Who is the greatest?
At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked him, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Then Jesus called a child to him and put him in the midst of them.
And he said, "I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.
Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this little child will be greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
"And whoever accepts a child like this in my name is accepting me." - Warning Against Scandals
"But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea!"
Woe unto the world for these stumbling blocks which must come, but woe to those who cause them!
Therefore, if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away from you! It is better to enter eternal life missing a hand or a foot than to have two and be thrown into the eternal fire.
"If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and cast it from you! It is better to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hellfire." - The Lost Sheep
And Jesus said, "Beware that you do not despise one of these little ones; for I tell you, their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father who is in heaven."
For the Son of Man has come to save the lost.
And what do you say about a man who has a hundred sheep, and one of them has strayed; doesn't he leave the ninety-nine on the mountain and go to find the one that has strayed?
I tell you the truth, when he finds it, he will be happier for that one lost sheep than for the ninety-nine that did not go astray.
Even your Father in heaven does not want one of these simple disciples to perish. Be at peace with your brother.
If your brother sins against you, go and talk to him alone. If he listens to you, you have won your brother.
But if he does not listen to you, take one or two others with you, so that the matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses. #Two or three witnesses. 16:18 See Deuteronomy 19:15.
If they refuse to listen to them, tell the church. If the church refuses to listen, then you must treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
I tell you the truth, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
I tell you the truth, whatever two of you agree on the earth, my Father in heaven will do for you.
"For where two or three are gathered in my name, I am there among them." - Boundless Forgiveness
Then Peter came to Jesus and said to him, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?"
Then Jesus said to him, "Not seven times only, but seventy-seven times!" #Seventy-seven ... times. 22:18 ... endlessly.
Therefore, the Kingdom of Heaven can be likened to a king who decided to settle accounts with his servants.
As he began settling his accounts, a man who owed him a very large sum was brought to him. Literally: "Ten thousand weight or quintal, which is equivalent to about 300,000 kilograms of the coins used at that time."
Since he had nothing to pay off the debt, the gentleman decided to sell himself, his wife, his children, and all that he owned, and use the proceeds to pay off the debt.
Then the servant prostrated himself on his knees before the king, and pleaded with him, saying, "Have mercy on me, and I will repay you all the debt."
So the lord had pity on him, canceled his debt in full, and let him go.
And as he was going, he found one of his slave companions, who owed him a small sum. He seized him by the neck and began to strangle him, saying, "Pay off your debt to me."
The servant prostrated himself before him on his knees, and pleaded with him, saying, "Have mercy on me, and I will pay what I owe."
But he refused, and instead took him and threw him in prison until he paid off his debt.
And when the other slaves saw what had happened, they were very sad, and went to tell their master everything that had occurred.
So his master called him and said, "You wicked slave, because you begged me, I will forgive you all that you owe me."
Shouldn't you have shown mercy to your companion the slave as I have shown mercy to you?
And his master was very angry, and handed him over to be punished until he had paid back all that he owed.
That is how your Heavenly Father will also treat you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.
Unity in marriage
And after Jesus had finished speaking about these things, he left the region of Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
And a great multitude followed him, and he healed them there.
And some Pharisees came to Jesus, trying to tempt him, and asked, "Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for any cause?"
Jesus answered, "Didn't you read in the book, 'God created mankind in his image, male and female created he them'? #Male and female 4:19 From the book of Genesis 1:27, 5:2."
Then he said: "For this reason a man leaves his father and his mother, and is united to his wife, becoming one flesh." (Gen 2:24)
And thus they are no longer two, but one. No one should separate what God has joined together.
They said to him, "Why, if Moses commanded that a wife be given a divorce certificate, #divorce certificate. 7:19 See Deuteronomy 24:1. then she should be released?"
Then Jesus answered them, "Moses allowed this because of your hard hearts, but from the beginning it was not so."
Therefore I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, and marries another commits adultery."
Then his disciples said to him, "If this is the case between a husband and a wife, it is better not to marry!"
Then Jesus said to them, "Not everyone can accept this teaching, but only those whom God gives the ability to do so."
There are men who cannot marry because they were born without the ability to marry. There are men who cannot marry because people have taken away their ability to marry. And there are men who chose not to marry for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept this teaching, let him accept it." Jesus welcomed the children.
Then they brought children to him, that he might lay his hands on them and pray; but the disciples rebuked them.
Then Jesus said, "Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
Then Jesus laid His hands on them and departed from that place. Obstacle of wealth
And a man came to Jesus and asked him, "Teacher, what good work should I do to gain eternal life?"
Jesus answered him, "Why do you ask me about what is good? Do you not know that only God is good? But if you want to have eternal life, you must keep the commandments."
Then the man said, "Which commandments?" And Jesus answered, "Do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal."
Do not bear false witness, honor your father and your mother. **Do not kill... your mother.** (Exodus 20:12-16, Deuteronomy 5:16-20) Love your neighbor as yourself. **Love... yourself.** (Luke 10:25-37, Leviticus 19:18)
Then the young man said to him, "I obey all these commandments, so what else do I lack?"
Then Jesus said to him, "If you would be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor. And you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."
When the young man heard this, he went away sorrowfully, for he was very rich.
At that time Jesus said to his disciples, "I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven.
I tell you again, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When his disciples heard this, they were astonished and said, "Who then can be saved?"
Then Jesus looked at them and said, "With men it is impossible, but not with God; for with God all things are possible."
Then Peter said to him, "Lo, we have left all and followed thee! What shall we have?"
Then Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne in the new age, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
And whoever leaves home, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or fields for My sake, will receive a hundredfold, and will inherit eternal life with God."
Many will be the first to become the last, and many will be the last to become the first.
Like the workers of the vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a man who is a land owner, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
He agreed to pay the workers one dinar for each day, and then sent them to work in his vineyard.
The host left around 9 o'clock and saw some men standing in the market area doing nothing.
Then he said to them, "Go also into my vineyard and I will give you your wages."
They went to work in the vineyard. "He left again around noon, and also at three o'clock, and hired other workers.
Around five o'clock, he went out again, and found others standing in the market area, and asked them: "Why have you stood here all day without doing anything?"
And they said unto him, "No one has hired us." He said to them, "Go you also into my vineyard."
And at the end of the day, the generous host said to his manager: "Call the workers and pay them their wages, starting with those who came last and ending with those who came first."
Then those who had rented the room arrived at 5 o'clock, and each of them took a denarius.
Then those who had been hired first came, thinking they would receive more, and each of them also received a denarius.
So they took it, and began to complain about the generous host.
They say, "Those who were hired last, worked only an hour, and yet they were paid as much as we, even though we worked all day in the scorching sun!"
Then the host said to one of them: "I haven't wronged you, my friend! Didn't we agree to work for one dinar?"
Take your pay and go. For I wish to give the hired man his pay at the end of the day, the same as I gave you.
Is it not my right to do what I want with what I have? Or are you jealous because I am kind to others?
Thus it comes to pass that the first shall be last, and the last shall be first." Jesus prophesies his death and resurrection.
And as Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem, he took the twelve aside and said to them:
Behold, we are going to Jerusalem, where the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and teachers of the law, and they will condemn him to death.
They will deliver him to unbelievers to mock, scourge, and crucify him. But on the third day he will rise from the dead." The greatest is he who serves.
Then his mother, the mother of my sons Zebadiah, came with her sons, and she bowed down to him, asking for something from him.
Then Jesus said to her, "What do you want?" And she said to him, "Promise me that my two sons will sit in your kingdom, one at your right hand and the other at your left."
Then Jesus said, "You do not know what you ask. Can you drink the cup that I am about to drink?" 22:20 The cup of suffering and anguish, as in v. 23. "Which cup?" they asked. "I am willing to drink it," they replied.
Then he said to them, "As for my cup, you shall drink from it; and as for sitting at my right hand or my left, I am unable to grant it to anyone but those for whom the Father has prepared it."
When the remaining ten heard this request, they became very angry with the brothers.
At that time Jesus called them and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles rule over their people with authority, and their high priests exercise power over them.
But among you it ought not to be so; but whoever would be great among you must be your servant.
And whoever wishes to be first among you, let him be your servant.
"Even so, the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." - Jesus heals the blind.
And as they were leaving the city of Jericho, a great multitude followed him.
And there were two blind men sitting by the road. And when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, saying, "Master, Son of David, have mercy on us."
The people rebuked them and commanded them to be silent, but they raised their voices even more: "Lord, son of David, have mercy on us."
Jesus stopped and called them, and said, "What do you want me to do for you?"
Then they said, "O Lord, open our eyes."
Jesus was moved with compassion, and touched their eyes; and immediately they could see, and followed him.
The king lives.
As they approached the city of Jerusalem, they came to the village of Betfage, near the Mount of Olives, and Jesus sent two of his disciples ahead,
And he said unto them, "Go into the village before you. And you will find a young donkey with its mother tied up; loose them, and bring them to me."
And if anyone says to either of you, "Something is needed," say to them, "The Lord needs them and will return them soon."
This happened so that what the Prophet said would come to pass.
Tell the beloved city of Zion: #Beloved Zion. 5:21 Literally, "Daughter Zion." Behold, your king is coming to you, humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey prepared for service.
And the two disciples went and did as Jesus commanded.
Then they brought the colt and its mother, and laid their clothes on them; and Jesus sat on them.
And most people spread their rugs on the road. But others cut branches from trees and spread them on the road.
The crowds of people walking before and behind him cried out, 'Long live the king! #Long live the king. 9:21 Literally: 'Hosanna.' In Hebrew, it means 'save now,' but here it is likely a cry of praise to God and his Messiah, the king. It is repeated in verse 15. 'Long live the son of David. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. The king lives forever.'
And when Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was moved. And the people said, "Who is this man?"
And the crowd that followed him said, "This is the prophet Jesus, from the town of Nazareth, from the region of Galilee." Jesus in the temple
Then Jesus entered the temple area and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of the pigeon sellers.
And he said unto them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer'; #My house ... prayer. 13:21 From the book of Isaiah 56:7. But you have turned it into a 'den of thieves'! #Den of thieves. 13:21 From the book of Jeremiah 7:11."
And some blind and lame came to him in the temple court, and he healed them.
And the chief priests and scribes saw the wonders which he did, and the children in the temple crying out, saying, 'Hosanna to the King! Blessed is the Son of David!' And they were very angry, and said unto him, 'Hearest thou not what these children say?'
Then Jesus answered, "Yes, but have you not read in the Scriptures: 'From the lips of infants and infants you have ordered praise'?"
Then Jesus left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and spent the night there. The power of faith.
And as Jesus was going into the city early in the morning, he was hungry.
And he saw a fig tree by the way, and went to it, but found nothing on it but leaves, and said to it, 'No more fruit for you henceforth.' And immediately the fig tree withered.
When the disciples saw this, they marveled, and asked him, "How did the fig tree wither like this?"
Then he said to them, "I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only be able to do what I did to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Move from here and cast yourself into the sea,' it will obey you."
And whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive." - Doubt the Authority of Jesus
And Jesus went into the temple area, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him, and they said, "Tell us, by what authority do you do these things, and who gave you this authority?"
Then Jesus answered them, "I will also ask you a question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
"Where did John's baptism come from? From God or from people?" They began to discuss it among themselves, saying, "If we say it was from God, he will ask, 'Why didn't you believe him?'"
And if we say that she is of the people, we fear the people, for they all consider John a prophet.
Therefore they answered Jesus, saying, "We do not know." And Jesus said to them, "Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things." Like the sons.
And Jesus said, "What do you think about this parable? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go today and work in my vineyard.'"
Then the son said, "I don't want to go." But he changed his mind and went.
Then the father went to his other son and asked him the same thing. The son answered, "Yes, sir, I will go," but he did not go.
"Which of the two sons did what the father wanted?" They said, "The first." He said to them, "I tell you the truth, tax collectors and prostitutes will enter the kingdom of God before you."
For John the Baptist came to show you the way of righteousness, but you did not believe him; yet the tax collectors and harlots believed him. Even when you saw what he did, you did not repent and believe in him, like the son of the vineyard keeper.
And listen to another parable: There was a man who had a piece of land, and he planted a vineyard, and surrounded it with a fence, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower for guard. Then he leased it to some farmers and went away.
And when the time for harvesting grapes came, he sent his servants to the farmers to get his share of the grapes.
But the farmers seized their slaves, beat one of them, killed another, and stoned another.
So the owner sent even more slaves than before. And the farmers treated them the same way.
Finally, he sent his son, and said to himself, 'They will respect my son.'
But when the farmers saw that this was the owner's son, they consulted among themselves and said, "This is the heir; let's kill him so that we can seize his inheritance."
They captured him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
"So what do you think the generous landowner will do to those farmers when he returns?"
And they said to him, "He will destroy them in a terrible manner because they are evil, and then he will give his goodness to other farmers who will give him the fruit in the season of fruit."
And Jesus said to them, "Have you not read the Scripture: 'The stone which the builders rejected, That stone has become the chief corner stone'? The Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes."
Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a nation that produces fruit worthy of the kingdom.
For whoever falls on this stone will be broken, and whoever the stone falls on will be crushed!"
And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard these words, they knew that he spake of them.
So they tried to arrest him, but they were afraid of the people who considered Jesus a prophet.
Like a wedding feast
And Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying:
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son.
And the king sent his servants to call those invited to the wedding feast, but they did not want to come.
So the king sent out other servants and said to them, "Tell those invited, 'The feast is ready. The oxen and the fatted calves are slaughtered, and all things are now in order. Come to the wedding feast.'"
But the invited ones paid no attention, and each went his own way. One went to work in his field, and another to his business.
As for the rest, they seized the king's slaves, beat them, and killed them.
Then the king became angry and sent his army, who killed those murderers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants, "The wedding feast is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy of it."
Therefore go into the streets and invite every one you meet to the wedding feast.
They then went out into the streets and gathered everyone they found, wicked or righteous, until the banquet hall was filled with guests.
When King Lear entered to see the guests, he saw a man there who was not dressed for the wedding.
Then the king said to him, "My friend, how did you come here without wedding clothes?" But the man remained silent.
Then the king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet, and throw him out into the darkness, where the wailing and grinding of teeth will be."
"For many call, but few choose." The Pharisees were trying to trap Jesus.
Then the Pharisees went away and conspired together how they might entrap Jesus in his words.
Then they sent their disciples to him, along with some from the party of Herod, saying, "Teacher, we know that you are truthful and teach the way of God with integrity, and you show no partiality, but teach the way of God according to truth.
"So tell us your opinion, is it permissible to pay taxes to the emperor or not?"
But Jesus knew their evil intent, and said to them, "Hypocrites, why are you trying to catch me?"
Show me the coin that you use." So they brought him a denarius.
Then he said to them, "For whom is this inscription and this name engraved on the coin?"
They said to him, "These are for the Caesar." He said to them, "If they give Caesar what is Caesar's, and give God what is God's."
When they heard this answer, they were very astonished, and left him and went their way. The Sadducees were trying to trap Jesus.
And on that day, some Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, came to him and asked him:
"Teacher, Moses said: 'If a man dies without leaving any sons, his brother shall marry his widow and raise up seed to his brother' (Deuteronomy 25:5-6). See also verse 24:22."
We had seven brothers. The first got married and died, leaving no children. So his brother married his widow.
And it happened to the brother, the second, the third, and even the seventh.
And after they were all dead, the woman also died.
Of the seven, who will be the wife on the Day of Judgment? They all married her."
Jesus answered them, "You are in error, because you do not know the Scriptures, nor the power of God.
They understood that in the eternal life after the resurrection, people do not marry nor do they give their daughters in marriage, but they are like the angels in heaven.
As for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what God said?
"I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." #I am... Jacob. 32:22 From the Book of Exodus 3:6. "God is not the God of the dead, but of the living."
When the people heard this, they were amazed at his teaching. Greatest commandment
And when the Pharisees heard that Jesus had answered the Sadducees and silenced them, they gathered together.
And a legal expert, trying to trap him, asked:
"O teacher, what is the greatest commandment in the law?"
Then Jesus said to him, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind." #Love the Lord ... your mind. Deut 6:5 (37:22)
This is the first and greatest commandment.
The second commandment is like the first: "Love your neighbor as yourself." #LoveYourNeighbor 39:22 Referring to the Gospel of Luke 10:25-37, we understand that the neighbor refers to every human being in need of help. Just as you love yourself. #LoveYourself 39:22 From the Book of Leviticus 19:18.
"The whole law and the books of the prophets refer to these two commandments." - Christ, Lord of David.
And while the Pharisees were gathered around him, Jesus asked them:
What do you think about Christ? Son of who is he? The Pharisees answered, "He is the Son of David."
Then he said to them, "How did David call him 'Lord' when he said, while in the spirit,
The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool under your feet."
"If David calls Christ Lord, how can his son be?"
No one could answer him, and no one dared ask him any more questions after that.
Jesus criticizes religious leaders.
Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples.
He said, "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees have left Moses behind in the interpretation of the law."
So guard and put into practice all that they tell you, but do not act according to their works. For they say, but do not do what they say.
They burden people with heavy tasks, but they themselves do not want to make any effort to follow them.
All the good works they do, they do to be seen by men. They show their piety, increasing the weight of their fetters. #Their fetters. 5:23 Some Jews would write specific passages from the Bible and put them in small leather bags, then tie them with cloth bands to their forehead or left arm, showing their extreme piety. They also lengthened the fringes of their garments.
They love to sit on the best seats at banquets, and on the front rows at gatherings.
They love it when people greet them with special greetings in the markets, and call them: "Master."
"But you, do not let people call you 'Teacher,' for you have only one Teacher, and you are all brothers."
And do not call anyone on earth 'Father,' for you have one Father in heaven.
Do not let people call you 'Master,' for you have one Master, and he is Christ.
The greatest among you must be a servant to you all.
Whosoever exalts himself, God will bring him low, and whosoever humbles himself, God will exalt him.
Woe unto you, hypocrites, and teachers of the law! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces, neither entering yourselves, nor allowing those who would enter to go in.
Woe unto you, hypocrites, both Pharisees and teachers of the law! For ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither enter yourselves, nor suffer them that would enter to go in. Ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.
Woe unto you, hypocrites, and teachers of the law! For you travel across land and sea to gain one convert, and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a child of hell as you are yourselves.
Woe unto you, blind guides, who say, 'If one swears by the temple, it is no obligation to keep his oath, but if one swears by the gold in the temple, he is bound to keep his oath!'
Oh, blind fools! Which is greater: the gold in the temple, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?
And you say: "If he swears by the altar, his oath is not binding; but if he swears by that which is on the altar, he is bound by his oath!"
Oh blind man! Which is greater: the offering on the altar, or the altar that makes the offering holy?
Because if anyone swears by the altar, they are swearing by it and by everything on it.
And if anyone swears by the temple, he swears by it and by him who dwells therein.
And if anyone swears by the sky, he swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it.
Woe unto you, hypocritical Pharisees and teachers of the law! For you tithe every herb, even the mint and the dill, #dill but you neglect justice, mercy, and faithfulness. You ought to have done these things, and not left the rest untouched.
O blind guides, you lift the gnat from your cup, but swallow the camel!
Woe unto you, hypocrites, both Pharisees and teachers of the law! For ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the plate, but within ye are full of extortion and wickedness.
Blind Pharisees, wash the inside of the cup first, so that the outside may also be clean.
Woe unto you, hypocrites, and teachers of the law! For you are like whitewashed tombs. They appear beautiful on the outside, but inside they are full of bones and all kinds of filth.
So you also, outwardly you show yourselves righteous, but within you are full of hypocrisy and evil.
Woe unto you, hypocrites, both Pharisees and teachers of the law! For ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous.
And you say: "If we had lived in our ancestors' times, we wouldn't have participated in killing the prophets."
And thus you affirm that you are the generation that killed the prophets.
So complete what your ancestors began.
O you snakes and children of vipers! How can you escape the judgment of Hell?
Therefore I tell you, you will send prophets and wise men and teachers to you. But some of them you will kill, and crucify, and beat in your synagogues; and you will persecute them from city to city.
Therefore, you will be held accountable for the blood of every innocent person killed on earth: from the blood of Abel the innocent to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, #Abel ... Zechariah. 35:23 The first and last of those killed according to time and text in the books of the Old Testament. (See Genesis 4:8, and 2 Chronicles 24:20) Who was killed between the temple and the altar.
I tell you the truth, the punishment for all these sins will fall on this generation. Jesus warns the people of Jerusalem.
O Jerusalem, O Jerusalem, you who slay the prophets and stone the messengers of God! How often have I longed to gather your children together, like a hen gathers her chicks under her wings! But you have refused.
Behold, your house will be left to you empty and forsaken!
For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord." #Blessed ... the Lord. 39:23 From Psalm 118:26.
Jesus prophesies the destruction of the temple.
And Jesus left the temple. And as he was walking, his disciples came to him, desiring to see the temple buildings.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do you see all these buildings? Truly I tell you, not one stone will be left on another; all will be thrown down!"
While Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came to him in private and asked, "Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of your coming and the end of the age?"
Jesus answered them, "Beware, so that you are not deceived."
Many will come and use my name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and they will deceive many.
You will hear of wars and revolutions, but do not be afraid. These things must happen, but they will not be the end of the world."
For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes and famines,
But all of this will be the first pains of childbirth.
They will deliver you to suffering, and they will kill some of you; and all the nations will hate you for my name's sake.
At that time, many will abandon faith, one will betray another to the authorities, and some will hate each other.
False prophets will appear, deceiving many.
And because of the increase in evil, the love of many believers will grow cold.
But he who remains faithful to the end will be saved.
And the gospel of the Kingdom of God will be proclaimed throughout the world as a witness to non-Jews, and then comes the end.
When you see "the abominable destruction" #the abominable destruction. 15:24 Look at Daniel 9:27, 12:11, as well as Matthew 11:31. The one that the prophet Daniel referred to, standing in the holy place - so that the reader may understand this statement -
Let all who are in the region of Judea flee to the mountains at that time.
No one descends from the roof to take their belongings from the house.
The worker in the field does not return to his home to take his cloak.
How difficult the conditions of pregnant women and nursing mothers in those days!
But pray that your flight not be in winter or on a Sabbath day.
Because there will be a great tribulation such as has not been since the beginning of the world, and as will not be again.
If God had not decided to shorten those days, no one would have remained alive. But for His chosen people, God will shorten those days.
If anyone says to you, "Behold, Christ is here," or "Behold, he is there," do not believe it.
For many false christs and prophets will appear, and they will perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, the chosen ones of God.
I told you everything before it happened.
Someone might say, "Behold, Christ is in the wilderness," and you do not go there. Or he might say, "Behold, he is in a room," and you do not believe him.
For as the lightning comes from the east and shines to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.
Wherever you find the body, you will also find the vultures.
Immediately after the distress in those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light. The stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will be shaken.
At that time, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. And the tribes of the earth will mourn, for they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
And He will send forth His angels with the trumpet's blast, gathering together His chosen ones from the four corners of the earth, from the farthest east to the farthest west.
Learn from the fig tree. For when its branches become tender and its leaves sprout, you know that summer is near.
Also, when you see all these things, you will know that the time is near. #Time 33:24 Compare with Luke 21:31. The time is at hand.
I tell you the truth, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.
The sky and the earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. Only the Father knows.
But no one knows the day or the hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
"As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be when the Son of Man comes."
In the days before the flood, people ate and drank and married and gave their daughters in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark.
They did not know what would happen until the flood came and took them. So it will be also with the coming of the Son of Man.
At that time, two men are working in a field; one is taken and the other is left.
Two women grind grain on a stone quern, one is taken and the other left.
So be alert, for you do not know when your Lord will come.
Make sure that if the homeowner knew any hour of the night the thief intended to come, he would have woken up and not allowed him to break into his home.
Therefore be ye also ready: for the Son of man cometh in an hour when ye think not. The good servant and the wicked servant.
Who then is the faithful and wise servant whom the Lord has appointed over his household to give them their portion of food at the proper time?
Well done to that servant who, when his master comes, finds him doing his duty.
I tell you the truth, he will dispose of all his possessions.
The evil servant thinks to himself, "My lord is late."
He begins by beating his fellow servants, and starts eating and drinking with the drunkards.
Then comes the master of that servant on a day that he does not expect, and at an hour that he does not know.
He will punish him and place him with the hypocrites, where people weep and gnash their teeth.
Like the ten girls
Then the kingdom of heaven is like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them are stupid, and five are smart.
The foolish women took their lamps, but they did not take any extra oil with them.
The intelligent ones took extra oil in their lamps.
The bridegroom was late, so all the girls dozed off and fell asleep.
But in the middle of the night, someone cried out: "The groom is coming, so let's go meet him."
Then the girls woke up and prepared their lanterns.
The foolish said to the wise: "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are nearly out."
Then the wise women answered, "We cannot, for it is not enough for us. But go to the merchants and buy oil for yourselves."
And while they were going to buy oil, the bridegroom arrived. The wise women were ready, so they went in with him to the wedding feast. Then he closed the door.
Finally, the rest of the girls came and said, "Sir, sir, open the door for us."
But he said, "I tell you the truth, I don't know you!"
Therefore be ye ready, for ye know not the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh. As in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.
"Similarly, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man traveling to a far country. He called his servants and entrusted them with all his property."
So he gave one of them five bags, #five bags. 15:25 Literally, «weights or measures» (a weight is roughly 27 to 36 kilograms of gold, silver, or copper). From the money, he gave two bags to the second, and one bag to the third. He gave to each according to his ability. Then he left immediately.
He who took the five bags immediately invested them in trade, and gained five more bags.
And he who took the two bags did so as before, and gained two more bags.
But he who took one bag went and dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master's money there.
After a long time, the master of these slaves returned and began to account for them.
Then he who had taken the five bags took five more, and said, "My lord, you have given me five bags, and I have earned five more."
Then his master said to him, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You were faithful with a few things, so I will put you in charge of much more. Enter and share in your master's joy."
Then he who had taken the two bags came and said, "My lord, you gave me two bags, and here are two other bags that I have earned."
Then his master said to him, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You were faithful with a few things, so I will put you in charge of much more. Enter and share in your master's joy."
Then came one and took one bag, and said, "Master, I know that you are a hard man, for you reap where you did not sow, and gather where you did not scatter."
I was afraid of you, so I went and hid your bag in the ground. Take your money.
His master answered him, "You wicked and lazy slave. Since you know that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter,
Why didn't you deposit my money in the bank, and when I returned, I would take my money with interest?
So take the bag from him and give it to the owner of the ten bags.
For to him that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away.
But that unprofitable servant cast him out, into the outer darkness, where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. The Son of Man is the Judge.
And when the Son of Man comes in his glory with all his angels, he will sit on his glorious throne.
Then all nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
He will place the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right: "Come, you who are blessed by my Father. Take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world."
Because I was hungry, you fed me. Because I was thirsty, you gave me drink. Because I was a stranger, you welcomed me.
You clothed me when I was naked. You cared for me when I was sick. You visited me when I was in prison.
Righteous ones will answer: "Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink?"
And when we saw you as a stranger, we sheltered you, or when you were naked, we clothed you?
And whenever we saw you sick or in prison, we visited you.
And the king will say, "I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me."
Then the King will say to those standing on his left: "Depart from me, you cursed, to the eternal fire prepared for Satan and his angels."
Because I was hungry, you did not feed me. Because I was thirsty, you did not give me a drink.
I was a stranger and you did not welcome me. I was naked and you did not clothe me. I was sick and in prison and you did not visit me.
Evils will answer: "Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not give to you what you need?"
And the king will say, 'I tell you the truth, whenever you neglected to do it for one of my weak brothers, you neglected it for me.'
Thus the wicked go to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.
Jewish leaders are planning to kill Jesus.
After Jesus had finished speaking, he said to his disciples:
You know that Easter is after tomorrow, and the Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of his enemies to be crucified.
And the chief priests and the elders of the people were gathered in the palace of the high priest Caiaphas.
And they planned to arrest Jesus by deceit and kill him.
And they said, "We should not do this during the festival, to avoid riots among the people." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
While Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the Leper,
A woman came to him, with a precious perfume in a marble bottle, and she poured it over his head while he was eating.
And when his disciples saw this, they were indignant and said, "Why this waste?"
This perfume could have been sold for a large sum of money that could be given to the poor.
Jesus, knowing what they were saying, said to them, "Why are you disturbing this woman? She has done a good deed for me."
The poor will always be with you, #the poor... always. 11:26 See Deuteronomy 15:11. But I will not always be with you.
I poured perfume on my body to prepare it for burial.
I tell you the truth: wherever this good news is proclaimed in the world, what this woman has done will also be told, so that everyone may remember it." Judas Iscariot betrays Jesus.
Then one of the twelve, named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,
And he said unto them, "What will ye give me, if I deliver Jesus unto you?" And they weighed out for him thirty pieces of silver.
And from that moment, Judas began to seek an opportunity to betray Jesus to them. At the Passover table.
And on the first day of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to him and said, "Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal for you?"
Then Jesus said to them, "Go to that man in the village, and say to him, 'The Teacher says, My time is near; I will celebrate the Passover with my disciples in your house.'"
The disciples did as Jesus had told them and prepared the Passover meal.
And when evening came, Jesus was sitting at the table with his twelve disciples.
While they were eating, he said to them, "I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me."
And they were grieved, and began to ask him one by one, "Is it I, Lord?"
Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand with me in the dish, will betray me."
Man of man is fulfilling what is written about him, but woe to him who betrays the Son of man! It would have been better for him if he had not been born!"
Then Judas, who was betraying him, asked him, "Master, is it I?" And Jesus said to him, "You are."
While they were eating, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to the disciples, saying, "Take, eat; this is my body."
Then he took a cup of wine, gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, "Drink all of you from this.
Because this is my blood, the blood of the covenant, shed for many for the forgiveness of sins.
And I say unto you, I shall not drink of this wine until that day when I drink it new in my Father's kingdom.
After that, they sang some hymns and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus foretells Peter's denial
Then Jesus said to them, "This night you will all fall away and disown me. For it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'"
But after I am raised from the dead, I will go before you into Galilee."
Then Peter answered him, "Even if everyone else loses their faith in you, I cannot lose my faith in you."
Then Jesus said to him, "I tell you the truth, before the rooster crows tonight, you will deny me three times."
Then Peter said to him, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you!" And all the disciples said the same. Jesus prayed alone.
Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples, "Sit here while I go over there to pray."
And he took with him Peter and the sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and troubled.
Then he said to them, "My grief is very great, even to the point of killing me! Stay here and keep watch with me."
Jesus withdrew a little from them, and fell on his face to the ground, and began to pray: "Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; #the cup 39:26 of tribulation and suffering. Repeated in v. 42. But not as I will, but as thou wilt."
And he came to his disciples, and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, "Could you not watch with me for one hour?"
"Stay awake and pray so that you may not be tempted. Your spirit yearns for it, but your body is weak."
And he withdrew a second time to pray, and said, "O my father, if it be not possible for this cup to pass from me, but that I must drink it, then be it as you will."
Then he returned a second time and found them asleep, for sleep had weighed their eyes.
Then he left them and went a third time to pray, and he said the same words that he had said before.
Then he returned to his disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the time has come, and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners."
Get up, let's go. Here comes the man who betrayed me." Arresting Jesus
And while he yet spake, Judas, one of the twelve, came; and with him was a great multitude with swords and staves, sent from the chief priests and elders of the people.
And the traitor gave them a sign and said, "The one who approaches is the wanted man, so seize him."
Then he came up to Jesus and said, "Greetings, Teacher!" and kissed him.
Then Jesus said to him, "My friend, do what you came for." And immediately they came up and seized Jesus, and took him away.
Then one of those standing by Jesus reached for his sword, drew it, and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back in its place. For whoever lives by the sword will die by the sword."
Don't you realize that I can call upon the Father, and he will send me more than twelve legions of angels right now?
But if you do, how will you verify the books that declared these things would happen like this?"
And at that moment Jesus said to the crowds: "Have you come after me with swords and clubs, as one would come after a criminal? Every day I sat in the temple court teaching, and you did not arrest me!"
"But this happened so that what the prophets wrote would be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left him and fled! Jesus before the Jewish leaders
Then they took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders were assembled.
Peter followed from afar, and entered the courtyard of the high priest's house. He went in and sat with the guards, to see what would happen in the end.
And the chief priests, and all the council of the Jews, sought false testimony against Jesus, that they might put him to death.
But they did not find, although many false witnesses came forward and said lies about him. Finally, two men came forward.
And they said, "This man is #This man. 61:26 That is, Jesus, for his enemies would not even utter his name! He said, 'I can destroy God's temple and rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up and said, "Will you not answer and defend yourself against all the charges these men are bringing against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. Then the high priest said to him, "I put you under oath by the living God: tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."
Then Jesus answered him, "I am he whom you have spoken of. And I will tell you: from now on, you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of God's throne, coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest, tearing his clothes, said, "You have blasphemed; what further need do we have of witnesses? You have heard the blasphemy; what is there left to say?"
"Then how do you judge?" They answered, "He deserves to die."
They then spat in his face, punched him, and slapped him.
And they said to him, "Tell us, Christ, who is it that struck you?" Peter denied Jesus.
Meanwhile, Peter was sitting in the courtyard outside. A servant of the high priest came to him and said, "You were also with Jesus of Galilee."
But Peter denied it before them all, saying, "I don't understand what you're saying!"
Then he went out to the gate of the square, and another servant said to those who were there: "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
Peter denied it again, and swore, saying, "I do not know this man."
And after a little while, those standing there came to him and said, "You are indeed one of them; your accent reveals that you are a Galilean."
Then he began to curse, #curse. 74:26 He swore by the curse that he was telling the truth! He swore and said, "I do not know this man." And immediately the rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered the words that Jesus had said to him: "Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times." And he went out and wept bitterly.
Jesus before the governor Pilate
And on the following morning, the chief priests and the elders of the people came together, and they consulted how to kill Jesus.
They seized him, brought him before Pilate the governor, and delivered him. Judas, who betrayed him, took his own life.
When Judas, who had betrayed Jesus, saw that they had decided to condemn Jesus to death, he repented of what he had done. So he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
And he said to them, "You have delivered an innocent man to be killed." And they said to him, "What has that to do with us? Manage it yourself."
Then Judas threw down the pieces of money in the temple and left. He went and hanged himself.
Then the chief priests took the pieces of money, and said, It is not lawful to put this money into the treasury, for it is the price of blood.
They decided to buy the potter's field with it to be a graveyard for strangers.
And for this reason, the field is still known as "the Blood Field" to this day.
And thus was fulfilled what God spoke through the prophet Jeremiah: "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price for which the children of Israel had agreed to sell me."
"They bought the field with the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me." - Zechariah 11:12-13, Jeremiah 32:6-9. Jesus before Pilate
And Jesus stood before the governor, and he asked him, "Art thou the king of the Jews?" And Jesus said, "It is as you say."
And when the high priests and elders accused him, he said nothing.
Then Pilate asked him, "Do you not hear all the many charges they bring against you?"
But Jesus gave no answer to the accusations made against him. Pilate was amazed at his silence. Pilate failed to release Jesus.
And it was the custom of the governor, on Easter, to release a prisoner chosen by the people.
And there was a notable prisoner, whose name was Barabbas. #Barabbas. 16:27 Or 'Jesus Barabbas' in some Greek manuscripts.
When the people had gathered, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release for you, Jesus the Christ, or Barabbas?"
Pilate knew that they had handed Jesus over to him out of envy.
While Pilate sat on his judgment seat, his wife sent him a message saying, "Don't do anything wrong to this innocent man, for I have had a dream about him all night."
But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowd to ask for the release of Barabbas and the crucifixion of Jesus.
Then the governor said to them, "Which of the two do you want me to release for you?" And they said, "Barabbas."
Then Pilate asked them, "What shall I do with Jesus of Nazareth, who is called Christ?" And they all said, "Let him be crucified."
Then Pilate said to them, "Why? What crime has he committed?" But they cried out even more, "Let him be crucified!"
And when Pilate saw that his attempt was to no avail, and that a riot was beginning, he took some water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of the blood of this man; it is your responsibility."
Then all the people said, "His blood be on us and on our children."
Then Pilate released Barabbas to them and ordered the beating of Jesus, and he handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
Then the governor's soldiers led Jesus to the palace, and a battalion of guards gathered around him.
They stripped him of his clothes and dressed him in a red robe. #dressed him in … purple. 28:27 Purple, in mockery of him, for this is the color of the robe of kings.
They wove him a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and put a reed in his right hand, and kneeling before him in derision they cried, 'Long live the King of the Jews!'
Then they spat on him, took the stick from his hand, and began to hit him on the head.
Having mocked him, they stripped him of his clothes, put a purple robe on him, and led him out to be crucified. Jesus on the cross
When they had gone out, they found a man from the city of Cyrene named Simon, and they made him carry the cross.
And when they arrived at a place known as 'Gethsemane', which means 'Place of Skulls',
They gave Jesus wine mixed with gall for him to drink. When he tasted it, he refused to drink.
And when they had crucified Jesus, they divided his garments among them, casting lots for them.
Then they sat there guarding him.
And they set up over his head a sign that said, "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews," as his accusation.
He was crucified with two criminals, one on his right and one on his left.
And the Maronites cursed him, shaking their heads.
And they said, "If you are the Son of God, save yourself, and come down from the cross!"
And the chief priests and the teachers of the law and the elders also scoffed at him, saying:
He saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him!
He placed his trust in God, so let God save him now if He truly intends to. Didn't he say, 'I am the Son of God'?
Even the criminals crucified with him were mocking him with similar words. The death of Jesus.
From noon until 3 in the afternoon, darkness covered the whole earth.
Around the third hour, Jesus cried out loudly, saying, "Eli, Eli, why have you forsaken me?" #Eli ... forsaken me. 46:27 From Psalm 22:1. That is, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
When some of those standing there heard him, they said, "He is calling for Elijah!" #ينادي إيليا. 47:27 The word "Eliy" in Hebrew and "Elou" in Aramaic resembles the name "Elijah," a well-known prophet who lived around 850 BCE.
Then one of those standing there quickly took a sponge, dipped it in vinegar, put it on a long reed, and offered it to him to drink.
As for the rest, they said, "Let's wait and see if Elijah will come to save him!"
Then Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and breathed his last.
The veil of the temple rent in two #templeveil. 51:27 The veil that separated the Most Holy Place from the rest of the Jewish temple structure. The Most Holy Place represented the divine presence. From top to bottom, it split in half, and the earth shook, the rocks rent asunder,
And the graves opened, and many of the holy believers who had died arose.
And after Jesus had risen, the bodies of the saints came out of their graves, and entered into the holy city, and appeared unto many.
But the Roman officer, #Roman officer. 54:27 Literally, "a centurion." And the guards who were watching Jesus' body, when they saw the earthquake and the other events, were filled with great fear and said, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
And there were women looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee to serve him.
Some of them are Mary Magdalene, Mary, the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. #Sons of Zebedee. 56:27 James and John. Jesus was buried.
And when evening had come, a rich man named Joseph, from the city of Ramah, came to Jerusalem. He, too, was a disciple of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Pilate ordered that the body be given to him.
So Joseph took the body and wrapped it in clean linen cloth.
Then he placed him in his new grave which he had dug in the rock, and rolled a huge stone at the entrance to the tomb and left.
And Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting opposite the tomb. They were watching over Jesus' tomb.
And on the following day, after the Sabbath was ended, the chief priests and the Pharisees came to Pilate,
And they said to him, "Master, we remember that this deceiver said before he died, 'I will rise from the dead in three days.'"
So he commanded that the tomb be guarded until the third day, lest his disciples come and steal the body, and then say to the people, 'He has risen from the dead.' This would be even greater deception than the first."
Then Pilate said to them, "Take soldiers and go, and make sure of everything by your own investigation."
They went and sealed the tomb. And they put a guard, soldiers, over it.
The resurrection of Jesus
And after the sabbath, as the first day of the week began, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to the tomb.
And at that moment there was a great earthquake, for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came to the tomb, and rolled away the stone from the door, and sat upon it.
And his appearance was bright as lightning, and his clothes white as snow.
The guards feared him greatly and became like dead men.
And the angel said unto the women, "Fear not: for I know that ye seek Jesus that is crucified."
He is not here; he rose from the dead, as he said before. Come, and see the place where he was.
Then quickly go to his disciples and say to them, 'He has risen from the dead, and is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him. Behold, I have told you.'
Then the two women quickly left the tomb, their fear mingled with great joy, and ran to tell Jesus' disciples what had happened.
And suddenly Jesus met them, and said, "Peace." And they came to him, and held his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid; go, tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me." (Gospel of Mark)
And as the women went on their way, some of the guards went into the city, and told the chief priests all that had happened.
Then the chief priests and elders gathered together, and consulted among themselves, and they gave a great sum of money to the soldiers.
And they said unto them, "Proclaim among the people that the disciples of Jesus came by night, and stole away his body while ye slept."
"If this news reaches the governor, we will convince him, and keep you safe."
Then the soldiers took the money, and did as they were told. And thus the story spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus speaks to his disciples.
And the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
And when they saw him, they prostrated themselves before him, though some had doubts.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "Give me all authority in heaven and on earth."
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
And teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. Remember, I will always be with you, to the end of the age."
John the Baptist
This is the beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
As it is written in the book of the prophet Isaiah: "Behold, I send my messenger before your face. He shall prepare the way."
The voice of one crying out in the wilderness, saying, "Prepare the way for the Lord; make straight in his paths."
John the Baptist came into the wilderness to baptize, and he urged people to be baptized as a sign of their repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
And all the inhabitants of the villages of the region of Judah and Jerusalem came out to him, and he baptized them in the Jordan river after they confessed their sins.
His clothes were made of camel hair, he had a belt of leather around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
And he used to say, "A greater man than I will come after me, and I am not worthy to bow down and untie his shoelaces."
"I am the water, and you are the baptisms; he who is baptized in me, shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit." - Jesus' Baptism
And in those days, Jesus came from Nazareth, a town in Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
And when he came up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him.
And a voice came from heaven, saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." The Experience of Jesus
And Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, alone.
And he remained there forty days, facing the temptations of the devil. He was with the wild beasts, and angels served him. Jesus chose some of his disciples.
And after John was imprisoned, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God.
And he says, "The time is at hand, and the Kingdom of God is near; repent, and believe in this gospel."
And as he walked by the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake; for they were fishermen.
Then Jesus said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
They left their nets and followed him.
Then he walked a little and saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John in their boat, preparing the nets.
Then Jesus called them, and said unto them, Follow me; and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the servants, and followed him. Jesus cast out a demon.
Then they went to Capernaum, and on the Sabbath day Jesus entered the synagogue and began to teach.
They were amazed by his teaching, for he taught them as one with authority, not like the teachers of the law.
And there was in the congregation a man possessed of a foul spirit, who cried out,
"What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are, you are the Holy One of God."
Jesus rebuked him and said, "Be silent and get out of him!"
Then the unclean spirit seized him, and he began to convulse, and uttered a loud cry, and left him.
And all were amazed, and began to say to one another, "What is this new teaching? It commands unclean spirits with authority, and they obey it."
And the news of him spread quickly throughout all the region of Galilee. Jesus healed many.
Then they left the assembly and went with James and John to Simon Peter's and Andrew's house.
And Simon's mother-in-law lay sick with a fever. And they told Jesus of her.
He approached her, took her hand, and sat her down. The fever left her, and she began to serve them.
And that evening, as the sun set, they brought many patients to him, some possessed by evil spirits.
All the people of the city gathered at the door of the house.
Jesus healed many who were afflicted with various diseases, and cast out many demons. But Jesus did not allow the demons to speak, for they knew who He was. Preparation to proclaim the Gospel
And in the early morning, before the sun rose, Jesus went out alone and went to a deserted place to pray.
So Simon and those with him set out to look for him.
And when they found him, they said to him, "Everyone is looking for you!"
Then Jesus answered them, "Let us go into the neighboring villages also, that I may preach there also: for I came for this."
He went throughout the region of Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons. Jesus healed the leper.
And a leper came to Jesus, and knelt down before him, and said, "Lord, if you will, you can make me clean."
Jesus, moved with compassion, stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, "I do will it. Be made clean."
The leprosy left the man, and he was cleansed.
Then Jesus sternly warned him and sent him away.
And he said unto him, "Beware, tell no one what has befallen you, but go, present yourself to the priest; #go... to the priest. 44:1 The priest shall judge for you, according to the law, whether you are clean or unclean. And whatever the priest shall command you, that shall you observe, #that which the priest shall command you, as Moses commanded. 44:1 Behold, in the book of Leviticus 14:1-32 it is written. And the people shall know that you are healed."
