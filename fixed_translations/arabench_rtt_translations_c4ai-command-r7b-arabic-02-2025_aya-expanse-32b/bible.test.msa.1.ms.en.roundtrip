Who is the most important person in the kingdom?
environmental that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”
Jesus called a little child and had him stand among them.
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
"Whoever becomes humble like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven."
"Whoever welcomes a child like this in my name welcomes me."
"But what if one of these little ones who believe in me is led into sin? It would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and be drowned at the bottom of the sea."
"How terrible these things that lead people into sin will be for the world! Such things must come. But how terrible it will be for those who cause them!"
"If your hands or your feet are a source of sin, cut them off; it is better for you to enter eternal life maimed than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire."
If anyone wants to blind their eye to see, let them blind it and throw it away. It is better for them to enter the Kingdom of God with one eye, than to be thrown into hell with two eyes. The parable of the lost sheep
"See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you, their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father who is in heaven."
(No
What do you think? Imagine a man has a hundred sheep, and one goes astray. Won't he leave the ninety-nine on the mountain and go look for the lost one?
What I'm about to tell you is true. If he finds that one sheep, he will be happier about it than he is about the ninety-nine that did not wander off.
So it is with your Father in heaven. He does not want any of these little ones to be lost. When someone sins against you
"If your brother sins against you, go to him and tell him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother back."
"But what if he doesn't listen to you? Take one or two others along with you. The Scripture says, 'On the evidence of two or three witnesses a matter is to be confirmed' (Deuteronomy 19:15)."
But what if he refuses to listen to the witnesses? Then tell the church. And what if he refuses to listen to the church? Then treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
What I will tell you is true. What is shut on earth is shut in heaven. What is opened on earth is opened in heaven.
Again, I tell you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
"Wherever two or three are gathered in my name, I am among them." - The servant who showed no mercy.
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus said, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy times."
"The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants."
And the king began to do so, and a man was brought before him who owed him millions of dollars.
The man was unable to pay. So his master gave an order. The man, his wife, his children, and all that he had were to be sold to pay off his debt.
The servant knelt before him. "Give me time," he pleaded. "I'll pay everything."
The lady felt sorry for him. She forgave his debt and set him free.
But the servant went out and found one of the other servants who owed him a few dollars. He seized him and began to choke him, saying, 'Pay me what you owe!'
The other servant fell to his knees. 'Give me time,' he begged. 'I'll pay you back.'
But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and threw the man into prison until he could pay back what he owed.
The other servants saw what happened. It disturbed them greatly. They went and told their master everything that had occurred.
Then the lord called his first servant and said, "Wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me.
Shouldn't you have shown mercy to the other servant as you did to me?
His master handed him over to the jailers to be punished until he paid back all he owed.
"So will My Heavenly Father treat each one of you unless you forgive your brothers and sisters from your hearts."
Jesus teaches about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Large crowds followed him. He healed them there.
Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
So Jesus said to them, "Have you not read what was said to you by God: 'In the beginning God created male and female, and said, “For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two will become one”'?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh" (Genesis 2:24).
What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
They asked, "Why then did Moses command a man to write a bill of divorcement for his wife and send her away?"
Jesus answered, "It was because of your hardness of heart that Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.
This is what I tell you. Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery. A man is not permitted to divorce his wife unless she has been unfaithful to him.
The disciples said to him, "If such is the case between husband and wife, it is better not to marry."
Jesus answered, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining single. Only those who have been helped to live without marriage can accept it.
Some men cannot have children because they were born that way. Some were made that way by other people. Others have made themselves that way for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. And whoever can accept living that way, must do so." Little children came to Jesus.
Some people brought children to Jesus. They wanted him to place his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he departed from there. Jesus and the rich young man.
A man came to Jesus and asked, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?"
"Why do you ask me what is good?" Jesus answered. "There is only one who is good. If you wish to enter the kingdom, obey the commandments."
"Which one?" the man asked. Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness against anyone."
"Honor your father and your mother" (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) and "Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"I've obeyed all those orders," said the young man. "What should I do next?"
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."
When the young man heard that, he left sadly. He was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When the disciples heard this, they were astonished. And they asked, "Then who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "For mortals this is impossible, but for God all things are possible."
Peter answered and said to him, "We have left everything to follow you; what then will there be for us?"
"I am not able to say to you that it will be so," Jesus said. "In the time when everything is new, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. Then those who followed me will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
Everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.
But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.
The Story of the Workers in the Vineyard
"The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard."
He agreed to pay them the usual daily wage. Then he sent them to his vineyard.
He went out again around nine in the morning. He saw others standing in the town square doing nothing.
He said to them, "Go, you also, into my vineyard, and I will give you a fair wage."
So they went out. "They went out again around noon and at three o'clock and did the same thing.
He left around five and found others standing around her. He asked them, "Why were you standing here all day doing nothing?"
They answered, "Because no one has hired us." He said to them, "You also go into my vineyard and work."
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to the foreman, "Call the workers and give them their pay. Begin with the last ones hired, and then go to the first."
The hired workers arrived around five o'clock. Each received his usual day's wage.
Therefore, when those who were first hired came, they expected to get more. But each of them also received the regular daily wage.
When they received it, they started complaining about the owner.
"Those people who were recently hired only worked for one hour," they said. "They were paid the same amount as us. We did most of the work; we were under the scorching sun all day."
The owner replied to one of them, "My friend, I am being fair to you. Didn't you agree to work for the usual daily wage?"
Take your money and go. I want to give the last person I hired the same wage I gave you.
Can't I do what I want with my money? Do you feel cheated because I've been generous to others?
"So the last will be first, and the first last." Jesus speaks again about his impending death.
Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. On the way, he took the twelve disciples aside to speak to them.
"We are going up to Jerusalem," he said. "The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death..."
Then they will hand him over to the non-Jewish people to be mocked and flogged, and then crucified on a cross. On the third day he will rise from the dead! A mother pleads with Jesus.
The mother of Zebedes' sons came to Jesus. Her sons came with her. She knelt down and asked him for something.
"What do you want?" asked Jesus. She said, "Promise me that one of my sons will sit at your right hand in your kingdom, and promise me that the other will sit at your left."
Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I am about to drink?" They answered, "We can."
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The other ten pupils heard it. They were angry with the brothers.
Jesus called together his disciples and said to them, "You know that the rulers in the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise power over them.
Do not be like this. Rather, whoever wants to be important among you must be your servant.
"And whoever desires to be first among you, let him be your servant."
"Be like the Son of Man. He did not come to be served, but to serve others. He came to give his life as a ransom to set many free." Two blind men receive their sight.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, and a large crowd followed them.
There were two blind men sitting by the roadside. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"
The crowd ordered them to stop. They told them to be silent. But the two men cried out even louder, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stopped and called to them. "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.
"Our Lord," they answered, "we wish to be able to see."
Jesus felt deep concern for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately they could see. And they followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem.
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them,
He said to them, "Go into the village ahead of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt by her. Untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone says anything to you, say that the Lord needs them. The Master will send them immediately.
This happened so that what was spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled. He said,
"Say to the city of Zion, 'See, your king comes to you, humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.'" (Zechariah 9:9)
The disciples went and did what Jesus commanded them.
They brought a donkey and a colt, spread their cloaks on them, and Jesus sat on them.
A very large crowd of people spread out on the road, opening their coats. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
Some people went before him, and some followed him. And all of them shouted: "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Blessed is he who comes in the highest heavens!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, it stirred up the whole city. The people asked, "Who is this?"
So the crowd answered, "This is Jesus the Nazarene, the prophet." Jesus cleanses the temple.
Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written: 'My house shall be called a house of prayer.' (Isaiah 56:7) But you make it a 'den of thieves.' (Mark 7:11)"
The blind and the lame came to Jesus in the temple, and he healed them there.
The chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" In the temple courts they were indignant.
"Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," answered Jesus. "Have you never read, 'Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise'?" (Psalm 8:2)
Then Jesus went out from the crowd and departed to the town called Bethsaida. But when evening had come, His disciples went down to the sea, and entered a ship and were going to the other side of the sea, to Capernaum.
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the road. He climbed it, but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit!" And at once the fig tree withered.
When the students saw this, they were puzzled. "How did the olive tree wither so quickly?" they asked.
Then Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
"If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer." Questioning Jesus' authority.
Jesus entered the temple courts, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and asked, "By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered and said, "I also will ask you one question. If you tell Me, then I will tell you by whom I am."
"Where did John's baptism come from? Was it from heaven, or from men?" They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'"
But what if we say, "of men"? We are afraid of people. Everyone thought John was a prophet.
They said to him, "We do not know." Jesus said to them, "Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things." The Parable of the Two Sons
"What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work today in the vineyard.'"
"I won't do it," the son replied. But then he changed his mind and went.
Then the father went to the other son. He said the same thing to him. The son answered, "I will, father." But he did not go.
"Which of the two did the will of his father?" They said, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John came to show you the right way to live, but you did not believe him. However, the tax collectors and prostitutes believed him. You saw this, but even then you did not stop sinning and believe him. The parable of the tenants.
"Listen to another story. A man owned some land, so he planted vineyards. He built a wall around it. He dug a tank to press the wine. He also built a watchtower. He leased the vineyards to some farmers. Then he went on a journey."
When the time of harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants. He commanded the servants to gather his share of the fruits.
But the tenants seized his servants. They beat one of them. They killed another. They threw a stone at the third to kill him.
Then he sent other servants to the tenants. He sent more than he had sent the first time. The tenants treated them the same way.
Finally, he sent his son to them, saying, "They will respect my son."
But the tenants saw the son coming. They said to each other, "This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours."
So they took him and cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
"When the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to these tenants?"
"Those evil people will be destroyed," they answered. "Then the vineyard will be rented to others. They will give him his share of the crop at harvest time."
Jesus said to them, "Has it not been written in your Law, 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
"This is what I am telling you: The kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will bear its fruit.
Anyone who falls on that rock will be shattered into pieces. But the rock will crush anyone it falls on.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables. They knew he was speaking about them.
So they looked for a way to arrest him. But they feared the crowd. For the people held Jesus to be a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Story
Jesus told them more parables. He said:
"This is like the kingdom of heaven. A king prepared a wedding feast for his son.
Send a servant to those who were invited to dinner. So they told them to come. But they refused.
"But when the other servants came, he said, 'Tell those who are invited, "See, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet."'
But the people didn't care. One went to his field, and another to his business.
As for the rest, they seized his servants. They treated them badly and then killed them.
The king was furious. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed the murderers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants, "You have prepared the wedding feast, but those I invited were not worthy to come."
Go to the street corners. Invite anyone you find to dinner.
So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they found, both good and bad, and soon the wedding hall was filled with guests.
King entered to see the guests. He noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.
"My friend, how did you get in here without your wedding clothes?" The man had nothing to say.
Then he signaled to his servants, who bound him and threw him into the cloud, and they took him to a distant place. There people wept and bit their fingers.
Many are called, but few are chosen. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went out. They plotted together to trap Jesus in his words.
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. "Teacher," they said, "we know that you are a man of integrity. You teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Don't let others tell you what to do or say, no matter how important they are.
So tell us, what do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?
But Jesus knew their evil intentions. He said to them, "You hypocrites! What treacherous plots are you trying to lay against me?
Show me the currency that people use to pay taxes. They brought him a silver coin.
He asked them, "Whose picture is this? And whose words are these?"
"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's."
When they heard this, they were troubled. So they left, discussing among themselves. "Marriage when the dead rise."
On that day the Samaritans came to Jesus with a question. They did not believe that people rise from the dead.
"Teacher," they said, "Moses commanded us: 'If a man dies without having a son, his brother shall marry his wife, and they shall have a son who shall bear the name of the deceased brother.'"
There were seven brothers among us. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened to the second, third, and even the seventh brother.
Finally, the woman died.
Well, when the dead rise, who will be his wife? All seven were married to her.
Jesus answered them, "You are wrong, because you do not know the Scriptures, nor the power of God."
When the dead rise, they will not marry. Nor will their fathers give them in marriage. They will be like the angels in heaven.
What about the resurrection of the dead? Haven't you read what God has told you?
He said, "I am the Lord who appeared to Abraham in the light. I am the Lord who appeared to Isaac in the light. And I am the Lord who appeared to Jacob in the light" (Exodus 3:6). "He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living."
When the crowd heard this, they were astonished at his teaching. They said, "Could this be the Messiah?"
The Pharisees heard that the Samaritans had not been able to answer Jesus. So the Pharisees gathered together.
One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with a question.
"Teacher," he asked, "which is the most important commandment in the law?"
Jesus answered, "Blessed are those who love the Lord and love his mercy" (Deuteronomy 6:5).
This is the first and most important commandment.
The second is like it: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself" (Leviticus 19:18).
All that is written in the Torah and the Gospel concerning these two commandments. Who is the son of Christ?
The Pharisees gathered together. Jesus asked them,
"What do you think about Christ? Who is his father?" They said, "He is the Son of David."
He said to them, "Why then does David call him 'Lord'?" The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. David said,
"The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool'" (Psalm 110:1)
If David calls him "my Lord," how can his son be?
No one could answer him in a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him any questions.
Jesus condemns the Pharisees and the teachers of the law.
Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples.
"The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat," he said.
"Therefore, you must obey them. Do everything they command you. But do not do as they do. For they do not practice what they preach."
They put heavy burdens on others' shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a single finger to move them.
All that they do is done to be seen by others. And on their foreheads and arms they put small boxes bearing verses from the Bible. They make the boxes very wide. And they make the threads hanging from their coats very long.
They love to sit in the place of honor at banquets. They also love to be in the most important seats in temples.
They love to be welcomed in the markets. They love to be called "my lord."
"But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers."
Do not call anyone on earth your father; for One is your Father, He who is in heaven.
No one should be called your teacher. You have one teacher, and he is Christ.
The most important person to you is your servant.
He who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.
"How terrible it will be for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. And you yourselves do not enter, and you do not allow those who are trying to enter to go in."
(No
"How terrible it is for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win one person to your faith, and then you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are.
"How terrible it will be for you blind guides! You say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing; but anyone who swears by the gold in the temple is bound by their oath.'
You are blind and stupid! Which is more important? Gold? Or is it the temple that makes the gold sacred?
You also say, 'Whatever is sworn by the altar is nothing. But whoever swears by the gift that is on it, he is obligated to perform.'
O blind ones! Which is more important? Is it the gift? Or the altar that makes the gift sacred?
"So everyone who swears on the altar swears on it and on everything on it.
Everyone who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it.
And whoever swears by the sky, swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it.
"How wretched you teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former.
Oh blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!
"How terrible it is for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed. You only want to satisfy yourselves."
"You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the plate, and then the outside also will be clean."
"How terrible it will be for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean.
This is the case with you. From the outside, you appear to be doing the right thing. But on the inside, you are full of wrong. You pretend to be what you are not.
"How terrible it will be for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.
And you say, "If we had been in the times of those who came before us, we would not have followed their path, nor would we have approved of what they did."
So you bear witness against yourselves, as you bear witness that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
So he completed what the former ones among you had done of sins!
"O nest of venomous snakes! How will you escape the punishment of Hell?"
That is why I am sending you prophets, wise men, and teachers. You will kill some of them. You will crucify some of them. You will flog some of them in your churches. You will drive them from town to town.
"Therefore you shall pay for the blood of the saints which has been shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar."
What I'm going to tell you is true. All this will happen to those who are alive now.
"Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I have wanted to gather your children as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!"
Look, you've left your house empty.
I say to you, you will not see me until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.' (Psalm 118:26)
Signs of the End Times
Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came to him. They pointed out the temple buildings to him.
"Do you see all these things?" asked Jesus. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. Then the disciples came to him privately and said, "Tell us, when will this happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end?"
Jesus answered, "Watch out! Beware of being deceived."
Many will come in my name, saying, "I am the Christ!" They will deceive many.
You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. You will also hear people talking about wars in the future. Do not be alarmed. These things must happen, but the end is not yet.
There will be wars between nations. There will be wars between kingdoms. People will suffer from hunger. Earthquakes will occur in many places.
All these are the beginning of the birth pangs.
"Then they will deliver you to be beaten and killed, and they will dismember you and cut off your ears. All this is because they did not believe in Allah and the Messenger. And what We have revealed to you from the Book, testify to it with the witnesses of Allah. Indeed, Allah is Seeing of what you do."
At that time, many will turn away from their faith. They will hate each other. They will hand each other over to their enemies.
Many false prophets will arise. They will deceive many people.
Because lawlessness will increase, the love of most people will grow cold.
But he who endures to the end will be saved.
This good news of the kingdom will be preached throughout the world, to all nations, and then the end will come.
The prophet Daniel spoke of the "abomination that desolates" (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11) which you will one day see standing in the holy place. The reader must understand this.
Then those in Galilee will go to the mountains.
No one on the roof is allowed to go down to their home to fetch anything.
No one in the field should go back to get their coat.
How terrible those days will be for pregnant women! How terrible they will be for nursing mothers!
Pray you don't have to flee in winter or on Saturday.
There will be terrible suffering in those days. It will be worse than anything else since the beginning of the world until now. And there will never be anything like it again.
If time were not shortened, no one would live, but for the people of God, it will be shortened so they may live.
At that time people will say to you, "Look, here is the Christ!" or "There he is!" Do not believe them.
False Christs and prophets will arise. They will perform great signs and wonders. They will seek to deceive the chosen people of God, if possible.
See, I told you before.
If anyone tells you, "It's in the distant wilderness," do not go there. Or if they say, "It's in the depths of the house," do not believe them.
The lightning comes from the east and is seen in the west. So will it be when the Son of Man comes.
Gulls will gather wherever there is a corpse.
"And after the terrible suffering of those days, 'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light. The stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will be shaken.' (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)"
"At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory.
He sends His angels with a loud trumpet call, gathering His chosen ones from every direction, from the four corners of the earth. He gathers them from one end of the sky to the other.
Learn from the fig tree. Once its branches become tender and its leaves sprout, you know that summer is near.
Similarly, when you see all those things happening, you know that the end is near. It's at the door.
Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.
"The heaven and the earth will perish, but Allah will remain. Say, 'Indeed, my Lord expands the provision for whom He wills of His servants and restricts it [as well]. And whatever you spend of anything, He will replace it. And He is the Best of Providers. And if you burn a town, it will not be that you remain behind [its destruction], except for a little while.'"
No one knows that day or hour. Not even the angels in heaven know. The Son doesn't know. Only the Father knows.
"Remember how it was in the days of Noah. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking. They were marrying. They were giving their daughters in marriage. They were doing all those things until the day Noah entered the ark.
They did not know what would happen until the flood came and took them all. So will it be when the Son of Man comes.
There will be two men in the field. One will take and the other will leave.
Two women will grind using a hand mill. One will be taken and the other left.
"Take care of yourself. You never know where or when your Lord will come for you."
You must understand one thing. Imagine that the homeowner knows at what time of night the thief comes. Then he would keep watch. He wouldn't leave his house unlocked.
For you also must be ready; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
Let's suppose that a master put one of his servants in charge of the other servants in his house. The servant's job is to give them their food at the proper time. The master wants a faithful and wise servant for this.
It will be good for the servant if the master finds the servant doing his work when the master returns.
What I am going to tell you is true. The master will put this slave in charge of everything he owns.
But what if this servant is wicked? What if he says to himself, "My master is delayed."
Suppose he started beating other servants. And suppose he eats and drinks with those who drink a lot.
The master of that slave will come on a day when the slave does not expect him. He will come at an hour the slave does not know.
Then his master will cut him to pieces and send him to the place where the hypocrites are sent. The people there will weep and wail.
The Story of the Ten Virgins
"This is like the kingdom of heaven in those days. Eleven virgins took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were fools. And five were wise.
The fool took his lamps, but he did not take olive oil.
The wise took the oil in their vessels with their lamps.
The groom didn't come for a long time. So all the bridesmaids fell asleep from exhaustion.
At midnight someone shouted: "The bridegroom! Come and meet him!"
Then all the virgins woke up and prepared their lamps.
The fool said to the wise man, "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out."
" 'No,' they answered, 'there may not be enough for all of us. Instead, go to those who sell oil. Buy some for yourselves."
So they went to buy oil. But while they were on their way, the bridegroom arrived. And the bride's maids who were ready with him entered the wedding feast. Then the door was shut.
Then the other girls also came. 'Sir! Sir!' they said. 'Open the door for us!'
But he answered, "What I am about to tell you is true. I do not know you."
"So be watchful. You do not know when your Lord will come. The story of three servants."
And again, Jesus told them another parable about the kingdom of heaven. "There was a man who was going on a journey. He called his servants and entrusted his property to them."
He gave $10,000 to one. He gave $4,000 to another. He gave $2,000 to the third. The man gave each servant an amount of money he knew the servant could handle. Then he set out on his journey.
The servant who received $10,000 immediately went and started using his money, and made another $10,000.
He who earned $4000 earned another $4000.
But the man who received $2000 went and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money in it.
After a long time, the master of these servants returned. He wanted to collect all the money they had earned.
The man who had received $10,000 brought the other amount of $10,000. He said, "Sir, you trusted me with $10,000. Look, I have made another $10,000."
And his lord said to him, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your lord!"
The man who had $4000 came. He said, "Sir, you trusted me with $4000. Look, I have made another $4000."
And his lord said to him, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your lord!"
Then came the man who had received two thousand pieces of silver, and said, "Master, I know that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter seed."
That's why I was afraid. I went out and hid $2000 for you in the ground. Look, this is yours.
And his master said to him, 'You wicked and lazy servant! Did you know that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter seed?
Alright, you should've deposited my money in the bank. When I returned, I would've collected it with interest.
Then his master said to the other servants, 'Take the 2000 dollars from him and give it to the one who has 20,000 dollars.
"Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. What about the one who has nothing? Even what they have will be taken from them."
Throw this worthless servant out. There in the dark, people will weep and gnash their teeth.
The Son of Man will come in his glory and in his full power. All the angels will be with him. Then he will sit on his throne of glory in the sky.
All the nations will be gathered before him. He will separate the people into two groups, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
He will set the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right, "Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world."
I was hungry. You gave me something to eat. I was thirsty. You gave me something to drink. I was a stranger. You invited me in.
I needed clothes. You gave them to me. I was sick. You nursed me. I was in prison. You came to visit me.
"Then those of them who had believed will come and say, 'O Moses, was it this that you brought us to doom with, and your people, and you did not doom them? You saved us! We have wronged ourselves in no way. Then will you afflict us with torment? You were the one sent.'"
When did we see you a stranger and take you in? When did we see you naked and clothe you?
When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?
The king will answer and say to them, “Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did it to one of the least of these brothers of Mine, you did it to Me.”
"Then he will say to those on his right hand, 'O you who are blessed, enter into Paradise, for you have been prepared for it.'"
I was hungry. But you gave me nothing to eat. I was thirsty. But you gave me nothing to drink.
I was a stranger. But you did not invite me in. I needed clothes. But you did not give me any. I was sick and in prison. But you did not visit me.
And they will answer: "Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or clothed in rags, or sick or in prison, and not serve you?"
He will say, "Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me."
"Then those who disbelieve in Allah will be driven from behind them to the Fire, and it will be said to
Plan to kill Jesus
Jesus finished saying all these things. Then he said to his disciples,
As you know, in two days it's Easter. The Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, Caiaphas.
They made plans to arrest Jesus cleverly. They wanted to kill him.
"But not during the celebration," they said. "It might stir up the people." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in the house of Simon the Leper at Bethany.
A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume. She poured it on his head as he was reclining at the table.
When the disciples saw this, they were indignant. They said, "Why this waste?"
The perfume could have been sold at a high price. The money could have been given to the poor.
Jesus knew this. He said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a good thing for me."
You will always have the poor with you. But you will not always have me with you.
She poured perfume over my body to prepare me for burial.
What I am about to tell you is true. What I have done will be told everywhere this good news is preached in the whole world. It will be told in memory of him." Judas agrees to hand over Jesus.
One of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests.
He asked, "What will you give me, and I will deliver Jesus to you?" They paid him thirty pieces of silver.
From that time on, Judas watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. The Last Supper
That day was the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal for you?"
So he told him, "Go to such and such a person's house in the city, and say to him, 'The teacher says, 'My time is near. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.'
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover.
When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples.
As he ate, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."
The disciples were very sorrowful. And each one began to say to him, "It is not I, Lord, is it?"
Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand in the dish with me, he will betray me."
"The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. Woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born."
It was Judas who was about to betray him. He asked, "Surely not me, Teacher?" Jesus replied, "Yes, it is you."
While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is my body."
Then he took the cup, gave thanks, and offered it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you."
This is my blood of the new covenant, poured out for the forgiveness of many.
This is what I'm telling you. From now on, I won't drink wine with you again until the day I drink it with you in my father's kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said that Peter would deny him.
Jesus said to them, "This very night, if you believe in me, you will find me. For it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered,' but after I return, I will gather my sheep into the fold, and there will be one flock, one shepherd." (Zechariah 13:7)
"But after I am raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."
Then Peter answered and said, "Even if all may fall away because of You, I will never fall away."
"I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "this very night, before the cock crows, you will disown me three times."
But Peter said, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never say that I don't know you." All the other disciples said the same thing. Jesus' prayer in Gethsemane
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there to pray."
He took Peter and the sons of Zebedee along with him. And he began to be sorrowful and very troubled.
Then he said to them, "My heart is overwhelmed with sorrow. I feel like I'm about to die. Stay here and keep watch with me."
He went a little farther. Then, falling to the ground, he prayed, "Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned to his disciples, and found them sleeping. "Could you not watch with me one hour?" he asked Peter.
"Be careful of prayer and prayer. Then you will not fall into sin when it tempts you. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
Then Jesus went away again, and prayed, saying, "O Father, if this cup may be taken away from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will."
Then he returned. He found them sleeping again. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
So he left them and went away. For the third time he prayed the same prayer.
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you sleeping and resting? Look at the green field and the sheep. Until the Son of Man receives from the sinners what is prepared for him."
Rise up! Let us go! Here is the one who will betray me to them! Jesus is arrested.
While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. He was accompanied by a large mob armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Judas, who was to betray Jesus, agreed with them and said, "As soon as I kiss him, arrest him."
So Judas went to Jesus immediately and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you have come to do." Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' companions seized his sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
"Put your sword in its place," Jesus said to him. "For all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you think I can't ask my father for help? He'll send an army of over 70,000 angels right away.
But how, then, do prophecies come true? They say that this must happen in this way.
At that time, Jesus spoke to the crowd. He said, "Do you think I am leading a band of robbers against you? Do you come with swords and clubs to capture me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you did not arrest me."
"But all this has happened that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all his disciples left him and fled. Jesus was taken to the Sanhedrin.
Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.
Not far away, Peter followed Jesus. He went into the courtyard of the high priest and sat down with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the whole council were looking for evidence against Jesus to put him to death.
But they found no evidence, although many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two other witnesses presented themselves.
They said, "This man said, 'I can destroy the temple of God, and I can rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up and asked Jesus, "Have you no answer? What is it that these men are testifying against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."
"Yes," Jesus answered, "it is as you say. But I tell you all, in the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the priest stepped back from above. He said, "He has spoken much evil against God! Why do we need more witnesses than this? You have heard him say this evil."
"What do you think?" they answered, "He must die!"
Then they licked his face. One of them hit him with his fist. Others slapped him.
They said, "O Jesus, who struck you?" Peter said, "I do not know Jesus."
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A servant girl came to him. "I also was with Jesus of Galilee," she said.
But before them all, Peter said it wasn't so. He said, "I do not know what you are talking about."
Then he went out to the gate that leads to the garden. Another woman saw him from another gate and said to the people, "This one was with Jesus of Nazareth."
And again he said it was not so. With an oath he said, "I do not know the man!"
A little later, those who stood by came up to Peter. "You must be one of them," they said. "Your way of speaking gives you away."
Then Peter began to curse and swear, "I do not know the man!" And immediately a rooster crowed.
Then he remembered what Jesus had said to him, "Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.
Judas hangs himself.
It was early morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to put Jesus to death.
They bound him and led him away. Then they handed him over to Pontius Pilate.
Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned to death, and was filled with remorse and deep sorrow for what he had done. He returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
"I made a mistake," he said. "I released an innocent man." "So what?" they replied. "That's your problem."
So Judas threw the money into the temple and went away. Then he went and hanged himself.
The temple priests picked up the coins. They said, "Putting this money in the temple treasury is a crime. It is blood money. It was paid for the death of a man."
Therefore, they decided to use the money to buy a cemetery plot. People coming from other countries will be buried there.
That is why it is still called the Field of Blood to this day.
Then the words of Jeremiah the prophet came to him, saying, "They have taken the two thirty shekels. That is the price of a man, who was valued by them."
"So they weighed out thirty pieces of silver to them. And the Lord said to me, 'Throw it to the potter'—the handsome price at which
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "Yes, as you say."
But when the high priest and the elders asked him, he did not answer.
Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear what they are testifying against you?"
But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge. The governor was quite amazed.
It was the governor's custom at Easter to release one prisoner, whom the people should choose.
At that time, they had a famous prisoner named Barabbas.
So when their governor had gathered them together, he said to them, "Which one do you want me to release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Pilate realized that the leaders were envious. He realized that was why they handed Jesus over to him.
While Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message. The message said, "Have nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus put to death.
"Which of these two do I want to release?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered.
"What shall I do then with Jesus who is called Christ?" asked Pilate. They all answered, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What has he done?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere with them. Indeed, the crowd began to become unruly. So he took water and washed his hands before them, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood. You are responsible for it!"
Everyone answered: "We and our children will bear the responsibility for his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas. But he had Jesus flogged, and then handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
The governor's soldiers took Jesus to the palace, which was called the Praetorium. And all the other soldiers gathered around him.
They removed his clothes and put a purple robe on him.
Then they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt in front of him and mocked him. "Hail, king of the Jews!" they said.
They cursed him. Someone hit him on the head repeatedly with a stick.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him and put his clothes on him. Then they led him to be crucified. Jesus was crucified.
And as they led him away, they seized one Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, and laid the cross on him, to carry it behind Jesus.
They came to a place called Golgotha. Golgotha means "place of the skull."
There they mixed wine with various bitter spices and offered it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it.
When they crucified him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots.
They sat there guarding him.
They placed a sign over his head that read: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
Two thieves were crucified with him, one on his right and the other on his left.
Those who passed by shouted insults at Jesus and mocked him. They shook their heads.
He said, "Are you planning to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days? Save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"
Likewise, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders mocked him.
"He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him."
He trusts in God. Let God save him now if He wants to. It is he who said, "I am the Son of God."
Likewise, the thieves who were crucified with Jesus also mocked him. The death of Jesus.
From noon until three, darkness covered the whole earth.
At about the ninth hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of those who stood there heard Jesus cry out. They said, "He is calling Elijah."
So one of them took a sponge, filled it with vinegar, put it on a reed, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
The others said, "Leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah will come to save him."
After Jesus cried out loudly again, he died.
At that moment, the curtain of the temple was torn from top to bottom. The earth shook. The rocks split.
The graves were opened. Many of the saints who had died were brought back to life.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus had been raised from the dead, he ascended to the holy city. There he appeared to many.
When the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were terrified and said, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
It was not far away, there were many women watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to provide for his needs.
Mary Magdalene was among them. Mary the mother of James and Joseph was there as well. So was the mother of the sons of Zebedee. Jesus was buried.
As evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came. He had become a follower of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
He placed her in his new tomb that he had hewn out of the rock. He rolled a large stone in front of the entrance to the tomb. Then he went away.
Mary Magdalene and the other woman sat opposite the tomb. The guards at the tomb.
The next day, which was the day after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
"My lord," they said, "we remember something that the liar said while he was still alive. He claimed, 'In three days I will rise again.'"
So give orders for the tomb to be made secure until the third day, otherwise his disciples may come and steal the body, and then tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first.
"Take some guards with you," Pilate answered. "Go. Make the tomb as secure as you can."
So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting guards.
Jesus ascends to heaven.
Saturday was over. Dawn had broken on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other woman went to check the tomb.
There was a powerful earthquake. An angel from the Lord descended from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. The stone was rolled back and the angel sat on it.
His body shone like lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards trembled with fear before him until they became like the dead.
The angel said to the woman, "Do not be afraid, I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.
Not here! He has risen, just as he said he would! Come and see the place where he was lying.
Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' That is my message for you.
The women fled from the tomb. They were afraid, but also filled with joy. They ran to tell the disciples.
Then Jesus came and said to them, "Peace be with you." They came up to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me." The soldiers returned to the chief priests.
As the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
When the chief priests met with the elders, they devised a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
They told the soldiers, "We want you to say, 'His disciples came at night. They stole his body while we were sleeping.'"
If the governor hears this report, we'll make him pay. This will keep you out of trouble.
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus' last commands to his disciples.
Then the eleventh Christian disciple went to Galilee. And they went to the mountain, as Jesus had commanded them.
When they saw him, they prostrated before him, but some of them had doubts.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
Teach them to obey you in everything you command them. And be assured that I will always be with you until the end.
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
The prophet Isaiah wrote long ago: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way" (Malachi 3:1).
"A voice cries out: 'In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.' (Isaiah 40:3)"
And so John came. He baptized people in the desert. He also preached that people should repent and turn away from their sins, and then God would forgive them.
All the people of the countryside of Judea and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. They all confessed their sins, and he baptized them in the Jordan River.
John wore clothes made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
This is what John was preaching: "After me comes one who is mightier than I, so strong that I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals."
"I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." The Baptism and Testing of Jesus
At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
Jesus came up out of the water. At that moment, he saw the heavens opened and the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him.
A voice from heaven spoke to him: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."
So Jesus, filled with the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness.
He stayed in the wilderness for forty days. There, the devil tempted him. Wild animals did not harm Jesus. Angels took care of him. Jesus chooses the first disciples.
After John was imprisoned, Jesus went to Galilee. He preached the gospel of God.
"The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God is near. Repent of your sins and believe in the good news!"
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting their net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
"Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will make you fishers of men."
So they left their nets at once and followed him.
Then Jesus went a little further with them, and saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John, who were also in the boat mending their nets.
So he cried out to them immediately. And they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after Jesus. And Jesus cast out a demon.
Jesus and his companions went to Capernaum. And when the Sabbath came, he entered the synagogue and began to teach.
The people were amazed at his teaching. He taught them as one who had authority, not as the scribes.
Then a man who was possessed by an evil spirit cried out from the tower, saying,
"What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!"
"Be silent!" Jesus said sternly. "Come out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Then it came out of him with a scream.
So the people were amazed at him. They said, "Then what is it that you have brought [as evidence]? And are you not, when [in reality] you are not turning away, merely ord
The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout all the region of Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left the temple and went to the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed with a fever. They told Jesus about her.
So he went to her, took her hand, and helped her stand up. He removed her fever, and she began to serve them.
That evening, after sunset, they brought to Jesus all who were sick and those possessed by demons.
All the people in the city gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many of them. They were suffering from all kinds of diseases. He also cast out many demons. But he would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prayed in a solitary place.
It was very early in the morning, and it was still dark. Jesus got up, left the house, and went to a place where he could be alone. There he prayed.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they shouted, "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus answered, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages. I must preach there also. That is why I have come."
So he traveled throughout all of Galilee. And he preached in their synagogues, and also cast out demons. Jesus healed a man with a skin disease.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus. He knelt down and begged him, saying, "If you choose to make me clean, you can."
Jesus filled his heart with sorrow. He reached out and touched the man. He said, "I am willing. Be 'clean'!"
The disease left him immediately. He recovered.
Jesus sent him away immediately. And He sternly warned the man.
"Do not tell this to anyone," he said. "Go and show yourself to the priest. Offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded. That will be a testimony to the priest and the people that you are 'clean'."
But the man went out and began to proclaim it freely, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town. He would stay in unpopulated areas, but people would come to him from everywhere.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk.
A few days later, Jesus again entered Capernaum, and the people heard that he had come home.
The people gathered so much that there was no room left. There was not even space outside the door. Jesus preached the word to them.
Four of the arrivals were carrying a man who couldn't walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, lowering the man on a mat, they set him in front of Jesus.
Jesus saw their faith. He said to the man, "Child, your sins are forgiven."
Some law professors were sitting there. They were thinking.
Why is this man talking like this? He's saying something very evil! Only God forgives sins!
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say to this man, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Rise, take up your mat and walk"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus spoke to the man who couldn't walk.
"I tell you," he said, "get up. Take your Quran and go home."
The man rose and took his mat. Then he walked away, while everyone watched. They were all amazed. They praised God and said, "We have never seen anything like this before!" Jesus chooses Levi.
Jesus went out again beside the Sea of Galilee. A large crowd came to him. He began to teach them.
And as he journeyed, behold, a man named Zacchaeus, who was rich, and a chief tax collector, and he was seeking to see who Jesus was; but he could
Then Jesus entered the house of Levi and sat down to eat with him and his disciples. There were many tax collectors and "sinners" eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed Jesus.

Some Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They were watching him closely. They wanted to see whether he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus spoke to the man who had a withered and paralyzed hand. He said to him, "Stand up before everyone."
Then Jesus said to them, "What does the law say we should do on the Sabbath? Make it a day for good deeds or for evil? To save life or to destroy it?" But they remained silent.
