So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David. And there were fourteen generations from David until the carrying away into Babylon. And there were fourteen generations from the carrying away into Babylon until Christ. The birth of Jesus Christ
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband, Joseph, was a righteous man. He did not want to shame her publicly. So, he decided to divorce her quietly.
But while he was thinking about this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
You will bear a son. You must name him Jesus. This is because he will save his people from their sins.
All this happened so that what the Lord had said would come true. He had said through the prophet,
"The virgin shall conceive and bear a son. She will give birth to a male child, and they will call his name Immanuel," (Isaiah 7:14) which means "God with us."
Joseph woke up. He did as the angel of the Lord commanded him. He took Mary into his home as his wife.
But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And he gave the name Jesus to the child.
The Visit of the Wise Men to Jesus
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This happened while Herod was king of Judea. After the birth of Jesus, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem.
They asked, "Where is the child who has been born to be the king of the Jews? When we were in the east, we saw his star. Now we have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was greatly disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
So Herod summoned the chief priests and the scribes of the people, and asked them where the Christ was to be born.
"In Bethlehem in Judah," they answered. "This is what the prophet wrote:
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times." (Micah 5:2)
Then Herod secretly called the wise men and learned from them the exact time the star had appeared.
Send them to Bethlehem. He said, "Go! Search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, bring me a report. Then I too can go and worship him."
After the wise men had listened to the king, they set out on their way. And the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, they were filled with joy.
The wise men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They knelt down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures. They gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their country by another road. The flight of Jesus' family into Egypt.
When the wise men had departed, Joseph had a dream. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him. "Get up!" the angel said. "Take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you to return, for Herod will go to search for the child to kill him."
Joseph awoke. During the night, he fled to Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.
And they remained there until Herod the king died. Thus were fulfilled the words of the Lord spoken by the prophet, saying, "Out of Egypt have I called my son" (Jeremiah 11:1).
Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him. He became furious and issued orders regarding Bethlehem and its surroundings. All boys under the age of two were to be killed. This corresponded to the time when the wise men had seen the star.
In this way, the words of the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled. He said,
"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and great mourning. Rachel weeps for her children; she refuses to be comforted, because they are no more." (Jeremiah 31:15) The return of Jesus' family to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise! Take the child and his mother. Go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child's death are dead."
So Joseph rose and took the child and his mother, Mary, and brought them to Egypt.
But then he heard that Archelaus was king of Judea. Archelaus ruled in place of his father Herod. This made Joseph afraid to go there. After being warned in a dream, Joseph instead went to the land of Galilee.
There he lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets about Jesus, "He will be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Repent of your sins, for the kingdom of heaven is nearer than you think."
John is the person about whom the prophet Isaiah spoke. He said, "A voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes were made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the entire region of the Jordan.
When they confessed their sins, John baptized his followers in the Jordan River.
John saw many Pharisees and Samaritans coming to the place where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Bear fruit that shows you have turned away from your sins.
Do not think that you can say to yourselves, "We have Abraham as our father." I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.
The sickle is already lying at the roots of the trees. All trees that do not bear good fruit will be cut down. They will be thrown into the fire.
"I will baptize you with water for repentance, but those who come after me will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
He carries his censer in his hand to remove the chaff from the threshing floor. He will gather the wheat into the storage rooms, but he will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire. Jesus is baptized.
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. He wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to prevent him, saying to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you. Why do you come to me?"
Jesus answered, "Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness." Then John consented.
As soon as Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment the sky opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to him.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Jesus tempts
The Spirit of God led Jesus into the desert, where he was tempted by the devil.
After 40 days and 40 nights of fasting, Jesus was hungry.
The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'" (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Then Satan took Jesus to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple.
"If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down, for it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you, and on their hands they will bear you up, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.' (Psalm 91:11-12)"
Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test'" (Deuteronomy 6:16).
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
"If you worship and obey me," he said, "I will give you all this."
Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve'" (Deuteronomy 6:13).
Then the devil left Jesus, and angels came and attended to him. Jesus began to preach in the synagogues.
John was put in prison. When Jesus heard this, he withdrew to Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth. He went to live in the town of Capernaum, which was on the lake in the region of Zebulun and Naphthalim.
And so, the words of the prophet Isaiah were fulfilled. He said:
"Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where the Gentiles live! Land along the Mediterranean Sea! Region east of the Jordan River!"
The people who walk in darkness will see a great light. They live in a land of deep darkness, but a light will shine on them. (Isaiah 9:1,2)
From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, "Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus chooses the first disciples.
One day, Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee. He saw two brothers, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew, who were fishermen, casting their net into the lake.
"Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will make you fishers of men."
So they left their nets at once and followed him.
From there, he saw two other brothers, James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. And Jesus called them.
So they left the boat and their father and followed Jesus. Jesus healed the sick people.
Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom of God, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
The news about him spread throughout Syria. People brought to him all who were sick with various diseases. Some were suffering from severe pains. Others were possessed by demons. Some were convulsing violently. Others could not move at all. Jesus healed them all.
Large crowds followed him. Some people came from Galilee, and from the Decapolis, and from Jerusalem and Judea, and others from beyond the Jordan.
Jesus gives blessings.
Jesus saw the crowds, went up the mountain, and sat down. His disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them. He said:
"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled with the kingdom of heaven."
"Blessed are those who are watchful; they shall have their reward with their Lord, and neither fear nor grief shall befall them."
Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.
"Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy."
"Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy."
Blessed are the people of pure hearts. They will see God.
Blessed are those who make peace. They are in the mercy of God.
Blessed are those who suffer for the sake of righteousness. To them belongs the kingdom of heaven.
"Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they exclude you and revile you and spurn your name as the Christ's sake."
Rejoice and be glad. Your reward in heaven is great. Likewise, people harmed the prophets who lived long ago. Salt and light.
"You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot."
"You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a mountain cannot be hidden."
People don't light a lamp and put it under a bushel basket. Instead, they set it on its base. Then everyone in the house is illuminated.
"Similarly, let your light shine before others, so they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven. Jesus gives full meaning to the law.
"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
What I am about to tell you is true. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. Not one letter, not one stroke of a letter, will disappear from the law until everything is accomplished.
"Do not break any of the commandments, even the least of them. Do not teach others to break them. If you do, you will be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. Instead, practice these commandments and teach them. Then you will be called great in the kingdom of heaven."
"This is what I tell you: You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you are not, you will surely not enter the kingdom of heaven. Murder"
"I have heard what was said to the people who lived long ago. They were told, 'Do not kill. (Exodus 20:13) For whoever kills will be judged accordingly.'"
But this is what I tell you. Do not be angry with your brother. Whoever is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment. Again, whoever says to his brother, 'You fool!' will be liable to the Sanhedrin. But whoever says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of hellfire.
Imagine that you are presenting your gift at the altar. Remember that your brother has something against you.
Leave your gift before the altar and go first reconcile with your brother; then come and offer your gift.
Imagine that someone has a claim against you and takes you to court. Settle the matter quickly. Do so while you are still on good terms with him. If you don't, he may hand you over to the judge. The judge may hand you over to the officer. And you may be thrown into prison.
What I'm about to tell you is the truth. You won't get out until you pay the last penny! Bastards.
"You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit adultery.' (Exodus 20:14)
But I tell you, anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
"If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
"If something from the right side comes to you that you want to test it with, cut it off and cut off the root of the right side. Verily, the right side is one thing and the Hour is another. Verily, a man may be given a trial by his own hand and what he possesses, and he may do with it what he wills, then it will be a burden upon him. Divorce."
"It is written: 'If a man divorces his wife and she leaves his house, he must give her a written notice of divorce'" (Deuteronomy 24:1).
But that's what I'm telling you. Anyone who divorces his wife causes her to commit adultery, and anyone who marries a divorcee commits adultery. A man can only divorce his wife if she is unfaithful to him. I swear.
"And again, you have heard what was said to your peoples long ago: 'Do not deny the covenants you make with the Lord. Keep the promises you have made with him."
But what I'm telling you is: Don't say anything like that. Don't say anything like that for heaven's sake. It's God's throne.
Do not make it in the name of Earth. That is God's footstool. Do not make it in the name of Jerusalem. That is the city of the great King.
"And do not swear by your heads, for you cannot make even one hair white or black."
"Let 'yes' mean 'yes'. Let 'no' mean 'no'. Anything more comes from the devil. Be kind to others."
"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth' (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)"
But that's what I'm telling you. Don't fight an evil person. "If someone slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other cheek to him as well.
If someone takes you to court to get your shirt, let him have your coat as well.
Suppose someone forces you to walk one mile. Go two miles with him.
"Give to those who ask of you. Do not hate those who want to borrow something from you. Love your enemies."
"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'"
But this is what I tell you: Love your enemies. Pray for those who persecute you.
"Then you are the children of your Father who is in heaven. He causes the rain to fall on the earth for you and makes the earth bear fruit for you. And only those who repent remember."
"If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Even tax collectors do the same."
If you only greet your own people, what more are you doing than others? Even unbelievers do that.
"So do not be among those who dispute concerning what comes to you from your Lord."
Donate to the poor.
Beware of doing good deeds in front of others. Do not do them so that others may see you. Otherwise, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.
"When you give, do not announce it loudly, as the hypocrites do in their prayer, seeking to be praised by people. Do not forbid others from entering the mosques, as the disbelievers do. Allah knows best what you do. The hypocrites think they are deceiving
"When you give to the poor, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing."
Then your charity will be in secret. Your Father who sees in secret will reward you. He sees what you do in secret. Amen.
"When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, who love to be seen by people, praying in the synagogues and at the street corners, so that they may be praised by others. Truly, I tell you, they have already received their reward. But when you pray, go into
"When you arrive, go to your room. Close the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret."
"When you arrive, do not talk too much as wicked people do. They think they will be heard because they talk a lot."
Don't be like them. Your father knows what you need even before you ask him.
"This is how you should pray." 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who have wronged us.
Protect us from falling into sin when we are tempted. Protect us from the accursed Satan.
"Forgive people, O Muhammad, when they sin, for if you do that, your Father in heaven will forgive you."
But if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive you your trespasses. - Fasting
"When you fast, do not be like the hypocrites, who announce their fasting with false piety, but are not truly believing. They disobey Allah and His Messenger, and do not have faith. They are the
"But if they keep silent, anoint your heads with olive oil, wash your faces."
"Then no one will know that you are fasting except your Father who is in heaven. Your Father sees in secret; and He will reward you. But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, so that your fasting may not be seen by others but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you." "Spend from the wealth We have provided for you before death comes to any of you and he says, 'My Lord, if only You would give me a little more time, I would give in charity and be among the righteous.' But no one will be given more time when his time has come. Allah is well aware of what you do."
"Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal."
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
Your heart will be where your treasure is.
"The eye is like a lamp for the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light."
But suppose your eyes are weak. Then your whole body will be dark. If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. He will hate one and love the other. Or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not be anxious.
I tell you, do not worry. Do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink. Do not worry about your body, what you will wear. Is there not more to life than food? Are there not things more important for the body than clothes?
"Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?"
Can you add an hour to your life by worrying?
"And why do you worry about clothes? See how the wild flowers grow. They don't work or spin clothes."
But this is what I tell you. Not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of these.
"If God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?"
"So do not worry, saying, 'What will we eat?' or 'What will we drink?' or 'What will we wear?'"
People who don't believe chase after all those things. Your Father in heaven knows you need them.
"But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Be fair when judging others.
Do not judge others, and you will not be judged.
You will be judged as you judge others. You will be measured as you measure others.
You see a splinter of wood in your friend's eye, but you pay no attention to the beam in your own eye.
How do you tell your friend: "Let me take this piece of wood out of your eye"? How do you say this while there's a piece of wood in your own eye?
"You hypocrite! First, remove the plank from your own eye. Then you will be able to see clearly to remove the speck from your friend's eye."
"Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Ask, seek, knock."
"Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you."
To all who ask, it will be given. He who seeks will find. The door will be opened to him who knocks.
Imagine your son asks for bread. Who among you would give him a stone?
Or what if he asked for a fish? Which one of you would give him a snake?
Even if you are evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!
"In everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets, both the great and the small."
Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction and hell. Many enter through it.
But the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life. Few people find the way. A tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
You can tell what they really are by what they do. "Do people gather grapes from thorns? Do they pluck figs from thistles?"
In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree does not bear bad fruit, and a bad tree does not bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You can tell a tree by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?'
Then I will say to them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!' Wise builder and fools.
"Everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock."
The sky rains. The waters rise. The winds blow and strike that house. But it does not fall. It was built on the rock.
But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.
The sky rains. The water rises. The wind blows and strikes that house. And it falls with a loud noise.
When Jesus had finished saying all these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching.
He taught as one having authority, not as the scribes.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain. Large crowds followed him.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus, knelt down before him, and said, "Lord, if you choose to make me clean, you can do it."
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man, saying, "I want to do this. Be 'clean'!" Immediately the man was cleansed of his leprosy.
Then Jesus said to him, "Do not tell anyone. Go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." Faith of a Roman centurion
When Jesus came to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached him and pleaded for his help.
"Oh Lord," he said, "my servant is bedridden and cannot move. He is in great distress."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
The captain answered, "Sir, I am not worthy that you should come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
I myself am a man under authority, and I have soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, "Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with faith like this."
"I tell you, many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven."
But those who believe they are of my kingdom will be cast out into the darkness. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then Jesus said to the Roman soldiers, "Go! Let it be as you have believed." And his servant was healed at that very moment. Jesus healed many.
When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's wife's mother lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to serve him.
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
He did this to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah had spoken: "He took up our infirmities and carried our diseases" (Isaiah 53:4). Following Jesus has a cost.
Seeing the crowd, Jesus gave orders to cross to the other side of Lake Galilee.
Then a religious teacher came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
Another of his followers said to him, "Lord, first let me go and bury my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me. Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus got into a boat. His disciples followed him.
Suddenly, a terrible storm swept across the lake. The waves tossed the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
So the disciples woke him up, saying, "Master, save us! We are perishing!"
He answered, "You of little faith, why are you so afraid?" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm. The sea became like a lake.
The disciples were amazed. They asked, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!" Jesus heals two men possessed by demons.
Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake in the region of the Gerasenes. Two men possessed by demons met him. They were coming from the tombs. The two men were so violent that no one could pass by there.
"Son of God, what do you want with us?" they cried. "Have you come here to punish us before our time of judgment?"
Not far away, there was a large herd of pigs eating.
The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us to the pigs in the field."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" And the unclean spirits came out of the men and entered into the swine. And the herd ran violently down the steep place into the sea, about two thousand of them; and they were drowned in the sea.
Then the man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, "Return to your home, and declare how much God has done for you." So he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.
Then he went out from the city to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk.
Jesus got into a boat, and went across the lake to his town.
Some men came, carrying a paralyzed man on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
Then some of the people in the circle said, "This one is saying something very bad!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking and said, "Why are you thinking these evil thoughts?"
Should I say, "I have forgiven your sins"? Or should I say, "Rise and walk"?
I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he spoke to the man who couldn't walk. "Get up," he said. "Take your mat and go to your home."
The man woke up and went home.
When the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe. They praised God for giving such authority to men. Jesus chooses when.
From there Jesus saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's post. He said to him, "Follow me." And he got up and followed him.
Then Jesus entered the house of Matthew and sat down to eat a meal. And many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and His disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this and said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick."
Go and learn what this means, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice" (Isaiah 6:6) "I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance." They asked Jesus about fasting.
One day the disciples of John came and said to Jesus, "We and the Pharisees fast, so why do your disciples not fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast."
People do not sew a new piece of cloth onto old clothes. The new piece will tear away from the old one. The clothes will be torn even more.
"New wine is not poured into old wineskins. If it is, the skins will burst. The wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. No, new wine is poured into new wineskins. Then both are preserved." A dead girl and a suffering woman.
As Jesus was saying these things, a ruler came and bowed down before him. "My daughter has just died," he said. "But come and place your hand on her, and she will live."
Jesus rose and went with him. His disciples also went with him.
Suddenly, a woman came up behind Jesus. She had been suffering from a discharge of blood for twelve years. She touched the hem of his garment.
I thought: "I just need to touch his clothes. Then I'll get better."
Jesus turned and saw the woman. He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you." The woman was healed at that very moment.
When Jesus entered the ruler's house, he saw the flute players there. And he saw the noisy crowd.
He said, "Go. The girl is not dead. She is sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After the crowd had been led outside, Jesus entered. He took the girl by the hand, and she arose.
The news about what Jesus had done spread all over that region. Jesus heals two blind men.
And Jesus went from there, and two blind men followed him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus entered the house, a blind man came to him. He said to him, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" He answered, "Yes, Lord."
Then he touched their eyes and said, "Let your faith determine what happens to you."
They could see again. Jesus sternly warned them, "Make sure that no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They talked about it everywhere in that area.
As they were going out, another man who was demon-possessed was brought to Jesus. He was blind and could not speak.
When the demon was cast out, the man spoke. The crowd was amazed. They said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel before."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons." There were only a few workers.
Jesus went about all the cities and villages. He taught in their synagogues and proclaimed the good news of the kingdom of God. He healed every disease and every weakness.
When he saw the crowds, he felt deep compassion for them. They were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
"So ask the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest."
Jesus sends out the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
Here are the names of the twelve disciples. The first is Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then James the son of Zebedee and his brother John.
Then Philip, Bartholomew, John the Baptist, Thomas, Matthew the Tax Collector, and two others, James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus.
And others were Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas would later betray Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent out the twelve and instructed them, "Do not go to Gentile regions," he said. "Do not enter any Samaritan town."
But go to the house of Israel. They are like lost sheep.
"And when death approaches one of you, leave as inheritance to your heirs. If I intended to bring you near [to me] after my death, then indeed, Allah is the One who commands justice and kindness. And if I intended to bring you misery, then indeed, Allah is the One who has cursed the disbelievers."
Heal the sick. Raise the dead. Cleanse those who have leprosy. Drive out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.
Do not carry any gold, silver, or copper in your belts.
Don't take a bag for the trip. Don't take extra clothes or sandals or walking sticks. The worker should be given what he needs.
When you enter a city or village, look for someone willing to receive you. Stay in this person's home until you leave.
When you enter the house, greet those who live there.
If a house welcomes you, bless it with peace. If not, do not bless it.
"Some people may not welcome you or listen to your words. If they don't, shake the dust off your feet as you leave that house or town."
What I intend to tell you is true. The Day of Judgment will be easier for Suwāmah and ‘Amūrah than for that city.
"I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.
Beware! The men will bring you before the local courts. They will whip you in their temples.
They will be brought before you to account for and to rule over you because of me. You will testify against them and against those who are not Jews.
But when they arrest you, do not worry about what you will say or how you will say it. At that time, the right words to say will be given to you.
It won't be you who speaks. Your father's spirit will speak through you.
Brothers will hand over brothers to be killed. Fathers will deliver their sons. Sons will rise up against their fathers and kill them.
Everyone will hate you because of me. But whoever endures to the end will be saved.
"When people attack you in one place, flee to another. What I am telling you is true. You will not finish wandering through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
A student is not better than his teacher. A servant is not better than his master.
It is enough for the student to be like his teacher. And it is enough for the slave to be like his master. If the head of the house has been called Lazarus, what can the others who live there expect?
"So do not be afraid of your enemies. For everything that is hidden will be revealed, and everything that is covered will be made known.
What I tell you in the dark, speak in the light. What is whispered in your ear, shout from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Aren't two sparrows sold for a penny? But not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father knowing it.
He even counts every hair on your head!
So do not fear. You are worth more than many sparrows.
"What about someone who says in front of others that he knows me? I will also say in front of my Father in heaven that I know him."
But what about someone who says in front of others that he doesn't know me? I will say in front of my Father in heaven that I don't know him.
"Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
I have come to turn "sons against their fathers, and daughters against their mothers, and daughters-in-law against their mothers-in-law."
"A man's enemies are the members of his own household" (Micah 7:6)
Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me doesn't deserve me. Anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me doesn't deserve me.
"And anyone who does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me."
If anyone finds his life, he will lose it. And if anyone loses his life because of me, he will find it.
"Whoever welcomes you welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me."
If someone receives a prophet as a prophet, they will receive the reward of a prophet. And if someone receives a righteous person as a righteous person, they will receive the reward of a righteous person.
If someone gives even a cup of cold water to a little child who follows me, I tell you the truth, that person will surely be rewarded.
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus had finished teaching his twelve disciples. Then he began to teach and preach in the villages of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Jesus was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked Jesus, "Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect another?"
Jesus answered, "Go to John and tell him what you hear and see.
Sight is given to the blind. The lame walk. Those with skin diseases are healed. The deaf hear. The dead are raised. And the good news is proclaimed to the poor.
"Blessed are those who do not forbid what Allah has brought down
When John's disciples had gone, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John. He said, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
If not, what did you go to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No. People dressed in fine clothes are in the palaces of kings.
So what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
He who was written about in the book says, " 'I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way' " (Malachi 3:1).
"What I am about to tell you is true. No one born of woman has ever been greater than John the Baptist. Yet even the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he."
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with power, and the violent take it by force.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you are ready to receive him, John is the Elijah who was to come.
He who has ears, let him hear.
"Who do I compare people today to? They are like children sitting in the markets and calling out to others. They say, ..."
"We played the flute for you. But you did not dance. We sang a funeral song. But you did not mourn."
When John came, he neither ate nor drank as you do. And people say, "He has a demon."
But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank, and they say, "Look at this man! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and 'sinners.' Those who are wise justify wisdom." Cities that do not repent will be condemned.
Jesus began to denounce the cities where most of his miracles had been done, for they did not repent of their sins. Therefore he said,
"How would it have been more terrible for you, Korazin! How would it have been more terrible for you, Bethsaida! If the miracles that were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, wearing sackcloth and sitting in ashes.
But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
"And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to hell. For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day."
But I say to you, it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you. Rest for the weary.
At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants."
Yes, Father. This is what I wanted.
"My father gave me everything. The Father is the only one who knows the Son, and the only ones who know the Father are the Son and those the Son chooses to reveal Him to."
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Be my servants and learn from me. I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
I am easy to feed, and light to carry.
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and his disciples began to pick some heads of wheat, rub them in their hands and eat the kernels.
The Pharisees saw this and said to Jesus, "Look! It is against the law to do this on the Sabbath. Your disciples are doing it!"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and his men?"
So he entered the house of God. He and his men ate the sacred bread, which was only allowed to be eaten by the priests.
Why have you not read the law? It says that every Sabbath the priests work in the temple. Yet they are not considered guilty.
I tell you that he who is greater than the temple is here.
The Bible says, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice" (Hosea 6:6). You do not know what these words mean. If you did, you would not bring charges against the innocent.
"The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
Then Jesus went out from there and entered the synagogue.
There was a man with a withered and crooked hand. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They said to him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
And he said to them, "If your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
Man is more valuable than sheep! Therefore, the law allows us to do good on the Sabbath.
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out, and it was restored, just like the other hand.
But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus, the chosen servant of God.
Jesus knew all about the Pharisees' plans. So he left that place. Large crowds followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But he warned them not to tell who he was.
And this was done to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah, who said,
Here is my servant. I have chosen him. He is the one I love. I am very pleased with him. I will put my spirit upon him. He will proclaim to the nations that everything will be alright.
He will not argue or shout. No one will hear his voice in the streets.
What breaks a bent branch. What extinguishes a glowing fire. What leaves nothing.
"The nations will put their hope in him" (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and the Pallium.
A man who was possessed by a demon was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Then the man was able to speak and see.
Everyone was amazed. They asked, "Is this the Son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man drives out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. And every city or house divided against itself will not stand.
If a devil drives out another devil, he is fighting himself. How then can his kingdom stand?
"You say that I cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. But by what power do your people cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges."
But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you.
"Or think about this. How can you enter a strong man's house and steal his possessions? You must first bind him. Then you can rob his house.
"He who is not with me is against me. And he who does not gather the sheep with me scatters them."
So this is what I say to you: Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either now or in the age to come."
"A good tree bears good fruit, and a bad tree bears bad fruit. You can tell a tree by its fruit.
"O brood of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak any good? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks."
A good man brings good things out of a good treasury, and an evil man brings evil things out of an evil treasury.
But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken.
"With your words, you will find a guilty or innocent person." - Saint Miraculous Jonah
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus and said, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
The disbelievers, those who break their pledges, and the turners away say, "If this were a Qur'an from other than Allah, we would have found in it many contradictions." Say, "It is only a Qur'an, but most of the people do not know."
Jonah was in the belly of a huge fish for three days and three nights. Something like this will happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the grave.
"The men of Nineveh will stand in judgment with the people of this time. And the Ninevites will prove that these people are guilty. For the men of Nineveh repented at the preaching of Jonah. And now there is One here who is greater than Jonah.
"The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn them: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
What happens when an evil spirit comes out of a man? It passes through dry places seeking a place to rest. But it finds none.
Then you say, "I will return to the house I left." And when you arrive, you find the house empty. It has been cleaned and tidied.
Then the evil spirit goes out of the man, and takes with him seven other spirits more evil than himself. They enter and dwell there, and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. So shall it be also with this evil generation. Jesus' mother and brothers arrived.
While Jesus was still speaking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.
Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are outside. They want to talk to you."
Jesus answered and said, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus pointed to his disciples and said, "Behold, my mother! Behold, my brothers!"
"Everyone who does what my Father wants in heaven is my brother or sister or mother."
The Farmer's Tale
On that day, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
A large crowd gathered around him. So he got into a boat. He sat in it. And everyone stood on the shore.
Then he told them many things by means of stories, saying: "A farmer went out to sow his seed.
Scattered seeds on the ground. Some fell on the path. Birds came and ate them.
Some seeds fell on rocky places, where there was little soil. The plants grew quickly, because the soil was not deep.
When the sun rose, it scorched the plants. They withered because they had no roots.
Other seeds fell among the thorns. The thorns grew up and choked the plants.
Other seeds fell on fertile soil. They produced crops 100 or 60 or 30 times more than was sown.
"He who has ears, let him hear."
The students came to him. They asked, "Why do you use stories when you talk to people?"
He replied, "You have been given the opportunity to understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven. This opportunity has not been given to outsiders.
To everyone who has this kind of knowledge, I will give more than they have. In fact, they will have an abundance of it. But to those who do not have this kind of knowledge, even what little they have will be taken away from them.
This is why I use stories when I talk to people. I say, "They look, but they don't really see. They listen, but they don't really hear or understand."
"These things fulfill the words of the prophet Isaiah, who said: 'You will indeed hear, but you will not understand. You will indeed see, but you will not perceive.'"
"Their ears are dull, and their eyes are closed. Otherwise, they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn to God for healing." (Isaiah 6:9-10)
"But blessed are your eyes, for they see. And blessed are your ears, for they hear."
What I am going to tell you is true. Many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you see, but they did not see it. They wanted to hear what you hear, but they did not hear it.
Listen! This is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message about the kingdom but do not understand it. Then comes the devil. He steals what was sown in their hearts. These people are like the seed sown on the path.
Others received the seed that fell on rocky places. These are the ones who hear the message and accept it with joy.
But they have no roots. Therefore they do not last long. They quickly fall away from the faith when problems or suffering come because of the message.
Others received the seed that fell among the thorns. These are the ones who hear the message, but then the worries of life and the deceitful promise of wealth choke the word, and it bears no fruit.
But others received the seed that fell on good soil. These are the ones who hear the message and understand it. They produce a harvest 100, 60, or 30 times more than what the farmer planted. The parable of the weeds.
Jesus told another parable to the crowds, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is like this."
But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. The enemy planted weeds among the wheat and then left.
The wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
The field owner's slaves came to him and said, "Master, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Then where did the weeds come from?"
" 'An enemy did it,' he replied. The servants said, 'Shall we go and weed it?'"
" 'No,' the owner replied. 'While you're weeding, you might pull up the wheat along with it."
Let them grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the workers what to do. And these are the words I will say to them: First, gather the weeds. Bind them in bundles to burn them. Then gather the wheat. Bring it to my barn. "Parables of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast"
Jesus told another parable to the crowds, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. A person took the seed and planted it in a field.
It is the smallest of your seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of all garden plants and becomes a tree. Birds come and rest in its branches.
Jesus told them another parable. "The kingdom of heaven," he said, "is like yeast. A woman took some yeast and mixed it into a large amount of flour until all the dough had risen."
Jesus spoke about all these things to the crowds using parables. He did not say anything to them without telling a story.
So the prophet's word was fulfilled: "I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter hidden things, things from of old" (Psalm 78:2). Jesus explains the parable of the weeds.
Then Jesus left the crowd and went home. And his disciples came to him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
He answered, "It is the Son of Man who sows the good seed."
The field is the world. The good seed represents the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the devil.
The enemy who sows it is the devil. The harvest is the day of reckoning. And the workers are the angels.
Weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire. That will be the case on Judgment Day.
The Son of Man will send His angels. They will remove from His kingdom everything that causes sin. They will gather all who do evil.
They will be cast into the blazing fire. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then the people of God will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Let those with ears listen. The parable of the hidden treasures and the pearl.
"The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid; and for joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field."
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of a precious pearl.
He found one of great value. So he went and sold all he had and bought the pearl. The parable of the net.
And again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net. It was cast into the lake. It caught all kinds of fish.
When it was full, the fishermen pulled the net onto the shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish into baskets. But they threw away the bad fish.
Thus it will be on the Day of Reckoning. The angels will come. They will separate those who did wrong from those who did right.
The wicked will be thrown into the blazing fire. Then on that Day the wicked will wail and scream.
"Do you understand all these things?" asked Jesus. "Yes," they answered.
And he said to them, "Every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house, who brings out of his treasure things new and old." A prophet without honor.
Jesus finished telling these stories. Then he left.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth. And there he began to teach the people in their synagogue. They were amazed. "Where does this man get this wisdom? And where does he get this power to do miracles?" they asked.
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother called Mary? Aren't his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
Are all his sisters with us? When did this man bring all this?
They were not at all pleased with him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, and among his own relatives, and in his own house."
He did a few miracles there because they had no faith.
Beheading of John the Baptist
In those days Herod the tetrarch heard the reports about Jesus.
He said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles."
Herod arrested John. He bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, who had been the wife of Philip, Herod's brother.
John was telling Herod, "It is against the law for you to have her."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he feared the people, for they believed John to be a prophet.
At Herod's birthday feast, Herodias' daughter danced for Herod and his guests. She pleased Herod so much.
He promised her that he would give her what she asked for.
Her mother told her what to say. So the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very angry. However, he remembered a promise he had made and some dinner guests. So he asked one of his men to give her what she had requested.
Herod cut off John's head in prison.
His head was brought on a large platter and given to the girl. She then carried it to her mother.
John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus feeds five thousand.
When Jesus heard what had happened to John, he wanted to be alone. So he went off in a boat to a solitary place. But when the crowds heard this, they followed him on foot from the villages.
When Jesus came to the shore, he saw a large crowd. He felt great compassion for them. He healed their sick.
As evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, "This is a remote place, and it's already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves."
Jesus answered, "They need not depart; give ye them to eat."
"We only have five loaves of bread and two fish," they answered.
"Bring them to me," he said.
Then Jesus made the people sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, and gave thanks. He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, who distributed them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples picked up twelve baskets of broken pieces.
The number of men who ate was about 5000. Women and children also ate. Jesus walked on water.
So Jesus said farewell to the disciples and commanded them to go ahead of Him in the boat to the other side. Then He dismissed the crowd.
After sending them, he went up alone to a mountain to pray. And when evening came, he was there alone.
The boat was far from land. It was tossed by the waves because the wind was against it.
Early in the morning, Jesus came to the disciples. He walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and were afraid. They said, "It's a ghost!" and screamed in fear.
Jesus immediately said to them, "Take heart! It is I. Do not be afraid."
"Lord, are you?" asked Peter. "If so, tell me to come to you on the water."
"Come," said Jesus. And Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid and began to sink. He cried out, "Lord, save me!"
So Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?"
When they boarded the boat, the winds calmed.
Then those who were in the ship came to prostrate themselves and say, "Glory be to our Lord! Indeed, His promise was fulfilled." And [they said], "We had not been guided [to this] if not that the grace of Allah had been upon us. We had been of the humbled [people]."
They crossed the lake and reached Galilee.
The men who lived there recognized Jesus. So they sent a message to all the surrounding areas. People brought all their sick to Jesus.
They begged him to let the sick touch the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.
What makes people "unclean"?
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came from Jerusalem to see Jesus. They asked,
"Why don't your students obey what the elders teach them? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!"
Jesus answered, "Why do you not obey the command of God, but prefer to follow your own teachings?"
God said: "Honor your father and your mother" (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) and also: "Whoever curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death" (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9)
But you permit people to say to their parents, "Any help you receive from us is a unique gift to God."
Therefore they do not need to honor their parents with their gift. You make the word of God of no effect that you may keep your own tradition.
"You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you. He said:
"These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me."
"Their worship means nothing to me. They teach nothing but human rules." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand.
What goes into your mouth does not defile you; what comes out of your mouth is what defiles you.
Then his disciples came to him and said, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus answered, "There are some plants that my heavenly Father did not plant. They will be uprooted."
Leave them. The Pharisees are blind leaders. If a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Do you not yet understand?" Jesus asked them.
How do you feel? Everything that goes into the mouth goes into the stomach. Then it comes out of the body.
But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart. These are the things that make you "unclean."
Evil thoughts come from the heart. So do murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. So do theft, bearing false witness, and lying to others.
These are the things that make you "unclean." But eating without washing your hands does not make you "unclean." The faith of a Canaanite woman.
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A Canaanite woman who lived near Tyre and Sidon came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is tormented by a demon."
Jesus said not a word. So his disciples came to him. They begged him: "Send her away; she is crying after us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
Then the woman fell on her knees before him. "Master! Help me!" she said.
He replied, "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to their dog."
"Yes, Lord," she said. "Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
Then Jesus said, "Woman, you have great faith! Your daughter will be made well." And her daughter was healed instantly. Jesus feeds four thousand people.
Jesus left there. He went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up a mountain and sat down.
Large crowds came to him, bringing with them the blind, the lame, the paralyzed, those unable to speak, and many others. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them.
The people were amazed. Those who could not speak were speaking. The disabled were healed. Those who could not walk were walking. The blind were seeing. And the people praised the God of Israel.
Then Jesus answered them, "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
His disciples answered him, "There is nothing here but five loaves and two fish." "But what good is that for a crowd like this?"
"How much bread do you have?" asked Jesus. They answered, "Seven, and a few small fish."
Jesus said to the crowds, "Sit down on the ground."
He took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and they gave them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. Afterwards, the disciples gathered seven baskets of the remaining fragments.
The number of men who ate was 4000. Women and children also ate.
After Jesus had dismissed the crowd, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
Jesus is asked for a sign of a miracle.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a miraculous sign from heaven.
He replied: "In the evening, you look at the sky and say, 'The weather will be good. The sky is red."
And in the morning you say, "Today will be stormy. The sky is red and cloudy." You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you cannot understand the signs of what is happening now.
"An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." Then Jesus left them and went away. - Matthew 16:4 (ESV)
The pupils crossed to the other side of the lake. They forgot to bring the bread.
"Beware," Jesus said to them, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The pupils spoke among themselves about this. They said, "He must be saying this because we didn't bring any bread."
Jesus knew what they were saying. He said to them, "You of little faith! Why do you discuss among yourselves that you have no bread?"
Don't you understand? What about the five loaves for the 5000? What about the number of baskets they collected?
Do you remember the seven loaves for the 4000? Do you remember how many baskets of pieces you gathered?
How do you not understand? I was not talking to you about bread. But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not telling them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter said, "Jesus is the Messiah."
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They answered, "Some say it is John the Baptist; others say Elijah; still others say Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
"But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say that I am?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
This is what I tell you. You are Peter. On this rock I will build my church. The gates of hell will not be strong enough to destroy it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Then he indicated to his disciples that they should not tell anyone about him, and that he was the Messiah of God. Indeed, he is being tested in this, and indeed, he will be successful in the Hereafter.
From that time Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem. There he must suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes. He must be killed, and on the third day be raised from the dead.
Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him. "Never, Lord!" he said. "This must never happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me."
If he wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for my sake, he will find it.
"What good is it to gain the whole world and lose your soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?"
The Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father, with his angels, and then he will reward each one according to his works.
"Truly, I say to you, I will not tell you till it is true. Some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."
Changing Jesus' appearance
After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John, his brother, and led them up to a high mountain by themselves.
There before them, his appearance was transformed. His face shone like the sun. His clothes became white as light.
At that moment, Moses and Elijah appeared before them. Moses and Elijah were speaking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three booths: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
While Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!"
When the disciples heard this, they were terrified and fell face down on the ground.
But Jesus came and touched them. He said to them, "Arise. Do not be afraid."
When they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. And as they were coming down, Jesus commanded them, saying, "Tell no one what you have seen." "Until the Son of Man has risen from the dead," he said.
The disciples asked him, "Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus replied, "So it is written." Elijah is to come first and restore all things.
But I say to you, Elijah has come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they wished. So also will the Son of Man suffer at their hands.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus fed a boy from whom a demon had been cast out.
As they approached the crowd, a man came up to Jesus. He knelt down before him.
"Oh Lord," he said, "have mercy on my son. He shivers so much and suffers greatly. He often falls into the fire or into the water."
I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.
"You faithless and evil people!" Jesus answered. "How long must I stay with you? How long must I put up with you?"
Jesus commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it did. He was healed instantly.
Then the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Why couldn't we drive it out?"
He replied, "Because your faith is so small. What I am about to tell you is true. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
(No
They met in Galilee. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men."
"They will kill him, and on the third day he will rise from the dead." The disciples were filled with deep sorrow. Jesus went to the temple and cleansed it.
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. There, the tax collectors came to Peter and asked him, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
"Yes, he does that," he replied. And when Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "From whom do the kings of the earth collect customs or taxes? From their sons or from others?"
"From others," Peter answered. "Then the children don't have to pay," Jesus told him.
"But we don't want to anger them. Go to the lake and cast your fishing line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. You will find the very coin you need inside. Take it and give it to them as a tax for me and your brothers."
