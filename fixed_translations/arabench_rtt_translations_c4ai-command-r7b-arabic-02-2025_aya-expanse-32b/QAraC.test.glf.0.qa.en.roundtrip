Москe, I want.
angg, Sultan! What are you saying?
This is sad! It's an opportunity we won't waste.
Also, I don't interfere. It's my right to take, and it's your right to take what you've given me before.
anggah, God bless your parents, don't bring us problems.
Salih, don't be...., forgive me, Lord!
Oh Lord, is there a brother who advises his brother as you say?
If you are hungry
And I found a great feast.
The holiday is for no one.
Say that to yourself.
This holiday will not return to us.
Don't be a stranger, Saleh.
Seize the opportunity from us.
No, no, no, no, don't try to convince me, it's impossible, impossible, I won't do it.
The problem is that he's afraid.
What are you afraid of?
This is a government project! Everyone is taking.
This is the rule!
Even people who don't participate benefit from it.
He is the head of a huge project.
This means he's in control.
The Third International Millennium Beach, specifically the first phase of the infrastructure.
O donkey!
Here we can loot!
If he refuses to take
Who gave you the right?
You don't have the right to benefit from it.
When his car wouldn't start.
Who used to take him to the project site? Wasn't it me?
No, if that's the case, you're right.
Who gives you money to fill up your car four and five times!
Leave it to me.
Don't be foolish and be stubborn.
Take some interest.
Look at Uncle Thursday.
And now, as you say, they call him the millionaire.
A third of the project,
The third is the fee.
One who plays in a popular band,
They say there was a national celebration.
And he bought a hundred lamps.
You know what they did.
I added the zero.
What's the use, auntie!
No, God guides him, God willing.
Let's eat with him.
I spent last night trying to convince him.
It's an opportunity.
For the victory of good.
And God willing, the majority will be good.
This is common.
Keep it between you and me.
Don't speak to anyone about the matter.
Do we need to worry?
But my friends
Neck pain.
The man began to change his mind.
I spoke with him today.
Two-hour morning.
He began to be convinced.
We will meet him in a moment.
We are compelled to convince him.
He cuts us off from the benefit.
They really convinced him to change his mind at the meeting.
My brother Ali, my brother Osman.
I don't know.
Because today is my first day of work.
Rely on me.
How could you not get it!
Sure. But are you sure I'll get some?
I want to ask you
If you are hungry and walking down the street
Do you eat or not eat?
I am a person who eats a lot.
Don't be afraid.
The dish is large.
We are still working on the first paper for the meeting.
If you're not okay,
If you have any concerns
What I really want to know
It's legitimate.
"O Allah, guide Saleh."
This is reasonable because you are a boss for the first time in your life.
It's very simple.
We will add our share.
In the project budget!?
What do you think?
Lest anyone doubt what we are about.
We publish our share as a separate article!
This amount of money has been stolen.
By the people responsible for the project.
Cannot
No, no, no! Oh! Alright!
You know how these things happen.
But it seems you have some concerns.
This is their right.
First and foremost,
Everything is in our hands.
I told you he was lying.
What's wrong with you?
He says the new car is his colleague's, and you believe him.
He said that!
Say it's his friend's car.
And in a very distinguished location as well!
Except for a very rich man.
What I heard from people,
He told me that he bought it for himself and registered it in his name.
He said: "Please"
He has the money now.
Now he will start lying.
Isn't this his family?
Is that all?
Aren't we going to take anything?
We'll finish what we started!
He wants to eat it alone, one bite at a time.
Don't nod your head!
Nor your brother
Sit down and everything will be alright.
I talked to him all night.
I told him, "Whatever, they're your relatives."
Finally, he agreed.
This is how things should be.
And God willing, you will not get it just once.
This is the international beach of the third millennium.
Specifically, infrastructure.
Then they will start the second phase later.
And it will continue with him.
O Allah, grant me the reward for this good deed.
It's a good thing you pressured him into agreeing.
You are no different from them.
But, it's okay.
I wish you had explained it to him.
We want a percentage share.
They all take a percentage.
He even said that after I convinced him.
They want their friends to attend the meeting to set the project budget.
They must be followed, it's their money.
We place it with certainty.
Submit it as soon as possible to get approval.
Take your time.
Who is this? Do you know him?
He is my wife's brother who shares with me.
Do you mean that...?
They are responsible for doors, windows, and everything related to finishing.
Good, good
How much do you want to finish?
How much will you get?
We take the money.
Let's give ourselves a week to think.
And we'll determine the amount we'll get.
Some people are waiting and want a little bit.
Abdulaziz is right.
If someone decides to take half a million.
During this week, everyone will think carefully.
And specify the amount they want.
By next week, they will decide and determine how much they want.
What do you have to do with this?
Then, it's up to you?
Ignore him.
Oh my friend, what's the matter? What's wrong with you?
I don't know what he's doing here.
Ha! Who invited you to this project?
It's a government project.
Salih, your brother's name is Sultan!
This is our neighbor's driver.
Sometimes he drives us when our car doesn't work.
Write.
Sane Abdullah.
No, no, there are three other people.
What do you want from me? I'm tired of it.
I told him, "Enough, man. Let's propose the budget and be done."
No, no, this will cost a sum of money.
How much should I give him?
God bless him, does he have children!
Yes, he did, make it twenty-five thousand four hundred.
Four hundred
They add it by force.
How much are you going to give them!
This is too much.
This is my mother, as we were just talking about her.
Yes, Mom.
Yes, no, no, no, the latter, oh! My son.
Oh no! My son, you want to go to Thailand for treatment.
Wait, wait, what happened?
Why are you upset?
Only from the first phase, specifically the infrastructure.
Used
Add three thousand.
Buy me watches from Thailand with starry glitter.
Did you add her?
Yes, Mom.
No, I didn't add her, I just wanted to check the name.
Oh, my beloved mother.
Let's expand the feast.
Yes, but the budget needs to be defined; it can't be open-ended like this.
Tomorrow is the last meeting and everyone must determine the amount they want.
I have this.
One million is enough!
So much, my love.
Guys, guys, wait, it's noisy, give us a chance.
The committee is currently in a meeting to approve the project budget. Financial matters should not be discussed now. That's all.
I want more
We said, "Don't humiliate us, we are in the ministry's courtyard."
Oh my God, we're screaming, don't draw our attention.
If someone comes and asks you what's bothering all of you here
We'll tell him that the power is out or there's an electric shock.
Do not make noise in the ministry's courtyard.
Believe me
Sew it! Do you hear me!
"I was with them, what's the budget now?"
Without counting my brother.
Fully, fifty million
Just fifty million for the first phase.
How much is it now?
What, Saleh
Share the good, man.
Anyway, enjoy your meal.
Come quickly, let's work, all the beneficiaries are waiting for us.
No problem... The important thing is that we don't want any discussions, they should just vote on the budget and that's it.
And start implementing tomorrow.
And it serves a very large segment of society.
Lord bless, this is the International Beaches Project for the Third Millennium.
This is the first stage.
More specifically, the infrastructure.
For future generations
Certainly, on behalf of our program's staff, we would like to welcome you and congratulate you on the launch of the project, which will take place tomorrow, as far as I know.
It took us a year and a half.
One and a half years
Once again, on behalf of the Future Achievements Program,
This project
And future generations
If good preserves the blessing of oil upon us.
Second, third, and tenth stages.
actor
Welcome aboard.
Why did they gather us here? When will the cars come to pick us up?
What? Where are they going to take us?
Praise be to God, I have grown up and become old.
Let's sit down, the sun is hot.
Yes, a nice girl.
But I don't see anything.
Anything but the sea.
Why did they remove you?
My sister Manira told me that Iman is here.
My father's land in the desert.
I wondered who lied to her and gave her incorrect information.
That is not the land.
I saw a farm in the desert and said, "That's my father's farm."
Moreover, why do you ask about these things?
You have brothers.
Those who work hard and invest in land, real estate, and businesses, and make an effort.
Free from headaches.
I'm disappointed in you, Iman.
And also, my sister.
However you know
They must give it to me.
They are your brothers.
Nothing is better than the truth.
Because money
Now we help her and drive her to the hospital.
I don't know how many years she spent in trials with her brothers.
Nine or ten years, if not more.
No, but
The sisters of Um Salim are thieves.
Poor thing, she was telling me yesterday.
She wants to build a mosque before she dies.
What do you know?
I'm not saying your brothers are like her, God forbid.
How many years ago did my father pass away?
Why are you asking now?
She saw the farm.
What else do you want?
How long does her period last?
Let's understand the story first.
It's her right.
If it were someone else, his sisters wouldn't have taken a single penny.
I got it.
Where from?
As if it's not my money.
Look what, Monira
See him.
Becomes fifty thousand
Because I was brave and asked about my father's land, the one in the desert.
I'm sure my share is more than that.
Everyone lives in a villa like this.
Their children are in the best schools.
What I say, ya! Munira
I won't stop fighting for my right.
I will get my revenge.
It's better to invest your money in the company! No, thank you.
Everyone wrestles with the other.
People have lost their compassion.
You think your brothers are better than mine.
Look at me.
Twenty years
I used to go to the court a lot.
And in the end
I didn't benefit from it at all.
Why does he do that?
That's why I'm telling you, oh! My dear, be nice to them.
Treat them kindly.
And you will get bored of them.
And why do courts take a long time?
We are four hundred thousand, all of us.
If we reach the million like other countries.
I really did, my God, dear, doubt issuing an order.
Look at my brothers.
I swear I don't want all this.
Oh my God!
I only say: "Allah, we work, and what Allah wills, happens."
God is the best disposer of affairs.
Didn't you have a court hearing last week?
As usual, oh my god! Dearie
The judge asked us to file a brief.
We've been through this many times.
My dear, they will invest millions, and you will just watch.
As I told you, you'll get bored of courts.
And it won't take away from your right.
That's why I'm telling you, if I were in your shoes
I'll be satisfied with what they give me.
Because the woman
We don't pay you anything.
Men ask you!
She has some.
Just some questions about her share.
She just wants to know something and leave.
If you can't find it
I'll drag you and show you.
He will find his way.
I signed the waiver.
Two hundred and fifty, which is more than enough for her, her husband works.
Take it or leave it.
Why did you ask now?
But he is jealous.
As if it's not my right.
My father's inheritance, and he wants to decide how much I should take, take it or leave it.
It's not my place or his to decide.
This is God's command.
Why is my father suffering in his grave?
I didn't expect that from them.
Because it's money.
It opened thirty years ago.
I don't know what to do, yaaaaaaaaah.
Land, buildings, and real estate are easy to visualize.
I don't know how much they charge.
Even the company,
It's your right to ask about everything.
And I will not leave them.
How are you going to get back to them?
What do you have to do with this?
And what do you have to do with me? I have the right to know everything.
Tra
Your sister gave him a power of attorney.
that allows him to examine almost everything in the company
"Saghyr, Sa'ad"
He's screaming in our faces.
"Sakar, enough."
My brother Nasser
Sorry, I'll take
Yes, sir.
Get out, now.
Excuse me, go.
Don't give him a reason to attack us.
Now, if he goes and sues us,
And he told you that he hit him.
So, shall we let him do as he pleases!
I have an official document.
Official! We can't stop him.
It is his legal right to examine everything.
If he looks at the budget and accounts
We give him forty thousand every three months.
If he reviews the budget,
Double twelve by eight
Divide it by three.
Thirty-two
Do you know how much?
This is how much we owe her.
Except for lands and projects
We are free to do what we want.
We have no fear, we are not afraid.
If he doesn't agree, this is what we have. If he agrees, welcome.
Let them go and deal with it.
They only give their sisters enough to live on.
She is married.
She has a husband to rely on.
What do you want with money?
This is what was supposed to be from the beginning.
Yes, sir.
As he pleases
Even my desk.
My brother Rashid, this was supposed to happen earlier.
As you wish, sir.
File by file
When I knew her true nature.
Villas and lands that you were unaware of their existence.
It turned out to be seven.
It turned out to be sixteen.
I didn't know.
She was poor, shocked.
What happens
Don't leave them alone.
Please, son, I don't want to hear any talk about courts.
The more you worry.
The fewer the judges,
Half a minute
Then he says his usual phrase,
To the seventh, the fourth, two thousand, I don't know how much.
They will be very happy, my son.
You weren't supposed to get out of bed at all, Mama.
O Allah, heal him.
No, no, please come.
Nasser and my sister Manar
After we slammed the door in his face and kicked him out of the company.
He's sending one of my old schoolmates.
His name is Abdullah.
And now
I won't allow him.
I mean, can he influence them?
Inshallah
Yes yes yes
Do not rely on the judiciary.
Courts do nothing but reports.
Delay and wrangling, useless lawyers.
The years pass by.
And the passing of the years
And you won't get a single penny.
O Allah, have mercy on Umm Salim.
You advised me the day before she died.
Don't go to the courts.
He said that our courts
She died without taking anything from her inheritance.
She passed away without the judge resolving her case.
What if we were like other countries?
Hello Abdullah
My brother Abdullah
Years have passed.
This is my brother Saad.
I invite you to grow in grace.
The most important
Fraternity
Uncle Rashid
You are a brother to me.
Don't let money problems get to you.
Is there anything else you're talking about besides my sister?
Sorry
Why should I ask him to stop talking?
It's correct.
They don't even want me to get my share of my father's inheritance.
My mother told me yesterday that my brother Saad's wife...
Her father is a messenger at the ministry.
It's all my father's money.
We've been waiting for a long time.
We'll try one last time.
I sent them your friend Abdullah.
They didn't respect him until they expelled him.
Let's see what Sheikh Abdul Rahman will do.
He is a very kind man.
He said: "In confirmation of Nasser."
Don't worry.
Intimidating them with the law
Did you forget what poor Umm Sulaym said about the courts?
Perhaps the brothers of Umm Salim do not fear the courts.
But my brothers
They might be afraid of rumors.
They might be ashamed to go to court.
We'll wait and see how things go after Sheikh Abdul Rahman's visit to them.
God bless you.
Is this the Friday sermon?
If you don't have it, get out.
What are you saying, my son!
He is telling the truth.
Go away, %pw go away
Tomorrow morning I'm going to the court.
And why should I postpone until the day after tomorrow?
I'm the one who decides, not you.
What will happen if I wait until the day after tomorrow?
Hello, brother Rashid
This is a promise.
I told you before.
Let's intimidate them with the law.
Now, I am asked to postpone going to court.
Because they knew you were serious about it, my love.
It's important that we visit your sister Manira.
What is this?
Sir, you asked me what this is, this is...
God bless you all.
A small model of the courthouse building.
God bless you.
And each one of you
Blessings upon you.
You didn't tell me.
I told you not to go today.
Postpone it until the day after tomorrow.
To obtain a sample of this %pw from the courthouse building
Ready to show you the way.
Enter through this door, this one.
When you enter through the door,
You put all your things there.
The mobile phone and anything metallic so as not to make beep beep beep beep beep sounds.
Register the case, you will be asked to go to the eighth floor, elevator one two three four five six seven eight go.
Circling around the offices
Look at the judge, if you really need a particular judge, for example.
Also, these.
You want to sue us.
We are here to guide her.
We'll see when you'll get your due.
Either you take the six thousand.
As he said.
Goodbye
We're eating dinner at my sister's house today.
Oh my god!
My sister told me he was very happy, I didn't believe it.
He said: "If they approve the project, I'll invite you for dinner at my place."
Alhamdulillah, luck comes with a spouse.
Oh, sweetness, O Abu Waleed!
Luck is on his side.
My sister told me that he was so happy that he didn't sleep last night.
Alhamdulillah! Oh! Manal
He doesn't know anything about business, but good men helped him.
Alright, tell your father.
I hope you enjoyed the food.
Thank you, Billy.
Thank you, Abu Waleed! May God bless you.
May God bless your life.
Very delicious food, Um Waleed.
Hire an accountant and a secretary to organize your business.
They told me to rent an office, and they would take care of everything.
Eat a little, uncle.
Oh, my darling daughter
I want a BlackBerry.
We want a bigger house.
See, it looks better now.
Father, didn't we agree that you would give a speech after lunch?
And now, ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming the project owner, my father, Abu Waleed.
*Forgive us*
Congratulations, Abu Waleed.
You deserve
But, frankly, you're not an expert in business and trade.
Man, there's a story behind this project.
I'll tell you how!
Praise be to God, %pw
Last year,
When the Japanese team played against our national team.
I was at Souk Waqif.
What I know about that now
This is a manufacturer's catalog for multipurpose halls, which our esteemed ministry is seeking.
Any contractor can build it for you.
What understands
Any contractor
Japanese people are wonderful.
When you open it, the computer says
Cinema, if you want.
If you want a kitchen, click on "Kitchen".
When I presented the catalog to the ministry committee,
And what about your contract with the factory?
I paid some.
Deposit
Most importantly, your contract with the factory.
I signed it, praise be to God.
And give me some time until I place the first order.
What are you waiting for?
It's true that they agreed to it.
But we're still waiting for Boufahd's signature.
What did the secretary say?
He said that Bu Fahad didn't attend.
Do you want tea?
"O Walid, tell me what you did!"
You don't know Bou Fahd; he might come, and he might not.
He will suddenly appear one day.
He doesn't have time.
Come here.
You are the boss here.
Do you want to kill me?
No, he has to sign it.
Look at all these files on my desk, they all need Bofahed's signature.
So! What should I do?
God bless you.
Fifteen minutes for two, oh! Boo and Waleed.
It's time to go back home.
I don't think Boufahd will come.
God willing, tomorrow will be easier for you.
I said that you've known the manager for a long time and he's a friend of yours.
What's wrong with you?
He is a useless manager.
Stupid boss, does nothing,
Alas, they seem wise but they are not.
They do something useful.
Do they do anything at all!
They don't move a chair without Bou Fahad's permission.
The manager didn't ask about you yesterday.
The people's issues are pending.
It seems you're going to them today as well.
I'm in trouble.
I face problems daily.
Because the factory gave me limited time.
No, God willing.
And if they ask about you
Not only you are waiting for Bu Fahed.
Look at these files.
They all need Bu Fahd's signature.
I think he will come today.
Please sit down.
Or walk.
I'll call you when he comes.
If something happens, I'll call, don't scare them.
Goodbye
Sorry, I was worried about you. She's my wife.
Oh my god!
I only need him to sign, what's this?
Oh my child! This is the registration period, my daughter will miss the university scholarship, her papers need to be processed.
My problem with the factory, the deadline, the deadline.
Wait a moment.
All your papers are going to fall.
He's drinking his coffee. Once he's finished, you can come and see him.
Please, I ask you all to be quiet.
Yes, sir.
Goodbye
Wait, wait oh! People
Wait, where are you going, wait.
I know what happened first.
What happened?
He has an urgent trip.
He has a unique voice.
I'm tired of this.
Our interests have stopped, brother.
We wait every day for Fahd.
"We say only that we must be patient and endure. We rely on God and on Sheikh Fahd."
Peace be upon you, Papa
No blame.
Everything is deteriorating.
The factory is in Japan.
I informed him that the deadline had passed.
And your aunt is another story.
Alas, she lent him the money.
He's having problems from all sides.
Oh mother, I am very worried about my father.
Don't leave him alone.
Who will you call?
Yes, who is this?
Bu Waleed
To talk about the factory and your sister-in-law's money.
Wait for Boufahd.
Oh father, how long do you want me to wait?
They always say
We are waiting for Bu Fahad.
O my father! You have tried your best.
But all my friends will be joining university next week.
What are you looking for?
Phone, my love
Don't be afraid, just leave it to God.
Alright, who will you talk to?
Wait for Boufahd.
I won't say anything, sister.
You've been very patient with us.
God bless you.
Bu Waleed is in a sad position.
And he was shivering like a leaf due to the fever.
Because time is running out.
Five days left.
He's going to lose all his money.
God is the best disposer of affairs.
How nice! It pulls me, it pulls me, it pulls me.
I wish I could improve. I feel...
I have an unusual fever.
The top is shaking.
The other part is completely stationary.
Fifty percent of my body isn't working due to the fever.
It's a discount.
Don't be afraid.
Everything will be alright.
My sister helps.
You will wait until we return her money.
May God reward her with good.
We're not worried about your sister now.
My boss too, God help me.
It seems he heard.
Only Allah knows what he is planning.
I'm upset with him and Bu Fahd.
He drags me along, it's a problem.
Tomorrow is the last day.
My wealth will disappear.
Don't drag us in.
In the brain, in the brain
How will you be able to speak?
Give it to me, let's see who's calling.
Mr. Bou Bled
I'm calling you because I feel bad about you.
Be on standby.
Goodbye
I was a committed person throughout my life.
You were a role model.
You think I don't know that you skip work every day?
I can deduct from your salary.
What's up with your phone?
Instead of your enemy
I'll put you on the stock committee.
You're going with them to the stock market today.
You never leave work during working hours.
If you do
So don't blame me.
Today is his last chance.
He looks perplexed as he holds his phone, waiting for their call.
I'm afraid he'll be fired.
This is my phone, oh! Bou Walid
It's sad.
Let him go, good luck.
Ohhhhhhhhhh
Yes, welcome.
What's wrong with you, Uncle Bou Walid? I'm talking to you, not the phone.
Finish your paper.
Don't be afraid.
Many thanks
It seems that Bu Fahd is here.
What can I do for you?
He is a very important officer.
Where is he going?
Let's go to Uzbekistan.
Brother, where is Uzbekistan?
This is the third office on your left.
Don't cough.
Wait, Fahd.
Don't sit.
Don't challenge me.
Or do you want?
From house to house
Go ahead.
Oh people, this man is crazy.
Do you know how much I spend?
After all these years, you
Taking the papers, bringing the papers
My knee is weak now.
Going back and forth between all these ministries.
But we were young.
I was carrying bags of rice on my back like bags of potato chips for kids.
Then, God willing, you will learn to ride a bike.
Especially the bicycle that I learned to ride and bought.
Olive green
They pass by me, shaking my hand, and I'm riding this bike, oh my God.
Our daily bread, raising our children
The manager arrived.
We'll celebrate after you're done.
Praise be to God, praise be to God.
So, will you quit your job?
I testify that you are a good citizen.
Now I want to rest, brother. Goodbye.
We are all for you.
Don't you want us to grant you an extension for a year?
Enough, enough
"O Allah, reward you with the best."
You've already given me four extra years.
I should have retired a long time ago.
All my children have jobs now.
The last one, yesterday was his first day at work.
And now, oh! Abu Abdulaziz,
I want to rest.
And you're just a delivery driver.
With the traitors
Do you think that
Khanfoush hasn't eaten for four years.
Oh my goodness!
I can smell it now.
We will do whatever you want.
Transfer me to the Human Resources department.
Have you finished all the paperwork?
Yes, since yesterday.
Your papers will be delayed.
I'm boring.
Okay, done.
Stay in touch.
My son Khalid
From this moment on,
I hope to rest, yes.
Great, great
I'm at work and I can't leave.
Can you stop by the Human Resources Department?
I have some papers there.
I want you to take them to the Civil Service Department.
Thank you, thank you, Father.
Where are you going?
I have to go to the bank.
She's inviting us all.
Yes, now.
I have to go to the bank.
Send it with someone else.
No, sister, I can't get out of work.
Alright, alright, goodbye.
It seems he didn't agree, did he?
He said he couldn't quit his job.
What are you doing?
I will go to the bank tomorrow morning.
He is used to going to work every day.
I'm sure he'll get bored.
This is good for him.
Will you let him rest?
God willing, he will come home early.
He called and said that Khalid...
I sent him to complete his papers.
They fear God.
Everyone must rely on themselves.
My mother regrets the khonafrush.
Oh mom, I won't mess up.
I am not sorry, oh seller of doughnuts! Oh, my daughter!
But I say since he left the job and departed.
Khaled gave him tasks to do.
He's sleeping in his room.
Those Lost at Sea (Singing)
Good morning, Father.
Hello, my daughter.
Oh daddy please
But they called me and said the guard was angry.
Give me your papers.
Yes, Saeed's mother.
I told you to let the children be independent, why don't you listen to me?
As if you hadn't resigned.
Poor thing.
I'm waiting for you with the coffee in front of me.
We will eat it today.
Goodbye
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.
Sorry, my dear father.
God bless you.
Yes, it's next to the market.
Get out of here quickly.
I left, my daughter, I left.
Oh, in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
God willed it.
Praise be to God that you're back.
Sit, sit, sit
I told you to stay home.
Let your children learn to be independent.
I can't do anything, Umm Saeed.
They are having a hard time, I have to help them.
Enough, enough, relax.
And I'll get you a glass of water.
And the sellers will eat it.
God bless him, he's very tired.
And the taxis
He is naive.
He went to the market branch.
And they want her ID card.
I didn't take her car.
And she gave him the papers.
I am better, praise be to God.
Rely on yourselves.
I told you.
I want you to relax.
Take a chair and sit with us.
A very delicious lunch.
I went from one ministry to another.
I ran from one ministry to another.
Completing my children's papers
You cared for them when they were small, and you care for them now, you indulge them.
My children are in good positions at work.
And they're busy all the time, what can I do?
Every day there are meetings, either with the manager, or with the director, or with the minister.
They have good jobs, and when they are needed, they have to be there, it's a %pw job.
* * Until you can leave and finish your work, others stop you and force you to sit all the time, what were you thinking
I'm coming now. May God reward you for your kindness.
Come now, goodbye.
Sorry now, oh! oh! Bo Saqr
They called me and said it's ready.
If you send your father tomorrow to finish your work,
So I'll be late for work.
Fear your Lord.
Impossible, especially tomorrow, I can't.
Because he loves you.
Although he is discouraged and exhausted from your bad behavior towards him.
You don't even respect his age.
He was tired and slept in his room for two days.
Because she wanders the streets in the heat of the sun.
Let him give you the papers.
And he set out immediately to finish it.
A committee, starting from early morning until noon.
Did you hear that, Mom?
Do you want to delay the construction of my building?
Because you have a deadline and a committee tomorrow.
You must finish your paperwork tomorrow.
Some of them at night.
He has a committee meeting tomorrow, he must be present.
What's the problem, sir?
Containing his tears
In fact, I didn't lie to my father.
The committee changed its mind.
And they said they would come by the end of the week.
Okay, why didn't you tell him?
Oh father, don't go.
I will go because the committee hasn't come.
Instead of sitting in the cafeteria with those sparks.
Deceived him.
Alright, enough.
I will apologize.
I will do it.
Thank you
O my father! Eternity
He is wrong.
And also selfish.
When he learned that the committee wouldn't come.
We are blessed by your presence.
From now on, father!
We'll do our personal work ourselves.
Stay at home.
Let me kiss you on the head.
Hello, hello Oh! My son
Good morning
Oh father! I love you.
The whole world is worth it to me.
What I want is for you not to get angry.
No disturbing.
As I told you,
After finishing this paper
I really wanted to do that myself.
And he asked me to come at once.
Because I have a meeting.
With His Excellency the Minister
Delightful
You meet important people.
I feel happy when they say my children are with this one or that one.
Don't worry and go to your work, (singing)
Where is Bou Saada?
O my Lord, O Father!
The cover is with me, I'll send it with the tea boy.
He just passed in front of me, I'll send her with the tea boy.
My dear father
You mean he didn't sign it.
He may have forgotten.
Because the committee will meet in an hour.
No, rather God's blessing be upon you.
I have a meeting with the minister today.
Give me the papers.
This is my daily routine, work, home, work.
I don't see anyone.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, hello
Yes, no, I didn't tell him anything.
A week's vacation and off to the sea.
They said he enjoys himself on the farm.
He goes in the early morning.
He enjoys himself a lot there.
And guess what?
They say he's a good cook.
And he will go to him.
Goodbye
What's the problem?
Find a solution, sir.
"O Allah, guide them."
No, I'm fine, nothing.
Your papers are scattered.
He is at the farm.
And she
Her friend's paper
I am thirsty, I want water.
Give me water, water.
My dear children
No, no, take that out, I don't want it.
What are you writing?
I want to leave them puzzled.
Thank you, sister.
You are right.
No, no, no, I told him.
You are right, sister.
I'm sorry, sister.
They call it my league and cup.
Talk about the referee of the match.
He started talking nonsense.
They nicknamed him "The Theft Repentant."
People started inciting him.
And bring him some words to say on television and radio.
And also
They imprisoned him.
Believe me or not, my sister.
These days, no one cares about anyone but themselves.
Why is he looking for trouble?
Now, I will never ever start.
Let him speak and utter his famous phrase, "Enough corruption."
Praise be to God that he is well.
We are blessed by your coming.
Goodbye
I'm late for work, Mom.
Listen, son.
I was warning you.
Last night
Now I just want to remind you.
Alright, Mom.
I will never call.
Radio or TV, and I won't call Q-tell.
Your sister, Aisha,
And your fiancée has been crying all day.
Have mercy on us, O Lord, and have mercy on them.
As you said.
I will stop talking about things that don't matter.
Because I don't want you to be sad.
Your uncle, Manira's father.
I came here two days after you entered prison.
He said it was over.
It will be cancelled.
After many attempts, he finally calmed down.
But next time he's going to take you to court to divorce his daughter.
Alright, Mom.
I promised you.
You won't see any good if you call a TV or radio show again.
I told you I wouldn't do it.
Sorry, I have to go now.
I'll tell you, but stay calm.
The manager told me
They don't want you to work here.
Because you might be talking about management.
And start getting us into trouble.
How will the manager justify this decision?
He has a million excuses to say.
Where am I going!
You're serious, resign.
What did I tell you before?
Hello, yes.
Goodbye
I told you.
You know, for the greater good.
We need to reduce the number of messengers in the ministry.
You're right, but
Please, just once, tell us "Stop corruption."
It's cold.
Stop corrupting.
Correct, yes.
You're here!
We have work to do.
It's a disaster.
Until this issue is resolved.
See, I told you.
I told you they would fire him.
And Munira is standing here and heard me say that
Yes, Father, I did.
I heard them say it myself.
Please go, let me talk to your father alone.
Let me talk to your father.
He went to prison, we considered it a slip and forgave him.
We can't forgive him after he was fired.
Just because we're relatives,
You hear that.
Quietness
Insha'Allah, everything will be alright.
O Lord, guide us to the straight path.
I came to drink coffee.
I introduce you.
I feel bored.
I'll give you two weeks.
I swear he will take you by force to court for the divorce of his daughter.
Even if I go out
Why do you want to get into trouble?
But be careful.
Even if someone asks you,
Ignore him.
What is it that prevents him from fighting corruption?
Yes, it is.
It seems he doesn't know these days.
We want to hear it, at least once, please let us hear it.
No, it's good.
Are you police?
No, no, Mother, you didn't understand.
I asked him to speak on a radio show about a problem my relative had faced.
He was hesitant.
We felt he was hesitant because we talked to him in public.
So I suggested to my uncle that we go to his house and talk to him alone.
Did you feel that he agreed?
He was hesitant.
And leave.
Enough, enough, enough
I'll be sad and never talk to you again, did you hear that?
Are you Saleh Saad?
No, rather may God bless you, no more, I've quit this habit, praise be to God.
You have a very strong sense of responsibility.
The ideal employee
But unfortunately,
Even if I tried
Peace be upon you
"You didn't need to come, we were fine."
I was about to call the secretary to tell you not to come.
Shahin, what happened?
What I knew
Is there anyone in Qatar who doesn't know Saleh and his stance against corruption?
You are the righteous one known for preventing corruption.
Stop corrupting.
Yes, the job.
That there are no vacancies, you know.
Praise be to God, I didn't hire him.
Am I crazy to rent it here?
I went everywhere, Manira.
Not even one of them told me that there was a vacancy five minutes before I came, but they rented it out, I mean, they gave it to someone else.
My sister Aisha got divorced yesterday.
I'm responsible for them now.
I now have a great responsibility.
I don't know what to do.
He is currying favour with the minister.
But I didn't feel it was the right thing to do.
I'm afraid this man will take my place.
Enough, stop.
Who said I would be silent?
But I want it done in a way that doesn't affect me.
I'm thinking of a way to get rid of it.
He will finish it.
But how?
I know him.
Is he the one talking nonsense on the radio?
I'll bring him to your house.
And give him only the information.
You are loyal and patriotic.
A very enthusiastic citizen.
Thank you
I really left that.
I consider your voice the voice of truth.
Bu Fahd, I spoke with him.
Believe it or not, Saleh.
He says, "It's been a long time since we've heard him say, 'Stop the corruption.'"
He wanted to meet you.
This is natural, valid.
I am a servant in the tent.
Forward, forward, forward
You are one of a kind.
For you, your kind words.
Your words on the radio are better.
Let's hear "Enough corruption" once.
Oh, please, just one, he says, Boufahd, listen, listen, listen to him.
Stop corrupting.
This is the original, sir, this is.
Continue, I don't want you to stop.
I can't.
Then I resigned.
Although I want you to continue solving people's problems.
Leicester is reliable.
I'll give you one problem.
You are the voice of justice.
I want to talk to you alone.
He is a very important person.
You can't say no to him, you have to say yes.
Yes, correct.
This is your chance.
Opportunities don't come twice.
No, it's %pw.
Don't understand it.
Wait, brother, please.
From these issues and problems
My Lord Minister
The ministry ordered eight thousand tubes in its latest project.
The bear carries a dose of poison equivalent to one hundred and twenty cm of pressure.
But this employee
To approve the pipes that
Because he wants to take the balance.
Stop corrupting.
Thank you, thank you very much, Brother Saleh, for stopping corruption.
No, rather God's blessing be upon you.
This request is a special request.
I hope you hear it.
The final stations of corruption... Stop corruption.
You know
Necessity forced him to do that.
This is the last one.
Sultan was fired.
Did the minister dismiss him immediately?
He said: "Accurate information."
Now, Bou Fahad can do whatever he wants.
I'll do all the tasks.
Yes, sir.
Sure, Minister.
Goodbye
Stop corrupting.
It was definitely the last time, I won't do it again.
And here is my job application, sorry, I was joking.
They got what they wanted.
Listen to me.
Because he fears that one day
And to expose the evil of his deeds.
To denounce and expose corruption,
They fear you.
They tricked my sister Aisha and me.
You're kind.
Your uncle, Manira's father.
I assure you that I will find a job.
The people who criticize are stupid.
They are hateful, they despise our country.
Do we have any problems?
We don't have favoritism.
I haven't heard this word before.
In our government departments,
We don't have any bribes.
What we know
Employee
Does a foreigner get more than a citizen? No, never.
We produce everything locally.
The problem of belonging to a family, that's what we suffer from these problems.
If your manager or supervisor gets angry,
We are the best nation.
Our country is the best country.
Free me from any problems.
And thank you.
What did you say on the radio yesterday?
Mom, I want candy.
No candy until dinner.
So, no candy.
Why is your shirt torn?
Mom, Adoul and I were playing.
I know you were playing.
But what's bothering your shirt?
God is gracious to you, O believers.
Come and see what your mischievous nephew did.
I told you it was expensive, we don't need to buy it. You said, "It doesn't matter, it will look nice on Waleed."
See what he did.
The camera is now unusable.
That's why he's not afraid, no one can stop him.
Mom, where's the candy?
Look how he intended to tear it apart, clearly this is criminal intent.
Wael El-Faqir
He was happy to wear this shirt for the first time.
He will see him.
Where is Adol?
In the garden
Why, what happened?
Something between me and him.
Don't tear it.
Show some shame.
Don't argue with a child.
A child should not be allowed to do as he pleases.
It was not repaired.
Don't ask me to choose my words carefully.
Are you a repairman?
We will educate them.
Act yourself.
Don't argue with him.
Why are you fighting like boys?
Stay away from this matter.
Don't interfere.
Tell him to raise his children well.
It's a child.
You can't distinguish between a child and a man because you're crazy.
You know
You are not to blame.
Let's go upstairs.
What they deserve
We're wasting our time responding to them.
What should not be
Where people loved each other.
Alright, alright, I'm coming, goodbye.
But sir, some files require your signature; the minister wants to see them.
Alright, I'll talk to the minister, no need to worry.
I saw the disaster, the disaster.
It's new, oh wow! Aisha
This is not a child's action.
You are right.
This man ruined the clothes.
Look, look
This is unwearable.
Look at Adol's pants, one leg can be worn, the other will be exposed.
It's clear that this was torn by hand.
It appears to have been torn using a power saw.
I only say that God is the best Master.
I'll tell you.
Who wants candy? Come on.
I know as well.
If you know, take a tour around the villa.
I love you, not just because you know how to ride a bike,
Also because of something else
Telling the truth is right.
Alright, do you want candy?
Yes, I want two.
I'll give you four pieces.
Who took our clothes out of the closet?
How did your father cut them?
He has a big pair of scissors that can cut even a car.
Under the bed, take all the candy.
What is this event?
No one else can do such a thing.
Why should we be silent?
The most important
We insist on what we say.
It was Walid, the child, who took off the clothes.
Which computer?
What is he talking about?
Those cracks are impossible for a child to make.
Why don't you believe me?
Go and find your friends.
Give me a second.
You're always like this.
Oh my son, fighting every day, oh!
The past days
"I seek forgiveness from Allah and pray for his health."
"O Allah, guide me."
Who can carry such large scissors?
You go and find friends.
You're a liar, mom.
He went and brought the big scissors.
Act, man! Sultan, hurry up!
Come and let's solve this problem, come my son.
How will I start?
Each one of you
You are parents.
A child is born.
When a child is born,
You are my brothers.
Listen to me and make up with each other.
Alright, tell me, what will you do now?
Alright, I stripped them naked.
It's nothing compared to the disaster he caused. All my papers and information are gone. He destroyed everything.
I won't let him go.
He speaks in a very formal Arabic, like that used in museums.
Ignore him.
He will knock until he gets tired and leaves.
He's crazy, my brother and I know him well.
And your handshake.
He is full of hatred and envy.
He's mad because I broke the computer.
Ohhhhhhhh
Salman, beat him, beat, beat.
Fear God, O my children.
Strike, strike, [silence] be careful, [silence]
Take your cousins and play with them outside.
"O Allah, guide me."
O Allah, send blessings and peace upon Muhammad.
Adult men
Something to leave for the children.
Alright, Mom.
Your brother, Abdurrahman
Maybe the last time, oh! My son.
You know he's the older brother, oh! Girls
He knows how to talk to people.
And the argument
Don't be annoyed with me.
I'm supposed to
Plays a role
"O Allah, guide me."
Even you have become like them, my son.
Mom, they hit my son, a conspiracy against us, she says, %pw, stay away.
Go away.
There's blood coming from my son.
You ashamed us, children.
It was the children who were throwing them.
He doesn't want to believe.
I saw them.
We told him they were children, but he didn't believe us.
He said from his window.
He saw children throwing stones and from a distance, he thought they were adults.
I am not crazy.
Launch!
Perhaps you are tired or dizzy.
Do you know who they are?
And they tell me they're throwing stones.
They do.
Oh my God! Dear
I'm telling you to go home and rest. They signed a promise. What more do you want?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
This, oh God, my God
O Allah, be our helper against our enemies.
Oh my mother, oh my mother
All this is because of you.
Because you
Your men, but they act like children, like sick minds.
Take me to the hospital, I'm going to faint, I'm going to die.
Yes, and this isn't the first time I've seen him.
And I noticed that he never took his eyes off you.
What is recorded in the business subject.
But he has been studying with us for a week.
It's clear that he wants to know you badly.
Don't be like that, he loves you so much. Don't be so reserved.
No, my sister.
What I want is for him not to think I'm easy.
I ran after him.
Let's keep it casual.
Now he's running after you, eager to know you.
It's true that I love him too.
But, I don't feel it's the right time.
One hundred percent
She saw you and *
Ugh, waiting for her to come up and say, "Sorry, can I introduce myself?"
Take the initiative.
You are right.
But I'm waiting for the right opportunity.
The right opportunity
What are you waiting for, you're enrolled in the same class as her.
What did the teacher say?
Please ask her, Miss.
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh
We've been exchanging glances for three months.
But you don't recognize each other.
You are too big.
This means you have to go and say, "Excuse me,
Can I get to know you?
What is this to some extent
I'm waiting for the right opportunity.
A quiet and polite girl.
I don't know what you want.
We finished filming all the episodes yesterday.
Yes, of course.
Never forget us.
As long as I am free.
To buy the villa behind our villa for Wael.
Tomorrow, when he gets married, he won't live far from us.
What's the use now?
You're late.
I didn't know.
I saw it empty a few days ago, who bought it?
And they bought it through a housing loan from the Development Bank.
O Allah, send prayers, peace, and blessings upon his household.
Hello, hello, my son, good morning.
Open, start the engine.
Thank you, my son, may God reward you.
Hello Nora, come on out, the car is running now, come, I'll take you.
Peace be upon you too.
What do you want?
The two neighbors are talking to each other. What do you want?
Leave us alone.
The two neighbors are talking to each other, you are not compatible.
A gentleman parked his car behind mine, I can't get mine out.
So, if you don't mind, give me your car keys.
Even the car key
I'll leave you with this Titanic mood.
See you.
Goodbye
Now you know a lot about me.
I only know that you are Waleed.
Wael Rashid Abdullah
Make sure that when they hear your father's name, many people will think you are the son of the famous actor.
The same name, God willing.
In fact, my father is Rashid Abdullah, the actor.
Is Rashid Abdullah, the famous actor, your father?
You're eating cookies! Why didn't you eat dinner with them?
Tell me,
How did you know that the famous actor Rashid Abdullah is our neighbor?
Ah, yes
My friend at university, I know them, told me that.
He loves his acting, and has only watched his own works.
In the end, we live next to a famous and beneficial person in the community.
My heart, O happiness
He's very nice, he has a sense of humor.
And his son is a good man, he helped me, may God reward him well.
It is said that
Do you know what?
Do you know why I want to take a picture with him?
Oh mom, talk to my uncle Abuud.
I can read an interview with him in the newspaper.
He said they would make a series about diving.
You lucky thing, he brought you lamb, a gift of a new villa.
He proved to be a good neighbor.
Hello Saleh, any news?
In fact, we have a lot of names.
They told me, O Abu Sa'd, may God bless you, my name is on the (list).
That will be determined according to the needs and experience of the staff.
What we know
We may not transfer you.
Sorry, I won't be able to help you.
Thank you
We wanted to move and settle first, then when God blesses us with money, we'll buy furniture.
I did the right thing.
Yaaah! This is Ali.
Don't consider me a stranger.
Whatever you need,
I'm ready to help.
Neighbors for discussion
But now I heard and saw.
This is good, God willing, you are an expert in furniture.
So I'll go with you.
Don't be afraid, my sister.
Whenever you want to choose the furniture, let me know.
My love, your father applied for a loan, if approved, we'll change all the furniture.
And I repeat it again,
Feel free to ask me anything.
We're like family now.
Your sister can't study without your help.
But I want her to be independent.
I'm sure you were talking to her!
Do you want me to lie and say she's my friend?
Oh my son! Oh Ali
I don't have any problem.
As long as she loves me and I love her, I'll solve the problem.
You are dreaming.
Let me suggest my aunt to you.
Leave it to me.
As you wish.
They will reject you.
We will see.
Good night.
Good night
What's the news, Abu Ali?
Oh brother, the car broke down.
Sometimes it bothers me.
My daughter, God bless her, has a lecture.
And this car is always breaking down.
Your daughter is our daughter.
What matters
No need to trouble yourself, my brother Rashid.
May God not sanctify your hands.
The car is parked in the yard, and the driver is sitting idle.
It seems the development bank bought you a house and a car.
It's not our car.
Our neighbor Rashid Abdullah's car.
I see that relationships are evolving.
We will discuss matters of mutual interest that benefit both parties.
Oh my God, this is a huge development.
They set off.
Oh, Mom, this is embarrassing.
I agreed.
She said that Nora was like her daughter, and that the driver would take her to university every day.
Did you tell her that my father's car will be under maintenance for a week?
I swear, no.
She said the driver would take her every morning.
"God is witness, O Mother of Ali."
They are good people.
No, no, no! Oh, a man!
There is no initiative nor power except from God.
Oh no, oh no, what is this?
What should I do, I have responsibilities.
Who will take my daughter back to university?
Oh my god!
We cannot refuse your request.
Bu Saad, Bu Saad
I'm sorry, Bu Saad.
Bu Ali knows how much we love him.
Thank you, may God reward you with good, O Abu Sa'd.
They love you, God willing.
This is one sweet.
Oh people! Mr. Rashid is busy, leave him alone.
Sorry, sorry, Mr. Rashid, if we wasted your time.
I don't have a problem.
You're so lucky, you have good connections.
We are your friends and brothers, take care of us when we need something.
Tell me where you want it to be, I'll bring it to you.
What happened, what makes you cry, why do you drag me?
You want to suggest Manal to me.
Agree, Mother, agree.
Manal talked to her mother about me.
Why don't you believe?
Umm Waleed
Bow dresses, do you have a party?
I don't understand.
God willing, Waleed will get married soon, my eyes are my eyes.
She called me, oh my God.
She's taking some accessories.
Not accessories! Jewelry.
This is my mother.
You will also travel in a sleek vehicle.
Insha'Allah, Insha'Allah
God willing, I can't meet you.
This is the kindness of a mother and father.
In addition to all this, the car gave you
With the driver.
If I went with you on this trip, they wouldn't believe that this poor man is the king's husband.
Oh God!
Will you go in these clothes?
No! No, no, no, no, no, don't worry.
I'll change my appearance, you won't be able to recognize me.
They will be surprised when they think I am a sheikh.
Get him coffee, it'll extend his life.
Bu Ali, I didn't know you. I thought you were an important person, but you're not Bu Ali. You're not Bu Ali.
What do you think?
He even walks differently.
May God bless you, the people to whom we are applying for Aliya.
Important figures
I arranged everything from Eyal's hats to the car.
I'm sure I'll find it with you.
In the latest series, in which you played the lead role
There was an action, as I remember, a wedding.
You were wearing a shiny black bisht.
And I also want you to teach me how to wear a bisht.
Because, please, I've never worn a coat in my life.
Inshallah, you look great.
Like this, even when you enter the guest room.
This is not correct.
My brother Rashid,
Do you have cufflinks?
Peace be upon you
"He who doesn't leave me and Khalid."
Therefore
You are my child.
We are a family now.
And we don't want our daughter Nora to be far from us.
Nora suits Waleed.
He told me that he sees her at university and that he won't find a better wife than her.
We are lucky for this.
I'll tell her father, and God will make a way.
Why did they reject him, why?
Because he is an actor-father.
Ask your father to come.
Soon, tell him Rashid wants to see you.
Where are you, my God!
I'm crying from sadness.
Because he is an actor's son.
Why aren't you ashamed?
I am an actor.
But I act honestly.
I perform my role on stage for a few hours, and my role ends.
When the play is over.
You're role-playing.
I do
I carry a useful vision.
But you
I wear costumes to play roles.
On the stage
But you
I wore it in the guest rooms.
The role of the rich and wealthy woman.
Who is the actor?
Who is the real actor?
Don't be sad, Waleed.
Lift your head up.
It's an insult.
You missed the scene.
I heard her scream at him, "Don't turn your face, don't turn your face, may God lose him, he broke my heart."
And walk straight.
Like a horse.
It's Thursday, oh my God, man, Thursday.
It's Thursday.
His wife is crazy.
She envies other women.
That's why he walks like that.
So that he may not see women, and no woman may see him.
See how his wife drives him crazy.
Straight, do not turn your face away.
I'll expose him in the office tomorrow.
Thursday, please, show them the city center.
Thursday, show me the city center.
What's your wife's name for the mall?
Oh Thursday
I'll go see what Salem wants.
May God compensate him.
When will you change!
If you heard what they're saying about you
Even my elders say more than this.
Why are you doing this?
She envies the women around me.
Why are you so jealous?
If I sometimes sit in front of the TV
She, she
I swear by God.
No, no, it's good.
Hello, peace be upon you sister
Look at this talk.
I just spoke to her, right in front of you, I heard a man's voice.
I swear, sometimes I just throw my clothes in the street.
Respect yourself and divorce her.
I find it difficult to divorce her.
No, no, no, no, no
Don't come near me, stay there.
See what's on your mind!
There's nothing.
Who are you talking to?
You're wasting your time with these good-for-nothing people.
Especially this fat person, he is the one I hate the most among your friends.
Those with full faces and hair like children's plants.
This rude person has no shame.
You want to torture me in my grave.
Let me talk to her.
Tell me, what's the matter with you?
Who are you talking to!
I don't see anyone here.
Salim, what happened! What's wrong with you!
Our friend Khamis is crazy.
After a while, he faced the wall and started talking to himself.
Collapsed
Khamis is a poor man.
He always imagines his mother and imagines talking to her.
God is sufficient for His wife.
They say Thursday is with you.
He is busy now, receiving an international call, so far away, even the call drops.
What does the letter say?
God bless you, Khamees.
Why are you awake!
I don't sleep, I can't sleep.
Regarding tomorrow's meeting
With the women's delegation at the ministry
Is it possible for you to
"O Allah, guide Khamees."
These names were selected by the Office of the Minister.
But, come here
Why are you afraid of her?
If you're talking to Salem, why are you saying then!
Tell the truth.
Why are you hiding behind the water tank like this?
Several
I saw the number you were given, read it, it's with you.
The last number!
Enter the last digit after removing the number of the woman you were talking to.
Tell me, what's her name!
I told you, I told you, I told you.
I told her that I was talking to Salem.
My friend at work, Saloom.
You didn't believe me.
What are you wearing?
Are you going on a diving trip?
I swear to God, brother, you didn't let me change my clothes.
Who do you want me to call?
Call my wife.
Call my wife.
Tell her, brother! Give me the %pw, pen, call, I'll give you the number.
They help each other.
You men are always like this.
You're a liar, I'll show you.
If you interfere again, I'll go to the minister's office.
Cursed me
And she threatened me that she would complain about me to the minister's office.
She is truly brave.
She plans to destroy my career.
My mistake was that I heard you and called her.
Listen, Thursday.
She suspected me at the minister's office.
I'll go with you and tell the whole truth, get me out of this case.
This has nothing to do with me.
You are a coward.
Sisters and brothers
Good morning, everyone.
I'm delighted by your presence at the meeting.
Where is the rest?
Fled
Where is Thursday?
He's coming.
Turn off your mobile phone.
Alright, don't turn it off, leave it in the office.
The meeting is only for one hour.
This is not my phone.
The war began.
Oh my God, he has been with you since that day.
Where can he go?
He can't go.
And since that day, his stance has not changed.
Jealous, jealous of the women around him.
This is not envy.
He sits alone here in the living room at night.
He says she is my mother.
Mother! Mother has died.
So he called on me, to find a solution for me.
I asked you to move to the section with women.
Is it a military decision?
Look at the signature, it's very clear at the bottom.
Brother, sorry, I've been transferred to the Social Welfare Department.
Welfare office! Are you sure they transferred you there?
Why are you strange?
Thank you, may God keep you.
Are you Mrs., sorry, Mr. Khamees?
The minister's office called and informed us.
Have you been to your new department?
Who's with you in the office?
Article, Saleem, Jasim,
Wow! The minister decided to transfer you yesterday.
And you just moved to the new department today.
I explained to you my problem with my family.
The minister decided to transfer you.
Therefore, I must go to the minister.
He started his annual vacation today.
He will return after a month and a half.
What is this torment?
If you want my opinion,
The minister will give you the same speech.
Work there until we find you another place. This time they transferred you because many people told him about your problem with your wife.
I'm telling you the truth.
And what he did!
Don't talk if your wife calls.
What you don't know, they might obey you, beg them.
I asked them to put the abayas in the car, I put them in a box for you.
How much?
I had put ten as you are five in the office, meaning two people each.
It seems he is very afraid of his wife.
Imagine if they gave us male names.
They call me Abdul Qadir.
His name
He is kind and handsome, that's why she fears another woman might love him.
In the name of God, what's wrong with her?
Who called me?
Oh Abdulqadir, the one inside Hassan, behind Khalil.
Here are the abayas, each one can choose what they prefer.
Look at this.
How much is this?
What's wrong? What happened?
Sorry
Where is the social welfare office?
There are supposed to be five employees.
What's your name?
I am handsome.
I am crazy, my wife drove me crazy.
I am crazy.
You laid out the project before us.
And he met them.
What did they say?
They said.
Illuminated, prepare tea.
I can't.
Do you want me to go back to the kitchen and ruin my appearance?
Go now, and make us some tea.
Oh, hello, nonsense.
Walk and listen to what the men say.
Don't forget that we are the Scorpion clan.
Go, get me tea without sugar, go, go, go!
The bank said the project was good.
I called him several times, his phone was busy.
How unfortunate, they waited for us for a while.
It's my brothers as usual.
One of them took a month off, traveled three months ago, and hasn't shown up.
God is Generous, Goodbye.
And all changes are in our favor.
For us
Yes, but if you build a garden
It will accommodate a number of villas, not less than two or three.
The park is a place of rest for the residents of the complex.
Men don't need women's opinions.
Keep it to yourself.
Put the tea and go.
There is no garden.
Just a moment.
Sister, you know I love football.
If your uncle and brothers found out you were playing it at school, they would kill you.
What are you planning, to kill yourself?
See, I told you.
I suggest you forget about it.
You're only hurting yourself.
No, no, no, I'm angry with you.
I was busy.
Forgive me, you are our blessings.
Oh, look who's here.
Inshallah
This is Thursday.
Grew up
I became an adult.
I'm tired of looking for a woman for him, I didn't find one.
I come from a family with deep roots.
You know,
Leave the matter of his marriage to me.
Is this from the HR department?
Yes, God willing, your life will be long.
Set it aside.
I have some remarks on his suggestions.
Alright, may God grant you a long life.
Something else
No, it may give you a long life.
I'll take care of them and I'll meet them when I find the time.
What did you do about the employees I sent you yesterday?
What's the problem?
I'm leaving now, I'll call you later.
What happened?
You're crazy.
We are your older sisters.
And we suffered from them.
Do you know they asked me what you play at school?
I told them you play table tennis.
Praise be to God, they didn't kill you.
That was just an appetizer.
Do you know who we are?
Our roots
You know what this means.
This time we broke your face.
Scorpion Leader
Small scorpion
Oh uncle, let me slap his face.
That was enough.
Save it for next time.
You've changed your mind! You didn't say you wanted architecture.
You're crazy.
A Scorpio's daughter cannot work in the streets with men.
Engineering and Construction
You will disappoint us.
Let me hit her head.
No, neither a sultan nor anything else.
Sure, Scorpio Chief.
Fatoum defeated him.
Let your brother have his chance, Falcon.
This is a shame.
It's a good thing, at least you got a slap in the face.
Show my face.
Why do they want you to go with them tomorrow morning?
What do they want?
Come here.
Walk in front of me.
Where are we going?
What does the word say?
Where are we going?
I told you to shut up, don't say a word.
Write the education.
Or even care, we don't care.
What else do you want?
You have two options.
So you know we're open-minded.
Don't say we didn't warn you.
Nursing, or education
I go
Bring us a copy of the request.
Go!
Scorpion Master, oh my God, my son.
The big ant itself offered you.
Thank you, Uncle! But when is the engagement?
Miss Manira
What you ask for is difficult.
I can't travel, oh! Abu Khalid
I have personal circumstances.
Recommended by the minister
It's difficult.
Think about it again.
Don't decide now, think until tomorrow.
How do they let you work!
That's why they say nothing.
I have a suggestion.
Ask one of them to travel with you.
Girls shouldn't travel.
This is nonsense.
What shame!
You should feel grateful that we allowed you to go to work.
Go tomorrow and tell them you can't travel.
Shut up, don't argue.
Listen and be silent.
Thursday, the son of scorpions
He is from us and we are from him.
He's a fool and he has no qualifications.
But it's a spider.
What should I do, my sister?
What should I do, Fatima?
I am weak and bankrupt.
What can I do?
I can't do anything.
What can you do?
The appointment is next Monday.
I'll call you to let you know when the sheikh arrives.
What a beautiful laugh!
Go and get some new fingers.
Go and get some fingers, son.
I love this laughter.
Oh brother, please.
I won't sell you a word.
Prepare us tea, coffee, and cake.
Oh, how lucky! Aisha, you are now the minister's friend.
I'm afraid it's a rumor, oh! Abu Khalid
Manar was nominated to be a minister in a new ministry within the new ministerial structure.
Mounira deserves all the best.
I hope this isn't a rumor.
Are you going to work tomorrow?
And we must all cooperate to serve this country.
Through the efforts of each one in their place, thank you.
I wish you all success.
Thank you, Your Excellency
Thank you, Your Excellency
Thank you
Hello, please come in.
Peace be upon you
Yes, with soap as you requested.
He is the overall supervisor of the women's football league.
Ask him about Fatima's playing.
Inshallah
Captain Fatima scored two goals like professional players.
Captain Fatima is talented, brothers.
Captain, what do you think of Fatima's play?
She is a good forward player.
You're going to travel to China.
Captain, isn't China a bit far?
God willing, may He bless you.
Your sister will play an important game.
She was studying education, but today I went and asked to have her transferred.
You will study architecture.
What is the difference between a man and a woman?
Really? Go and serve the coffee.
Where are you going?
I'm tired of waiting.
Stupid, are you stupid?
Go, and tell your mother you've been expelled.
Go!
O donkey!
The coffee in the pot you have has gotten cold.
They won't charge you for a whole year, but once they know you have a chain, they'll charge you.
Hello, how are you, how are the kids!
What did you tell her?
I told her she would be with us in the series.
Sure, she is the main character.
See Ali Shawal, he will play the role of Nawaf.
There's something called makeup, which can make her look younger.
Mary's role is limited to six or seven episodes.
To benefit from Saul.
He's going to give us endless lectures.
I'm afraid he looks annoying.
The most important thing is that the producing company doesn't know about you and Hamed.
I hope I'm not late.
And Rashid is here too.
That the director and actors are ready.
To save time, people, let's start the meeting.
Tell us what you think.
Hamad, do you want to say something?
Frankly, I think she's the best.
Find out when the maid committed suicide.
You know the part that affects me the most.
When the maid committed suicide.
When she hung herself from a fan, spun around, and bled to death.
She found him and cried over him, it's touching.
And he kept kicking her until he reached the courtyard of the house.
It is excitement.
The police come, search the house, and arrest the mother.
It's really a great series.
I had finished the series here on this table.
It's really an extortion of the artistic conscience.
Social
All of them are about extraordinary events.
"She who does not believe"
Seventy cases of murder.
And what about crying?
You are known for obstructing people.
It's a good thing, Mr. Hamed, let's be open.
Let's take a majority vote.
Mr. Nasser, don't claim openness and use the majority as an excuse, this doesn't work with critical assessment of artistic production.
You're involved in this because of your government job.
Goodbye
I heard the doorbell ring.
He was an Indian carrying a bag in his hand.
He asked me, "Are you Ms. Hessa?" and I replied, "Yes."
I opened the suitcase.
It was a ring worth around seventy to eighty thousand.
I'm afraid the Indian man brought these things by mistake.
No, not by accident.
It's Samira.
Hamed's wife, the supervisor at the company.
It's a gift from her to you, may God bless you with it.
Yes, it's yours.
The ring is a very luxurious ring.
I never dreamed of owning such a ring.
Blessings upon you, my dear Hessa.
Yes, that's it, I call it the chain of blessings.
Ali and Hamed own the production but they are employees there, they can't present it under their names.
We won't take more than the ring.
Don't share this with anyone, keep it between you and me.
Am I crazy to do that?
Your inspiring husband
The one called the magician
Only five percent, it's a small amount.
No, this is good, if they agree to four million for them.
Your husband earns 200,000 riyals, that's good.
I think we'll give the college girl role to Nadia.
A great role, you love a man and run away on a bicycle.
The series we're producing is called "Extortion of Conscience."
They talked to me about the role in the series.
I really want to know.
Gulf series are always like this, the trend of blackmail this year.
Alright, tell my courage, what's my role?
You too, my dear, your turn is guaranteed.
Don't embarrass me.
Jay, Jay, now
I made all this breakfast, don't just walk away and leave me.
This is Omar, the manager's secretary.
"O Allah, protect us."
I wasn't asked to meet him at this time of day.
He told him it would be a weak and silly chain.
Don't waste your money on him.
Okay, so what happened next?
God protects me, what should I say, I'm afraid Rashid told them something about the series.
Don't be afraid.
Leave it to me.
A person with a sick mind.
Social chain
I saw this on TV.
May God not lengthen your life.
The series on TV now is called "Blackmailing a Young Flower."
But, I think the budget they're asking for is too high.
You need a large budget.
But don't forget that the producing institution is local.
We need to support him.
What matters
Have you read the arts page?
We heard they'll start filming the series "Conscience Decay."
And a huge budget is allocated to it.
But, it was said that the series was weak.
Others said the series consisted of a school teaching corruption.
It's possible they'll stop filming.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
Hello. Please sit down.
Good morning
Good morning, welcome.
I'm Monir. I'm a journalist, and I have an appointment with Mr. Hamed, if you don't mind.
Oh, okay, please sit down for a bit, as there's a meeting.
Mercury, this will allow us to use a design for the universe.
By the way, we will reach out to all the world's correspondents to get in touch with us.
This is your task.
Mercury Production Company
And discusses its issues in a manner that places it among the best productions in world history.
Do you believe who wrote this?
He has no shame.
Do we have a journalist like this?
Do we have a journalist like this?
A journalist must have a moral sense.
They work.
Do you think they're here?
I met the Minister, do you know what he told me?
It's very tragic and its facts are extraordinary.
The first episode is tomorrow, we'll watch it with people.
What do you see, Mother?
It's normal, Mom, it's just the first episode.
Have you seen people talking to themselves, except in Gulf series?
Also, have you seen a mother who wants to kill her children, except in your soap operas?
Oh my son! Art is a matter of taste, not strange cases that you generalize about people and society.
Oh Mother, it can be done in Fine Arts, but Drama is completely different.
Don't give me a headache.
It seems they are imitating the Turkish people.
Don't judge yet, watch at least the first five episodes.
This series is a failure.
We cannot allow our children to watch it.
What is this limit, brother?
There are worse shows, and you watch TV.
In fact, not anyone.
You are the reason.
For the public, in every house.
Go and get the people who understand these dimensions and hidden lines.
And they were informed of it.
It is not ours.
Tell me, what happened?
The minister passed by with some guests.
I stood up to greet him.
We agreed to produce the series.
How will the minister like this?
Alright, let's hear Nasser's opinion.
My colleague wrote that.
I only publish messages that say something good about the series.
No, no, don't worry.
Read tomorrow's newspaper and I will publish praise messages from me, and I will mention that the viewers sent them.
Inshallah
It will make you happy.
This year
Alright, if they had an agreement with him.
It's the best series in the history of Gulf drama.
They are all in agreement with them.
Alright, let's say they all have a deal with them.
I will only read the translations.
I wish they would rerun the series Extortion of Conscience.
Thank you, Minister of Arts, for this series.
I hope they re-air it.
When the Ministry of Interior contacted me for the first time
To come and collect the final installment of money from the series.
They were right to call you the wizard.
That wasn't everything.
Lucrative profits and we took our money.
And the chain also failed.
The writer himself told me that he regrets writing it.
I'm here to propose the second part of the series.
The minister believed the trick that was made for the press.
He believed in the illusory success we created.
He is not satisfied with the series.
This means that it is impossible for him to agree to the second part.
I assure you that the minister himself will request a second part.
I can't
Say "Thank you"
To all people
Who worked on this series?
Congratulate them on their success.
They all deserve it.
In fact, winning those prestigious festival awards
Proves that
This is what you believe.
You are inspiring.
You will win the gold prize.
What was he saying?
He said: "If the readers and the press lie to me."
Yes, why not have a second part?
As long as Arab and Gulf TV festivals are artistic whitewashes.
Art wash!
I've heard about money laundering.
Not art
Illegal money
The serials are identical.
What can we do with "one two"?
What do you want to say?
We didn't sign a contract with them; they should comply.
Write it.
Our products are exported worldwide, bread in all its types and shapes, flat, large, small, triangular, and diverse.
What did we agree on in the contract?
Two million dollars
What did you do with the Australian baker?
He is the inventor of bread.
Has anyone told you about his product?
No, they just told me it was bread, but I don't know what's in it.
Buzzard bread
You call it a zipper.
Instead of cutting bread (samon) as you call it = semolina bread.
The inventor tried to make it easy.
Genise bread
This is the secret.
I ate bread with the zipper.
These people make very strange things.
This button is amazing, it's made in such a way that once it's put in the mouth, it dissolves.
It can have different flavors: strawberry, ketchup, coffee.
You know how much I've invested in this project.
Three million dollars, with patents.
Enter! Oh! Sorry.
Yes, Abu Nasser.
Yes, sir, I am at your service.
I delivered it today, sir.
Tell him "Oh! Forgive me."
I was with your son Nasser yesterday, playing football in his team.
I agreed with him.
To form his team of drivers and security men,
It's also an incomplete team, we only have one goalkeeper, if he gets injured we'll be in trouble.
I'm supposed to have fans too.
When I took seventeen players,
I didn't say anything.
The important people in the company.
Indispensable ones
The hospital's pastry shop.
Why are you bothering the man?
I told him he couldn't, he's from a well-known family, he can't run after a ball and humiliate himself.
He is able to do what he wants.
But don't take the necessities.
What can I do, Mama? My team has a match and I need four players.
No more excuses.
Okay, whatever happened, happened.
Hamidi didn't come to work today, sir.
I went with him.
He said, "Put on your clothes."
And they would let me stand in the goal area.
The match started.
Then I didn't feel anything.
They told me the ball hit me while I was distracted.
Have you ever worked as a goalkeeper?
I only played because Nasser asked me to play.
"There is no power or strength except from Allah."
We're tired of your love for football.
From now on, oh! Nasser
No ball.
You need to disband your team.
All bakers should return to their bakeries.
What do you think?
Open, it is
I don't want to hear anything.
O Allah, O Helper
Listen to what he wants to say.
Alright, I will, just because you asked me to.
Speak, what did you want to say?
Tomorrow, we will play the last match of the tournament.
Don't make him angry, ya Bou Nasser, please, I beg you.
Alright, come on! Guys
Congratulations, congratulations
Sweet, sweet, sweet, congratulations.
Oh, Mr. Nasser! I just want to speak with you for one minute.
Thank you, my team was on time today.
Mr. Nasser, we must
You promised us a party.
Do you want me to call and book a room at the hotel?
Invite the press and journalists to go there.
No way! Rashid, we'll get it at our house.
So that my father doesn't cancel it when he sees the players and their success.
They won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup.
I hope so.
No, no, I saw him taking pictures with the players and he was talking to them with the press.
It seems that Sami, the sports page editor, is interviewing him.
Photographic image
Leave it close to me.
Take a good shot.
He is happy.
Your comment on your children's, the bakers', victory made them
High spirit
And the effort
Loyalty to the bakery
Sorry, Abu Nasser, we saw the team playing with a 4-4-2 formation.
Loyalty to the baker's plan and the coach.
Thank you, Uncle Bo Nasser.
Blessings upon you.
Hello, goalkeeper.
The league and cup will bring journalists to interview you.
No, she is not a member of the National Assembly.
They sent their representative to conduct the interview.
They brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought the cup.
You know, we encourage young people.
I expect a bright future for them.
Yes, goodbye.
Insha'Allah, your phone will always ring, and your pictures will be in the newspapers. You're lucky with this ball.
Do you know who was talking to me on the phone?
He reduced the price of the engines, said: "Okay."
Yes, I've become famous now. Under every picture of me in the newspapers, they write: "The first baker athlete."
Were you interested in soccer?
What do you mean?
Since I was in school
The person who sat next to me loved football.
He says he wasn't close to football.
Since the person next to me plays football, I am close to football.
My closeness to sports means that I am an athlete.
So we haven't become a global village yet, but we've become global football.
I heard him say yesterday that he would build a sports club.
And today we meet the first athlete at the International Bakeries, Bo Nasser.
To improve football
Before the match, tell us your predictions before heading to the theater.
The match is tough today.
The team that controls the midfield will win today.
Yes, if God wills, we will reach out to professional player agents to develop the International Bakery Team.
His name is Saud, listen, we want a commitment.
(Ah, he wants the previous deal for the players)
That was useless.
When I gave you the prices
I gave them the international exchange rate.
So, isn't the Gulf part of the world?
Of course not.
This is none of your business.
You just have to let me know when a buyer from the Gulf comes.
Open your fax line.
Two of them are defenders, one is a midfielder, and the other is a center player.
Look, these four players
Three of them cost.
$200,000 per player
Take them all in one bundle.
It will be six hundred thousand. I'll give it to you for five hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Well, this is about African players, and now, for the Brazilian player.
He's the player of the season, costing one million two hundred thousand dollars.
They quoted me this price but then I received a fax, I'll show it to you, it's right here. Wait, look, look, I received it from a club in the UAE.
The decision is yours.
Thank you
God willing, he will lose his leg.
How are you?
Knee, knee
My knee is fine.
We don't want to be cheated, I hope there are no cross-links.
Ohhhhhhhhhh
What is this interconnected muscle?
Welder! Make a maftah (rice and meat, a traditional dish).
Frankly, you're lucky to have Brazilian and African players, congratulations, congratulations.
Thank you
To the store, the store.
Oh God, hopefully, you have another business.
No, no, no, only the players.
I see them unloading the boxes.
Young players! Yes, we want them, from the forests of Africa.
Yes, why this?
Karim, open the box for him.
He is a human being like any other human being.
A young man said, "Didn't you hear him?"
He said they were young.
As long as we
Why don't you give us this little boy as a free gift?
Listen, Abu Nasser, if you take care of him and raise him well, it will be in your best interest later.
And they go and release him in the playground.
Come, come, come, come
Be easy on him, he's young.
Put it in the annex, let him raise it.
Don't hesitate if you need anything, all the players are with me.
Your trainer must understand.
We won 2-0, we dominated the game.
Father, he is the coach of Spain.
What I love
Successful coach
He must control the game.
And this, the opposite, is the way to Al Wakrah.
We shouldn't let your coach do as he pleases.
He spent less than two months with the team.
We must put an end to this.
If he were an expert in football, he would activate the corner players and not attack from the center.
Yes, I rely on the offside trap.
Oh mother, don't give me a headache.
Kakuno Malawee must be fired.
And replace it with Shinamo Hababo Hitawala Hatawa Hawa.
No, no, no, no, no, no, I don't want to play.
Shululu forgot his cigarettes. Damn it.
What line?
Implementing the plan
And he forgot Holo.
This is not supposed to happen between the coach and the team manager.
Man of the match, team star
Do you mean we're not soccer experts?
Listen, Sultan
Let him go home.
Don't take him in the bakery van, send him by taxi.
It's not your command.
Stay informed.
Did my father's actions make sense?
The coach was fired and sent back.
What is he doing?
The team is destroying.
Goodbye to our team.
Mama Mama
No, he's crazy. That means he told you he's divorcing you. Tell me the truth, what happened between you two?
From the very first day I saw him, I told your mother, I don't like this person.
I feel he is incapable of taking responsibility.
Forget the nonsense of talking about the past.
You must go to his father and find out why your daughter was divorced.
What am I saying, Brother Rashid!
Why did he divorce her then?
"This is injustice, Abu Abdullah. We know, we have the right to know, why did you divorce her?"
Please, don't interfere. It's none of your business.
How could I not interfere? The man is waiting in the hall to find out why his daughter was divorced.
She knows how to appreciate her husband and respect his feelings.
Who is Barcelona?
You're clueless. You don't know the Spanish league.
Barcelona is not a lady,
This is Guardiola's team.
That means I'm going now to the man who's waiting for me in the lounge.
If I go, I'll go. Okay, stay here and leave it to me.
You must leave and not nod your head.
It wasn't enough for her to curse Barcelona.
Messi, the football wizard, who scores a hat-trick in every match.
Maradona himself said that Messi would be better than him.
And your brash daughter mocks him. Listen,
Your daughter doesn't like Barcelona and doesn't suit us (a popular saying).
What do you want to say!
Listen, God may guide you.
What do you want with my son?
To apologize and to please her.
If only.
By God, we have a lot of money.
What's the point of our money, if we don't make our son happy?
Oh, stop.
Most importantly, I'll look for a Barcelona fan.
Oh mother, I am not angry.
She's crazy! Oh, son, stop thinking about her.
Drink your tea, son.
You know, son! They are the losers.
A thousand girls wish to marry you.
Drink up, son.
I feel sorry for her.
How unfortunate, she got divorced two days ago.
After only one month of marriage.
What did he do to you? Do you want me to intervene with him?
I don't want to get into trouble with him.
Who told you these illogical stories!
Don't believe her.
Do you know who he is?
You want more than this!
Her wealth only.
Remember the building I want to buy and turn into an apartment hotel.
Those in Mansoura.
It belongs to his father, and when my son marries your daughter, I will ask him for this building.
If you can't.
Talk to her brother.
Listen carefully,
A millionaire's son proposed to you.
Do you know what a millionaire is?
Opportunity doesn't come twice.
They are so rich that they bought a palace in Spain to spend every summer there.
"Okay, and the Barcelona story?"
The girl's family might have spread this rumor to prove her innocence.
Say that the story is true and that the man loves Barcelona and is loyal to the region of Catalonia.
His wife is supposed to respect that.
Do not mock the team.
Assuming this story is true.
God bless you, they called him Abu Al-Borjain because he had two towers on the corniche.
Design it in an odd way, like intertwined ropes.
When people see them from a distance, they think it's one tower.
As you wish, all the luck is yours.
%pw welcome
God bless you. Go on, take something, anything.
Thank you, my love.
But tell me, the light of my eyes, my son Abdullah, is waiting for your reply.
No, don't worry about the light of my eyes, Mother of Abdullah.
If I searched all the GCC countries, I wouldn't find anyone better than you.
Tell them to provide us with their estimates for constructing the building.
I'm done, is there anything else?
Oh, the family will call you.
"See their needs for marriage, prepare the check and I'll sign it."
In the name of God, God has commanded, in the name of God, God has commanded, with your permission, Your Excellency the Minister.
Abdullah is divorced too!
I wish for children from you and wealth from him.
God bless you, Auntie!
You wear it for the cold.
Oh, but I don't know where my mom booked us?
Where did you book us, Mama?
My mother says she booked us to Malaysia.
What's the problem with Malaysia, okay?
Safe journey.
What's wrong with you? Have you heard of anyone coming from their moon crying?
What's wrong with you, girl? Tell me.
Tell me what happened, my daughter.
Oh Mother, she's so arrogant.
Why?
She's ruthless, abandon her.
You did the right thing when you fired her.
I feel sorry for her.
This is her mother.
Why are you sad?
Did he chase her?
God bless you. Don't forget to bring us olive oil from Spain.
Oh, Spain. Where are we going?
Alright
My mother says she booked us to the Maldives.
Alright, alright. Oh! [Daughter] The Maldives are beautiful too.
And she will also entertain you.
I thought you would come back from your trip happy.
What annoys me is why did he take the boys?
Come! Take the bag.
What's wrong with them?
Why are you sad, my dear?
Shut up! May God give you health, you're going to tell me about my son's face.
Oh, my son! Why are you sad?
When I see the scales, I'll be depressed.
Oh! My child, may the one who bothers you die (a popular saying).
Forget her, divorce her, divorce her. Your father has a lot of money and there are many girls.
Be quiet, I know what's bothering my son. Why should he live unhappily!
Oh my son, call her and divorce her.
May God curse her mother.
Say it to her three times.
You're divorced. Wait, wait, don't hang up, two more times.
Divorced, divorced.
Very tense.
Oh my god!
Oh, problem.
Just because they saw you at the disco.
Call him, call him, let me talk to him.
Should I call him mama? "Divorce me," he said, "I divorce you, I divorce you."
Why did he divorce you? He has no shame.
Now if someone goes to a disco, what will they do!
And one if necessary %pw.
What's wrong with you! The world has gone upside down!
I'll go back home and mock him, and he won't know who you are.
Me, me, my daughter was divorced by Abdullah!
My daughter is divorced.
Your daughter is different.
You buy and sell them at Toys R Us stores.
Just as you feel the bad taste in your mouth now, you'll feel it for your daughter and be discouraged.
And they did nothing.
"She didn't bring you the apple peeled, divorce her."
You are free to divorce them however you wish.
She is still married to a man.
This suits you, let it go to hell!
I feel the same as I did to others.
What you would not accept for yourselves.
Don't accept it for people.
Do you know who owned the land this shopping center is on?
In a strategic location?
Leave it to God.
And also at a ridiculous price.
Closing for business.
I need to get Abu Sukkar's approval.
Yes, I went to his office and didn't find him.
I went to his office the week before and they told me he had traveled.
He has a meeting, come tomorrow, tomorrow afternoon, I'm off work, and the problem is I need to get Abu Saqr's approval, it's necessary.
Go to his office.
No, no, no, no, this is official business.
The right place for that, may God protect you, is the office, not the house.
Are you still eating?
What could make Abu Saqr happy?
Everyone has a key.
Tell me, Abu Fahd!
Do you know him?
What I know, I see on TV and you told me that you meet him in Umrah.
But we don't know each other well.
Cut the crap.
"O God, guide them, for they have come immediately. Ask them about the reason for this celebration at least."
"Masha'Allah, there is no power except from Allah."
The month is thirty days long, and he hosts fifty feasts.
I suggest, Your Honor, that you be put in the Guinness Book of World Records.
As the world's most prolific party organizer.
Okay, who's this brother with you?
Hello, this is a blessed time.
It's an honor to your honor.
Ah! Abu Flah
He says Abu Sakr gives a feast every day.
This is what we see.
But oh! Abu Falah, the dinner appointment tonight is for a special occasion.
Today, God protect you, your son Falcon.
God willing, they deserve it, Your Highness, congratulations.
He's here, welcome! Son.
Peace be upon you
Why?
For this occasion, my son Saqr should go to the agency tomorrow and pick up the car he wants.
I waited for approval for a year and a half.
I was out of work.
But when I got to him
And I gave him the money.
May God guide you, Abu Saad.
Things won't work this way.
I told him: "Sweet."
He must go to the exhibition and choose the car he likes.
We will buy three for him.
Take me to him!
They took me to him.
You told me you met him during Umrah last year.
Today, his youngest son is Shahin.
His game is banquets.
This is your chance.
He passed by and congratulated him.
He deserves to be well, sir.
"Wow, Abu Sakkar!%"
God bless you, thank you all.
Praise be to God that the falcon is well, Your Honor.
God bless you
By the way, who are you?
My lord, the judge.
You didn't recognize me.
I can't lie to you (like that).
Sir, I was with you on the Umrah last year.
And I remember you bought a red rosary.
God bless you.
I was in the hospital.
Visiting a relative
To be honored by meeting you.
So, Saker, you're still undecided about entering the business field or you've made your decision.
I'm tired of him.
Why, my son, is Souk Sakr nice?
Start, open an office, then see.
Abu Sakr,
Sir, please say yes.
Why?
I have a gift, a falcon.
Full floor
Even if trade loved you and came to you, you would say: No.
Who in the whole world is like you these days? Since you got the license, everything comes instantly, a free car and an office in the best location on the corniche.
Yesterday, Abu Abdul Aziz told your father that if Sakr wanted to join the business, I would make him a partner with a 50% share.
Oh mom, how can I balance between business and university?
Oh mother, don't force me to do something I don't like.
And you're lucky that agencies, offices, and cars are thrown at you for free.
It's an opportunity, son! Who can start a business at this time without capital?
Your only capital is people's love for your father.
Be smart and invest it.
Believe in me, son! This is your one chance in life.
Arouz, get ready for lunch quickly.
%Pw also reached the pickles and pepper.
He didn't leave anything, he didn't leave anything, I'm afraid he'll take the samosa agency.
Your son has a good appetite for work.
This is what I was looking forward to seeing. Do you know what he told me today?
He told me, "Mother, I want to expand my investments."
He wants to enter the Caribbean and invest in the islands there.
And perhaps Allah will ward off the evil eye from him.
Abu Sultan was telling me yesterday that your son has just entered the business field.
He has twenty agencies, six restaurants, and a stake in two banks.
Tra
I think, God knows best, that they haven't opened it yet.
Oh, what's in the northern area of our office?
No, but I love her.
Thank you and may God bless you, blessed be God, O Abu Said.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
God bless you all.
There's no use regretting now.
Look, Uncle! A whole year of suffering and hard work to get the supermarket ready.
What's the problem! I think he passes by the store every day.
He saw her and sent me his secretary, whose name is Samer.
This scoundrel, son of a scoundrel, told me he wants to be your partner instead of taking the store from you.
Does he also want to be your partner?
"There is no power or strength except from Allah."
You started talking to him, didn't you?
He asked me, "Who are you, my brother?"
I said actions!
Why did you tell him you had an Iranian bakery?
When we were walking past this bakery, there was a small sign. What was written on this sign, what name was on the sign?
I wrote to the neighborhood bakery.
No, I want another name.
Peace be upon you.
So, how are things going with you at work?
Well, sir, we hope to finish the workers' housing drawings for Future Company tomorrow or the day after.
No, no, Mr. Sakr, she is my wife, Elisa. Allow me to introduce you to Mr. Sakr, the owner of the company.
Hello, how are you?
Let her take one of the company cars.
Thank you very much, you're very kind.
Even cooking now is based on science and study.
Today, someone said I want to work in business, he has some money and wants to invest it.
But he doesn't have enough knowledge, understanding, or study of economics, or even business.
A person like this
Do you think he will succeed? I don't think so, he will waste his time and lose.
Did you hear, Abu Nasser!
Did you hear what these two parrots are saying?
What is this?
I took my son Falcon.
See it.
See him today.
Sir, we're not talking about your son, Saqr.
We're talking about the rule.
Your son, Falcon, may God grant him whatever he wants, exceptionally.
Thank you, he's talking about the rule.
I was worried about him, my son Falcon is building himself up on his own.
He once gave a car as a gift.
Sell it and invest the money based on his own advice.
And whatever Allah wills, behold it now.
Oh, nonsense! We're talking about ordinary people.
He burned one of them, and that's what Abu Nasser did to him, taking him and throwing him into the fire.
Sagar is talented in business.
Strong economic preferences.
We must ask who his father is.
I swear I'm amazed.
"What Allah has willed" or "Praise be to Allah"
Manie Bay Magazine in the Economic Referendum
Enter.
"Peace be upon you, welcome, welcome."
What's wrong with it?
I swear I don't know what to say, oh! Salem.
Yes, I remember.
The story was true.
They say the company sent a fax to my father.
And they said to him
God replace it for him, he can't bear it.
As you see.
They say that when he heard the news,
He fell in the office with the fax in his hand.
He had done him a great deal of good.
As they say, I was training him to shoot, and when he got strong, he shot me (like a target).
What did the doctor say?
Pray for him, O Salim.
I am shocked.
I can't believe there are people like that in this world.
A man gives to the poor without knowing that his left hand does not know what his right hand is doing.
The donations of this organization are delivered to all Muslims in Asia and Africa.
But I would also like you to explain to us your goals and future steps, God willing.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, our goal at the Saker Charity Association is to achieve solidarity in this nation.
In addition to sixty blankets for our brothers affected by the Pakistan earthquake.
Last but not least, we are now also supporting seven poor families.
With a monthly salary not exceeding one hundred and thirty riyals only.
We won't be late.
Then we'll come to you right away.
Who is this beloved?
This is Khalid and his wife; they are inviting us to the hotel tonight.
Yay, anywhere, you and me together, I'm happy.
Dear, may God keep you for me.
My beloved!
This is not fair. It's my source of income.
This bakery
And take their wealth as interest.
Five reales for broad beans, three reales for hot bread.
Two chickpeas.
Five beans, good, good.
Cook six broad beans!
Go! Divers.
The captain is here and has brought breakfast.
You need men.
My lord and master!
So what?
No, no, what I'm asking you for is to hear the sound of yes echoing in my ear.
Hello, Nawara.
I'm annoyed with you.
Do I bear your anger?
So what's the problem?
Why are you upset?
Nawwara chose a simple dress.
Don't say Anood will be upset.
Good heavens, these Lebanese speak very well.
And don't talk to him too much.
Me too, I'm jealous of her.
The most beautiful dress for the most beautiful Nora.
He flirts with her by calling her Nora.
Let your blood boil, how long will it take?
I paid twenty thousand, and twenty thousand riyals are remaining.
Insha'Allah (Management), Congratulations.
Inshallah.
Hello, Ms. Umm Saleh.
Hello Fadi, it seems you're busy, I don't want to keep you.
I'm at your service (a common saying).
Hello, hello.
Did you receive the text message yesterday?
I receive them, oh! Fool.
Did you like the joke?
So, did you bring the design with you?
I didn't have time to make them, show me your designs and choose from them.
Believe me, your taste is better.
They're leaving us, envy starts to work.
When he realizes that my project is good and starts generating income,
They say he will carry out a project like mine.
Design and Tailoring Shop
Women's clothing.
This is Abu Nasser, he has nothing to do with trade.
There are banks in it.
It will harm his uncle.
That's how it is these days.
Yes, yes, Uncle.
You know I was sleeping and they woke me up by saying your aunt wants you.
Everything is fine! Ask me anything!
Everything is alright, everything is alright.
I hope so.
What do you have in mind for any project, for example?
Are you looking for a partner or something?
I heard you were determined to do that, so I thought I should drop by.
Welcome.
If you need an upgrade, we have it.
Alhamdulillah, the work is going well.
What should I do, O God, O Abu Saleh?
But we're too late, they rented it last week.
Yes, they did.
Alright, that's good, goodbye.
So, this is it.
Are you sure?
And with luxurious fashion, discover the great disaster!
What is it?
He rented a shop next to yours.
(Ad) You are the envier! (Ad) You are the hater!
Before you know that the market is open to everyone,
You must know.
Open your heart to your aunt.
I didn't come to ask you.
You deny, lie, and mock me, and you told me,
I wanted to do my work in secret.
Taking that is the store next door, you want to disrupt my business.
But they didn't say come and be like a pain in the neck next to wisdom teeth, you're driving me crazy.
This is envy and hatred, I swear I'll slap you, this is hatred, leave it to me.
Are you related, people?
You ugly bastard, Abu Saleh!
Leave me alone, I swear to hit you. Oh! You and your annoying voice.
I'll hit you just as you hit me and stole a piece of me.
Oh people, come.
Say peace be upon him, O servant of God.
I swear, I swear, you did nothing.
He advised me to hire a designer from the Philippines.
Don't let anyone lie to you.
Why, why the Lebanese in particular?
They talk to him, joke and laugh, and feel very comfortable.
That's why Abu Saleh is Lebanese.
He started telling me some nice words and convincing me.
I liked it, I liked his words.
He convinced me to pay twelve thousand riyals.
And after two days, I went to the wood market and found the same cabinet, its twin, for 900 riyals.
And earn money.
A Lebanese designer bag.
Can I meet with the gentleman? You told me yesterday that he was difficult, is he still difficult today?
Oh, today is also very difficult.
I feel that Abu Saleh has changed lately.
What's wrong with it?
I don't know. What's the problem?
Abu Saleh was very psychologically exhausted after his cousin opened a store and hired a Lebanese designer like him.
Two weeks ago, the store's sales decreased.
The problem here in Qatar is that no Qatari will open a business unless another Qatari comes along and opens the same project and the same business right next to him. Should I go to him?
No, no, no, no, he is with Fadi the designer now thinking of a solution.
What do we do now?
We're sitting as if we've eaten poison.
If we keep like this, I think we won't even get the rent for the shop.
A place far from them.
This means we'll leave the field to them.
Okay, thank you. What is the discount?
Why don't you include a free evening gown with every wedding dress?
There's no way, let's go.
What's up? What's happening? We're going to the store next to you; today they're offering a promotion: with every wedding dress, you get two free dresses and a 25% discount.
Alright, let's go.
And now wait for two weeks, they will announce the same advertisement, buy a wedding dress and get two free with a 25% discount.
They're fighting us.
I think the same thing, if we leave them, they will destroy us.
Don't tire yourselves out.
What else can I do?
So it's definitely a challenge.
Certainly it's a challenge.
Bravo, that troublemaker deserves it, he doesn't want anyone to make a living.
If that happens, you'll hear the news within two or three days, I'll close his shop.
Well done.
Wait, wait, close, close, I'm coming to you now, goodbye.
What is it?
Saud says the store is unbearable and no one can sit there, and he says he doesn't know where the bad smell comes from.
The smell has nothing to do with this air conditioner, impossible.
It will smell in the place for at least six days.
One hundred percent sure.
He came at night.
He cuts the electrical wires from the store.
Is this fair?
Now will you sign an undertaking or shall we start a case and open a file?
Don't do anything for him.
I will tear him out of this life.
Oh my! Abu Nasser, something strange has happened; no one is coming to our store.
Abu Nasser, I'm cutting, I'm cutting, there's a customer coming. I'll talk to you later. This is urgent.
He's in bed, moaning.
He says it's a psychological matter, and I was afraid to tell him that the bank called and they need the installments.
The debts piled up on him because of his miserly relative.
What time is it now?
Poor things, if they accidentally entered and saw Saad the designer, they would scream at him and run away from him.
Asleep! Poor thing, he never sleeps, his eyes are open and he stares at the ceiling.
I don't know what he did to me.
Saud is in the store.
He bewitched him, I don't know what he did to him.
If the women saw him, they were afraid of him.
I don't know what happened to him!
I lost because of him, I lost because of him.
I am very indebted.
I'm afraid they'll imprison me.
And I have no evidence against him, so I can't sue him.
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do.
Forgot it, he deserves it.
Please tell me what kind of magic you performed on him. You've turned his designer into a monster, and women are afraid when they see him.
Spread a rumor.
What's happening? Oh! People, tell him that the photography group needs him urgently.
Oh my god!
I swear they'll raise my blood pressure, kill me, paralyze me. This isn't fair, Abdullah.
It's not good, dear Ahmed. Don't get angry. You have heart problems; this is not suitable for you, man!
I swear I've called him several times, my ear hurts, but he's useless. They're going to drive me crazy, they're going to drive me crazy.
You're not doing anything, I'm responsible for everything!
Listen to me, I'll give you an ear.
Episode 25, Scene 16, Ahmed, we want to finish.
Okay, I'll stop filming because an extra assistant didn't show up.
What is this production?
What have I done, oh my God? Why is Mr. Abdullah shouting at me?
My love, if you don't want someone to shout in your face,
What happened to Abdullah?
The extra actor is late and they're in trouble.
Oh! Ahmed, I don't need anyone, my dear.
Look for someone with authority and stature who can convince people that he can truly be a millionaire or billionaire, not just anyone.
Sir, please come in, place your order, and it will be ready in half an hour.
No one, oh God! Ala, no one, I was just explaining to him.
Alright, I'll manage with two scenes instead of one.
You are responsible and you are the production manager. You are responsible.
What are they doing now?
They'll do everything, look at the manager tense and flustered, but they'll handle it.
He needs someone with special qualities. Where do I find such a person now?
Are you serious?
Didn't you hear what the manager said?
I know someone, I hope God makes it easy for you, I hope he is suitable.
%PW Shock of Happiness
Saud Kanz! I remember him as Saud Shouk Al-Saadan.
Ah, when he was young, they called him Saud Shouk Alsaadan, and when they grew up, they called him Kanz.
Why "cans"?
I'll tell you why. He was poor, wandering the streets to collect cans and sell them by the kilo.
Oh my God! A rich and respected brother, no disappointment.
His appearance is suitable, as far as I remember, he is fat and chubby, neither tall nor thin.
Are you sure it's appropriate?
Inshallah, but you have to do his makeup well, and I guarantee he will be suitable and funny too.
Alright, what are you waiting for, call him!
I don't have his number.
Amir is coming with me and I'll go to him.
Where was Saud's house?
What is he saying?
Shut up, shut up.
Saud Kanz.
No one in the neighborhood is named Saud Kansa.
Yes, I'm sure it's from this neighborhood, but I forgot from which house.
This house belongs to someone named Saud and he lives with his mother.
Ah, yes.
But this is not true.
This is Saud's laptop.
This is certainly true, but it evolves over time because laptops are like boxes.
He is tall, fat, and a bit tanned.
He cancelled the cans and started collecting old computers. Come on, come on, come on Oh! Man
He went to the vegetable market to buy them for me. Where is the other one?
I don't know, son.
This is what you always wear.
I have another one, where is the other one, where is it?

Yes, Mom, they said they'll pay me.
Alhamdulillah, you're working now instead of being unemployed.
Okay, Mom, bye-bye.
You will argue with her, you will get angry, and you will go upstairs.

O Allah, heal her.
Your life is a bowl of cherries (proverb).
Oh my lord! Oh my lord!
Does he have asthma medication for my mother?
He is a manager, not a doctor.
Look at yourself, listen to what you're saying, it's completely useless.
What's her mother's name?
Sprayed on you, what do you think?
Did you hear what she said about you?
She tells you that you're light, you should be more serious.
They gave me, they gave him, they gave him, they gave him, they gave him half a million to repair the damaged tires of my car.
And give him three million to get me dinner.
I was about to ask you why you're talking like that.
Because I'm humble at the request of some people.
Look at Mr. Ghafel, the neighborhood's producer, high-level actors.
Now excellent, he is suitable for the role.
Excellent, I'll help you, I have no feeling, I don't have any, right?
Did your family buy this?
Your life is a bowl of cherries (proverb).
Take the gentleman to the makeup room, do his makeup, and I'll tell Salman to bring you the costume and come to you.
Go, go, go, this is great.
Alright, alright.
Listen, brother, take the car with us when we finish shooting, I'll call you to pick it up.
What matters, but is anyone giving me a ride?
I'll lift you! Oh, it's okay, I'll get our driver to lift you. Alright, thank you, brother, thank you, thank you, wait.
Alright, call your friend, the extra worker, call him.
Oh my God! They're calling Saud a laptop from the makeup room.
Let him brush my teeth then.
It's written in front of me.
Alright, shall we review again?
This means that I
I didn't expect this from you.
We will fight, for what!
We will fight for our rights.
Oh, wait.
And you know who you're talking to, Abu Abdulaziz.
Why did you divorce her, uncle!
Divorce her and be done with it.
We don't marry the daughter of a thief.
What do you need, what do you think?
He'll clean it, but later. The most important thing is to be ready because you're going to enter the fitting room to change your clothes and we're ready to shoot.
My teeth, toothpaste is expensive.
Oh people! The shooting of this scene is postponed.
Why this?
I don't need tea, oh! Brother, I'm bored and my stomach is bloated from tea. What's this, I've been waiting for an hour, how long do I have to wait?
"I didn't see anything, it's very common."
May God bless you.
They are fast.
Thank you, Sir. May God protect you.
Send my regards to your people.
Tell them Abu Abdulaziz greets you.
Alright, Judge.
That was fun, wasn't it?
Those who are like you are greeted and even kissed on the nose.
The first time someone pinched my nose.
How do they kiss them on their noses?
This is a problem.
His nose is like an ice cream stick, hurting your lips. That was funny, that was fun.
I didn't laugh!
Don't remember.
Can I be an actor?
Something's wrong. What's with your voice?
Oh Ben, oh Ben, I am very sick, I am waiting for you.
Come quickly.
Welcome, Sheikh, welcome.
See it or see it for yourself, man.
Listen to me, you!
Alright, go now.
I see a lot of appreciation.
My son, what happened!
And peace be upon you, what's bothering you, sir?
Oh, my God!
Don't tire him, God willing you will be, oh! Dr. Hassan, come here, come here.
Yes, oh! Dr. Hany, what happened?
Leave the honor in the office.
Don't be afraid.
She is the mother of all, God willing, she will be fine.
Hello, welcome sir, hello.
Shut up or I'll slap your face.
Here my name is Abu Abdulaziz.
Call me, my lord!
How are you, sir?
May God curse you (a popular saying).
Yes, Your Honor.
Welcome, sir! Please sit down.
God bless you.
This ugly face (a popular saying).
Go down with him, Sir Rashid.
I swear I didn't do anything to you, tell me what to do about it.
Hey pal! Can I find a doctor quickly, please?
Doctor, my mother is sick!
Wait in line, it's your turn.
Listen to me, you!
Can I ask you, friend?
Oh my son, quickly, I am sick.
You go to the hospital a lot, you take your mother every week, you haven't found any of them, they are good and accept anything.
Unlike citizens.
Don't forget the citizens.
Alright, then look for a wife in the hospital.
I liked it.
But, brother, you're ignoring me.
Alright, try to be close to her, smile at her, look at her, give her your number, and have good intentions.
There's nothing wrong.
Act politely.
Or leave, leave, if you don't leave I'll call security, so they can teach you a lesson.
No, I don't need anything.
Why do you drink, sir?
Just for me, please.
No, thank you.
You can take her and leave the hospital.
The person speaking to you is Fahad Al-Marzouk.
You will marry him means you will marry him.
No, no, I need the cash, clothes, and the car too. I'll rent them from you.
So I can give you your money.
No, no, no, wait.
Go!
And what is this percentage %PW that Al-Marzouk is talking about?
Welcome, welcome, welcome.
My eyes witnessed their wedding contract yesterday.
I wish you had come.
They were surprised by what I did for them; it was a very elegant and private party.
One is regular and the other is diet.
Now you have no excuse.
What is this?
Mom promised my friends tomorrow at work.
Will you take this for them!
Ah, what's wrong with him.
Noura, come here!
What is this?
He will drive this thing for his friends, for the scandal.
Whatever you take, it's going to make everyone talk about you.
And give me the money, tomorrow I'll buy you something nice.
Oh, but I've promised them now.
And you have to take it tomorrow.
Don't worry, they're still open. Go and change your clothes so we can get something to please the people.
Get out of here! Let's go.
And it's at a reasonable price and its quality is excellent.
Above average, not the best!
Certainly there's premium chocolate, but sorry, I thought you were looking for something more reasonably priced.
This is too expensive, why are you looking for the most expensive one?
This is unbelievable, check out this artistic touch.
This is what is called royal chocolate.
The same chocolate that is always requested at the Spanish court.
Give me that.
Congratulations, on the other hand, he has a warranty certificate.
Welcome, come in!
Come here, brother, give us some of this chocolate, brother.
What an occasion, man!
No, Saleh Abdel Ghader, the one in accounting.
By the blessing of God, it's worth it, give me another one.
Hurry up with the coffee.
Auntie, did you go to their wedding?
Oh, my darling, I attended their wedding, it was embarrassing, disgusting. Can you believe it, my sister!
Did you listen to your aunts' words?
That's why I want to throw you an unforgettable wedding.
No time, you only have one and a half months.
I'll arrange everything.
But he doesn't let me do anything.
You live in society, you see people put everything they have into their joys.
And you saw it for yourself.
If you buy something sweet, you'll see how they praise you and compliment your taste.
Didn't they tell you it's wonderful and amazing?
That's true, but how much did we pay?
The money we spent on chocolate could buy four sheep for the wedding.
Don't interfere, your mother knows how to do everything, just give her the money.
This means they will agree to anything we choose.
I wish you hadn't said that.
What's your opinion about this stage?
But excellence costs a lot of money.
Why, why, the past was beautiful!
What do you think of this?
This is the first time anyone in Qatar has thought of making a stage like a computer mouse.
Sorry, one moment.
Talk about anything but the stage and arrangements, this is the place where women with nothing to do, except talk, should be quiet.
The man is waiting for us.
We will go to the mouse stage.
It's a very strange phase.
The latest model in twenty eleven.
We have already chosen the mouse.
You can sit aside, it's all for your own good.
So you have to choose, if it's Noah's Ark, you'll have to pay twenty thousand more, and if it's the mouse, you'll pay one hundred and twenty thousand.
Make your decision, and we're ready.
You're not the first one to get married.
See what you're doing? Getting married in the Comoros? That's how things are done in our country.
And we haven't even started yet.
If you don't need a stage, where will you put the bride? In a box?
Iron, paint, and some wood.
And the people are happy.
They exploit us and lie to us; in fact, they are con artists.
So what's bothering you now?
Are you angry and annoying?
If you don't want to get married, that's fine.
With permission, I will call the bride's mother and tell her that Saleh is in a very difficult situation.
He doesn't want to get married? He can't afford the wedding expenses? That's good for me. Do you want me to call her? I'm serious, I'll call her.
We received a bouquet of flowers from the Netherlands.
I think if you put them on the tables at the wedding,
Are you sure this is your first time in Doha?
The Middle East as well!
Put it on the bill.
How much will it increase?
One hundred and seventy-seven, okay.
But Samir, I don't want to see this group at any wedding.
Learn people's secrets.
Alright, they're reserved.
Your salary is higher than mine.
A problem we can't handle is starting.
May God guide you, Saleh.
But for heaven's sake, you should have tried to sort things out.
For me, thank God, I've decided to look for a wife in any Arab country.
They say a wedding costs you only two thousand dollars and enjoy.
God bless you, dear.
God willing, his wedding will be next month.
Just specify the number of cards you want and let me know.
If the invitations are sufficient, that's good. The important thing is that people know they are invited, where, and when, and that's it.
You're only interested in him, you don't care what people will say.
People know the standard of marriage from invitations.
Tomorrow, when you see these invitations, I know what the ladies will say.
Look at their wedding, if they are the ones who sent the invitations, they didn't see so-and-so's invitation.
We said we'd order it online.
It has a cloth cover, made of panda skin, and contains silver glitter.
No one blames you, you can't stop me.
I'll be a hot topic for the girls, we'll ask for invitations, we'll ask for invitations!
I pity him, oh God!
God bless him, of course his family pressured him a lot.
Dude! He's collecting money from everyone.
What did he say, he even sold his car.
And he looks twenty years older, this morning I saw him talking to himself.
Don't criticize him, brother. May God keep him. I don't know when we will develop.
Close the door, please.
Sorry, brother!
Did you try to convince them to have a budget-based wedding?
What do you mean by "based on my budget"?
Why, am I living alone?
The problem our society suffers from is appearances, pride, and boasting about illness.
He forces you to be sick with the same illness.
If you want to live there.
Once, I pointed to the bride's mother.
Her words attacked me (like knives).
Put your trust in God.
By the way, tell me,
How did you get married?
And I don't want to get married, I'm not crazy.
Even if you decide, my brother, to get married,
I will consider marrying a foreigner or even an Arab.
He says your country!
We decided to bring a DJ for the songs.
But because Umm Nasser brought a famous singer to her son's wedding.
He is a very famous singer, but I forgot his name.
Why are you so upset?
It seems you don't like what I'm doing!
It's enough that he sold his car, and every day one of his friends gives him a ride.
I entered the room before, and found him talking to himself.
I see, now you've changed your mind.
Since my brother Saleh is tired, his mother said no.
What matters to me is you and him.
I am no less than people.
Don't make us a joke.
Oh Mother, please, enough. My brother spent all he had and took money from everyone.
Be quiet.
My mother has new demands for marriage, and my brother said I don't have the money, so I screamed at him and said he will get married, and I don't want to get married.
Where is she now?
They are coming in and they are giving her first aid.
He said she was much better now and they would find a room for her in the hospital.
Shame!
Relax, sister!
The doctor told you to stay calm and gave you an injection to make you sleep.
How can I rest when he wants to make a joke of us for good or for evil.
I was telling him to bring Abdullah Rashid, and he told me he didn't have the money.
I feel sorry for your mother.
He was afraid for her.
Go to her, go to her and kiss her head.
And tell her I'll do what you want.
I'll bring you Abdullah Al-Ruwaissed.
Abu Yusuf Karim, I don't think he won't help me.
This is such an injustice, I couldn't find anyone but Abu Yusuf.
What's the matter!
Are you crazy, Saleh!
But the minister kept him because he was an old man, and besides, he was disciplined and honest.
In my opinion, if you tell him the same thing you told me, there's a good chance his heart will stop.
Yes, I did.
This is because of the financial crisis you're going through, and you want to ask Abu Youssef for some money, of course, from the ministry's funds.
"And none knows when you may attain it except Allah."
And when the accountants came and asked him about the money,
Of course, there could be a problem.
No one knows, and he knows how to deal with it.
You are responsible; the man is in his office and you must be responsible for what happens to him.
I'm stealing in my last days!
My uncle doesn't call it stealing.
On the first step.
Yes, yes, a white box wrapped with blue ribbon and containing a circle with a picture of a dove's wing, bring it, bring it.
Alright, Uncle Abu Youssef, I, if I wasn't experiencing hardship,
I'll give them all back.
They call me Abu Yusuf.
And I came in my last days.
Corrupt me, O Thursday.
Salih, Salih.
Alright, listen to me, if it was anyone else, they would've been done for or something would've happened to them! Oh! Oh! Oh! Khalid.
Salih, Salih.
I've tried every method, Abu Youssef, I'm drowning.
I can't back out of the marriage.
And you know them, they are all bald.
What's wrong with you?
No, no, the other one, the panic button, the panic button.
In the cabinet, in the cabinet.
Oh Uncle Abu Yusuf, the cupboard is full of grains, which grains do you want?
The vase containing an image of a man in a state of panic.
We've only booked two rooms for hair and makeup for us.
We'll be there from tomorrow.
We scared Abdullah Rabee' and his gang.
You will see, dear.
No, I won't tell you.
This will be the song of the season.
We are the first in the world to use it.
Mmm mmm
Bye bye
There is no god but God.
My son, don't forget to read the Mu'awwidhatain when entering the dance hall.
The women here have an evil eye.
I told you she's amazing.
The best groom ever, may God preserve you, I don't want to envy you.
Mom, mom, the police are knocking at the door.
I was wrong to obey you, God.
What an injustice, today is my wedding day.
The people who will conduct the test have come.
And now I'm screwed, I'm going to prison, oh my God.
Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf!
It's still early.
But it's not fair for this to happen!
The company offered a contract worth three million, two million just for the materials.
Wrote a memo to the minister.
We know corruption exists, but it doesn't go this far.
It seems you don't live in this world.
Tell me, what did the minister say to Uthman?
And why didn't our president object? They say he was with him!
As far as I know, I swear to what I know.
Where is morality?
The right has become wrong, and wrong has become right.
Oh Saad! Did the minister really dismiss him, people! What's happening in the world?
He just shot him!
Something else?
The minister's sister.
This girl is involved with the minister.
Strange world (a popular saying).
Look at yourselves, don't you know her?
This is the new employee whom the minister appointed in place of the unfortunate Osman.
Go, go, go.
What do you want me to do, Saleh?! Oppose the minister!
You're crazy!
Listen to me, man.
We have children, we want to live.
We want to live.
What happened?
Here he is, standing by the elevator.
This is the reward for honesty and integrity, brother Saleh.
I wish we could do anything for you, brother!
Praise be to God, praise be to God for everything.
What's wrong with you, Saleh?
These are among the strange things we see before us in this world.
We see things that are unbelievable.
I'm at your service.
I want you to stop by the supermarket after work to get some vegetables for the salad.
I'll try, okay bye bye.
Who will take my sister home?
She was sitting in the front, laughing and talking. Who was she?
This is my university colleague, what's the problem if he drives me home? It's fine.
Oh my god, I can't believe it, why do you look like an old-fashioned person!
What do you mean?
Don't you hear what we're saying?
You are traditional.
This is a mix of old and new in right and wrong!
Right is right and wrong is wrong.
Life has evolved, and we live in the age of technology.
The age of international variables that coordinate the world and no one can keep up with them.
The more I live, the more I see!
Don't blame me, oh! Manar, I shouldn't be tense and angry.
This is what he sees in his day.
Tell her he's sorry.
Life isn't occupied in the right way.
Don't be upset, come and eat lunch.
Let me sleep to relax.
The manager is not angry with you.
Did the president get angry?
No, he's not angry, go wash your face and eat your lunch.
Alright, dear.
I'm very eager to meet you on my first day of work.
It's an honor to your honor.
Of course, of course.
Certainly, I know you don't need anyone to remind you of the principles of the job.
But at the same time, it is extremely important.
To remind you of some of the values and principles you uphold.
In the public interest.
This is what your honor should be.
We all have to.
The lottery is very important, sir.
To be a thief
Thank you, thank you all.
What I want to say is
And to warn you from my first day of work,
"that there is among you one man"
Who is sincere, loyal, dedicated, and such bad things.
Just doubt.
There is an honest employee.
So that we can take the necessary legal action against him in our ministry.
No, it will be as you wish, my lord.
Praise be to God, we are all thieves.
As you wish, sir, I'll say it in front of my colleagues and behind them.
Where is Khalid?
Yes, Your Honor.
Khaled, you were highly praised, may God bless you.
All right, Your Honor.
Oh, sir! You know how to choose.
God may guide you.
Why did you let the devil play with you?
You should thank God it was only about honesty.
Oh mother, why was my father imprisoned?
Be quiet, my daughter.
No, no, I'll never do it again.
Oh mother, why was my father imprisoned?
Stop.
This means he has become honest.
How embarrassing to say that your father is honest.
Goodness!
Your whole body is covered.
What will people see?
And if God wills, you will look for a job, no one will hire you in this condition.
Is there a decent lady who covers her body and charms?
She covers her chest, wears it even here, chokes herself.
I'm tired of her, son.
And I bought her a shirt and pants that revealed her midriff above her navel.
But it's a hopeless case; she doesn't want to be on the right track.
Here I am telling you!
You will only touch yourself.
To ask for the hand of your daughter Sarah for our son Rashid.
One of us is just looking for the right man for his daughter these days.
Let me tell you, Rashid is my son.
He is a very kind person.
What stops drinking (proverb).
He's drunk 24/7.
Sugar, sugar, feeling sluggish all day.
And don't ask about the noise.
It's good manners.
And they told me he was a hypocrite as well.
And how about theft?
This is what I expect from you. How's the drug scene?
Clear, done. I'll give you five riyals if you can find his pupils, you're competing for it.
Alright, Uncle! Abu Sara, we've come to propose to her.
Learn to loiter and congregate.
We know she came from a good family.
By the blessing of the Son, blessing, thus life works, by blessing.
I'm drunk.
I can't walk.
Alright, come.
Okay, bye bye
Okay, call your father to come pick you up.
Why should I call him?
So he can come and get you.
Where is he?
Look, he's over there, waving his jar with the girl of hair color.
By God, your father walks straight, he's just enjoying himself.
Hello, my dear daughter Mona!
Majid! His name was Abdulaziz.
Ah, yes.
You confused me, my daughter.
And you know that since the establishment of the State of Palestine with its capital in Jenin in 2009, after signing the comprehensive peace agreement with the State of Israel,
And Israel continues to practice terrorism, pressure, and siege on it.
The latest is what has been raised by the Israelis and their Arab friends of claims against the Palestinians.
They are dodging plastic knives through the tunnels.
Especially paragraph A.B., which states that the Palestinian people must cut their nails daily.
Now move on to the fateful meeting.
Mr. Cheap
When Israel agrees to the establishment of a Palestinian state,
Dude! Why are you saying this, dude?! You're ruining our reputation and leaving me alone!
Please!
Pardon me, Mr. Tiger, pardon me, Mr. President.
Can you give me a chance to speak?
We have fully adhered to the comprehensive international agreement.
What is the Israeli representative saying?
To find any solid thing, stone or plastic, as a commitment.
Oh man, even our houses.
"Shoaib, oh people of the Gulf."
In Palestine, everything is made of wood.
According to the agreement, American companies will manufacture wooden cars for us.
And all the doors of our houses are made of thermally treated wood.
What we need is speeches.
Don't change the subject.
Mr. President,
This is a crucial point, and I would like to take a vote on this because nail growth is a violation of the agreement.
If you agree, raise your hands.
But I had a very strange dream.
So that you can control the students.
I'm tired of telling him.
This is the fourth school you will start working at tomorrow.
Because I asserted my strong personality as a teacher from the beginning.
The boys are chasing him and tearing his clothes, and he doesn't know.
How many times has he come to me without a hat?
My department head told me.
Rashid is a nice guy, and we don't want to kick him out.
The children are throwing stones at him.
They pull his jockstrap in the playground in front of everyone.
And they said, "This teacher is lazy and will destroy everything."
Should I tell them the ketchup story?
Oh Maria, come.
What's the story with ketchup, this is new, no one told me!
They poured an entire bottle of ketchup on the chair.
He came and sat down.
He doesn't know anything.
When he saw the children laughing at him in the schoolyard.
Stop.
By the way, your boss, whom you'll start working with tomorrow, called me.
But, never mind, we'll give him a chance.
Because I'm waiting to tell you.
The age of kindness and weakness is over.
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
You will see a different adult.
No need to remind you of the important educational quote.
You are a graduate of education, and I am a graduate of education.
And we all know the quote,
The teacher is the first-grade student's father.
You will see Mr. Rashid the strong.
And if anyone does wrong,
There's going to be a problem.
He told me, when you start talking, shut your mouth.
You'll see what I'll tell him.
Which one of you mocked me and said, "Just shut up"? Which one?
You're the one who told me to shut up!
No, it's not me.
So that's who's beside you, you!
Go to the school principal.
And tell him that Mr. Rashid fired me.
I don't want to see your face here, you hear!
What do you think about my anxiety?
This should not just be on the first day, but it should be like this all year round.
Be aware of the consequences.
If you hear someone's voice
While I am explaining or speaking.
You know what he does.
Psychological, do you know what psychological means?
Means tense.
Did you hear what you said or not?
I heard him too.
Get out of the classroom.
Go to the school principal.
Take your things and leave now!
Take your stuff.
What matters to me.
It's clear that he's still looking for it.
No, sir, we didn't see him.
By the way, ice cream with milk is really good if it has strawberries inside.
Dear Abdel Rahman
Everyone makes mistakes, and that's human.
I'm laughing with you, son.
But more importantly, your father doesn't know the story!
I don't want this, I want the chocolate in my bag.
Well, where is your bag? Where is your bag? Where is your bag?
In the classroom.
I'm at your service.
She says she's happy with you.
You can't tell the difference between the son of a rich person and the son of the people.
Unfortunately, how does misfortune look green or red?
Come here, where are you going?
In the bathroom.
Are you still in the bathroom?
Knock on the door quickly and tell him the first class started half an hour ago, quickly.
I was before all of them, juice and potato chips.
I took it before them all, I disturbed them. My friend Abdurrahman, on the other hand, this is very healthy.
Okay, now go to Saud and get a PlayStation CD from him.
So what do we learn from this story?
This man
They must have morals.
This is the thing for PlayStation, he also told me to bring all the PlayStations at once.
Alright, do you want anything else, my friend Abdulrahman, my friend?
It is nothing now.
We learn from the story.
You all know I'm leaving this week because I got accepted into grad school.
Therefore, I thought I should hand in the party file before I travel.
How can I pick you up at noon? Abdulrahman told me, but I don't know where he wants to go, but he didn't tell me what time!
As long as his father is coming back and didn't say anything to him, praise be to God, I'm relieved and it's all clear.
"Say, if I don't take it this afternoon and he gets angry and tells his father, no, no, no, it's a disaster, no, no."
Hello, my friend Abdul Rahman.
God bless you.
What should I do, she's something else.
You love her, you love her like this.
Today, children, we will have a new lesson in science.
Peace be upon you.
Thank you.
I need water.
I didn't ask, I didn't ask for anything, I'm at your service.
Teacher, teacher. How do you ask for water from the teacher?
If any professor brings water for a student, are you their personal servant? This incident will not go unnoticed; I will write it in the report.
And you're laughing too, laughing at me.
Don't raise your voice and don't shout at me, got it?
Is this enough for you?
Okay, so this is for the number of cars?
Four to five cars.
Excellent, this is excellent, wonderful, excellent.
What should I do?
As you can see, he will park his car in front of our houses at the expense of our comfort.
What days Abu Nasser tells me
Abu Nasr is finished.
He studies abroad.
Okay, I broke the table.
Don't get tense, brother!
Why?
Are you different? (Example)
Change your behavior towards me.
Me or you?
We didn't say anything, bro!
What is this?
Listen, leave everything as it is, it's better for you.
I'm not threatening you, brother!
What do you mean by "no need" when I want to help you?
What do you mean?
Instead of, what do they call it?
It seems that you want.
You want this, as you like.
Faster, faster.
Is this good?
What I like, this is unfair!
What the neighborhood has (proverb).
We are coming to Uncle Naif to discuss not shouting.
Who is this person who is allowed to do whatever they want in the neighborhood?
Did you give me a chance to speak?
Alright people, quiet down and let's listen to what Uncle Abu Nayef has to say.
Now, this loser who isn't worth a penny is playing with your nerves!
Leave it to me.
If I don't hit him in the face, he won't keep to the umbrella he made.
The game is played by its players (proverb).
Is this correct?
Bye bye
You haven't seen anything yet.
You know he has a jewelry store now!
That's why I'm standing here wearing all these rings and necklaces.
May Allah replace it with something better.
Just walk, you'll stay in the heat?
How true it is that the innocent and poor Rashid has become like this.
Became the vice president of the Global Education Center.
Let him tell you, let him teach you. You are a teacher and he is a teacher, but look where he is now and where you are now.
Don't mention it.
What do you remember, Abdullah?
I'll tell you the secret.
The professor came, the professor came.
Teacher, I didn't do anything.
Teacher, do you know who he is?
Yes, dear, I know who he is.
Here I'm telling you, we won't have a chance as good as this.
I, am looking for a job! This is funny, I swear this is funny.
No, my brother, the job is in my pocket.
Thank you for everything you've done, thank you, thank you.
Send him my regards.
Your mother sends you her greetings. May God protect you, I will tell her, he sends his greetings.
Well, goodbye dear, in God's care (a popular saying).
What more do you want, your brother is going to be a minister, believe it, my son!
Oh my god!
But, my son, if you work with him, will they say anything?
He gave it to you like that.
This thing is good, right?
Alright! That's automatic, without a shadow of a doubt.
So, my darling, please make my dream come true.
Before your dream, my dream.
Building a tower between the Corniche towers
Go on, what are you waiting for!
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You can do it, Abu Saleh!
It seems your friend is angry.
It doesn't work like that, brother!
You can do it, Abu Saleh!
Do you believe that he stood up, took the phone, and gave it to Abu Saleh?
Look, behind all this talk, a million percent, Abu Sultan is right.
His relationship with Abu Saleh was not good.
No, Abu Sultan won't do that unless he intends to do something else.
In fact, to this extent?
Open the car door for him!
Finally, he works on opening the minister's car doors.
Oh my son! Don't break my heart, don't break my heart.
For your information, all the stories we hear in the cafes happen in the country.
But I can't believe what I'm hearing!
My heart stopped, my heart stopped.
I fear, my daughter, that the women will start talking about it and you won't mention Latifa, the dish collector. It spreads among the women about me, my daughter.
Say something, Abu Sultan, speak. I am shocked, I will collapse.
Please, know that I know what I'm doing.
None of your business.
Manira, I'm working on a low flame.
By opening the door for him, this is the beginning of the plan in my head.
I deserve to become a minister, not him.
Let me work, I have a plane.
Let them release him.
Yes, plan.
He should have trusted me from the beginning.
They told me we appoint him a minister because he was appointed two months before me.
Because I'm sure he'll be fired from his job.
The magic may be undone.
What is it?
This too?
At every event he attends, the photographer takes many pictures of him until his photo becomes common in the newspaper.
And it becomes foul until it rises to the surface.
Are you sure?
Just wait. Let me work against him and you'll see.
On the contrary, Your Excellency,
Certainly, Sir.
So, tell me,
Did you thank him for the lamb? By the way, the meat was very delicious.
The man is outside, go down and see him.
Don't be foolish, people want to give you respect and you want to humiliate yourself.
The only delegate, enter, enter.
No, no, no, don't take my picture, no. Just the minister, one picture, one.
Take another one as well.
Oh brother! I really love your plan.
I want you to take it to him.
Picture, picture, picture.
Yes, he is a minister, I have one too.
Alright, I'll tell you, wait!
Go to the second-to-last page.
See a big picture with the groom.
Say: "There is no god but Allah!"
Yes, every day he has one or two pictures.
As you say, he is a social activist, well, well, goodbye.
Everyone loves you, but I don't know what's wrong with you.
He is present everywhere (like).
They are jealous, they envy you. He who prospers is envied (proverb).
Take me to the market!
Is it still not ready?
Peace be upon you
Hello, peace be upon you, welcome.
You are very famous.
Yes, your name is Abdulaziz Abdullah, right?
This is my husband.
How many times have I told you?
Three hundred and fifty
For this famous person,
You're home today, is something wrong?
Leave me alone, I have a headache today, my head hurts, I feel pain all over my body, and my colon is getting worse.
I'm tired, really tired. I've only been with him for a month.
Let me rest today.
Hello, Umm Sultan.
Can I say something?
Oh my god!
I started to love her.
You saw for yourself what fame does!
I know. Alhamdulillah you're convinced.
To be honest,
Your minister is anxious, it seems he loves this story.
My brother Saad sent me.
No, I didn't follow any activity and didn't read the newspaper, I don't know.
We are at your service, goodbye.
If God wants an ant to disappear, He gives it wings.
Peace be upon you, do you have a conference here at the hotel tonight?
Wedding?
Don't you remember anything? Don't you have any events like a party, birthday, or wedding?
I don't know, but you can see the hotel behind us.
Ah, there's a hotel behind you, right?
Is it okay if I leave you in the car and go to the hotel to inquire?
Go, go, go and take your time. Go and ask, go.
God guides everyone.
Is this minister loosening the noose around our necks or easing our burden?
He couldn't find an occasion, a party, a wedding, or any problem to blame it on.
He took him to the Sixteen Thousand Hotel and found nothing for him. His luck is as bad as his face.
Shh, hello.
I didn't find his birthday, or anything.
Go, you might catch the second half!
In every subject, he has a hundred pictures.
He doesn't sleep! He doesn't get tired, brother.
Oh man! The newspaper editor says that the first thing is to set up his picture, and then I set up the newspaper.
She said my children participated in the "Picture Your Minister's Spouse" contest.
Someone asks another, "How many pictures of the minister are there in the newspaper?"
And the winner gets a prize.
The story isn't like that. You need to come to the cafe and listen to the comments every day about his picture in the newspaper. These are baseless rumors.
Oh my God, his death is so near.
As they say, when God wants to remove a butterfly, it approaches the light.
People leave you and greet him.
He became one of the most famous people in the country.
What do you remember and who is he?
You ruined my reputation.
God bless you and her.
She said: "We all got married except for the poor in hope. She is the only one of us who didn't marry."
This is my fate.
It's written that I won't get married.
And forget about marriage.
God alone is sufficient for whoever is behind this.
Look at those spoiled people sitting over there.
Yes, what's wrong with them?
Do you see the person playing with their hair?
Is this a boy or a girl?
After my father's death, I mean his murder.
I saw it, it grew, didn't it?
We should not associate it with the maid.
Go and make some tea.
I'm tired of talking to my mom. But she doesn't have just one maid, she has two.
I've told you a hundred times not to interfere; Khalid is my son, not yours.
You don't have anyone but Khadoud and the maids and the maids and Khadoud.
Oh, Mom, this isn't good. Khadija spends 24 hours with the maid and doesn't want anyone else.
Get out. I want to rest, I want to sleep. How?
Oh my God, Saud, your brother Khaldoun has become a girl.
Wait a bit, if I don't tell my father about you.
Let me tell you something, what is Khalwah suffering from?
Saud says Khulood is made up and acts like a girl. What's the problem? What's the problem?
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God! Oh! Saud.
Khald puts makeup on his face! It's just a little makeup. A child saw the makeup palette and played with it.
I saw a very small spot, and it's not even visible.
He is kind, polite, and gentle.
I will scold Saud.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
The last time I asked you, Saad, what you wanted to be when you grow up, you didn't tell me. Now, tell me, when you grow up, what do you want to be?
And you, dear Khaldi, dear Saad, what do you want to become?
This year, we will go to London just like last year.
Yes, contact the vibrator in Bahrain.
Tell him to bring Susan, Khalid, and Huda.
And say hello to Samoura.
I ask for forgiveness from God.
My father told me today to choose.
Do you want me to build on the land overlooking the sea or the nearby land?
I said I don't want to choose.
I can live with you, my love, anywhere.
Thank you, my love.
And you taught me how to fish?
Wow, Amal, I want to open my eyes and be told that I've graduated from university.
It doesn't seem to be a men's perfume.
I don't know, but it smells very strange.
Oh my God, what's wrong with me?
The way you speak has become feminine.
I forgot you were a man.
And God willing, do you speak to people this way outside?
How true she is, Khalid!
Get out of my room!
Alas! Solitude!
The disappointment of my hope in you.
Come on, don't hurt my feelings, I swear I'll tell my mom.
This is my son, and I know him well.
Oh, how poor you are! Khadija, light of my eye, I wish all children were as kind and sensitive as he is.
And when you see a kind and quiet person, you say they are like me.
Shame on you, shame on you for saying such things about your brother.
Stop, she's making a big fuss about nothing.
Oh, he just wears very nice perfume. Now, what's the difference between men's perfume and women's perfume?
Here I tell you, don't say that in front of your father.
I own it.
I'll show you, but be quiet, so Mohammed doesn't notice anything.
How did these girls meet?
It's a shame for a beautiful girl to do such a thing!
Don't look at it, don't look at it!
I'm afraid he felt there was something about him.
Take it easy.
I know you're monitoring the spread of Bluetooth these days.
I am waiting for Saad to come.
How are you, Saad?
God protect you.
We were waiting for you, we didn't play cards.
Oh, why?
Do you want to drink anything?
I see that he has been sleeping here in your apartment for two days!
For the sake of the Bluetooth story.
Yes, his older brother threatened him.
He is afraid of him.
Don't try, I told you not to try.
Seek refuge from the devil, my son!
I have made a reservation.
I will leave. How will I meet people? I can't!
And what should I say to your father?
Tell him anything.
Oh no, these problems they've brought upon me!
This is the end, Mama.
I remember when it was just a small hut.
Certainly this will be the result.
Stop, get out please.
The right thing always hurts.
The bottle broke.
It's impossible for me to live in Doha.
I can't face people.
My phone is off for a while.
And you blame me, Amal!
You are a girl and you spend your whole day at home.
What should I say when I'm a man who meets new people every day?
"It's difficult, oh Hope!"
I can't live spending my days and life with my head always down.
The father feels for a while that there is something wrong at home and that there has been a change.
For how long will my father be absent from the events happening here at home?
Sometimes I blame my father and sometimes I don't.
How can I blame him, Amal! When I remember his dedication and loyalty to his work, so that we can live with dignity among people.
And I blame him.
When he leaves home and leaves the responsibility of the children to the mother.
What we want now is not to dwell on the past.
Does the father know or not?
But I'm ready.
Turn on his Bluetooth.
But I won't give it to him.
What I want is not to see the shock in my parents' eyes.
I'll be devastating.
Good heavens!
He knows how to throw for us.
It's much better to know it from him than from someone else.
I wish our house hadn't gotten to this point.
Because a dirty bomb named "Eternal" exploded in it.
And customs and traditions
You will find them arrogant.
Closing their ears to it
And they don't want to listen to him.
They only listen to one voice.
Which is dirt and strangeness.
They trample on all the good.
Whatever comes to your mind.
You suddenly decided to study abroad.
We just say, but God is with you, son!
God bless you.
The people coming back to get you the gift are not the ones going on the trip.
You're right.
This is a rule.
But every rule
Amal, come with me quickly.
Did he see his daughter?
I don't hear anything.
Abu Saad!
Abu Saad.
Abu Saad, what's the news?
Daddy, what's wrong with you, Daddy?
Oh, Daddy!
Don't worry.
You are a great person.
And any man who wants to marry you.
I didn't divorce you because of anything you did.
I divorced you.
Because it's impossible.
To kiss my children's uncle.
Your brother is like me.
Salwa
You're here every day.
Before you never come.
I was hiding in the basement.
That was before when we were underground.
This is very strong language, can you handle such language?
I got a thousand and two hundred, you make a lot of money!
Say "Mashallah."
Go, go.
I've only been here for seven months, stop complaining and take me home.
How embarrassing and shameful! Every time he takes me to someone's house, his driver asks, "What do they give you?" Nothing satisfies him, and today he asked for a raise.
This driver is mocking you.
He came less than seven months ago.
Annoy me, son, annoy me.
Give it back, so we can get rid of it.
Return it and bring someone else!
Tell your son, he doesn't know what lies beyond this word! He doesn't know the cost in time, money,
And driving lessons. Send him and let's get rid of him!
The first time I came here to my house was six months ago.
Alright, then I'll say something new to you.
Gas is now $114, before it was 50 cents per liter. Everything has become expensive, boss.
Open your mind and listen to what I say!
When I first came here, what salary did I give you?
You gave me seven hundred.
You're still new, new. You've only been here for six months, and eight hundred is a lot of money.
I need money.
The driver you're talking about is old, old, and you are new.
These seven hundred have now become eight hundred.
Go!
He said, "I'll give you an extra hundred riyals only."
Three hundred is no use.
What I told you is true?
No, no screen. I'll be in trouble when I leave.
No, I'm afraid of dogs.
He who flees from his shepherd.
Why are you afraid?
Because before these people were shepherds.
Give them a salary of six to seven hundred. Do you know how much they're getting?
How much is your salary?
So, why are you afraid?
What scared me
God is sufficient.
I woke Nasser up and told him to go see it.
There was a limit.
He even stole the phone I bought for him.
What have I done?
I didn't do it!
They did everything they could, took his passport, and put it with them.
Walk! My lord, forgive me.
We will look for him everywhere.
This is the problem, this is the problem.
And after all this, they flee.
They put us in trouble and harmed us.
I told you to return it.
But do you think I'll let him go?
I will find him no matter what.
He will return, which means he will come back.
I'd rather pay for his ticket and send him home than let him stay here and make money.
I've been putting up with it until now, hoping to find a solution.
Come in now, no one will buy now.
At the beginning of the game, you seemed nervous, as I noticed.
But what were we afraid of? We were afraid that our team wouldn't score any goals.
We need more than three, we want ten, twelve, fifteen.
You made me feel before the match that you were scared; you were afraid of the opposing team.
I'm not afraid of the opposing team, I'm afraid of our own team. I'm afraid they won't score more than 3.
This is our team's level, I know that. I'm talking about our team's level.
This is a great trust from you.
The opposing team has nothing.
Amazing! The foxes have scored a goal now, you're ahead with the first goal.
Where are you going?
I'm going home.
Do you have a car?
Come with me, I'll give you a ride.
Thanks, man.
Why try? You won't be able to outperform our team!
Sir, the match has just started and the league has just begun.
Did you hear what he said?
He said it's problematic.
Mahmoud, bring the tea!
Now my friend is coming to pick me up to go to the stadium, quickly.
Take it, oh! My friend Sajid.
Take it, sir! Pasha.
What did he make for himself?
Yes, he is the Indian man.
Ah! Yes, man, he's crazy about football.
Don't talk about my team, Fox, like that.
They're going to win, they're going to win.
Go, Sajid, go, Sajid, come quickly, the match will start soon. Take water with you, today the wolves will play.
Dear viewers, we have with us one of the most famous fans of the Fox Club, called Fox.
They say you defeated them because they were incomplete.
What they say, what they say is not true.
What is incomplete? Every team has dozens of players.
If it's not one or two, nothing will change.
This fox is very smart.
This is our best fan.
Alright, on the occasion of Oh! Thalob's win, a final word you want to say to the Wolves.
All words stop.
When they say the name Fox.
Her name is in the high sky.
This is the good fan.
Listen to me, brother.
You can find him enthusiastic like this.
Here we go, oh! Handsome.
So, where is the Indian man who loves football?
Haven't seen you in a while?
Dude, he's a big star now, he doesn't come here.
I saw the man a few days ago and didn't recognize him. He was sitting in a cafe in Villaggio called Starbucks or something like that.
I remember this boy, he came and sat with us in the cafeteria and didn't have money to buy a cup of tea.
The man gave the boy twenty riyals as wages before my eyes.
What made him like that?
Wow! [A man] sits with important officials in the club, helping him and doing everything he wants.
Can I say something stupid?
Yes, uncle.
My uncle says: Whether you come or go,
I don't know why you support such a weak and bad club.
This is the Foxes team, it's my heart.
When you open my heart
With it, you can catch many foxes.
I didn't hear the poet, Your Honor, who wrote about the verdict.
When we had a match with them.
God, O Thaloob, say, say this poetry, say, say.
Oh my uncle. Oh God, who knows my secret.
My soul is in great pain.
I don't sleep at night.
You know we're the Fox Fan Club.
Can you tell me the winner's name so I can have an exclusive scoop?
We will hold a press conference, and if God wills, we will announce the name of the winner.
"The one who spends"
Thaloud, the famous fan, who was honored today by the management of the Foxes Club with a kind, rare, and amazing gesture.
Really!
Congratulations, Thalob, on this beautiful honor and this wonderful gift, of course.
Do you think this is a pen or a watch?
This is it, Dad, I swear.
This is just a gesture.
I tell you, it's him.
We must inform the police.
Where are you going?
All the fans, all the fans, all the fans.
No, no, no! Oh! That's not it, it's a look-alike.
I'm telling you, it's not him.
I was late.
I don't know the game times, brother!
Now how do we catch him?
We just have to wait until the Fox team plays their next game.
Here he is, here he is, I've seen him.
Alright, let's follow him.
Brother, you're late.
Here it is, here it is, here it is, here it is.
Go after him, follow him, follow him, go after him.
The problem is that we're not sure whether it is him or not.
I tell you, dad! This is it.
I say, with truth and wisdom, that we should go to them and inquire about their leader: where did he come from? How did he come to you? When did he come to you?
Oh father, you always complicate things.
We write about him, I'm sure of it.
Earth, may God preserve it. Yes, it is mine.
Yes, it's registered in my name, yes.
Also the other land next to it.
Tell your father that Abu Abdurrahman al-Subji sends his regards, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye.
No, no, please, I think we made a mistake. Oh! Sorry, son. We were looking for a friend and thought you were him.
O Allah, send prayers, peace, and blessings upon our Prophet Muhammad, who was created from every pair, each unique and not resembling the other.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, sir, thank you.
No, no, God bless you. Sorry, sorry, and thank you, thank you.
Alright, if you please. Sorry, I'm here to help you. Goodbye, may God grant you health. Goodbye.
And you say you're sure!
I don't know what your father will do! I'm very scared.
What should I do, Waleed?
When, when, when, I was walking, stuck the handle of the bag in it.
And try to sort things out now!
Go to your room, go.
I hope nothing bad happens.
I hope nothing bad happens.
Try explaining this to your father now!
Before my father finds out?
Shattered into a million pieces.
Alright, Mom, let's buy something like this as soon as possible.
Before my father comes.
Please, Mother.
You know your father, when he gets angry, he goes crazy.
Go to your room and don't come out.
He did nothing.
By mistake, he hit the vase against the wall, and it fell and broke.
Oh mama, I'm afraid for him.
Where do I know him from?
No, no, no, no, his father is crazy.
Why are you doing this to the boy?
You scared him and terrified him, do you want him to go crazy?
May I say something, my daughter?
Where do you think the boy went?
Alright, if he comes, I'll get in touch with you.
I hope nothing bad happens.
I wonder where Walid is.
Come with me, I'll show you where it is.
Go! Oh my God.
Here it is.
Oh my dear grandmother, I don't want to go back home.
Hide me in your place.
I didn't see the vase.
I swear I don't know.
This is how your father scares you - God willing, he will be guided.
Come with me, son!
Don't be afraid, son, as long as you're at home. Don't worry, son!
I have the solution.
We didn't say anything, Abu Waleed.
Please, I beg you! Oh! Abu Waleed
This time, I'll forgive him for your sake.
What did I find in the house?
Where is he? Where did he go?
Where is he? Where?
Alright, son Oh! Waleed, your father won't do anything for you.
Are you sure, Dad?
Yes, oh! My son, yes.
Are you leaving it here? I'm afraid one of the boys will hit it and break it.
He asked me and said, "I need you to bring me something like what you brought me before, the thing that Walid broke."
He wants exactly this same one. I go and find only this, the last one in the store. He's very lucky. Where are the children?
In the room, he studies.
Alright, take care of him.
Just this one game, and I'll stop.
Oh man!
Alright, then study!
My dad just wants this one game and then we'll study.
Oh dad please, don't tell my uncle.
Dad, don't tell your brother. Dad, this is the last time, I swear.
I'll call him.
And especially you. You've hurt me, am I your friend at the cafe?
I'll tell my brother about you if you don't!
Alright, I won't call. Here's the phone in my pocket. If you study, that's good.
Oh my daughter, why don't you take him to the doctor?
"O Allah, guide her, O Mother."
He scares him to death because he beats him all the time.
Poor boy.
Patience.
Oh, Mama, where is Amalah? I don't see her with you today.
And I went with her.
My sister is not happy with the abayas.
Oh my! My daughter, I told you the story of Monira and her son Naif.
Her son is the age of Waleed. May God keep him.
And the same height.
Yesterday she was telling me she didn't know what to do with her son.
She wants to take him to the hospital, but her husband Youssef
I learned about the story yesterday.
He argued with her and shouted at her.
He says, "Why didn't you tell me?"
This is a psychological condition.
This is against the boy's will.
Let him take his son and tie him to the middle of the backyard.
And then he tells him to do it again and pee in your bed.
Nonsense
What did you say, my beauty! O Um Manira?
I was telling her: Eat, eat.
Eat, drink, and may God protect you.
Oh, my misery.
Oh, Mom, Mom.
Thank God your father didn't find out about you.
But he beats you to death.
Alright, go to the bathroom and take a shower before your father wakes up, or he'll make a disaster out of you.
I won't listen to what you say.
How unfortunate they are.
They cry and tremble.
I'm afraid something might happen to my children.
I have to take them to their uncle to punish them.
I'm confused.
They didn't fail, they succeeded.
Why are you taking them to their uncle's?
Nasser got eighty-four out of fifty.
Why don't they get fifty out of fifty?
Their uncle warned them.
And I must say, I agree with his point of view.
Forgot feelings.
And my brother must punish them.
Alright, I'll get it, I'll get it.
This is the last time, this is the last time.
Fifty out of fifty.
Our time is wasted, and I assure them that he is our son.
Why don't you get a perfect score?
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I've warned you, but you don't listen to what I say.
Don't listen to what I say.
Shame on you, boy!
Hit him again, let me punish him.
It hurts! Stop, uncle.
So next time, review well, review!
Alright, that's enough.
Do you know what I'm going to do?
I'll let you jump one by one and you'll become falafel.
Be cautious when going with your family to public places.
It creates a misunderstanding for us.
Teacher, Waleed is crying.
Why are you crying?
This is an excellent sign.
It's strange that you're crying.
You're supposed to be happy.
Oh my son! Everyone has gone, even the buses. You're waiting for someone to pick you up.
At the school entrance means he is waiting for the bus. The bus has arrived and the boys have gotten off.
Did you hear about the boy who committed suicide today?
They gave him his certificate.
And he threatened his father if he didn't get a perfect score.
Wael, Wael. Come back, Wael! Come back, Wael!
Hello and welcome, on air, to a new episode of our program "Without Borders"
Oil accounts for more than thirty-five percent of the total and diverse sources of energy.
While the rest goes to natural gas, coal, and hydroelectric power.
Therefore, oil is considered the primary source of energy in the world.
The Gulf countries and Iran alone possess 688 billion barrels.
Followed by Iran with twelve percent, then Iraq with ten percent, then Kuwait and the UAE with nine percent.
Each of them later comes to Venezuela with seven percent.
Then Russia by five percent.
The Gulf countries and Iran account for two-thirds of the world's reserves.
Unprecedented prices and exceeded one hundred and forty-nine dollars for the first time in history.
In this episode, we attempt to understand many of the complexities surrounding oil.
And the problems faced by oil-exporting countries.
Despite its prices soaring through the roof
Also the problems faced by citizens and residents in these countries.
Due to inflation and unprecedented rise.
Which will appear shortly on the screen or you can write to us via our website "www.Aljazeera.net"
Because the market today is the main factor.
And not the producing countries.
Today, what determines the price is market power.
No, it's not OPEC.
Certainly, supply and demand play a role of course.
But other factors are
Other factors are political tensions.
In the world
Real estate markets
and stock markets and others
And moved on to speculative prices.
"Goods" like oil, for example
And tomorrow it will reach a thousand dollars, God knows.
The price of oil rose to $44 in 2004.
And today we see even gas prices
Fluctuates from day to day
Oil prices fell below ninety dollars.
And it increased in the second quarter.
Especially with the arrival of spring, secondly because most of the world's filters are under maintenance.
Always, for the second quarter
Seasonal decline in oil demand
In winter, it becomes less than ninety.
And all this indicates that speculation has power and control over the market now.
A lot has changed since we used to go to the traditional market in the past.
The market was influenced by supply and demand.
Seasonal supply and demand
Today, we see that economic growth
Today or yesterday, General Fallon, the commander of the Central Command in Afghanistan and Iraq, resigned.
His resignation sparked a major reaction due to its connection to the so-called expected American war.
Political or Geopolitical Implications
It can quickly affect the oil market, either negatively or positively.
The result will definitely have its impact.
Even as speculators react to political impacts
May affirm, will say, some will tell you that the American war on Iran is coming.
Here, what will happen to the market? The market will be optimistic in some way.
This question, Your Honor, is now in light of what
This returned the region to an atmosphere of tension.
This is the mystery.
But Val might see this scenario.
Quick thinking in the oil market.
Today, we are, and the figures show that there is no shortage.
Let me give you an example: In the past seven weeks.
In the United States of America, its oil reserves have increased by more than half over the past five years.
Today, I mean, I don't mean to say...
Even if it's for the next war, because today I'm telling you, even the world has a profitable warehouse.
Even today's global consumption, you can choose any country and find a long queue of people in front of gas stations.
This is something else.
What are the risks posed by this issue?
What number do you expect it to be? I don't know.
Two hundred or perhaps three hundred dollars might be less.
You may reach these tensions if they become real tensions.
Because the gulf, as you said, represents sixty percent.
In a country far even from oil-producing nations.
You will see how the impact comes back on the oil market.
Up to three hundred dollars.
And we moved from stocks and such to the oil market. Today you'll see over two or three trillion dollars.
Today we see printing.
Guessing it's been more than a hundred days means
That these tensions in the region and awaiting
April, as has been said before, will be the month to decide this war.
God knows, I don't know, I mean, Cheney.
In the area because
This year is the year of elections.
The current U.S. administration still has only a few months left.
George H.W. Bush launched a war on Somalia and sent thirty thousand Canadians in his final days in the White House.
We see, but do not expect events.
But I don't think this scenario will happen.
Because this scenario is expensive.
America won't pay anything, you will pay too, just like Iran and the consumer countries.
America Today
Now it depends on African oil and has many other alternatives.
Look, let's be clear.
You said in the introduction of your speech that sixty percent
Oil reserves
But now they issue twenty-two...
I get oil from West Africa.
I'm from West Africa and anything they export from any other region in the world.
Oil production
Because this is a difficult number and fixed reserves and reserves.
So-called deep water or offshore production from the deep sea
Therefore, the Gulf will remain a tough number.
Caspian Sea oil
I consider them dreams because they are neither truth nor reality.
They vandalize and destroy it.
The important thing is that there are means.
Today, Qatar is the world's largest energy exporter.
Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is why these countries are a tough number.
And the energy needs of countries
It certainly means there's something called a secure supply.
And despite internal objections within the United States, even at the level of General Fallon
But there are still some concerns.
About President Bush who
Try to observe how political risks do not come from the Gulf states.
It means it's not coming from generosity because none of us act generously.
No, there is too much kindness in dealing with it.
But not "in the current field"
We are not part of the charity.
Or be generous.
But Karim is generous to Westerners, not to anyone else.
With America in particular
Where the market is.
Wherever we find economic returns, we will go.
We won't do it.
Like oil and gas
You're going to put it down for generosity.
I have the proof.
I have the proof.
Over sixty to seventy dollars
Not the rise in prices.
But the decline of the US dollar that you insist on
You are ranked first among the GCC countries and OPEC members.
That exports must be in dollars and are rejected.
Currency exchange despite its collapse and therefore
Even if the odds aren't in your favor.
No, I didn't say it has to be 70.
It's the experts' talk, not mine.
Okay, the dollar has fallen by thirty percent and oil has risen more than this decline.
That means if we take the base year as 2004
We observe that oil prices fluctuate between thirty, thirty-five, thirty, and thirty-three dollars.
Of course, it means
That the price of oil has increased.
But it's a small increase, honorable deputy.
It means, if we take it.
We consider it now.
Even at these prices
I mean if we compare it to 2004.
Until his rate of descent exceeded that of the US dollar.
The exciting thing is
Interacting with the weakening dollar
As the dollar falls, oil prices rise.
This is also something the market is starting to sense.
Our interest now is to reduce.
No, the circumstances have changed. Perhaps at the beginning of the downturn two years ago they were saying this, but the circumstances have changed now.
And the dollar began to lose value against other major currencies like the euro and the pound.
So the question is, why did you peg your currency to the dollar?
Weak currency, no coverage.
This is a historical era.
Petroleum and its derivatives are priced in dollars, even for European production in the North Sea, Russia, and Norway.
You say America in the mid-seventies.
Removed the gold covering that used to envelop the American dollar.
What happens
Alright then, tell me what's correct.
OPEC includes
Four Gulf states
Qatar, Kuwait, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia
Today, OPEC's share in the global market
Forty percent
If we say today that the world consumes fifty to eighty million barrels
Those that deal in dollars for oil pricing.
If you put a price with another currency, everyone will do the same.
You can't.
All oil-producing countries must agree.
You, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, are a summer cloud.
Those who own 66% of the world's reserves are the big people.
Reserves, but I'm thinking of exporting them.
Including Venezuela, Libya, and Iran.
Cameron, Angola, and all these countries organized under OPEC
Her market share does not exceed forty percent.
Non-OPEC producer and exporter
And this cannot be related to the forty percent.
You can't do it alone unless...
In some countries that tried
Not a real attempt.
It's you who's being rejected because of American ties.
From dollars to another currency.
All oil-producing countries
He used to export only one barrel before.
It's a pity they didn't import them.
His currency reached a great height.
And he sells his oil in dollars.
In his transactions or receipts in the future, he received his funds in dollars and then converted them to his local currency.
Its currency is not tied to the dollar.
True, but
But it's your problem too; you sell in dollars, but if your currency isn't pegged to the dollar, you won't have an issue.
My main question now is
What are the concerns and implications of pegging your currency to the dollar amid a declining dollar?
I've been engaged for many years.
Especially in the 1970s when the dollar was a very strong currency and had immense power.
This disengagement is not easy.
Divorce is easy.
No, not here.
Divorce has expenses.
Works for these countries, not against them.
Profit and loss
Dow Jones announced yesterday that there are 4 countries, including Qatar.
But there is also a report in the Financial Gulf Newspaper stating that there are four Gulf countries, of course, since Oman withdrew from the unified Gulf currency.
I read a statement in Dow Jones, and I don't think it's a genuine statement.
The Governor of the Qatar Central Bank has denied.
He said yes and that there will be a study, but all Gulf countries must also be involved.
Profit and loss must be examined very carefully, free from emotions.
Leave the matter for study and until they come.
Look, I can bring other economists who can provide another study.
Which contradicts this study.
The global house said something simple and organized and was issued in a report on March 8.
Just four days ago
The global home is the simple solution and needs a non-political decision.
The political decision can be summarized in two things.
Not three, first thing.
His intentions or the five with Kuwait, about its intentions in two thousand and ten to issue the currency or study the issuance of a unified Gulf currency.
The second point is to issue a decision to eliminate the dollar.
Firstly, regarding the single currency.
From my personal point of view
To know the unified Gulf currency
This currency will be strong.
Will be
Perhaps one of the strong currencies in the world as you said.
And what will come from the reserves and the vast revenues
That's why the Prime Minister emphasized it when he said:
Gulf countries, because no single nation can do it alone.
Unless it has a strong economic content
And today's economic growth, even to the euro, we see it.
Of course, don't forget that the central bank plays a significant role.
In the evaluation
And calculate the profit and loss.
From all this news
Tense situation
As observers have said, the global organization has stated that this inflation will continue.
A long time in Gulf countries but the solution is in the hands of governments.
Some countries have raised salaries by 70%, such as the UAE.
To stop the inflation process
And here's my question now: when will you increase the salaries of those poor people?
I'll hear your answer after a short announcement.
Today's episode: Oil reserves and daily production of the Gulf Cooperation Council states, Saudi Arabia
She has 246 billion in reserves.
And two out of every ten barrels.
Producing nine out of ten daily.
One million, one hundred and one and a half in Kuwait produces one billion and produces twenty-seven million.
Qatar's population is fifteen billion and twelve billion, with a production of five hundred and fifty thousand. Oman's population is five and six tenths of a billion, with a production of seven hundred and seven thousand.
Bahrain has one hundred and twenty-five million and produced thirty-five thousand.
The total revenue was 30.8 billion annually.
From 2003 to 2007
Europe one hundred billion
Sixty-six billion in the Middle East and forty billion.
In Asia and other countries
While the gross domestic product of the Gulf Cooperation Council states in 2006 was seven hundred and seventeen.
The total in 2007 is expected to be 79.97 billion.
To be in the year two thousand, nine hundred and twelve and one-tenth billion.
While inflation continues to devour the salaries of employees and people working in this field.
But it will increase in 2008 to 8.3 percent.
Kuwait 14% but is expected to be 8.9 out of 10 in 2008
He will be ten years old while Saudi Arabia was six and a half years old and she will turn six.
And eight out of ten
Salaries are being eaten.
So, what are the amounts and percentages that you will give to the poor here?
If we want to solve the problem
Real solution
Always the salaries, always the increasing salaries.
The solution is not that.
I'm not against raising salaries.
What happens, I, what happens
We always
Of course, there is faith.
In the case of an increase, an increase without control over inflation will cause inflation to eat up all these increases.
To tackle inflation, a high-level committee comprising all experts and specialists is needed.
And now this committee is developing
Because wages are increasing in the world
And of course, the golden rule of economics states
It never ends.
And whatever it is
Salaries are increased significantly, no matter how much they increase.
Deflation will increase.
The solution is necessary and must be found.
In a scientific study, Bayt.com, the specialized employment institute, conducted a study with the help of the British company YouGov Siraj.
They conducted a survey of fifteen thousand employees working in Gulf countries in twenty key sectors.
Especially experts and those with professions have job dissatisfaction.
Because inflation here has started to devour.
Especially those with experience.
You're considering moving from this country where inflation is rampant.
Now you will lose.
This simple concept, and you put the simple concept and try to implement it.
The solution to the inflation problem is to increase salaries.
Balance exists.
It's there.
We are concerned, the state is concerned, and we are doing our best.
To solve this problem with a real solution.
Temporary solutions never solve the problem but rather exacerbate it.
Increasing it means
We hope to have more time before this committee puts forward its recommendations.
All requests
This boredom and you, Ambassador Joy.
Boredom will always exist.
True, but the government intervened and capped the increases at forty percent.
No, there's an important point about raises here.
Regarding promotions, you only want Qataris, as if non-Qataris were working in Burkina Faso and Zimbabwe.
It takes into account Qataris but does not take into account expatriates.
While the highest percentage is found in it.
You, Ahmed, live in Qatar, not in Germany.
And everyone talks about it and suffers.
A much higher salary than in the public sector.
On the contrary, we saw
In the public sector
On the contrary, the public sector becomes
Because the best units and competencies started.
I also read a report, as you know, we are in the oil field.
From work
Follow our experts.
Engineering and workers coming from outside Qatar
Because we also interact with the global market.
For all these things, what is the average salary increase?
Hope in Allah, the Exalted, but we say...
The government has a plan.
And I say that controlling inflation is more important.
Temporary solution
And we'll see, I'm sure.
That there will be
Positive results
It will be on the verge of fifteen percent.
Alright, the second nice report says that twenty-two billion barrels of oil will come to you and thirty-four billion cubic meters of gas.
No comment, it's not a spraying operation.
Procedures, of course we do.
But talk of economic growth must also reflect on people.
And that reflects any economic growth today, Qatar has the highest economic growth in the world.
The reverse is also true.
Similarly, the massive "carriers" in the country are part
Even if it weren't for this massive and "burdening" project
In this country, he will not be part of the inflation.
I caused some inflation.
This also led to a lot of criticism in the market.
Firstly, regarding the link between the dollar and oil.
Sold oil for protection.
I am from the United States of America, and thus stability in power.
Thank you
Saad al-Ghamdi from Saudi Arabia, your question Saad.
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.
Honestly, it's a good episode and a good title.
What I really want to talk about is that the region is now under American policies.
America's policy in its current war, in addition to its cultural war it's trying to wage against Islam, is a global economic war.
Now in China
And the American deficit with Japan also reached thirty-six billion dollars.
And Japan has already invested in 2000.
With America to the equivalent of nine.
Billions while now investing with the European Union in excess of twenty-seven billion dollars
To preserve American policy and make the dollar an unavoidable currency throughout the world.
I tell my brother to buy now.
And the Gulf region became
As a place
Thank you, Brother Saad.
Mohamed El-Wasif from Egypt
Hello, Mr. Representative.
The Arab rulers in the Middle East, sir, remind me of...
When it is
When there are demands to adjust prices
Adjust the salaries based on the revenues as you said, Your Excellency the Minister.
In Qatar, we considered you a role model.
And their insistence on not promising an increase is an Arab style.
We want to look at Qatar like Abu Treika.
He has the right to say what he wants. Do you have a question? It's certainly his right; he is responsible for this policy.
The question first
Saeed must take that into consideration.
This is the second time he should respond to the people's opinions.
With the poor as I said, because they are from countries that need special care.
Arab leaders don't care about the poor.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
Good evening to you and good evening to your happiness.
I want a raise, too.
Salaries are excellent and good. This is good.
Okay, thank you for the topic we need and suffer from.
I am with the poor and will always be with them, God willing. We know that there are no poor people in Qatar, and we are certain of this.
And that it is judged that, as he said, the money goes to the ruler's family and the ruler.
And this is the important question now.
Let's start by answering the brothers.
I can't judge.
What happens to wealth?
Now there are new cities like Lusail and Pearl and other places, and this means that Qatar is expanding.
This is not the case.
Suitable urban plan
In short, because we have two minutes, tell us what Qatar will go for.
Qatar now, there is a post-oil and gas Qatar.
There is a clear policy of the state.
Because that's how it is.
Non-renewable origin
Because it is a non-renewable resource.
So today the trend in the State of Qatar is...
The capital of the Middle East in education
Today we see the Education City.
Today, this educational city includes the best colleges in the world.
Building medical cities, media cities, and financial cities
Because oil and gas today
No, of course we don't imitate anyone.
Other satellite channels
Not just the island, you will make a hundred islands, and of course we will not stand against the island.
Because he is my brother. These countries are our countries in the Gulf now.
In the seventies, the change is now, everyone remembers the change of the seventies.
Now when we see what Qatar has in terms of growth.
This requires a special episode about Qatar in the post-oil era.
With our vision about oil, its future, and its resources in the region, especially in Qatar. In conclusion, my greetings to the program team.
I am Ahmed Mansour, greeting you without borders, and peace be upon you.
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.
Greetings from Doha, the capital of Qatar, this week.
And I welcome you to a new episode of our program "Without Borders"
At the same time that Qatar hosts the largest US military base outside the United States, Al Udeid Air Base
With the United States' enemies in the region
Like Iran and Syria
Its doors are open to leaders.
In fact, Hamas leaders enjoy special relations with the Qatari leadership.
And the Emir of Qatar was the only Arab leader
Who visited the southern suburbs of Beirut, destroyed by Israel during the Lebanon War in the summer of 2006
And he continues to provide unlimited support to rebuild what Israel destroyed in Lebanon.
And when Qatar is reconciled
With her older sister in Saudi Arabia for about two years.
Clashes with the regime in Egypt at the same time
Like the Lebanese file in which he succeeded while others failed.
The Lebanese leaders gathered in Doha where they signed an agreement that led them to safety.
To the final elections
Similarly difficult files
To be keen to be the driver of these files, not just a passenger.
The smallest Arab country
In today's episode
We are trying to understand the foundation and principles upon which Qatari foreign policy is based.
And for whose benefit?
Qatar, the smallest country by area and population, plays these significant roles.
And what qualifications enable him to do that?
And this will be in a live dialogue with the Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister.
For viewers who wish to participate, they can contact us through the program's numbers, which will appear on the screen in a moment.
The visit made by the Emir of Qatar.
Al Jazeera's roar to strengthen ties with Saudi Arabia
From the past like Saudi Arabia's attempt to seize the Qatari government with the help of the Al-Murra tribe.
In its issue published on June 20th last month
What is the nature of the secret deal?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Many things that are not
I don't think it's correct.
In many interviews here on this program, I've always said that the right thing is
And we consider it the backbone.
I am from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
There was a misunderstanding.
Moreover,
And different viewpoints.
It is true that the border issue was resolved, and it was a major obstacle.
The historical Saudi-Qatari ties were special.
These links, if we notice them.
Between the two countries and the two families.
Destroyed by misunderstanding
Neither us nor them.
Because there are no conditions between brothers.
And it has been accomplished, and now relations are in a state where I can confirm that they are excellent.
In the interest of the Cooperation Council
But how was the situation between the island and Saudi Arabia improving while the island was the obstacle and the reason that led to the year 2002?
There's an important point.
And I repeat, if you go back to all the shows, I always said
Not just the older sister, but I was saying that our reliance in the Cooperation Council is on
That Saudi Arabia is an important country in the region.
We value our relationship with her.
There was some heated media exchange, and it was clear to both parties.
These countries find themselves
Failed when the brothers agreed.
Especially the Qatari Saud family
They found themselves in conflict.
Where there are no camels.
And I don't think it's a strategy of anyone involved in this conflict.
But please, Sheikh, allow me to put things in their proper context or dot the i's.
Many observers find the island to have changed significantly in the past two years.
At a time when the conditions criticized on Al Jazeera's screen are still ongoing.
Because of what is happening inside Saudi Arabia.
Are they still standing, whether detainees, opponents, or others?
The island stopped dealing with these issues.
Even Al Jazeera's coverage of the Hajj has changed.
Praising the system and what the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques is doing at a time of difference.
First, you can ask the island management about this matter. Don't ask me because I
That brings together the two countries.
For the stability of the region
This strategy continued and reinforced the stability of the region.
The area you mean is the Gulf region.
Gulf Region
There are many cases surrounding the Gulf region.
Also, the call of the custodian of the two holy mosques in Kuwait.
He had an impact on all listeners and the entire Arab world.
Spoke from the heart about resolving, surpassing, and burying Arab disputes.
Not just in terms of views.
No, it's about politics, and politics is about perspectives.
In the Arab world, it is considered
A type of war
While in the developed world
Talking about the same interest.
I have stayed for many years now.
The situation now
Listen first.
On this subject, there is a difference from the other subject.
The idea of a small country standing up to larger nations and making them feel weak.
Any difference or misunderstanding
He had his reasons.
And its causes have ended.
It ended because of our leaders' decision.
Is there insurance for future relationships?
Between the two parties, there are guarantees.
Based on the brotherhood, love, and interests that unite the two countries.
And the leaders, their speech is considered more than a document.
Between Qatar and Saudi Arabia to develop this relationship.
We greatly hope for this Saudi-Qatari relationship to develop.
For the best and more there are fields
This relationship is like our relationship with Arab countries, the other Gulf states.
Because Qatar is an important country.
Alright, Saudi Arabia is an important country.
What is Egypt to Qatar? Because it's bad that at the same time you reconciled with Saudi Arabia.
And three organizations, namely Hezbollah.
Al Jazeera is a channel.
Are you pro or against the regime in Egypt, the largest Arab country?
Let me start with this first.
Egyptian people
And we respect the Egyptian nation.
And its benefit
With many Arab issues and the sacrifices of the Egyptian nation
And this is the case.
Some will think that through this case, we are trying to reach an understanding with the brothers in Egypt.
In light of what you say, you respect Egypt and the Egyptian people.
We believe he is a good person.
Our differences with Egypt are on two points.
Or a single point.
We were accused of planning to overthrow Gaza, and I don't believe it.
And we do not interfere.
In cases that belong to other countries
He does not believe in interfering in the affairs of any country unless there is room for reform.
Do you mean that you intervened in the Hamas coup against the authority in Gaza?
Of course, I don't deny that we didn't know about the issue as much as they did through the media.
We have relations with Hamas and we have relations with others.
What made Egypt differ or have a dispute with you on this point?
I'll come back to this.
Hezbollah plot
Hezbollah and
But I'm talking about my country.
We were very surprised by this topic.
Shake for Qatar
What the pyramids said.
The pyramids said: ...
Attacking Egypt and its position.
Can I reply?
We return to the plot they mentioned.
The days will reveal that.
The beginning was not from the Gaza conference.
And I absolve the Egyptian people and President Hosni Mubarak of that.
If we go back to the Lighthouse Conference
After the Madrid conference, do you remember the port that was held in Doha?
And that was a coincidence, and when it was scheduled to hold the conference with us.
They said they didn't want to hold the conference.
Oh people, we know that you are coordinating with Israel.
"Heading to Qatar and this is it"
What are we trying to understand why?
Our session was a waste, and wasting time is good.
It has two parts.
Who are they?
There is a disagreement.
In political orientation
If we look at the gas conference that was held
Prince spoke with all the presidents, including his brother President Hosni Mubarak.
We were informed by a foreign state.
Brothers in Egypt have a viewpoint on the matter that it should not be concluded.
People are being killed and we're just watching.
If you don't want to hold it in Doha, we can hold it anywhere in the Arab League.
It would be shameful to discuss the issue at the Kuwait conference.
By Israel, and the Western world stands and watches what is happening.
When we said we're all okay now, this is normal, and there is no power except from God. We Arabs cannot stop it, nor has any major country prevented this war.
Egypt's request for a declaration of a cessation of hostilities in Gaza, after an hour of fighting stopped.
Even we
We should not deal with the Arab street with such innocence; our disagreement with the brothers is on one point.
This is within international standards.
And an insufficient number of hospitals and doctors who are caught at the borders.
It was you who stood at the border.
There, and no one can enter.
They didn't take it well.
Because Gaza is next to Egypt and is considered part of its national territory.
When we talk about any human issue anywhere in the world, we are talking about a human issue.
And we respect sovereignty in Egypt.
And we know her position, but this does not harm the Egyptian position.
And we hope for a lot from Egypt.
The largest Arab country
We believe she is capable of amplifying our voices and the voices of others from the Arab world.
To all other parties
Even the rescue mission after Gaza.
That the Europeans tried to save her.
What happened in Gaza
Whether it's a conference or a presentation and so on, I consider it a rescue for the government.
We were not invited to a conference, but to coordinate between the Gulf countries.
We were gathered in the Cooperation Council.
These amounts will not be issued to any party.
but will be released to
The affected parties in Gaza
And this was direct.
Because entry is not allowed from any side.
I am happy for Egypt, and all the Qatari people are happy for Egypt because Egypt...
Egypt's victory in political issues is very important to us.
But you expect
Just give me two minutes.
One of the ministers was boasting about what had been exiled and said:
And whoever harms Egypt, we cut off his leg and break his arm.
Frankly, I think this official has done his country a disservice.
In fact, they didn't fail, and they didn't talk about anything but themselves.
What helped them in this, and I said this to our brothers in Saudi Arabia, the Saudis' intervention because the king has wisdom in this matter.
To end things in the Arab world
We agreed.
The king will decide that this is in the best interest.
We accepted King Abdullah's decision because we respect and trust him.
But to say that we stopped them is an insult to those we stopped.
As if they were students in a school.
I think this
The limit has been reached.
He believes he must impose his strength.
We apologize, we apologize for this.
If you think the small state has no right, its right is usurped.
And you come and bring your noise to Darfur.
It's an Arab decision at the Arab League.
An African decision and a United Nations decision
I think the main problem is
Hezbollah plot plus Qatar
I don't know what kind of plot, in Qatar.
If that happens, perhaps after the swine flu appeared somewhere, it will be the reason behind the spread of this pandemic in Qatar.
Qatar is a peaceful country that knows its size and capabilities.
But Qatar has a point of view.
Qatar has a modest foreign policy.
If Qatar can solve any Arab issue, we consider it an honor for us.
Because any Arab conflict
We believe that any Arab dispute can weaken our position regarding our main issues, namely Palestine and all the other challenges we face.
The Arab world has become a recipient.
Even our analysis has become like theirs.
Western analysis
But there is one thing we know, we know what happened in Pakistan.
In a way, I want them to welcome me and roll out the red carpet for me in Washington.
Is anyone blaming Qatar?
Did Qatar wrong any Arab country?
Try to contribute money.
These contributions are provocative.
I can pass by to say hello to you and you say: You're saying hello to challenge me.
This is another case, it means that you have a problem or you have a deficiency.
This topic doesn't concern me, it concerns you.
But if you have internal problems
We always say it.
Especially after the speech of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah
In Kuwait and I know this man is honest.
A man says what will be.
My heart always says this.
I always say this.
I always say, even in the midst of our dispute with Saudi Arabia, I say
And you can refer to all the documents you have on the island, but
The case is different from
From one part, we said no, this is everything, we stop at this point.
And we tried as much as we could.
I don't want to get into this topic.
Let them see their affairs and where their mistakes lie.
And we see our errors, but it doesn't mean that everything we have is correct.
Do you mean this, Your Highness?
To the existence of internal problems in Egypt.
And they want to get out of it.
Do you deny that Qatar contributes in any form of conspiracy against Egypt externally and tries to break its relations with Turkey or any other country?
It seems we have superpowers.
They are seventy million, if we could, not eighty million.
They also have a problem that needs to be solved.
That you played a role in the Shalit case, despite knowing that this file is important to the Egyptian government.
And you ask with the French.
We received a call from a friendly nation.
There's an issue that needs to be addressed. We said, "This issue is Egyptian," and they replied, "It's a matter for the brothers."
We want to regard this case as a request.
From Israel and another country, we want to see another part.
When we saw this, we told them that if the same conditions applied, the brothers should talk to the brothers in Egypt.
And we announced this, I mean, is there a responsible person who can say we are in this, meaning that he deceived the Arab League.
This means he is a poor man.
How did he allow us to pass?
To keep President Mahmoud Abbas in office
We endorsed that.
Does he address his people? Does he address us? Does he address the Arab world?
The problem is from you.
I think this is a healthy phenomenon.
I do not own the island, as I have been accused.
And the island must enter the media competition as there are many media outlets in the West.
There are many media entities, and at some point, they all insult each other.
But after a while, they will reach maturity.
It can be or not be.
Firstly, our position with Saudi Arabia is different.
Even if we concede to Saudi Arabia, we accept it in Qatar.
Important relationships
Egypt is an important country, but there is a special relationship with Saudi Arabia.
There's also a special relationship between Egypt and any other Arab country; Egypt is the largest Arab country.
This is true, but we have a history with Saudi Arabia and the relationship is different.
It's a personal dispute between some officials here and there.
We respect the Egyptian president.
I hope it's just a policy disagreement in terms of perspectives.
I told you the problem when there was an attack on Gaza.
The second problem is that they have issues with us, and so far we don't know what Qatar did to cause this.
Why don't you try to schedule a meeting between the Egyptian president and the emir now?
Saudi Arabia intervened in this matter.
When the matter was leaked to the press, they initially said it was a secret meeting, but we found out about it the next morning.
I had a meeting with Omar Suleiman.
In Saudi Arabia
Explosion without return
And I cannot tell you that we agree on everything.
Let's say that so no one explains it away as you comparing yourself.
But dignity is dignity, whether with the young or with the old.
The minister said, "If Egypt obtains the appropriate satisfaction."
Children's satisfaction
I don't think Egypt is any bigger than that. I think it doesn't have the right expression.
Do you have a vision for solving problems with Egypt, or are you like the Egyptian people, waiting for divine intervention?
Please, I don't want to talk about divine intervention or anything like that because only God knows who will live and who will die.
And I pray.
Someone tricked him into thinking there was a way.
And our pride in Egypt.
That there is a certain way
Either you stand with me or against me.
And every pain felt by the Arab citizen
In the Arab world, we struggle with this, and it is the policy of His Highness the Emir.
Nations derive their strength from sources of power.
The United States has the sources of China's power and the sources of France's power and the source of power of a small country like Qatar.
Our faith in God
What's clear is
You're trying.
But we are a small country, and I keep that in mind.
And I will repeat it a hundred times.
So that no one can say we have any sensitivities.
That no one takes from us
To Israel, I've disturbed you now.
Okay, before I go to Israel.
How can you solve the problem with Egypt?
What's going on now?
And every day they lodge a complaint with America if I can tell you about the big countries you were talking about.
They deal with us on the basis of interests, and accordingly.
All complaints and all
To cause a rift in the relationship.
I believe that any great nation that does that will affect its image.
Our Arab pride will also be affected if we complain to each other.
Everything comes and we know everything.
Our solution is based on Arab interests.
We're here for them if they need anything.
Are there steps to repair relationships?
But I know that there are good relations between the President and His Highness the Prince.
If there's someone pulling the strings.
Against the alliance of the two countries and the two leaderships, he will lose himself.
No, it might be tomorrow, it might be in ten years, to be honest, I don't know, but from our side, if we're invited to a conference, we'll be there.
We will invite anyone to attend the conference, and we will attend and announce our opinion at the conference if we have a viewpoint.
We can't
Because Egypt is our older sister, but we have different perspectives and discuss things together.
This is all that is required, and when the time comes, we will be very happy.
What was canceled due to this policy.
As I said, we respect the Egyptian people.
Of course you asked about the number of cancelled contracts, ask about the number of Egyptians who came to Qatar at the same time.
But as a state policy, as I told you, the Egyptian people in Qatar are very close to our hearts.
Now, on the fourth of last June, it stirred the feelings of Arab countries when it closed the Israeli office, published in the Arts newspaper on June 4th.
Why do you say we've been dragging our feet when we've been trying to get this done for 12 years?
When everyone was campaigning for reconciliation with Israel and secret meetings were being held between Arab states and Israel.
And after the reconciliation of most Arabs
With Israel, whether under the table or on the table, or talk to it in any way.
If we wanted to stir emotions, we would have stirred them at the previous Islamic conference.
At the United Nations, Nasser's ally hosted a dinner for Israeli Ambassador Gabriela Shalev.
He was one of the many guests who attended this party, and I don't know why the ambassador held it.
Because at the United Nations we sit next to Israel, and no one can deny that.
Or we find a glimmer of hope to alleviate the pain of our Palestinian brothers.
Now the management has changed, and I had a small space for the Egyptian issue, but unfortunately
What I was, you were.
My question is about the United States and the new administration and its impact on your (Qatari) relationship with the United States, given the presence of the largest military base in Qatar.
There are differences in opinions.
Jad is serious about solving many issues in the region.
And if they are serious, we will help them as much as we can.
We expect a special relationship or a resolution to the problems that existed between you and the Bush administration.
Many of these cases have been resolved.
The Emir of Qatar spoke yesterday in Paris about what is happening in Iran.
And you have special relations with Iran despite its poor relations with the United States.
We must first put it in the context of internal affairs because we have to respect every country and its internal affairs.
Lebanon after the elections
Before the elections, Saad Hariri said on this program that the Doha Agreement ends with the formation of elections.
Is this also your vision, or do you think the agreement is still valid, or will you have to reach a new agreement?
The Doha agreement was for a phase that would lead them to hold peaceful elections.
A year and a half has passed since the Doha Agreement.
We were following it day after day, minute after minute, until they reached the elections according to the Doha Agreement.
That we recently intervened in one of the constituencies to correct some misunderstandings that had occurred.
But you still have something to do with the arrangements in Lebanon.
We are always close to Lebanon, you know how much Qataris love Lebanon and how they go there.
The first country I visited after a Western country was Lebanon.
A quick Q&A about what's happening in Yemen
You intervened in the case of the two girls, and there are accusations that you supported them.
Or your involvement made them confront the state, and now there is a greater danger, the danger of the South.
And we suffered a lot, and this indicates the reason we are standing here and not there in Qatar.
And the truth is, we faced great pressures, but this was our vision and the position of His Highness the Amir.
The topic of the hot debate.
And its stability affects us positively, and its instability affects us negatively.
We intervened in an honest mediation between two parties.
We signed an agreement.
But I understand if this was intended to be used for other reasons.
And we were with them, and we are with them in all cases.
And it's not based on a truth.
I see that we have no need.
We sell them.
I say this with apologies, as I know there is a large Arab audience that disagrees with me.
Dear viewer, thank you also for listening, hoping that we have clarified some of Qatar's foreign policy to you.
In conclusion, greetings from the program team. This is Ahmed Mansour greeting you from "Without Borders."
I ask Allah for your safety and blessings.
Welcome, viewers. Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you. Welcome to this special encounter.
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State of Qatar
Of course, why would I say it's a special and exceptional interview?
Qatar and this man in particular was the main sponsor.
Sir, a simple and direct question.
I believe that happened due to an Arab consensus from the beginning.
And we tried that when we went to the United Nations.
Arab consensus was important, and Lebanese management from both sides was important.
To get some results
External intervention is very important.
Many opinions and suggestions from the outside.
Lebanese and international Arabic, if you want to say.
She went through stages, but they meant something.
That nothing is unless it means that these stages were there.
Does that mean the complexities in Lebanon
Since the time of truth
I mean when you were all gathered and now you've directly intervened in the Lebanese line and the Lebanese file.
Did you find out that the Lebanese complex is very large?
A Lebanese Arabic international regional code needs to be decoded.
Or it's a simple complication, but it's been magnified due to external interference.
Because we know that Lebanon is a beacon for journalism, a beacon for culture, a beacon for tourism, and a beacon for many things.
Lebanese should not allow
Impact on peace and security in Lebanon
The first problem
What are the repercussions of the situation in Lebanon?
I suddenly decided after 24 hours to take everyone on one plane.
From the plane straight to meet the Emir of Qatar.
They didn't expect it. They wouldn't rest for a minute unless I was kind to them.
The secret is in not letting them rest and making them think a lot.
Make a lot of calls.
We are floating the idea of bringing them to Doha because we need the atmosphere.
Or gather them with many difficulties.
In many circumstances
We are taking them out of these circumstances into conditions where they can find a solution.
If we want to succeed, let's get them out of this atmosphere.
And quickly.
God created success for us with the statement of the gun or the statement of Beirut.
And we succeeded because they agreed to go to Doha.
The parties decided to go to Doha.
Some thought that Qatar favored one party over the other.
And I'm from Beirut, but...
His Highness's policy if we are mediators
In this process
Okay, frankly.
Did you consult seriously?
with the main parties concerned at least with what is happening here in the Kingdom of Lebanon, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Syria
Especially the brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, I spoke with Prince Saud.
He expressed his support for the idea.
We benefited from Prince Saud.
Everyone needed a solution.
Her justifications are weak.
If we rely on logic
Her justifications are weak.
It had to be removed because there is tension in Palestine.
And there is the issue of the Iranian nuclear file.
The Arab League must have a mechanism to resolve issues.
Is the African Union better than us at resolving issues?
And try to bring the parties together.
Holding conferences to find solutions, yet why can't the Arabs, with their ancient ties, manage to do so?
Unite the Arabs, or gather the parties if you find them, or intervene to support the oppressed.
That should be under study.
If we want there to be a wake-up call for the Arab League, not the Arab world.
The Arab League is just a tool for implementation.
One of the officials was here, and he is Speaker Nabih Berri.
requires
Now it seems that the Lebanese have agreed.
Alright, listen up.
And on it is dew.
What never led to a result.
In the interest of the Arab cause
That will be considered a strength for the Arabs.
We tried it.
At the United Nations when we went for the Doha Agreement.
Agendas are made for solutions, not for other reasons.
There is no doubt that
And a more important role in the entire Arab world
is placed
Stop it with our consent.
So that others may come and help us.
Because this is a serious matter.
Why have we reached the stage where everyone is playing in our neighborhood?
In our garden
It is extremely important to put the interests of our people first.
Now we need an Arab university after this agreement to see what we will do with our Palestinian brothers.
What are we going to do for Sumer?
What are we going to do for Somalia? Isn't it a member of the Arab League?
Sudan is not in the Arab League! Iraq is not in the Arab League! Why don't we try?
We are part of the Arab world and small.
I hope this isn't a suggestion, this idea.
Qatar has good relations with Syria and Saudi Arabia.
I think that first, if we're not asked to do something, we'll do what we can.
But I am certain that His Royal Highness King Abdullah
King of Saudi Arabia
And brothers of President Bashar
Because Saudi Arabia and Syria had a historic agreement.
It can only be a transient stage.
And with God's permission, we will find it.
But still, I insist on asking, is this good for you? Could you possibly take a role in this part?
Even if it's not public yet, you have a kind of confidence.
We are seeking any rapprochement between Arab countries.
And this has been His Highness's policy since the beginning, but this matter...
Does what happened in Lebanon indicate that the region is on the verge of making serious adjustments?
Or what happened in Lebanon is an internal Lebanese affair for the region.
Attached to this case
I wish the opposite. I wish this were true.
The beginning of a new phase in the Arab world.
We can create.
He will be somewhere else.
In other words, Ambassador, are you concerned about the escalation that has been present for some time?
At least until the end of George Bush's presidency.
There is no doubt that I am still concerned about Palestine, now the Gaza issue.
I want to ask
We need something else.
He asked me to pay attention to the humanitarian aspect in Palestine.
We can't give them medicine.
No food.
Electricity for the patient in the hospital.
He who dies if the power is cut off.
I wish
The Arab League agrees to an amount for this food and medicine issue, we call it food and medicine.
What we want from the Red Crescent is not to hand her over.
Let the Red Cross handle it.
But please forgive me, the Arab side is committed to this Israeli siege.
What I want is to avoid going into details. All I'm saying is that as Arabs, we should provide medicine and food even if we don't agree with Hamas.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has made a great effort and pledged in the Holy Kaaba.
Because this disagreement will not benefit the other party.
Our saying "Don't deal with this party because we will find you a solution" is not correct.
And I
So far, there is no evidence of a solution.
Do you fear an American-Iranian confrontation in the coming period, or do you expect it?
Of course, this is possible.
At least I'm talking about Qatar.
Iran is an important neighbor to us.
We may not agree with all of their policies, or they may not agree with our policies in Qatar.
For example, they tell us they don't want you to have relations or connections with Israel.
Perhaps some consider you necessarily a part of it due to the American bases located there.
We know how to handle this.
Some said that the visit of the Emir of Qatar to Saudi Arabia
He might have met, consulted, or spoken with the Saudi host.
In Istanbul, negotiations between Syria and Israel.
And I can say that it's a coincidence.
The second subject was that the Saudi kingdom was keen to find a solution to it, and I was in contact with Prince Saud.
What happened in the past few hours
Change tactics to change negotiation tactics.
From your side or from other parties
We are responsible for
From all sides, we locked ourselves in the room.
Finally, we found ourselves... and then His Highness's intervention was very important.
And part of it is intervention work.
Without mentioning it now, it's over.
And his message was clear when he said, "We know our size, our place, and our role, and so on."
He wanted to play a role without provoking any other party.
Whether Arab, national, or regional
But still
I became responsible.
Did you want that or not?
We try to prevent some envy because we are a nation.
that these countries
Able or
I believe this will be a profitable partnership.
The final question, is your relationship with Washington long-term, ordinary or special?
I can say that our relationship with Washington is good.
Which means we don't agree in all cases.
But this is our right, if they talk about democracy, this is democracy.
How good it is, how can you interpret it on earth?
If we talk about the economy, it's excellent, and if we talk about education, it's excellent.
Health too, but if we're talking about politics, I can say it's good.
In your opinion, and clarify that in the next phase.
I believe that we're leaving the confrontation with Israel aside.
And if we wanted to stop the play in the Arab court
And repair the enmity between the Palestinians.
We agree on one opinion so that we are a respected force.
I don't think we have
To be effective
Thank you, viewers, for watching. We'll meet again, God willing. Best regards.
Welcome to our viewers in this dialogue with the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani.
In this dialogue
We attempt to explore the Arab political reality and the efforts of Arabs.
Welcome, Sheikh.
To understand what's happening in Gaza.
And I hope through this dialogue that we can
Shed light on some of your questions.
The Israeli entry into Gaza in a brutal manner.
Our goal was to have a unified Arab stance.
Dealing with friendly nations
Sister countries
And how do we find a clear and strong Arab stance taken by the Arab countries?
Then we find the reconciliation areas.
From our position, we know that more than one Arab country has been violated.
In an offensive manner
And no one was punished while
We are punished for everything, whether intentionally or not.
We are the specialized people.
In the world and the only ones always targeted
Always disciplined in some way
I think
To the extent that we won't be able
Gathering at the leadership level
To halt the discipline campaign
We didn't want to create a rift in the Arab world.
And there were five other verbal agreements.
By a two-thirds majority
But the purpose of the meeting is not
They wish it were true and our view were wrong because the goal
He is the solution to the problem, not a summit.
But will it be solved at the expense of Palestinian blood?
What we are asking for now is for the ministry not to cancel Qatar's request.
Which was also confirmed by His Highness.
In the speech he gave, which we do not insist was in Qatar, if it caused any embarrassment, we do not insist on holding the summit in Qatar, it can be anywhere.
An Arab stance that others respect.
Yes, and as for the ministerial.
We want to tell them that the Security Council resolution was issued.
and Israel
He had no role in the decision and continued killing and bombing in Gaza, and still does.
And I need to ask the Arab what to do about it.
What are we going to do?
Will Israel ever end?
Implement the rest of the Security Council resolution.
Or there will be a halt because Israel did not stop.
We don't pressure our brothers.
To a decision that is considered excessive
A few days ago
We will talk about the ministerial meeting.
You will support this in the end.
Certainly, we support holding an Arab summit, and this was our proposal. Other countries, including Syria and Yemen, have also requested the summit.
A real Arab.
Or they separated us into the camp of moderation.
And the camp of immoderation
And what do they mean by "immoderation"?
This was arranged by the West.
Moderate and non-moderate Arabs
You will not find a nation that is either censored or uncensored.
And we want to know what is moderation and what is immoderation. Does moderation mean following Israel's plans?
And ending the matter in a humiliating way.
Or we leave the matter open.
I mean, this is an important question.
Are the countries
They follow Israel's plans and want to solve problems in their ways.
What I want to say is that he follows Israel's plans, and I don't want to accuse anyone.
But I say
If we call the camp Moderation
What is moderation in the view of the West?
Do we agree on slaughtering a certain group of Palestinians?
Certainly, the elections were held.
I am neither a supporter nor an opponent of Hamas, but I am speaking from a standpoint.
The stark truth is that there is
Idea
What some people call an extreme move
But we must ask ourselves what this radical movement wants.
Either something is wrong with her rights, or she is claiming her rights.
Or will we sort them?
And creating other blocks as well
Against because we
Internal and intellectual Arabic
And it started happening.
That's why we don't want to fight a war on behalf of others.
Yes, Your Highness, briefly.
Who prevented the Arab summit?
I can't say it was prevented, there were efforts, and the matter is almost known.
Prevention topic
But as I said, we could have.
Vote and get two-thirds of the votes.
But that wasn't the point, because it's not a matter of challenge as much as it is an urgent need. That's what we believe.
While others thought it was not an urgent need.
We went to the Security Council.
Or there could be a resolution in the Security Council.
But the decision rests with the Security Council; Israel said it would finish it and then consider the matter.
All I want to focus on again
We will not exert efforts to implement the decision regarding the weaker party.
What will make it different from the first meeting?
Changes sometimes cause disagreements.
As much as
Will we be ready for a clear Arab stance?
Humanitarian aid
Support our brothers greatly.
Also to respond to the Israeli party and tell them
I don't think everyone is ready for that, we're supposed to look into this.
Why don't we freeze it?
Eighty-four and we were committed to the truce. Eighty-four and the Israelis were not committed.
It's natural for arguments to occur in meetings, but in reality, these arguments...
Representing their attitudes and what is in their hearts.
One of the reported fights
It was he who described Hamas' actions as divisive.
Not even a little
This situation occurred and we responded to it, and I had a brother among the ministers.
And I believe that this is what the West says.
These are radical movements, dismemberment, and other names.
And we do not want to be other people's men.
Therefore, he always means, and I don't mean anyone by it.
Any foreigner they find.
Or find a Western country or countries
Among the Arabs
Okay, now His Highness the Sheikh
A call for a second ministerial meeting
Her agenda must be one thing.
Who are you, Arabs, from all this, and what is the position of the nation of three hundred million?
A million Israelis in the market
Issued after Resolution 1888
The issued decision.
Israel has not carried it out, it will carry it out after completing the mission.
There is no doubt that the Arab delegation made an effort.
Something to be thankful for in this decision.
We can demand Chapter Seven because Israel is above the law, Israel.
If they are asked, it is said that they understand.
What is the fault of the Arabs if they did?
If that's the case, Israel will not be questioned.
He is above international law.
This is true.
Why did I go to the Security Council and why did I link the Arab Summit to a Security Council resolution?
At the summit, the Security Council will strive for us.
He needs a firm decision.
Decision
A civil servant can lose his position.
We were afraid of the West.
And we work hard after they make their decision.
I don't want to deviate from the topic.
Those who carried out the attack to rebuild Iraq in its entirety at their own expense because they were the ones who destroyed it.
Let's not demand the Iraqi government and not seek compensation for those who died.
No compensation.
The exact same thing in Sudan when they started talking about prosecuting Bashir.
Happiness
His Highness Sheikh
A Major Arab Diplomatic Victory at the Security Council
Listen, they faced some difficulties in the Security Council because the first speech was about a presidential statement.
Consequences
Israel did not comply with it.
He will commit to it in two days, after a week, after he completes the task.
Because they didn't adhere to it.
Sorry, but people have to assemble.
Because Israel agreed after it had finished the mission.
Do you have an alternative to the decision now?
All we did
Some brothers, unfortunately, with some efforts.
They participated in the siege of Gaza.
I am pro-West and it doesn't matter to me whether we have any relations with the West or not.
Against the West, not against America.
But these people know the language of interests.
Your friends if you are strong.
Or if you have a point of view.
And in the end, they take our one percent and we say we won.
What is victory?
What do you guarantee?
I can't say anything about precautions now because the decision wasn't made.
The council is master of itself.
I participated in the training.
Yes, we participated to some extent in the formation.
But you weren't invited to the meeting with the Arab ministers and the US Secretary of State.
But I think the brothers who went were enough.
I pointed to the Arab parties for a certain interest.
In this regard, His Highness Sheikh
For two years now.
Listen, I don't want to talk about accusations.
I can't pretend we were aware of everything.
If they are among the people.
There was Israeli rejection and international rejection, and we also contributed to this rejection.
And from there the conflict began and the siege started.
And last month, Israel killed twenty-eight Palestinians during the ceasefire.
And we let them starve to death because we don't want them in power.
Those parties, His Highness the Sheikh.
I clearly state that the Palestinian conflict
I mean, if it were
The creator of the Palestinian conflict, perhaps there was a Palestinian conflict.
You tell the other party, "No, you are 100% correct."
I'm not saying Hamas is 100% right.
I'm not saying this or claiming that.
But, the mediator in the middle is usually equidistant from everyone.
And not only the mediator, but we Arabs as well are equidistant from everyone.
But we don't want him to be present, so we must end it by any means necessary.
Once in training the armies right and left.
And once by besieging them and not giving them money or salaries.
And when we create a positive model in the West Bank
To show how people live
Luxurious life
And the reverse is true in Gaza.
A second Arab ministerial meeting was called, but this time...
Any talk still going on about it between Hamas, mediated by Turkey.
It seems that this meeting I was invited to wants to dodge the issue.
There will be subterfuge if we make another initiative.
We don't have any initiatives.
On this matter
Because Egypt is an important Arab country.
We are asked to take a role and we support any Egyptian effort made to reach an understanding.
But it's important.
"Don't come."
Tomorrow, with a party, it seems that another party will prevail.
No path to harmony.
Balanced Egyptian Initiative
Between international, Arab, and humanitarian demands
And the requirements of Egypt's role, which is an important role.
It is a leading Arab country that we all respect and appreciate.
In your opinion, is this what is required of Egypt?
The current proposals, the current initiative, do not meet these requirements, Your Excellency the Minister.
I have a vision for this initiative.
We hear some information from time to time.
I can't comment on something I don't know.
With all due respect to the Palestinian government or presidency that should be there, we all recognize the Palestinian presidency.
But there are also people
We must also take into account the opinions of those who are affected on the other side.
Until we complete these intermediate tasks
By the way, to get a perspective
Hamas' position was clear that this decision did not take our viewpoint into consideration, so how was it issued?
A decision in which Arabs participate in drafting without contacting or consulting the main party concerned with the issue.
We only want, of course, to deal with the Palestinian state as a state.
We deal with the authorities as a single party.
But now there is a split in one party here and another party there.
This does not mean that if we deal with people from Gaza, we have to stop dealing with people who are either in the bank or in the Palestinian presidency.
We deal with the Palestinians as one people and one government.
They ask someone from Gaza to be with them.
And now we start coordinating with each other.
What has been announced about it.
Firstly, regarding the resolution, it did not specify a mechanism, but welcomed the Egyptian initiative and any other initiative.
Some consider it a mechanism.
This is an interpretation, but from my reading of this decision, it welcomes the Egyptian initiative.
We hope that the Egyptian initiative will succeed in achieving its goals.
Something to stop the fighting.
I have no doubt about our brothers in Egypt.
Because Israel did not accept the Security Council resolution.
And considers that this decision is no longer in effect because Israel did not accept it.
Even if they accept it later, the situation on the ground will change.
Yes, Your Highness, when talking about Egyptian efforts.
In cooperation with Turkish efforts at the same time and
Or an Arab excuse.
Or the intractable Arab conflicts, hence he came to fill the void.
It is assumed that Arab parties will fill them.
I welcome Turkey's stance.
A status that Arabs and Muslims should appreciate.
Turkey is an Islamic country.
So this is a natural role.
And let people follow Him.
There's no Arabic word for solving the situation.
Someone says: Let them finish the task.
There must be a clear Arab stance on all this ongoing aggression and procrastination.
There will be an opposite Arab stance.
Israel can postpone the decision, I'm not talking about an Arab-Israeli war, and we are the people who always call for peace.
And we are a country that loves to live in peace.
But I do not call for an Arab war, I call for an Arab awakening.
A clear Arab stance
Of course, within the initiatives and proposals, you follow what is happening.
The proposals and conditions set by Hamas
You think
Now as an on-the-ground observer
And the political fallout from the military operation will now allow Hamas to set its terms.
Must he be right?
We agree on this point and disagree on that point.
The second thing
As I told you about these negotiations, they aren't there oh, now they are negotiating.
The second thing
Okay, at the required sites for Arabs.
This Arab reality
That we witnessed after the start of those operations.
It seems that a very advanced position has been taken by the Arab street.
As governments, we have a responsibility to act.
Certainly, I regret that some people describe the gift of peoples.
Once again, they are telling me this issue.
Representing the views of the people.
The presidents now.
I mean, if they want to.
At least they see what
Of course, there's a high ceiling and a modest ceiling.
To end normalization and diplomatic relations with Israel
Qatar to
Closing the office of Israel's representative in Doha
Qatar, which takes this position.
Take into account that the Arab side should be radical and adopt radical positions.
What the Arabs agree upon will be a collective agreement.
Not at all if we had an Arab agreement.
A treaty is one thing, and relations are another.
We are ready.
Let's stand with our Arab brothers.
If there was clear Arab decision and credibility.
They are dealing with others, not just countries with which they have relations.
But also countries that have none of them.
It is very important.
Don't be agents for others.
He asks why Qatar doesn't lead by example in this field.
If this is the only model, we are ready to be in it.
But we also want
An Arab model that Qatar adheres to as part of its Arab commitment.
Like
No one sells another.
Our problem is that trust between Arab countries is missing.
Unfortunately, I don't want to reveal our secret, I don't want to expose our brokers.
Therefore, it is very important.
For formal invitations anywhere because we need to get over this.
Some called the ambassador, some protested, and some expelled the ambassador like Chávez.
And this is part of the dispute.
But some of them summoned the ambassador and those who summoned the permanent member states, and all of these are movies about our people.
We talked about the modest ceiling of the people's demands.
Regarding the high expectations, some are calling for the opening of fronts. Some are demanding that Syria open its fronts with Israel.
I hear you say we call for peace, not for fighting Israel.
And we do not want to fight with Israel.
To ignite a war with Israel
And how do they agree?
This is also a problem.
What makes us talk to each other is beyond our differences.
What His Highness said caught my attention.
If countries don't sell to each other
What do you mean?
I mean now.
The street won't have mercy on us.
His Highness Sheikh
Is what is happening today a continuation of a project that began in 2006 in the Lebanon War?
Or there is a disagreement.
No, I think there are differences in goals.
Lebanon is a liberated land.
Of course, some parts are still designated as a deposit for the United Nations.
Or something like that
Lebanon means we've dealt extensively with the Lebanese situation.
Israel, of course, needs weak states around it.
So that she is the dominant one and has the upper hand.
Certainly, there are countries supporting them, and they are foreign countries.
That's why you want to remain the only power in the region.
And now they want
To change this example with Gaza
In Lebanon, you speak with several sects.
And how many sides does it have?
While in Palestine, there is only one side.
But I assure you once again that the problem in Palestine is that they listened too much to many Arabs and foreigners.
And from here the gap began, and each thought they would control the other part.
In your opinion, as an observer and spectator
As planned, it will end in broken bones.
As Arabs, do we accept this because it may happen to those who disobey?
Or express his opinion.
Whether it's Israelis or others in the future
We are setting a leading example.
Obedience and assistance in breaking bones
We have a moral example that says: Me and my brother against my uncle; me, my brother, and my uncle against the other.
Now it is assumed that we are in any dispute with Hamas, and I am not saying that Hamas or anyone else is immune from making any mistake.
All of them are mistakes.
Now we must abandon this case.
Forced part of them to kneel
Because failure here will not be the failure of the group.
Your Highness, Qatar, usually what I mean, in the past, was trying to submit proposals.
Initiatives to find solutions, that happened in Lebanon.
What happened in Darfur we will talk about it in a minute even if you are in a hurry.
That we
We don't want to rely on our brothers because sometimes there are sensitivities.
If that country took all these initiatives, it doesn't matter to us as long as there is a solution.
Our goal now is not to make Qatar a headline.
The emirate was among His Highness's goals.
One of his goals was how to prevent bloodshed.
And stop the hegemony.
What happened surpasses imagination.
We are in Qatar.
Do we know anything they don't? I don't think so.
But the most important thing is to have good intentions.
To reach a solution that respects
Talking about initiatives, it is useful to know what the initiative concerning Darfur has reached regarding the Justice and Equality Movement.
And the government of Sudan in Khartoum.
And it will mainly be about resolving the Darfur issue, because the Darfur issue is at its inception.
Help the Arab.
But we don't move a case we've made international.
Based on the revenge of the system, and now we want to solve the problem but we don't know how.
As I mentioned earlier, we always strive to implement decisions, and we are the best at executing them.
Removing the case from the competition, is there a competition in the Darfur case?
What I want is to get past this stage.
Before we summarize the conversation, Your Highness, there is an economic summit.
Will this conference be held, will you attend it?
We will not attend the summit.
We wish it could be held in a different atmosphere than the Arab atmosphere, but it is programmed.
That would be a shame.
Alright, if the Arab leaders attend this conference.
When Palestinian blood was shed in Gaza, and they were there for financial and economic reasons.
Assistance with heating
But it seems no one is afraid of this street.
You don't know the circumstances. I mean, of course, I hope nothing happens to us, but safety.
And to be safe
But no one takes a person in their little pocket.
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, many thanks.
Welcome, wherever you are, and peace be upon you.
So, how feasible is this celebration and the statements of good intentions by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights?
That disabled people are the most neglected in the world.
What is your opinion on the Arab region and to what extent are they concerned about this issue?
We will ask our guest today these questions and more.
Former Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
And I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Social Work and Sociology from Qatar University.
Master's degree in Social Planning and Social Policy from Helwan University in Egypt
And he held several positions in the field of disability.
Who was a founding member and general coordinator of the National Committee for People with Disabilities
In 1989
And the vice president of the National Committee for Disability Affairs since 1999.
Until 2003
He also contributed to the establishment of the Shifael Center for People with Disabilities.
For people with disabilities in Qatar
Our guest oversaw the launch of numerous programs, projects, and media campaigns.
and activities related to people with disabilities in the Arab world
I also contributed to delivering lectures and participating in meetings, conferences, and forums.
Hello, Ms. Hassa, you are with us in this episode.
The term used is "people with disabilities."
Initially, we used the term "disabled" perhaps in the 1980s and early 1990s.
A more educational concept when
Among those who provide them with such education
An important document at the United Nations appeared in ninety-three.
Translate the term and before we delve into the details
From other regions, although there are regions that are not classified or are classified as developing countries and are classified as poor.
And Latin America in particular, in fact this trend is stronger there than in any other region.
But the statistics proved the opposite.
The direction of legal rights exists in the Arab world and exists in many countries.
It is possible that resources exist and political will does too.
Alright, here let me tell you some statistics that you might know.
Eighty percent of poor countries
UNESCO says that about ninety percent of disabled children from poor countries do not go to school.
Mrs. Hassa, how can you not comment on these statistics?
It's largely true.
I have seen in Darfur, in Gaza, and in other areas exposed to such events, which are wars and conflicts.
There, it's impossible to distinguish between a disabled person and a healthy person because they are in large numbers.
In fact, illiterate female children, for example, are about fifty-five or fifty-two.
And in other countries
There are many barriers that prevent these children from accessing school even without disabilities.
In fact, the city doesn't have infrastructure, even if this child found that school.
What he can reach.
For children and other residents
These programs and projects are great, but we barely hear about them.
What's the point of this celebration, except when we talk about the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, which the world celebrated a few days ago?
The situation in the world
Better than people without disabilities
There are organizations that have come and implemented many projects.
Implementing a health strategy is very important.
Through this strategy
There is an overlap between humanitarian affairs and working with marginalized groups such as people with disabilities.
Now there is a degree of awareness in the Arab world, and it is better.
At the point of awareness, we pause to take calls and continue our conversation.
Thank you
I have two questions I'd like to ask her because she's been to the United Nations before.
The second point
United Nations laws calling for the fight against regimes that cause hindrance to the child's society, for example, the Syrian intelligence system.
Is there a law that allows for the prosecution of the entire regime as is the case in Syria?
Yes, Suleiman, your question is clear. Suleiman Kro is from Syria. Thank you very much. With us now is Nayef Saeed from Kuwait. Hello, Nayef.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Peace be upon you too.
Good evening
Good evening and welcome
If you please, I am one of those who suffer from a mental and intellectual disability.
I hear Arabs say that a free man understands by gestures.
And in the Quran there is a verse that says, "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Allah has granted us the power of argument, and whoever is granted the power of argument, is granted the power over all things."
I sat for thirty years without saying a word or two a day.
"So he praised God for making me speak."
I was talking about the Quran and found...
People attack me because I use the Quran as a reference and consider me a hypocrite.
They attack me, not knowing they are in the depths of Hell.
I'm just being defamed.
And I don't tell the truth.
If your house is made of glass, don't throw stones at others.
And of course, psychological disabilities.
Regarding Brother Suleiman's inquiry, it also falls under the same definition.
UN programs or what are their reactions to the causes of disability such as political goals or otherwise.
Go to various agencies and organizations.
To discuss with them, convince them, and find out to what extent.
Disability topics and cases on their agendas
UNESCO, the International Labour Organization, UNICEF, and the fact that these organizations address disability.
It's one of the programs that try not to lose disabled children.
With good opportunities and schools.
From various environmental aspects
UNICEF as well
But there are shortcomings that we must acknowledge, and there are shortcomings in the United Nations as well.
What are the most prominent weaknesses and inefficiencies that you talked about?
In favor of the United Nations
The issue of routine and bureaucracy
I was in my country, the State of Qatar.
But it was routine and bureaucratic, hindering progress.
My work is especially challenging during times of restrictions or limitations.
Fight or try to fight for the recognition of people with disabilities.
Until his illness reached a certain point, he did not place it in a separate article, as the global disability movement wanted.
But it occupied a rather suitable part.
Unfortunately, there is no coordination among them.
This is one of her most significant shortcomings.
The survey carried out by the Special Rapporteur in countries
Among the employees or individuals working on those programs
Unfortunately, we only received three responses out of forty-eight organizations and agencies, and we only got three responses.
What are you putting?
The issue of disability is permanent, stable, and ongoing for many years, even though this matter is primarily a human rights issue.
Recently, thank God, for the past two or three years.
The issue of disability has at least become a topic of discussion through events such as seminars and the like.
Peace be upon you
Madam, why are there no binding laws and decisions for Arab countries, and who is responsible for implementing these international systems?
Regarding Arab countries and salary allocation, for example, allocating a salary for people with disabilities.
Is there money allocated by the United Nations?
Will this money go to governments or to UN agencies, and will this aid actually reach the disabled?
The final remark is that there are no binding decisions for Arab states.
Thank you very much, Ahmed Halabi from Greece.
With us is Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia. Hello, Ibrahim.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Present this proposal to her.
which consists of writing directly to the Secretary-General of the United Nations
Switch to this box.
Or a manufacturing plant
Allocating only one percent of the annual net profit
I return to our guest to answer callers' questions.
He said that the doctors advised him to have surgery, but
It is very expensive and he cannot afford it, so where can he get help?
He is from Algeria.
I believe it's important to meet Brother Naji's needs.
Like any other rights, the rights of persons with disabilities
A citizen must obtain all these rights and duties.
Joining the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is a legal and binding agreement.
Fulfilling the rights and needs of people within the national scope.
Or even at the non-governmental level
Binding on all states, limited to ensuring the implementation of these laws.
There must be awareness at least at the level of officials.
That must be the case at least if we work on these treaties in this way.
Even if there is no great commitment to them.
Is there any response to the monitoring reports detailing what you're doing and whether there's interest?
But don't forget the standards, they are actually a morally binding document, not legally.
To be committed and to be legal.
Recognizing that these cases will be resolved, discussed, or will be within the context of a society suffering from many problems.
Naji Zakra, director of the National Center for the Deaf, is an expert in sign language on Jazeera.
First and foremost, Mr. Ali would like to extend his sincere thanks to Al Jazeera.
This episode has now been broadcast live.
Now Ali is talking and saying that he is very proud.
She was a servant to all those in need at the place she was and still is.
We support her and stand with her always and forever.
I also say that there are many people with special needs.
Some people are unaware of this agreement due to the lack of training sessions.
About them, especially in schools or hospitals or in public and private institutions
It is essential to publish this agreement.
As a law dealing with people with special needs in all countries of the world.
And I emphasized and insisted on these countries.
Adoption and signing of this agreement
Like the State of Qatar, some countries have signed this document, aiming to serve people with special needs and serve us.
Thank you very much, Comrade Naji, on behalf of Ali.
Many thanks
Your opinion might make the decision.
The former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. We can start with a proposal from caller Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
Creating a fund to support
A fund for donations and accepting any contributions from countries.
This means that the fund is supposed to spend on the activities that the Special Rapporteur engages in.
Even the Arab countries did not donate, except for one: Syria.
Dealing with those commitments is a problem within the United Nations, therefore
The box
Unfortunately, the lack of commitment and interest of member states.
Unfortunately, many people boldly say that this means we don't care about the situation now.
It's really a matter of obligations.
On human rights.
In its broad and general form
The marginalized, especially
But for this reason, there are those covenants.
To ensure these countries abide by their commitments, but it's a good idea from the brother.
Moreover, it is essential that there not be a separate box in the sense of an independent entity in its form, but rather existing organizations in the region.
What they have in their budgets
Submit special projects for people with disabilities in Gaza.
Assistance for People with Disabilities
The issue is always about political factors.
His state or government emphasizes its strong support.
Unfortunately, the number is decreasing.
For nominal amounts
The father is disabled.
Certainly, revocation of citizenship.
Take his girl.
Sometimes from
Teaching problems
If we're traveling or going out, we get confused.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Peace be upon you too.
And we can
They rebuild themselves, knowing.
I hope that Arab countries will allocate from their budgets
Many thanks from Kuwait, Kourain.
Aisha Mohammed from Qatar, hello.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
Good evening to you and Sheikhah Bint Khalifa.
I just want to send her a message of thanks and appreciation.
In recent years
With our best wishes; from us; parents of children with special needs.
For the continuous support of Sheikhah Hessa
Bearer of the Flag of Honor from Tunisia, Welcome
There is another level, the genetic level.
I believe there is genetic care that reduces the percentage of disabled people.
In our Arab customs, the uncle marries off his niece, and so on.
In this way, at this level, the level of disability and thank you.
Can you comment on what the viewers said?
In fact, as I said at the national level.
I know there are programs for guidance and support.
If it is within healthcare services.
which also falls under the umbrella of Hammad Medical
I believe he is within the psychiatric clinic as well as programs in the Supreme Council of Education.
The Special Education Administration, frankly, I don't know if it exists.
But it is certainly within healthcare services. Yes, there is support and there are medical services.
And rehabilitation services are provided for such cases.
Prevention is better than cure. She pointed to the genetic factor and consanguineous marriage. Are there awareness campaigns?
For example, to raise awareness.
In this area
Make sure this is a very important and serious point.
One of the things that I and others have dealt with a lot of words and posts.
Yes, there are awareness campaigns, not just targeted ones.
Implemented by the World Health Organization
And also for UNICEF.
Now in many Arab countries, including Qatar
And certainly Tunisia
There is now a binding decision for early inspection.
which have been implemented in many countries
This is all preventive.
Do such campaigns receive any positive response?
Especially when it comes to customs and traditions.
Of course, the difficulty lies when you clash with societal culture.
There must be a decision, there must be strategies, there must be a will to deal with it, and a commitment.
The issue of early screening, for example, because this is a very important matter before marriage.
You ask if there are statistics on disabled people.
Especially those with disabilities from the Arab region.
To the Arab region
And especially
With the recent events that have taken place in the region
In regions, conflict zones, and especially in wars and disputes.
For every person killed, there are three disabled people.
And what happened in Lebanon, Darfur, and many other places.
No, it's not enough, and by the way, the topic.
Human rights principles
There must be something for people with disabilities, their programs, and plans.
Programs within institutions in government and non-government ministries.
In circumstances such as war or unrest
Only the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet.
In the world, and even more strangely, what the International Monitoring Committee for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities said about the census.
To this extent, disabled people are not included in the statistics kept for the population.
What they always announce
For example, in the State of Qatar when the population census was conducted, I think it was more than five years ago.
But frankly
In collaboration with the Planning Council and
The Council prepared it as a factual matter and with our participation, such as the Office of the Special Rapporteur.
Adding more categories for disabilities.
The things you're supposed to find.
The types of those needs, all these important details that should lead you to a conclusion.
Is there a disabled person or not?
But at least
The statistics in this regard are somewhat mixed.
Peace be upon you
My lady, thank you for this program and thank you, Sheikhah Hessa.
But praise be to God that I am Qatari and receive all this care from my country.
My daughter is now a student at independent schools and is receiving a good education, praise be to God.
And I would like to thank Mrs. Hessa.
Its motivational role and its role in not making us fear or worry about our children
Praise and thanks to God, and thanks to her and those upon whom this category depends.
Many thanks to Fatima Al-Dosari from Qatar, still with Qatar with Latifa.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
My dear sister, reality, expectations, and what we anticipate is the solution to our children's problems.
Where is the role of our Qatari children's sheikha?
I hope you answer this question.
Hello, peace be upon you
And I testify to what the State of Qatar has provided as a special service for the hearing impaired.
We had a program for early detection of hearing loss.
There is a Higher Council for Disability Affairs.
For people with disabilities, regardless of the type of disability.
Even civil society associations, non-governmental organizations, or other communities
Because reality and what we hope it will be, if you compare it after five years.
What was offered to the disabled five years ago and now?
Many thanks to Karim Naem from Jordan. Now we return to our guest.
Of course
The community as a whole, with its individuals and especially with its families which
Children with disabilities have great ambitions and expectations.
Whether at the planning level or at the operational level
But regarding one point you mentioned, which is very important.
Children who are unable to obtain documents or otherwise, whether in Qatar or elsewhere
An international convention is like many international documents.
I committed to translating it into plans and strategies.
Providing those services automatically
Based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, regardless of religion, race, color, gender, or sexual orientation.
Okay, Sheikhah Hessa, you worked as a former UN official responsible for disability issues after six years of service.
Did you wish?
Perhaps there wasn't enough time or the financial aid wasn't sufficient.
A lot has been accomplished, and I'm proud of it.
Through my participation or through existing organizations or through government institutions in many countries.
Especially in the Arab region
There will be more research and larger studies.
We began with a global survey and I have more than one report.
Awareness is an ongoing process that must be continuously and significantly worked on.
Coordination among Arab countries
And among the people themselves are those with disabilities and their organizations because they
But they have a duty they must fulfill.
They must fight for
Many thanks
Thank you
Dear viewer, at the end of this episode, I thank everyone who shared their opinion and comment with us.
Tomorrow, God willing, we will welcome a new guest.
Join us with your messages and letters in a new episode of "Live" (Direct) with safety.
Good morning
I am very happy to have you here with us.
First, before we start asking you various questions and talking this morning
Thank you, Shaima, you might have congratulated me.
The entire Middle East deserves this international achievement.
Qatar has truly put a pin on the global football map.
Thank you, Qatar.
Me too, keep going! Oh! Ali
First, I'd like to say good morning to the viewers.
I express my congratulations to him and to all Qatari citizens on the hosting.
And God willing, as Sheikh Mohammed said,
It was a dream, and with God's will, it will become a reality, and work will start today or during the announcement period.
Did you expect Qatar to host the World Cup in two thousand and twenty-one?
Despite having strong files like the United States, Japan, and Australia, didn't you fear in this field, on this subject in particular?
No, look, to be honest with you, I said it was seventy percent likely that Qatar would get it.
He is very strong.
The company has global and competitive plans.
We were competitors.
Why are we afraid?
But praise be to God, Qatar's file was very strong and deserved it.
It's true that the 2022 World Cup bid and Qatar's hosting of it...
So, what about the feelings of the athletes themselves?
They are in the field, of course they feel overjoyed, God decrees what is good.
I want to %pw, we were talking off the air, but we want to hear that on the air.
The moment of announcement.
Where were you, how did you hear the news, were you surprised, tell me, and tell the audience.
On the radio
Then all the people joined us.
They heard about the announcement.
How did the international media find you?
On the level of sports channels, everyone was supportive, especially the Arab channels, praise be to God, everyone supported us.
As soon as Qatar's win and hosting were announced,
All Arab countries have announced their full support for Qatar, through the media, human resources, and volunteers, in the future.
Arab countries are known for their generosity.
Shaima, even at the level of international media
I went that time to celebrate at Souq Waqif.
Even the AFP was filming there.
We also conducted interviews.
Everyone cooperated, now Qatar is mentioned daily.
A hundred times a day, because it is the smallest spot on Earth.
I suppose everyone will know Qatar even online.
To host the 2022 World Cup
I mean, any footballer dreams of serving his country by being in the team.
Of course, any player, whether in the Qatari league, wants to represent the team.
So, it's a positive thing to work very hard.
To be in the league, even when he's in the league, he dedicates all his efforts.
Whether in training or matches, because he wears the league's logo on his shirt, he must dedicate his energy.
Look, the responsible people are making a great effort to take care of young players, teaching them professionalism from an early age.
Food, sleep
Tell me about your experience playing at various age levels. How was your experience, and what was the most important stage for you?
Was, of course.
I progressed step by step in the league, from the youth team to the first team.
You know camping with the club and with the league.
Therefore, each stage has a special mark.
Yes, Lana, God willing, you were moving between
Now we're used to you as sporty Lana.
We always saw you as a sportswoman. We loved watching you, getting sports news from you. So, how is sports with you?
Frankly, I don't see a difference between this and talk shows. In talk shows, we used to interview famous stars in their fields, and in sports, we also conduct interviews with stars.
Like Ali and others in their sports field.
On the contrary, the sports field is active.
Especially since we are the capital of sports.
And now Qatar has become the capital of world sports and football.
Instead of presenting a variety of talk shows on social, economic, and cultural topics
It has different fields, ping-pong, basketball, different champions.
But it's a sport.
Wow, amazing.
I truly wish
I wish I were ten years old now, not twenty-five.
So I think young players have a very big opportunity.
I hope they seize this opportunity.
This is great, Ali. What do you want to say to the players?
God willing, the young players who will have a bright future in the coming days, God willing.
Certainly, I told you it's an opportunity they should seize.
It's a golden opportunity.
Therefore, they have a great advantage thanks to which
Tell us, what are you doing, what new upcoming shows will you be presenting, I know we asked you to come during your vacation.
So tell us about your news, God willing.
Always keeping up with events, we are preparing for the Asian Cup which will start in January.
A few days ago, we finished the Gulf Cup. By the way, we'd like to congratulate the Kuwaiti league.
The newsletter is also available to cover events.
I first appeared in the media through Qatari television, of course, my roots are from Qatar Television.
I'm grateful for their kindness.
Deliver the media message across different channels.
Whether they are private, sports, or other channels
Thank you, Qatar TV.
We wish you success, we are still on the same subject.
First, I would like to thank the management of Al-Wakrah Club.
And his supporters, I was at Al-Wakra Club since
My childhood
The sheikh was here with us yesterday, Sheikh Nasr was with us.
He's still at the club.
I am still the son of Al Wakrah.
But, as I told you before, the program starts with professionalism.
That belongs to everyone in Qatar.
We know that young people really love and adore sports.
How do we make sports a social issue?
Media awareness primarily plays a crucial role in promoting sports across various aspects of life.
I said that youth are addicted to it, as schools are also realizing the importance of sports in school.
For example, they celebrate any sporting event.
Also in Qatar, you see signs on the streets, this reflects awareness of sports.
Allocating seats for women in stadiums and anywhere.
This also indicates the awareness and participation of women in the field of sports.
And now we have a Qatari women's league, for female players.
So I think that sports are evolving.
I also think that this period of time
To produce massive projects and raise sports awareness, I believe this timeframe is sufficient.
If considered and implemented carefully.
Sufficient, yet must be used carefully, as you said.
There's another point, which is how the young generation benefits from the association.
Everything is available, capabilities, experiences, and equipment.
There is also an important matter, praise be to God, we are in Qatar, as all Arab and Gulf societies know, we are famous for our love of sports.
How do you attract this audience to keep up with sports news, football matches in Qatar?
And attending the games at the same time
Most of the Qatari people love sports and football, but the problem is that they don't attend.
When browsing web forums, you'll find a great deal of interest, especially in most club forums.
There is great interest in my soccer league.
As a Qatari citizen, the best solution to encourage your attendance, aside from being a sportsman or player, is to foster a sens
What is the possible way to get the audience to attend, for example, your friends?
It depends on the individual themselves, there is no universal concept.
Some people like to watch it on TV at a home gathering.
For example, Japan, Japan has developed an excellent plan to attract a wide audience.
When you attend matches, you collect points or something, so they're looking for solutions, so I hope so.
And Arabic
The most important point is that every player will be here in Qatar, especially in the year 2020, Lana, what do you think we need?
Aside from financial support, what do you think we really need?
Providing the means to make them ready as a national league and participate in the World Cup.
Time flew by with good people, and when the producer told me time was up, I really said, "Inshallah."
Always achieve the impossible, achieve the dream we thought was impossible. Alhamdulillah we are living it in reality.
As Sheikh Mohammed said, it was a moment of celebration, but the hard work begins.
And with God's will, the year 2020 will be an event that the name of Qatar will be mentioned alongside.
I congratulate all residents of Qatar, and frankly, Qatar has become a global landmark.
To host in the year 2020
Thank you, Lana, for the wonderful introduction. I wish you success, and I'll always watch your shows to keep up with sports news.
Thank you, certainly happiness.
Young Qatari talents
They are singing a new popular type these days.
But in the form of repetition with music and a fast rhythm.
And also a group of rap enthusiasts, God willing.
We're staying with us, we'll start now and good morning.
We try to take a look at that.
We can simply define rap as fast music.
It's a repetitive performance, but not a rapid rhythmic singing of the song lyrics.
Consisting of numerous poetic verses, it addresses a variety of different topics and issues.
It can be personal at times,
Social, emotional, or political.
Often controversial,
And freedom to a large extent.
Rapping, not singing the lyrics to our viewers.
But he keeps doing it.
She fell in love with his voice, which is a secondary element.
Generally, sound is not important in rap songs.
For this reason, he is not called a singer, but a rapper or a performer of rap music.
Rappers focus on the following elements in songs:
For example, flow, flow of sounds, synchronization, and delivery.
They have followers, an audience, and fans.
They have a unique style in rap.
I think they'll give you a better idea than I personally could.
Good morning, welcome.
First of all, it was a time when we wanted to do something new.
To be distinguished in something.
So, we said, why don't we rap?
Rap is an art present in all countries of the world.
So, why isn't it in Qatar?
So we said we'd invent something new.
We gave him an idea that included a message.
We discuss the advantages and disadvantages that occur in society.
So, we are delivering a message first and second, it is an art.
It is one of the various arts, for the viewer's information, and it has addressed many social and psychological issues among youth in a radical way.
Time changes, and I think that's what time change is about.
Before that, there was little acceptance.
We've been singing since about 2005, acceptance was slow at first.
We say that our new beginning was in the year two thousand and ten.
There is more acceptance and popularity.
People love to sing and perform in a rap-like style these days, have you noticed that?
Yes, of course, a high percentage of people.
There's also something else I want to talk about. I've been a founder in many teams.
It's a great band, and I believe you organize concerts. Can we talk about this band?
How was it founded, how did the idea come about that a person could become a band, and how many of you are there in the band?
Initially, before the band was formed,
Rap arrived in Doha starting in 2005.
Everyone who loves the concept of rap and can rap, should rap and release it on the site.
I can download, Salman can download, anyone can download, so there was competition.
We met the people.
So, we started competing with each other.
After a while, and after all these years, we reached the year two thousand and ten.
Before 2010, there was a group system, meaning that this group itself, and three or four together.
So we said, why don't we unite as one group under the name Rappers Qatar?
Q Rappers.
So we agreed on this, we said under one name and we are all one hand together.
We present this thing and say the same idea.
About twenty-five people.
Twenty-five, what a number! God willing, it will be a big number.
So, does one of you play, or, or, do you all rap?
Formatting and composing.
You could say it's a personal matter.
Excellent, how were these twenty-five organized? How was this number organized in the band?
Everyone has their own capabilities.
That means everyone in the band can make a whole song.
Without any help from anyone else.
But capabilities might differ, for example if Salman is better than me,
He heard her and told me to change the words here, change something.
It is possible for each of them to change into the other.
We help each other a little.
Or a company that accredits you, so that these works are accredited by an official entity,
And there will be the right distributors.
So that the work turns out neatly and becomes something official for you.
To be honest, we hope to be supported and to get support from a company that came and adopted us by producing an album for us.
We don't have a problem.
Some things are a little difficult.
So, why don't you think the first move should come from you?
So that the individual is introduced on the first CD.
This way, you can attract companies later on, what do you think?
Around 2007, I made a CD.
I distributed them among my friends.
How was the order?
I believe.
It wasn't dominant in the Gulf in 2007.
But not like now.
We were talking before we were on air, for example, there are great groups like Palencia and Castro.
Let's talk about it?
They said they would organize the party for you.
They covered all the costs, procedures, coordination, and work; frankly, we didn't expect this level.
Frankly, we were surprised and it was a great performance.
But there was little pressure because there were no ads and nothing before the show.
There were no ads or anything two days before the party.
We assumed that no one would come due to the short notice.
When we were inside, before the party started.
This was a good point.
This means that our voice reaches families as well, not just young people.
We thought the idea would appeal only to young people.
But at this point, we discovered that there were many age groups listening to us.
Is there a particular song the audience loves?
The audience interacts with most songs.
Yes, most songs, but there were a lot of songs and we were many.
The entire group
What are words, how do they address different issues
We're talking about the current situation.
At least, even if it is...
Even if they spoke, before *
It must be so.
I mean, there's a rhyme.
We think about every word and try to find better synonyms.
Alright, you have a few songs, let's listen to one of them.
One of the songs you produced
Let's listen to her and see what the public thinks.
I hope they like the talk.
Thank you, Ali. I loved the introduction because it bears the name of my show.
This is a CD and MP3 program.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This is KG, Mrs. Bobo with one hot track for the body.
Remember, the show airs at 9:30. Everyone must watch.
Produced by Hasan Naama, Presented by Shima Al-Hamadi
Director Nasser Al-Mulki, and the guests are Qatar's rappers of course.
Because it really contains the name of the "program", thank you guys!
I have to applaud you and the people in the control room.
We broadcast it yesterday.
And who wrote the words, or is it?
Everyone writes their word.
Because if I wrote to Joseph
Don't write this for the love of singing, or passion.
I assume you're writing about the 2022 World Cup and the Asian Cup, I assume you can.
Yes, certainly, personally, we will produce a song about this topic.
But, I don't think it can be official at this stage.
Therefore, I think there should be some national songs.
Through the art of rap
Yes, in fact, today, everyone.
We are watching now.
The cup has arrived and the streets of Doha are decorated.
So, viewers, as we've seen, Doha has been decorated to celebrate the Asian Cup.
The participating agencies have made all the preparations to host.
And there will be more crowds.
I suppose they'll gather along the corniche.
I'm sure they're ready to host that important sporting event.
Are there any parties coming up?
There's an offer from the authority, they promised to organize a party for us.
But, still, there are some complications.
Procedures and some issues, so we're unsure.
So, we try, if I meet Youssef and see.
Some of them, I have a song topic,
If we find that it fits the song.
And the possibility of performing them.
When I am at home
Then send it to Youssef's email.
This part of the song is for Youssef.
There's something else, do you travel outside the country?
In this field, they have millions of fans.
Don't try to imitate, but we listen to people who have been in this field before us.
But we try to be competitive.
So why don't we take some ideas and imitate certain things?
But flip it, take the idea and apply it differently to my song.
The one who formed a band and doesn't have more than a CD.
A person named Abdullah Diakhal
He has the experience and ability to detect groundwater.
This talent is the ability to detect underground water reservoirs.
One of the residents of Marat town.
There are many experts.
Those who determine the groundwater before drilling.
Those in need or where water may be scarce, some wells could be dug in places without water.
With the help of copper bars and pomegranate branches
Or figs, through which he can locate water tanks.
What are the tools used?
To discover groundwater
That was in ancient times.
But now, they have been replaced with copper rods.
So, we placed the sticks side by side.
And you walk slowly.
We notice, when we walk along the stream of water
The sticks will open.
Now, we're passing a watercourse.
It opens this way.
When we crossed it, he started.
Now we are in the middle of a stream.
And here, the medium will be.
So, in this way, we can trace the path of water, or groundwater, in the earth.
The process is repeated more than once in more than one place to find the site with the highest density.
Confirmation of Abu Ibrahim
Upon reaching an advanced stage of this profession
To make his discoveries very accurate
Sometimes, outside, in Diriyah, Harmala, and Al-Athithiyah
Over one hundred and fifty wells have been discovered.
The error rate does not exceed five percent.
You need training, experience, and God-given talent.
Surpass equipment and modern laboratories.
In a short time
Abdurrahman al-Marshed
Doha Morning Show
Marat Won, northwest of the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
We have watched this report and promise you more reports from Arab and international countries.
And the Gulf countries, God willing.
And we arrived at (()) and various titles, but they
Logical meaning
I assume there is a large group of Gulf youth in the Gulf.
Any particular person you follow as an example
To follow rather than to imitate.
There is a general relationship among all Gulf rappers.
What is this, I mean if I produce a song
One who addresses a specific topic.
We can call it a meaningful competition.
We have contacts, but no one is answering.
In Saudi Arabia, Qusai will be circumcised, God willing.
He has fans and a CD.
Many companies want to adopt it.
Do you want to reach this stage, perhaps surpass it more and more, God willing.
We wish you good luck through these difficulties.
There, upon receiving the cup, let's watch some clips of the corniche.
In addition to a group of Qatari youth
Even if they are borrowed from the West, they are in a Gulf style.
There are love rap songs and a unique band of 25 people.
It's important to stay in touch with you to know how you're doing.
If you assume that you have an email, or a website, or a forum.
How can people communicate with you?
We had our own website.
But there were some issues with the hosting company.
The app sometimes closes without apparent reason.
So, we faced many problems and eventually closed them.
What's the point, the site will definitely close.
So, what do we do? What are the alternatives to solve this problem?
United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, and even Morocco and Egypt
You need to stay in touch with them to keep up with the latest news, songs are produced once in a while.
So, what's the alternative now?
We currently rely on special pages like
Under what name
Okay, when you search for our company's name on Google, ...
Qatari rapper
You can produce your own music video.
Regarding the program, I worked on it yesterday.
We uploaded many videos to YouTube.
Songs with pictures
Song and the same thing, with pictures.
I think we'll see you improve even more.
You need a place for all of you together instead of having the equipment in every home.
Blender, piano, computer, and guitar
Honestly, I hope we find support.
For example, a company.
CD production
They allocated a special place for us.
We work for ourselves.
In the end, we're still working on ourselves.
What we want
What differs from Joseph's statement.
We need a video clip.
And album
Videos accelerate the spread of the song.
Understands ideas faster
If there is support, everything else will eventually fall into place.
And let your beautiful voice be heard everywhere.
It's a type of art that deals with various issues and problems.
Thank you, Youssef Al Naemi and Salman Abdullah, for attending.
Let's see them and wish them all the best from the bottom of our hearts, guys.
These projects, yes.
There is also a project that is almost ready but needs some technical development.
Expiration Date
When you go to the cashier, you have the total amount and all the details.
Knows the goods, instead of reading the components of each commodity.
While walking with the shopping cart
Attached to the cart, so you can choose the material you want.
Most projects are a reflection of children's feelings towards a problem.
Includes many activities and goals.
The center offers a range of programs and activities that focus on one central idea.
We have ten objectives set by Her Highness Sheikha Moza in establishing the center.
Can also, yes
to transport him directly from his home to the underground train
But his idea is that it's for clothes.
It will show all the shops in Qatar that sell T-shirts.
It could also be with the car key, press the button.
Find the things I've lost and take me to the key.
Yes, let's get back to the projects the center will work on.
It is early childhood education.
Skills development and talent adoption
So, the matter differs between children's various skills, media, and research skills.
Personal skills, such as public speaking, persuading audiences
Skills vary, and we've developed a special program to accommodate them.
We started with Future Media, achieved great success in this project, reached the end, the project graduated.
We also have numbers of children and young speakers.
And their creativity...
Do you have young presenters?
Regarding television, it's important that they broadcast children's programs.
We're getting them ready for TV.
Through her television, Qatar TV
We raise them until they turn eighteen.
We welcome them wherever they are.
This is also the national television.
We need to attract, identify, and nurture these talents.
Whether it's media or research.
Intellectual dimensions
Reading and various other fields
Is there collaboration? Do you exchange ideas?
In all fields, such as the promising speakers' program sponsored by the Ministry of Awqaf.
Our exhibition, the Generation Exhibition, is also...
The science club played an important role in improving projects, as well as with technical support.
The main role was played by the Higher Council for Education, through supporting schools and partners.
Mr. Abdullah, moving to such a building like Katara,
which also embodies a variety of activities and clubs
Do you consider that a step forward to achieve more success?
In addition to moving to a separate building
Regardless of the place being very large
Dealing with the public is easy.
It is a pioneering and distinguished project.
In welcoming the guest and introducing the programs offered to the child
It's our main project for the next three years.
National Development Project for Reading
Under the patronage of Sheikhessa Hessa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani
I adopted and supported this project.
It's a big project, developing reading, writing stories, and developing children.
Various cultural skills related specifically to reading
There are certainly various programs.
We recently moved.
And we rearrange some activities.
Its design, and improving it to suit Katara visitors
We wish you success, through this center.
Contains very important ideas.
First, I'd like to thank you for hosting.
Most importantly, the more we deal with children, the more we discover that
Today's childhood is different from ours.
They need more care, focus, and time.
Listen to his interests, imagination.
Connect with him mentally.
They ... %pw, the way they treat their children like a hotel, providing accommodation.
Or like a bank, saving money.
Children really need someone to listen to those ideas, the imagination.
In the past few days, they transferred us to 2030.
At this exhibition
Good luck to the winning projects.
Thank you for being here, Mr. Abdullah Al-Jaml, Director of the Children's Cultural Center. We wish you success.
Until these projects become a reality and are not just a dream forever.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Children's Cultural Center at the Diplomatic Club was inaugurated last night.
Closing Ceremony of the National Exhibition of Dreams of Future Generations under the slogan "Dreams of a Generation, Facts or the Nation of Tomorrow"
Organized on the occasion of Qatar's National Day, with the participation of more than seventy children from Qatar.
There were many activities and numerous competitions at the exhibition.
Children's Creative Projects
We would like to welcome Mr. Abdullah Al-Jumaili, Director of the Children's Cultural Center. Good morning and welcome.
Good morning, dear sister.
First, I'd like to thank you for giving us the time.
Let's talk about this exhibition, it's truly unique.
We are happy to have you with us on the program to cover as many activities of the exhibition as possible.
This is the National Exhibition of the Dreams of a Generation
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. This is the exhibition.
Contribution of the Children's Cultural Center
To celebrate the National Day
Who was *
Attempt to calm the children
Live with a dream.
With the project
This project or dream
Children's imagination is very vast.
That's why we limited it to twenty and thirty.
And other key areas of Qatar National Vision 2030
We started training children in four stages.
Then, considering the brainstorming mechanism and tools that broaden the scope of thinking.
What exactly do you mean by this phrase?
Facts or the Nation of Tomorrow
This means, anything a child dreams of today.
It will grow as the project grows.
In fact, that was the true interpretation of the vision, that the children should live from that day forward.
I dream big.
Whether it's environmental, health, human development, or any other field
Serving the country
I think that when we know there are children somewhere
Or at a specific exhibition
All that was available through
At the exhibition, there were also guests of honor.
Because children learn from them, as role models.
Yesterday, two days ago there was *
There were also winners of various Gulf Cooperation Council awards.
There was a schedule for submitting their projects.
Yes, the pictures are the best evidence of what you say.
This is a collection of photos from the exhibition and various activities.
Here is also the owner of the last project, the forest.
We also want to talk about the colored ball.
It's a very bright idea, we can simplify it for the viewers, this is one of the children's inventions.
Exactly what is this topic, the colored ball, let's talk about it.
Suddenly, there are four or five projects dealing with this subject, one of which is the colored ball.
It was also named the Smart Stadium.
As soon as the ball goes out of bounds
Colors differ.
I suppose this will help a lot in future matches.
An apartment, after all these dreams.
And to be attached to things related to his field of interest.
I assume especially when there are responsible people who take these small projects from small minds into consideration.
But we never know, maybe these projects will serve our purposes, says the football association president.
Think about the idea of a colored ball.
Does he like it?
Often, he visited football-related projects.
He supported and adopted these projects as soon as he saw them.
I also adopted these projects.
Our children did it, the voice of the people also for many projects.
Okay, what were the projects on the site that people voted on the most?
There is an evaluation committee that has a way to evaluate projects.
The first, second, and third prize-winning projects
The forest, won the first prize.
He was very precise in the details of the projects, and the project was ready for implementation.
Certainly, it requires many administrative elements.
There were very detailed descriptions in the brochure distributed to visitors.
Surely the pictures we see now.
This is part of the big projects.
Maybe they don't try to do what they see in movies and cartoons.
It's true, part of it has been adopted by institutions.
For example, let's name the projects, what are these projects?
To collect, use, and recycle them.
From two hundred and seventy-four students
Qatar University celebrated yesterday the graduation of the 33rd batch, which includes 247 male and female students.
And His Excellency Dr. Khalid bin Mohammed Al Attiyah, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs
A large number of parents and faculty members
The university is celebrating today the graduation of seven hundred and seventeen female students.
We would like to thank our colleague Salman Al-Majed and we will remain in the same artistic atmosphere. We will be hosting a dear guest today.
From the series "Tsanif", the actor Abdelhamid Charshani.
He asserted himself through numerous works such as Hearts for Rent,
They worked hard to prove themselves in the art scene.
Especially since the field of art doesn't know flattery.
Means
Thank you, good morning, and I'd like to say good morning to the viewers.
No, I'm a fan of the show's team.
We'll watch a very short clip from one of your works, and then we'll start talking to you.
Are you mocking me?
Take the fake coat and bring the original one.
Go and get it.
I have the book, I'll return it to you.
What? Give me the best, make it for me! How do I prepare it?
The sheep has finished it in her belly, O Sheikh.
I am a member of a five-member committee.
On the conference's steering committee.
I don't agree with you.
I have no objections.
So this is a quick glimpse, a very short part of the Tsanif series, and we'll be watching the second part.
We would like to ask you about your participation this year in Part Two.
Can you tell us about the parts of your show "Tsanif" that cover a different topic in each episode?
What is your contribution? Can you tell us about it?
Of course, later.
I went through tough times back then.
Marat is also famous with the mountain.
The beautiful one praised by poets since ancient times.
When history is a witness and remains in the memory of cities.
It shows the antiquity of its history.
It is one hundred and seventy kilometers north of the capital, Riyadh.
Some believe it was named after Amir bin Qais al-Tamimi.
It is distinguished by its ancient monuments, the sweetness of its water, and the purity of its air.
You inspired poets, captivated them. You're famous for your renowned mountain, Koma.
They call it Wadi Kumayt.
Of course, Marra is an ancient city.
It was founded before Islam.
There were some ancient things with an unknown history, such as the well of Khalid ibn al-Walid.
The one we are in now.
The Prophet's companion Khalid ibn al-Walid - may Allah be pleased with him - ordered the digging of this well during the time of the Ridda Wars.
It still remains to this day.
The saying goes: "A tribe's guarantee," and I guarantee you a she-camel.
If you see the clouds, you can see the rain.
Another effect is a stream of chaos.
Which is that the river has flowed sweetly over the years.
It was enough for the city for a whole year.
From the beginning of the rainy season until the next rainy season.
And the date of creation of these monuments is unknown.
There is also the bride and there.
Jabal Qamait is one of the landmarks of the city of Marrat.
There were many proverbs based on this mountain, poetry and poets.
People come to him from all over the kingdom.
One of the most important monuments is the Al-Waleedi Well.
Because he once stayed during the Ridda Wars and was on his way to Yamama.
He pitched his tent over it and ordered the men to dig this well.
Any people still drink from its water and wash in it.
Yaqut al-Hamawi mentioned in Mu'jam al-Buldān that Khalid passed through Marrat.
It's an old mud house that has been restored to its original state.
It consists of different sections that reflect the area's architecture, heritage, and antiquities.
The poet once said of her: "When we passed by the water, water for free."
We came across Wadi Kumayt, not Wadi al-Anajil.
Mr. Ayman, no matter what God's decree is, there is cooperation between the family, guardians, the center, and the child as well.
I believe there are different ways he can be with you at the same time.
Generally to run the training process.
For everything that comes to us, whether it be an apprentice, a student, or a child,
This record contains his full personal information.
Even his monthly grades, for example, every month has a rating.
We were responsible for the Minds program.
In every four sessions, there is a report.
The guard through the password and username,
We gave it to him, can he reach it?
Yes, he can see the level he has reached, since he joined the center until now.
Yes, we have different models to see.
We have a girl.
With Mr. Ibrahim, who will join us later,
We'll see different models, I wish we had enough space.
But we brought a girl model.
There will be a different test in front of you on the air.
We will ask her math questions and varied questions.
We'll take a short break and then return to watch this smart girl, stay tuned.
The actor's performance, the audience is very smart now.
If any show catches his interest from the first, second, or third episode, if he feels he's not interested in the show he'll use the remote.
Who cares, he has another twenty thousand chains.
Correct, the Twenty Thousand Leagues series, correct.
Twenty thousand rings. Some people don't focus on one job.
He can watch other shows.
This is true, this is the majority.
He claims that I only watch TV during Ramadan.
Of course, we welcome our dear and respected guest, Abdel Hamid Charshani.
Do you have anything to say to the viewers, or to your fans who love you? Of course, I'm one of your fans.
Do you want to say something?
And I say to them, "May God return it to you in good health and well-being."
It's true that we don't go out much, don't show up much, and don't act much for a reason; I've mentioned the reason.
What's to come will be better.
Insha'Allah, we wish you every success in this year's endeavors.
Insha'Allah, we will have another interview with you to talk about those plays.
Everything leads to the other.
Because fashion shows are very popular among many people and are looked forward to by lovers of new fashion.
Welcome, dear viewers, to Sabah Doha. We are live with you this morning.
Of course, today we are talking about the Skills Development Center and a group of students who have registered at this center.
This center offers a variety of different sciences.
Of course, they focus on developing other potentials.
And also to make their minds fully functional.
Mrs. Nesma and Mr. Ayman Khogali, CEO of the Skills Development Center.
Hello, good morning.
Welcome with us.
And we have with us the beautiful Oumanya, good morning Oumanya.
Good morning.
How old are you, dear?
I am in the seventh grade.
God willing, we wish you all the best.
What things do we provide for our sons and daughters?
That was clarified with Mr. Ayman and Ms. Nesma, and it was specifically directed towards the benefit of our children.
The program is Minds for mental math calculation.
By fingers and abacus.
To achieve certain specific goals, we tried to show a small part of them.
Did you feel, Professor Ibrahim, that there was a difference in the students on the first two days?
And after maybe three or four months?
Whether he studies in public, private, or even independent schools,
In short, the program scientifically works on specific methods.
After completing the first level of the program,
What reveals the missing potential or the need for further development.
Has it reached a certain level or what updates have occurred to the child?
So, we are working on a scientific method, a scientific program.
Not all methods and mechanisms are applied in a routine manner;
But in a scientific and systematic way.
Before starting the program and after taking this course or the levels he has passed.
Mr. Ibrahim is with us now, as you can see, viewers, Amniyah is one of the students enrolled in this center.
We wanted to do this right away to show our viewers the importance of these matters.
If you bring the bisht, I have no objection.
So this is a very fast and small part of the Tsanif series, and you'll watch the second part of it.
But as we've seen, this part of the series is a sequel to the first part.
Can you tell us a bit about your roles in the series "Tsanif," where each episode has a different theme?
Focus this year on that
Jafel Fadhil
Who encourages by giving opportunities
Sixteen episodes in two seasons.
He will be a director in an episode, an episode in which he will be an old man and an episode in which he will be a baker.
So, it's a set of rings.
Mr. Ghanem Al-Sulaiti is from Qatar.
We have representatives from Qatar.
I can't remember many actresses now. Of course, there are actresses from Bahrain like Zahra Arafat, Ibtesam Abdullah.
We
Al-Rashid faction and Muhammad Adil.
Flew, of course
Without Tara, the young actors won't perform.
We now have little work in Qatar. There are two jobs a year.
Qatar TV channel also produces dramatic works, can we say that too?
Qatar TV provides an executive producer.
Qatar TV channel put their best foot forward, but with only one production a year, all Qatari actors want to work.
And that was the reason.
I replied to you. It's just one series, and all the Qatari actors want to work on it.
So whoever finds a scene, must thank God.
Praise be to God for everything.
So, let's go back to your beginnings.
Certainly, I'd like to thank him a lot.
I consult him on various matters.
Of course, the actor Abdulaziz Jasem is among the rulings of humans, even after the dispersion until yes or no.
In his plays, we started working with him in theater when he became the first executive producer. Abdulaziz Jassim, we worked with him for television and theater.
So, he adopted us, taught us, and raised us.
Then Mr. Ghaniem entered his life story, and did his best, in Fouaz El Tosh 2000.
Because it gives us opportunities as youth.
They work thirty to thirty-three times a year.
We have two jobs a year, thank you, thank you Tara.
The Deadly Feeling is also produced by Tara Arts.
The director of the program series is Mr. Monir %PW.
We return to you, dear viewers, and today we will talk about revenge medicine.
A letter by hand, hand in hand.
This treatment has been practiced since ancient times.
We have a guest.
The exam format is as follows.
It swells, the degree of pain.
You feel inside as if there's something like sand or shattered veins within the hand.
Loosen your grip.
My brother is a nervous wreck.
You feel stressed and have a little tension, tension.
Left side.
Now, dear viewers, we are examining the left side of his body.
So they know what we're doing.
Any health problem would be evident, we now know about his headaches and dizziness.
Is there any pain here?
Pain means trouble.
Problem! What does the problem mean in this context?
In this case, the sinuses, the ear.
He's shivering. Do you have a sinus problem or any other issue?
I had an operation, but that was a long time ago.
Is this my nose or what?
He gains weight without eating.
Alright, your left shoulder.
This is due to nerves, when I told him he was suffering from nerve tension.
Ten years ago, he was walking barefoot on the beach.
We know that when a person walks on the beach, I think he empties.
Any uneven ground is not just the sea.
Negative energy may %PW.
And perhaps he was amazed at you that you discovered these things through massage.
Of course, children are the most important.
Children, praise be to God. This is for Father, pay attention!
What harms him is the milk and food he eats.
Her baby is next to her, it automatically lies down and closes.
Close your hand.
Just a little pressure, thank God.
You'll find it in a few seconds and the baby will be happy. First, he'll feel the pain because of the pain here.
Later, you'll see the gases suddenly escape.
What are the discoveries you've made, Mr. Abdulaziz?
But less than other problems, people now suffer from arthritis, bones, headaches, thyroid and obesity.
The second thing for menstrual pains or period pains in general.
You should focus on a rock or stones, by pressing here, you are giving commands, Allahu Akbar for the lower back and menstrual problems. If you feel pain calendar calendar calendar calendar calendar
In seconds, God willing, it will disappear.

Delivery has become easier for her.
Either here or there, God knows best.
If they tell her there's a chance for delivery on the seventh or you can deliver on the ninth.
Except on sand.
If you walk on sand, it's fine, but if you walk on rocks, no.
You should eat seven fresh dates for breakfast, fresh dates are better.
If she doesn't have soft dates, dried dates are sufficient.
As Allah the Exalted said: "I seek refuge in Allah from the outcast Satan, verily my knowledge is from the Quran."
This means that God could not have brought these soft dates to her, no, He could not.
Praise be to God, and I seek refuge in the word 'I'.
You should bring small rocks or balls.
The birthing bed. For example, if she forgets and comes to the birthing bed, she grasps the handles.
You will notice in private hospitals, a lady from East Asia will come.
So, this is a practice in East Asia.
No need, you already have my mobile phone.
Mobile only!
"Cooperate with each other," I advise everyone who is listening to me now.
Make charity a habit and also care for others. You were created to worship God and then...
To serve people, that's the first thing. Second, I'm not a religious leader or a sheikh, I'm an ordinary man.
I would like to thank you, Mr. Abdulaziz, for this wonderful interview, and also thank our guest.
Thank you for coming, and I wish you all the best.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al Thani, Director of Public Health at the Supreme Council of Health, will address this topic in more detail.
Good morning, Sheikh.
Let's start with a look at these activities.
The program is healthy steps towards Qatar.
Is the program part of the national strategy to treat, combat obesity?
Around four of the world's top countries in terms of obesity are Gulf states.
We launched a strategy at the Supreme Council of Health, of course in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and other authorities, to combat obesity.
For fear of its spreading further and further soon.
One of the programs to protect against obesity is healthy steps towards Qatar.
We can make this contest together into an international one.
The program consists of sex weeks.
Every week is different from the next.
To raise awareness among seventh and eighth-grade students about the importance of health at this age,
Because this is the first stage where they become conscious of themselves.
In the first week, as you remember, it was about what is your favorite fruit?
The second week is walking.
You have to walk! The more you walk, the more points you get.
It's a map of Qatar, and every time someone gets points, they move forward and their schools move forward and their class moves up.
So a beautiful competition is created among the students.
In the second week, he drinks water, we don't want him to drink soda.
We tell him to drink water. There's no need to drink all that soda every time you feel thirsty. Don't drink water!
Later, in the fourth week, your favorite sport.
There are some games at school that some people don't like.
We are looking for a sport he loves.
So we force him to exercise.
The child is eating a healthy meal.
And his family members know that they should invite their child to eat a healthy meal.
And Al Jazeera Academy, an academy for girls and boys, until we take.
Certainly this is just a model, and with its success, God willing, we will gain more expertise in the coming years.
The students are happy and feel more energetic.
We need more games, we had so much fun with our colleagues.
The girls say their skin has improved and acne has decreased.
This is true, this is true and becomes consciousness.
Parents know about their children.
And their classmates from different classes, asking them how are you? And learning from their classmates.
And thanks to God, it is starting to spread that many schools are eager to participate next year.
Inshallah
Qatar was the official sponsor in supporting this.
We had the Aspire zone which provided sports competitions and awareness.
On the dining table.
So, thank God for the many authorities, some of which I mentioned and some I didn't.
But praise be to God, everyone participated in part.
And otherwise, the brothers did it in the form of separate lessons, or curricula, or
There was variety.
We tried to do different kinds and involve as many people as possible.
It's the next generation.
To publish this experience or disseminate it as much as possible in Qatar.
When you assess that there is something that needs to be fixed,
After its spread now and its satisfactory results,
God willing, we will expand because people are asking us why we weren't there.
Eat, eat healthy food and you will achieve this, you have no problem.
When we reach this age, when it starts from an early age, he will achieve what he wants by his twenties or twenties-five.
Sir, Your Excellency mentioned a series of titles, each group had a title.
If we return, we will try in today's paragraph to talk about the conclusion of the activities.
And when we mentioned people again in our program, we had more than one guest.
Let's repeat and what were the information for each week we want to present to the student
Alright, first thing, of course, the first week is your favorite fruit.
Every lesson was about fruits and their benefits.
What are the benefits of fruits rich in vitamin C?
So, he starts by liking some fruits, not all fruits are his enemies.
He might be allergic to one or two, but why doesn't he eat the rest?
Second week walking, people think walking is only for the elderly, why are young people walking?
It means when I grow up, I'll walk.
On the contrary, you walk because it soothes your mind and brain.
It is a relief to the individual, meaning that walking in mental clarity improves.
Take the students on excursions.
Yes, they all had to walk, whether at home or at school.
They earn their points through the class teacher.
What they walk in every day.
It was an event; people marched, the girls' school marched.
We want them to like this, creative with unique ideas.
The spirit of competition and teachers should think outside the box; we don't want to give them ideas to stick to.
Everyone has their skill in this aspect.
Certainly, the third week is about drinking water. We always try to drink water to avoid feeling thirsty and wanting to drink soda.
Of course, the fourth week is your favorite sport.
If we can find out his favorite sport and support him in it,
He will be interested in sports.
Their love for sports is through practicing it, he practices sports unconsciously.
We mentioned earlier that we would talk about the Qatar Multiple Sclerosis Society.
Let me welcome our guest for today's show to the studio.
Thank you.
We are happy to have you here at this exhibition.
And part of it is this disease that some of us may not have heard of.
Initially, as the Egyptians say, we will go straight to the point.
It's a chronic disease.
that affect the nervous system in a person's body.
The period between twenty and forty years.
This disease still has no cure, and the cause of the disease is unknown.
It affects the active group in society, which is usually the youth.
The treatments used for cancer patients, God willing, protect you from any harm from other diseases.
This disease is an infection of the brain and spinal cord.
The central nervous system in the human body.
The body assumes the entry of a foreign body into the body.
A neuron is
Cover this wire.
The white cells, or white blood cells, start to kill or dissolve this insulating layer.
that lead to the absence, weakening, or interruption of the nerve signal.
Leads to paralysis, may God protect.
No, with the development and progress in medicine, there is still no cure for this disease.
Alright, apart from the solution, we want to know how to get there.
Also, one should be careful of this thing.
The main reason is, quality of life, nature of food or life cycles?
Or what is the precise direct cause that drives a person to be affected by this disease.
All we have now are theories.
Even in marriage.
They are trying to solve the health problems that humans suffer from.
Yes, yes.
All these topics can be somewhat controversial in society.
So far, we know his reasons.
Alright, the age group that might be affected by this disease, multiple sclerosis.
Of both sexes.
Certainly, after forty years, the disease starts to subside with the person.
So far, we haven't found a cure for this disease.
Is this evidence of a lot of people in the Gulf, the Arab world, or let's talk about Qatar.
In Saudi Arabia, statistics indicate that they have twenty-five thousand cases.
And also Qatar.
Recently, just last week, I was informed of three to four cases that were diagnosed.
We currently have one hundred and twenty-five patients, this is recorded in the files.
Many people, when diagnosed with this disease, go for treatment in other countries.
Alright Mr. Abdulaziz, are there any effects like someone being infected with this disease?
Are there any signs that give the patient's family or the patient themselves an indication that they have multiple sclerosis?
And this virus, for example, kills.
We must be clear about this, it's not a virus.
Because nerve disease, nerves control the whole body.
Providing a specific reason for a particular location, type of food, or lifestyle.
