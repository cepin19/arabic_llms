Jesus called a little child to him and put the child among them.
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.

"Whoever welcomes such a little child in my name welcomes me."
"But what if someone were to lead one of these little ones who believe in me into sin? It would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea."

"If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter heaven with one hand or foot than to be thrown into hell with two hands and two feet. In hell, the disbeliever will be tormented forever."
"If your eyes deceive you, then kill yourself, and if your heart deceives you, follow it, for they command you with debauchery and disbelief. And indeed, the most righteous among you will be in the Fire. And most of you are in peace. Indeed, this is the true narrative. And what makes you know what the true narrative is? My Lord destroys the criminals."
"See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you, their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father who is in heaven."
(No
"What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine in the hills and go to look for the one that is lost?"
What I'm about to tell you is true. If he finds that sheep, he will be happier about it than about ninety-nine sheep that did not wander off.
So it is with your Father in heaven. He does not want any of these little ones to be lost. When someone sins against you
"If your brother sins against you, go to him and tell him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won him over."
"But what if he doesn't listen to you? Take one or two others along with you. The Scripture says, 'On the evidence of two or three witnesses a matter is to be confirmed' (Deuteronomy 19:15)."
But what if he refuses to listen to the witnesses? Then tell the church. And what if he refuses to listen to the church? Then treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
"I am not going to speak to you except in truth. What you seal on earth is sealed in heaven, and what you open on earth is opened in heaven.
And again, here is what I tell you. Imagine that two of you on earth agree on anything you ask for. My Father in heaven will do it for you.
"Where two or three are gathered in my name, I am among them." The servant who showed no mercy.
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy times seven."
"The king of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants."
When the king began to do that, a man who owed him millions of dollars was brought before him.
The man was unable to pay. So his master gave an order. The man, his wife, children, and all that he had were to be sold to pay off his debt.
The servant knelt before him. "Give me time," he pleaded. "I'll pay everything back."
The lady felt sorry for him. She forgave him his debt and set him free.
But the servant went out and found one of the other servants who owed him a few dollars. He seized him and began to choke him, saying, 'Pay me what you owe!'
The other servant fell to his knees. "Give me time," he begged. "I'll pay you back."
But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and threw the man into prison until he could pay back what he owed.
The other servants saw what happened. It disturbed them greatly. They went and told their master everything that had occurred.
Then the lord called his servants and said, "Wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me.
Shouldn't you have shown mercy to the other servant as you did to me?
In anger, the master handed the prisoner over to his guards. He will be punished until he pays off all his debts.
"That is how your Father in heaven will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart."
Jesus teaches about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Large crowds followed him. He healed them there.
Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that from the beginning God made them male and female?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife, and they become one flesh" (Genesis 2:24).
There are no longer two, but one. Therefore, a man must not separate what God has joined together.
They asked, "Why then did Moses command a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away?"
Jesus answered, "It was not this way from the beginning, but because you are so hard-hearted Moses allowed you to divorce your wives."
This is what I'm telling you. Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery. A man can only divorce his wife if she has been unfaithful to him.
The disciples said to him, "If such is the case between husband and wife, it is better not to marry."
Jesus answered, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining celibate. Only those who have been helped by someone to live without marriage can accept it.
Some men cannot have children because they were born that way. Some became that way because of other people. Others made themselves that way for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. And whoever can accept living that way should do so." Little children were coming to Jesus.
Some people brought children to Jesus. They wanted him to place his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he departed from there. Jesus and the rich young man.
A man approached Jesus and asked, "Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
"Why do you ask me what is good?" Jesus answered. "There is only one who is good. If you want to enter the kingdom, obey the commandments."
"Which one?" asked the man. Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness against anyone."
"Honor your father and your mother" (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) and "Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"I've obeyed all those orders," said the young man. "What should I do next?"
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."
When the young man heard that, he left sadly. He was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When the disciples heard this, they were astonished. They asked, "Then who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "For mortals this is impossible, but for God all things are possible."
Peter answered and said, "We have left all and followed you. What then shall we have?"
"I am not able to say to you that what I am about to do is right," Jesus told them. "But when all things are made new, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, and those who have followed me will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
Everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.
But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.
The Story of the Workers in the Grape Farm
"The kingdom of heaven is like a man who became the owner of a field. He went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard."
He agreed to pay them the usual daily wage. Then he sent them to his vineyard.
He went out again around nine o'clock in the morning. He saw others standing in the market square doing nothing.
He said to them, "Go, you also, and work in my vineyard, and I will give you a just wage."
So they went out. "He went out again around noon and at three, and he did the same thing.
He left around five and found others standing around them. He asked, "Why were you standing here all day doing nothing?"
"Because no one has hired us," they answered. "He said to them, 'You also go into my vineyard.'"
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to the foreman, "Call the workers and give them their pay, beginning with the last ones hired, and then the ones hired first."
The hired workers arrived around five. Each received their usual day's wage.
Therefore, when those who were first hired came, they expected to get more. But each of them also received the regular daily wage.
When they received it, they started complaining about the owner.
"Those people who were recently hired only worked for one hour," they said. "They were paid the same amount as us. We did most of the work and were under the scorching sun all day."
The owner replied to one of them, "My friend, I am being fair to you. Didn't you agree to work for the usual daily wage?"
Take your money and go. I want to give the one I eventually hire the same pay I gave you.
Can't I do what I want with my own money? Do you feel cheated because I've been generous to others?
"So the last will be first, and the first will be last." Jesus speaks again about his upcoming death.
Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. And on the way, he took the twelve disciples aside to speak to them.
"We are going up to Jerusalem," he said. "The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death..."
"Then they hand him over to a group of non-Jews. The group mocks him and beats him. They crucify him on a cross. On the third day, he rises from the dead!" A woman asks Jesus for a favor.
The mother of Zebedes' sons came to Jesus. Her sons came with her. She knelt down and asked him to do her a favor.
"What do you want?" asked Jesus. She said, "Promise me that one of my sons will sit at your right hand in your kingdom, and promise me that the other will sit at your left."
"You do not know what you are asking," Jesus said to them. "Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?" "We are able," they answered.
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The other ten pupils heard about it. They were angry with the brothers.
Jesus called them together and said, "You know that the rulers in the Gentile world lord it over their people, and their high officials exercise power over them."
Do not be like that. Rather, whoever wishes to be great among you must be your servant.
And whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave.
"Be like the Son of Man. He did not come to be served, but to serve others. He came to give his life as a ransom to set many people free." Two blind men are given their sight.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, and a large crowd followed them.
There were two blind men sitting by the roadside. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The crowd ordered them to stop. They told them to be quiet. But the two men shouted even louder, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stopped and called to them. "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.
"Our Lord," they answered, "we wish to be able to see."
Jesus felt deep concern for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately they could see. And they followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem.
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them,
And he said to them, "Go into the village opposite you. And immediately as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, and a donkey with it; untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone says anything to you, say that the Lord needs them. The Master will send them money right away.
This happened so that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled. And he said,
"Say to the city of Zion, 'See, your king comes to you, humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.'" (Zechariah 9:9)
The disciples went and did what Jesus commanded them.
They brought the donkey and the colt. They laid their cloaks on them. Then Jesus sat on the cloaks.
A very large crowd of people spread out on the road, opening their coats. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
Some spread their cloaks on the road ahead of him, while others spread branches they had cut in the fields. And they shouted, "Praise be to the Son of David!" "Hosanna in the highest heaven!" (Psalm 118:26) "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred. The people asked, "Who is this?"
So the crowd answered, "This is Jesus the Nazarene, the prophet." Jesus cleanses the temple.
Jesus entered the temple area and began to drive out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be a house of prayer for all nations' (Isaiah 56:7), but you have made it a den of robbers" (Jeremiah 7:11).
The blind and the lame came to Jesus in the temple. He healed them there.
The chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the miracles he did and heard the children shouting in the temple courts, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" They were indignant.
"Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," answered Jesus. "Haven't you read this in the Scriptures? 'The lips of children and infants praise you' (Psalm 8:2)."
Then Jesus went out from the crowd and came to the town of Bethsaida. He spent the night there. The vine branch withers.
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the road. He climbed it, but found nothing on it but leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit!" And at once the tree withered.
When the pupils saw this, they were puzzled. "How did the olive tree dry up so quickly?" they asked.
Jesus answered, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what has been done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done."
"If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer." Questioning Jesus' authority.
Jesus entered the temple courts, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and asked, "By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered, "I also will ask you one question. If you tell Me, then I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
"Where did John's baptism come from? Was it from heaven, or from men?" They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Why then did you not believe him?'"
But what if we say, "of men"? We are afraid of people. Everyone thought John was a prophet.
So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things. The Parable of the Two Sons
"What do you think about this? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first son and said, 'My son, go work today in the vineyard.'"
"I won't do it," the son replied. But then he changed his mind and went.
Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing to him. The son answered, "I will, sir," but he did not go.
"Which of the two did the will of his father?" They said, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John came to show you the right way to live, but you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. You saw him, but even then you did not turn away from your sins and believe him. The parable of the tenants.
"Listen to another story. There was a man who owned some land, so he planted vineyards. He built a wall around them. He also dug a winepress in it. He built a watchtower. He leased the vineyards to some farmers. Then he went on a journey."
When the time of harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants. And he commanded his servants to gather his share of the fruits.
But the tenants seized his servants. They beat one of them. They killed another. They threw a stone at the third to kill him.
Then he sent other servants to the tenants. He sent more than he had sent the first time. The tenants treated them the same way.
Finally, he sent his son to them, saying, "They will respect my son."
But the tenants saw the son coming. They said to each other, "This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours."
So they took him and cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
"What does the owner do when he returns with these tenants?"
"Those evil people will be destroyed," they answered. "Then the vineyard will be rented to others. They will give him his share of the crop at harvest time."
Jesus said to them, "Have you not read in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
"This is what I am telling you: The kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will bear its fruit.
Anyone who falls on that rock will be shattered into pieces. But the rock will crush anyone it falls on.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' stories. They knew he was talking about them.
So they looked for a way to arrest him. But they feared the crowd. The people thought that Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Story
Jesus told them more parables. He said:
"This is how the kingdom of heaven will be like. A king prepared a wedding banquet for his son.
He sent a servant to those who were invited to dinner. The servant told them to come. But they refused.
"But when the other servants came, he said, 'Tell those who are invited, "See, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet."'
But people didn't care. One went to his field. Another went to his work.
The others seized his servants. They treated him badly and then killed him.
The king was furious. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed the murderers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants, "The wedding feast is ready, but those I invited were not worthy to come.
Go to the street corners. Invite anyone you find to dinner.
So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and soon the wedding hall was filled with guests.
The king entered to see the guests. He noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.
My friend said, "How did you get in here without your wedding dress?" The man couldn't find anything to say.
Then the king signaled to his servants, who bound his hands and feet, and they took him outside and threw him into the darkness. There people wept and bit their teeth.
"Many are called, but few are chosen." Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went out. They devised plans to trap Jesus with their words.
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. "Teacher," they said, "we know that you are a man of integrity. You teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Don't let others tell you what to do or say. Don't be influenced by their importance.
So tell us, what do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
But Jesus knew their evil intentions. He said to them, "You hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the currency that people use to pay taxes. They brought him a silver coin.
He asked them, "Whose picture is this? And whose words are these?"
"Caesar," they replied. Then he said to them, "Give back to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and to God what belongs to God."
When they heard this, they were distressed. So they turned away while they were arguing among themselves. "Marriage when the dead rise."
On the same day, the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They do not believe that people rise from the dead.
"Teacher," they said, "this is what Moses told us. If a man dies and leaves no children, his brother must marry his widow and father children for him, so that his name will not be lost."
There were seven brothers among us. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened to the second, third, and even the seventh brother.
Finally, the woman died.
Well, when the dead rise, who will be his wife? All seven were married to her.
Jesus answered them, "You are wrong, because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God."
When the dead rise, they will not marry. Nor will their fathers give them in marriage. They will be like the angels in heaven.
"What about the resurrection of the dead? Haven't you read what God has told you?"
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob" (Exodus 3:6) "not the God of the dead, but the God of the living."
When the crowd heard this, they were amazed at his teaching. The most important commandment.
When the Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus, they gathered together.
One of them, an expert in the law, tested Jesus with a question.
"Teacher," he asked, "which is the most important commandment of the law?"
Jesus answered, "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God. Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. (Matthew 5:5-12)"
This is the first and most important commandment.
"You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against your kinsfolk. Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"All things written in the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments." Who is the Son of Man?
The Pharisees gathered together. Jesus asked them,
"What do you think about Christ? Whose son is he?" They answered, "The son of David."
He said to them, "Why then does David call him 'Lord'?" The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. David said,
"The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool' (Psalm 110:1)"
So how can David be his son when he calls him "my lord"?
No one could answer him in a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him any questions.
Jesus condemns the Pharisees and the teachers of the law.
Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples.
He said, "They sit in the seat of Moses, and the Pharisees and the scribes."
Therefore, you must obey them. Do everything they ask of you. But do not do as they do. They do not practice what they preach.
They burden others, but they themselves do not wish to lift a single finger to help.
"Everything they do is done for others to see. On their foreheads and arms they wear small boxes containing verses from the Bible. They make the boxes very wide. And they make the tassels on their robes very long."
They love to sit in the place of honor at banquets. They also love to be in the most important seats in temples.
They love to be welcomed in the markets. They love it when they are called "Lord."
"But you are not to be called 'rabbis,' for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers."
Do not call anyone on earth your father; for One is your Father, He who is in heaven.
You are not to be called 'teachers'; you have one teacher, the Christ.
The most important person among you is your servant.
He who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.
"How terrible it will be for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. You yourselves do not enter, and you hinder those who are trying to enter."
(No
"How terrible it will be for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert to your faith. And when you have succeeded, you make that person twice as much a child of hell as you are.
"How terrible it is for you, blind guides! You say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold in the temple, he is obligated.'
You are blind and stupid! What is more important, gold? Or is it the temple that makes the gold sacred?
You also say, 'Anyone who swears by the altar is bound by their oath, but anyone who swears by the gift on the altar is bound by their oath.'
Oh my uncle! Which is more important? Is it the gift? Or the altar that makes the gift sacred?
"So everyone who swears on the altar swears by it and by everything on it.
And whoever swears by his house, swears by it and by the One who dwells in it.
And whoever swears by the sky, swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it.
"How terrible it is for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices, such as mint, dill, and cumin, but you have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice, mercy, and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former.
Oh, you guides! You remove the smallest insect from your food. But you swallow a camel whole!
"How terrible it is for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed. You only want to please yourselves.
"Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside will also be clean."
"How terrible it will be for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean.
This is the case with you. From the outside, it seems like you're doing what's right. But on the inside, you're full of what's wrong. You're pretending to be something you're not.
"How terrible it will be for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.
And you say, "If we had been with them, we would not have killed the prophets."
So you bear witness against yourselves. You admit that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
"So complete what the former among you have started of sins!"
"O den of venomous snakes! How will you escape the torment of Hell?"
Therefore I send you prophets and wise men and teachers. You will kill some of them. You will crucify some of them. You will flog others in your synagogues. You will drive them from town to town.
"Therefore you shall pay for every drop of innocent blood shed on the earth, from the blood of Abel the Iberian to the blood of Zechariah, son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar."
What I am about to tell you is the truth. All this will happen to those who are living today.
"Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I wanted to gather your children, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you would not have it!"
Look, your house is empty.
I say to you, you will not see me again until you say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord." (Psalm 118:26)
Signs of the End of the World
Jesus left the temple. As he was going away, his disciples came to him to point out the temple buildings.
"Do you see all these things?" asked Jesus. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. There his disciples came to him privately and said, "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end?"
Jesus answered, "Watch out! Beware of being deceived."
Many will come in my name, saying, "I am the Christ!" and they will deceive many.
"You will hear of wars. You will hear people speaking of future wars. Do not weep. These things must happen. But the end is not yet."
There will be wars and rumors of wars. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines. Earthquakes will occur in various places.
All these are the beginning of the birth pangs.
"Then they will hand you over to be beaten and killed, and you will have to bear the expenses of every nation."
At that time, many will turn away from their faith. They will hate each other. They will hand each other over to their enemies.
Many false prophets will arise. They will deceive many people.
Because evil grows, the love of most people will grow cold.
But those who endure to the end will be saved.
This skin from our kingdom will be published all over the world. It will be a witness to all nations. Then comes the end.
The prophet Daniel spoke of the 'abomination that desolates' (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11) which you will one day see standing in the holy place. The reader must understand this.
Then those in Galilee will go to the mountains.
No one on the roof goes down to his house to get something.
No one in the field should go back to get their coat.
How terrible that would be for pregnant women! How terrible that would be for nursing mothers!
Claim that you won't have to flee in winter or on Saturday.
There will be terrible suffering in those days. It will be worse than anything else since the beginning of the world until now. And there will never be anything like it again.
If time were not shortened, no one would survive. But for the sake of God's chosen people, it will be.
At that time people will say to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'There he is!' Do not believe it.
False Christs and prophets will appear. They will perform great signs and wonders. They will seek to deceive the chosen people of God, if possible.
Look, I told you before.
"Therefore, if anyone tells you, 'It's far out in the desert,' don't go there. Or if anyone tells you, 'It's deep inside the house,' don't believe it."
The lightning that lights up the east is seen even in the west. So will it be on the day when the Son of Man appears.
Eagles will gather wherever there is a corpse.
"After the terrible suffering of those days, 'the moon will be disgraced and the sun ashamed; the stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will be shaken.' (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)"
"At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory.
He will send His angels with a loud trumpet call. He will gather His chosen people from all the four corners. They will bring them from one end of the heavens to the other.
Learn from the fig tree. Once its branches become tender and its leaves sprout, you know that summer is near.
In the same vein, when you see all those things happening, you know that the end is near. It's at the door.
What I intend to tell you is true. And the people who live at that time will not die until those things happen.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
No one knows that day or hour. Not even the angels in heaven know. The Son doesn't know. Only the Father knows.
"Remember how it was in the world in the days of Noah. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking. They were marrying. They were giving their daughters in marriage. They were doing all those things until the day Noah entered the ark.
They did not know what would happen until the flood came and took them all. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
There will be two men in the field. One will take and the other will leave.
Two women will grind using a hand mill. One will be taken and the other left.
"So beware, for you do not know the day your Lord will come."
You must understand one thing. Imagine that the homeowner knows at what time of night the thief comes. Then he would have kept a watch on his house. He wouldn't have left his house unlocked.
Therefore you also must be ready; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
Imagine that a master put one of his servants in charge of the other servants in his house. The servant's job is to give them their food at the right time. The master wants a faithful and wise servant for this.
It would be good for the servant if the master finds him doing his work when the master returns.
What I'm going to tell you is true. The master will put this servant in charge of all that he owns.
But what if this servant is wicked? What if he says to himself, "My master will be long away.
Suppose he started beating other servants. And suppose he eats and drinks with those who drink a lot.
The master of that slave will come on a day when the slave does not expect him. He will return at an hour the slave does not know.
Then his master will cut him to pieces and send him to the place where flatterers go. There people will weep and gnash their teeth.
The Story of the Ten Virgins
"This is how the kingdom of heaven will be at that time. Fifteen virgins took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were fools. And five were wise.
The fools took their lamps, but they did not take olive oil with them.
The wise took the oil in their vessels with their lamps.
The groom didn't come for a long time. So all the bridesmaids fell asleep and slept.
At midnight, someone shouted: "Here's the groom! Come and meet him!"
Then all the maiden's attendants arose and trimmed their lamps.
The fools said to the wise, "Give us of your oil; our lamps are going out."
" 'No,' they answered. 'There may not be enough for us all. Instead, go to those who sell oil. Buy some for yourselves.'"
So they went to buy oil. But while they were on their way, the bridegroom arrived. And the brides who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. Then the door was locked.
Then came the other brides. "Sir! Sir!" they said. "Open the door for us!"
But he replied, "What I will tell you are facts. I don't know you."
"So be ready, for you do not know the day or hour when the bridegroom will come. The parable of the three servants.
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a man who went on a journey. He called his servants and gave them his property.
He gave $10,000 to one. He gave $4,000 to another. He gave $2,000 to the third. The man gave each servant the amount he knew the servant could handle. Then he continued on his journey.
The servant who received $10,000 went immediately and put his money to work. He gained another $10,000.
He who earned $4000 earned $4000.
But the man who received $2000 went and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money in it.
After a long time, the master of these servants returned. He wanted to collect all the money they had earned.
The man who was given ten thousand dollars brought the other ten thousand. He said, "Sir, you entrusted me with ten thousand dollars. Look, I have made another ten thousand dollars."
His lord answered, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your lord!"
"The man who was given around $4000 came. He said, 'Sir, you trusted me with $4000. Look, I have made another $4000.'"
His lord answered, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your lord!"
Then the man who had received the two thousand pieces of silver came and said, "Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not scatter seed."
So I was afraid. I went out and hid $2000 for you in the ground. Look, this is yours.
And his master said to him, "You wicked and lazy servant! Did you know that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter seed?
Alright, you should've deposited my money in the bank. When I returned, I would've collected it with interest.
Then his master said to the other servants, 'Take the 2000 dollars from him and give it to the one who has 20,000 dollars.
From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked. What about the one who has nothing? Even what he has will be taken from him.
Throw this worthless servant out. There in the dark, people will weep and gnash their teeth.
"The Son of Man will come in all his glory. All the angels will be with him. Then he will sit on his glorious throne.
All the nations will be gathered before him. He will separate the people into two groups, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
He will set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.
Then the King will speak to those on his right, saying, "My father has blessed you, so come forward and take what you desire. Verily, it was befitting for him who was among you, but the King is not Usamah ibn Zayd."
I was hungry. And you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty. And you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger. And you invited me in.
I needed clothes. You gave them to me. I was sick. You nursed me. I was in prison. You came to visit me.
"Then those of them who had believed will come and say, 'Our Lord, we were misled by the wicked on earth, and we followed the path of error.' (14) So You made us stray, and to You is the return, and You have seen."
When did we see you a stranger and invite you? When did we see you in need of clothes and give them to you?
When have we seen you sick or in prison and gone to visit you?
The king will answer them, "Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me."
Then he will say to those on his right, "What is your situation with me? Have you no blessing? Go to Paradise! And to those on his left, "What is your situation with me? Have you no blessing? Go to Hell, which has wide-spreading flames, burning their faces. How evil is the destination!"
I was hungry. But you gave me nothing to eat. I was thirsty. But you gave me nothing to drink.
I was a stranger. But you did not invite me in. I was in need of clothes. But you did not give me any. I was sick and in prison. But you did not visit me.
"And they will say, 'Our Lord, when did we come to You as seekers of Your help, or as thirsty ones, or as naked ones, or as sick ones, or as prisoners, and You did not help us?'"
Jesus will say: "Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me."
"Then they will flee from it, but the fugitives will not succeed. And these are the ones who believed in Our verses and kept the covenant with Us; they are the believers."
Plan to kill Jesus
Jesus finished saying all these things. Then he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, Caiaphas.
They plotted to arrest Jesus cleverly. They wanted to kill him.
"But not during the feast," they said. "It might stir up trouble." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in the house of Simon the Leper at Bethany. A woman named Martha was there, and her sister Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his teaching.
A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster flask of very precious ointment, and poured it on His head as He sat at the table.
When the pupils saw this, they got angry. "Why all this waste?" they asked.
The perfume could have been sold at a high price. The money could have been given to the poor.
Jesus knew this. He said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a good thing for me."
There will always be poor people with you. But you will not always find me.
She poured perfume over my body to prepare me for burial.
What I am about to tell you is true. What you have done will be told everywhere this good news of the kingdom is preached in the whole world. It will be told in memory of you. "John baptizes Jesus"
One of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests.
He asked, "What will you give me if I hand Jesus over to you?" They paid him thirty pieces of silver.
Since then, Judas kept watching for the right opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. The Last Supper
That day was the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover meal?"
So he told him, "Go to a certain man in the city and say to him, 'The Teacher says, "My time is near. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples."'
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover.
When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve.
He said, while eating, "What I am about to tell you is true. One of you will hand me over to my enemies."
The disciples were very sorrowful. And each one began to say to him, "Is it I, Lord?"
Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand with me in the dish, he will betray me.
"The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. Woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born."
It was Judas who would betray him. He said, "It isn't me, Teacher, is it?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is you."
While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is my body."
Then he took the cup, gave thanks, and offered it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you."
This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
This is what I tell you. From now on, I will not drink wine with you again until the day I drink it with you in my father's kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus says Peter will fail.
Jesus said to them, "This very night, all of you will fall away on account of me. For it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)
But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee.
Peter replied, "Everyone else may stumble because of you, but I never will."
"What I am about to tell you is true," Jesus answered. "This night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times that you know me."
But Peter said, "I may die with you. But I will never say that I don't know you." All the other disciples said the same. Jesus' prayer in Gethsemane
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there to pray."
He took Peter and the sons of Zebedee along with him. And he began to be sorrowful and very troubled.
Then he said to them, "My heart is overwhelmed. I feel like dying. Stay here and keep watch with me."
He went a little farther. Then he fell on his face and prayed, "Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned to his disciples, and found them sleeping. "Could you not watch with me one hour?" he asked Peter.
"Take care of prayer and piety. For through them you will be protected from error when you obtain what you desire. Indeed, the mind is inclined to sin, and the body is weak."
Then Jesus went away a second time and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done."
Then he returned. He found them sleeping again. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
So he left them and went away. And for the third time he prayed the same prayer.
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you sleeping and resting? Look at the green field and the doves. Do you not complete what has come into your house from the harvest?"
Rise up! Let us go! There is the one who will betray me to them! Jesus is arrested.
As Jesus was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. He was accompanied by a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders.
Judas, who was to betray Jesus, had arranged a signal with them. "The one I kiss is he," he said. "Seize him."
So John went to Jesus at that very hour and said, "Teacher, behold, your disciple!" And he kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you have come to do." Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' companions seized his sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
"Put your sword in its place," Jesus said to him. "For all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you think I can't ask my father for help? He would immediately send an army of over 70,000 angels.
But how, then, do prophecies come true? They say that this must happen.
Meanwhile, Jesus spoke to the crowd. "Do I lead a band of armed men against you?" he asked. "Why did you not arrest me when I was in the temple courts every day teaching the people? You did not lay a hand on me."
"But all this has happened that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all his disciples left him and fled. Jesus before the Sanhedrin.
Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.
Not far away, Peter followed Jesus. He went directly to the high priest's courtyard. He entered and sat down with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the whole council were looking for evidence against Jesus to use it against him and kill him.
But they found no evidence, although many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two other witnesses presented themselves.
They said, "This man claimed, 'I can destroy the temple of God, and I can rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the chief priests stood up and asked Jesus, "Do you have no answer to what these men are accusing you of?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."
"Yes," Jesus answered, "it is as you say. But I tell you all, in the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? You have heard the blasphemy with your own ears."
"What do you think?" they answered, "He must die!"
Then they licked his face. One of them hit him with his fist. Others slapped him.
They said, "O Jesus, speak to us, who struck you?" Peter said, "I do not know Jesus."
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A servant girl came to him. "I also was with Jesus of Galilee," she said.
But before all these, Peter said it wasn't so. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.
Then he went out to the gate that leads to the garden. Another woman saw him from another gate and said to the people, "This one was with Jesus of Nazareth."
And again he said that he wasn't. He swore, "I don't know the man!"
A little later, those who had been standing by came up to Peter. "You must be one of them," they said. "Your way of speaking gives you away."
Then he began to curse and swear, saying to them, "I do not know the man!" Immediately a rooster crowed.
Then Jesus said to him, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times that you do not know Me." Peter went out and wept bitterly.
Judas hangs himself.
It was early morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to put Jesus to death.
They bound him and led him away. Then they handed him over to Pilate, the governor.
When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned to death, he was filled with remorse and despair for what he had done. So he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
"I made a mistake," he said. "I released an innocent man." "So what?" they replied. "That's your problem."
So Judas threw the money into the temple and went away. Then he went and hanged himself.
The temple priests picked up the coins. They said, "Putting this money in the temple treasury is a crime. It is blood money. It was paid for the death of a man."
Therefore, they decided to use the money to buy a cemetery plot. People coming from other countries will be buried there.
That is why it is still called "Field of Blood" to this day.
Then the words of Jeremiah the prophet were fulfilled. He had said, "They will give thirty pieces of silver for him, the price of a slave, since they valued him so lightly."
"So they used the money to buy the Potter's Field, as the Lord had commanded me." (Zechariah 11:12-13; Mark 19:1-13; 32:6-9) Jesus was handed over to Pilate.
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "Yes, as you say."
But when the high priest and the elders accused him, he did not answer.
Then Pilate asked him, "Do you not hear the charges they are bringing against you?"
But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge. The governor was quite amazed.
It was the governor's custom at Easter to release one prisoner. The people could choose whom they wanted.
They had a famous prisoner at that time named Barbarossa.
So when their governor, Pontius Pilate, had gathered them together, he said to them, "Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas? or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Pilate knew that the chief priests were envious. He knew that this was the reason they had delivered Jesus to him.
While Pilate was sitting on the judge's bench, his wife sent him a message. She said, "Don't have anything to do with that man. He is innocent. I have suffered much in a dream today because of this man."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas' release and to have Jesus put to death.
"Which of the two do you want me to release?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered.
"What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ?" asked Pilate. They all answered, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What has he done?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
Pilate saw that it was getting him nowhere. In fact, the crowd was beginning to get restless. So he took a basin, washed his hands in front of them, and said, "I am innocent of this man's blood. You are responsible!"
Everyone answered: "We and our children will bear the responsibility for his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas. But he had Jesus flogged, and then handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
The governor's soldiers took Jesus to the palace, which was called the Kremlin. All the other soldiers gathered around him.
They removed his clothes and put a purple robe on him.
Then they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!"
They threw insults at him. Someone hit him on the head with a stick repeatedly.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him and put his clothes back on him. Then they led him away to crucify him. Jesus was crucified.
As they led him out, they met a man from Cyrene named Simon, and they forced him to carry Jesus' cross.
They came to a place called Golgotha. Golgotha means "place of the skull."
There they mixed wine with various bitter spices and offered it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it.
When they crucified him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots.
They sat there guarding him.
They placed a sign above his head that read: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
Two thieves were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
Those who passed by shouted insults at Jesus and mocked him. They shook their heads.
He said, "So you will destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days? Save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"
Likewise, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders mocked him.
"He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
He trusts in God. Let God save him now if He wants to. It is he who said, "I am the Son of God."
Even the robbers who were crucified with Jesus mocked him. The death of Jesus.
From noon until three, darkness covered the whole earth.
Around the third hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which means "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of those who stood there heard Jesus crying out. They said, "He is calling Elijah."
So one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
The others said, "Leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah will come to save him."
After Jesus cried out loudly again, he died.
At that moment, the temple's curtain was torn from top to bottom. The earth shook. The rocks split.
The graves were opened. Many of the saints who had died were brought back to life.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus was raised from the dead, they went into the holy city. There they appeared to many people.
The Roman commander and Jesus' guards saw the earthquake and what had happened. They were terrified. They cried out: "Surely he was the Son of God!"
It was not far away, there were many women watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to provide for his needs.
Mary Magdalene was among them. Mary, the mother of James and John, was there as well. The mother of Zebed's sons was also there. They buried Jesus.
As evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came. He was a disciple of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Yusuf took the body and wrapped it in a clean cloth.
He placed her in his new tomb he had hewn out of the rock. He rolled a large stone in front of the tomb's entrance. Then he departed.
Mary Magdalene and the other woman sat opposite the tomb. The guards at the tomb.
And the next day, which was the day after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
"My lord," they said, "we remember something the liar said while he was still alive. He claimed, 'In three days I will return.'"
So give the order for the tomb to be guarded until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body, and then claim that Jesus has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first.
"Take some guards with you," Pilate answered. "Go. Make the tomb as secure as you can."
So they went and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone and setting the guard.
Jesus ascends to heaven.
Saturday was over. Dawn was breaking on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other woman went to examine the tomb.
There was a strong earthquake. An angel of the Lord came down from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. The stone was rolled back and the angel sat on it.
His body shone like lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were trembling and almost dying of fear from him.
The angel said to the woman, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.
Come here! He rose, as he said he would! Come and see the place where he was lying.
Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' That is my message for you.
The women fled from the tomb. They were afraid, but also filled with joy. They ran to tell the disciples.
Then Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with you.” And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me." The guards went and reported to the chief priests.
As the women were on their way, some of the guards entered the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
When the chief priests met with the elders, they devised a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
They told the soldiers, "We want you to say, 'His disciples came at night. They stole his body while we were sleeping.'"
If the governor hears this report, we'll pay him off. That'll keep you out of trouble.
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus' last commands to his disciples.
Then the eleventh disciple went to Galilee. And they went to the mountain which Jesus had commanded them.
When they saw him, they bowed down to him. But some had their doubts.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
Teach them to obey everything you command them. And you can be sure that I will always be with you, to the end.
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
The prophet Isaiah wrote long ago: "I will send my messenger before you, who will prepare your way" (Malachi 3:1).
"A voice cries out: 'In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.' (Isaiah 40:3)"
And so John came. He baptized people in the desert. He also preached to the people that they should be baptized and turn away from their sins, and then God would forgive them.
All the people of the countryside of Judea and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. They confessed their sins, and he baptized them in the Jordan River.
John wore clothes made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
Here is what John was preaching: "After me comes one who is mightier than I, so strong that I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals."
"I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." The Baptism and Testing of Jesus
At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
Jesus came up out of the water. At that very moment, he saw the heavens torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.
A voice from heaven spoke to him. It said, “You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.”
And the Holy Spirit descended upon Jesus and drove him into the wilderness.
He was in the desert for 40 days. There, the devil tempted him. Wild animals did not harm him. Angels attended to him. Jesus chooses the first disciples.
After John was imprisoned, Jesus went to Galilee. He preached the gospel of God.
"The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God is near. Repent of your sins and believe in the good news!"
One day, Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. He saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting their net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
"Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will make you fishers of men."
So they left their nets at once and followed him.
Then Jesus went a little further with them, and saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax booth.
So he cried out to them immediately. And they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after Jesus. And Jesus cast out a spirit that was mute.
Jesus went with those who were with him to Capernaum. And when the Sabbath came, he entered the synagogue and began to teach.
The people were amazed at his teaching. He taught them as one who had authority, not as the scribes.
Suddenly a man in their church shouted. He was possessed by an evil spirit. He said,
"What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!"
"Be silent!" Jesus said sternly. "Come out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Then it came out of him with a scream.
So the people were amazed at him. They said that day, "What is this but a human being like us, who eats food and drinks beverages? Yet he claims to be a messenger and a warner. Perhaps he is only a truthful man and a guide."
The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout all the region of Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left the temple and went at once with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed with a fever. They told Jesus about her.
So he went to her. He took her hand and helped her up. And the fever left her body. Then she began to serve them.
That evening after sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who were sick and those who were possessed by demons.
All the people in the city gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many of them. They were suffering from all kinds of diseases. He also cast out many demons. But he would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prays in a quiet place.
It was still dark, dawn having just broken, when Jesus got up, left the house, and went away by himself to a solitary place. There he prayed.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they shouted, "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus answered, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages. I must preach there also. That is why I have come."
So he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons. And he healed every disease and every affliction among the people.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus. He knelt down and begged him, saying, "If you choose to make me clean, you can."
Jesus was very troubled. He reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing to do it," he said. "Be 'clean'!"
The disease immediately left him. He recovered.
Jesus sent him away immediately. And he gave the man a stern warning.
"Do not say this to anyone," he said. "Go and show yourself to the priest. Offer the sacrifices commanded by Moses. This will be evidence to the priest and the people that you are 'clean'."
But the man went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer enter a town openly. He remained in secluded places, but people still came to him from everywhere.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk.
A few days later, Jesus again entered Capernaum, and the people heard that he had come home.
A great multitude gathered together, so that there was no room, not even outside the door. And Jesus preached the word to them.
Four of the arrivals were carrying a man who couldn't walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after digging out the tiles, they lowered the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying.
Jesus saw their faith. He said to the man, "Child, your sins are forgiven."
Some law professors were sitting there. They were thinking.
"Why is this person like this? He says such evil things! But God forgives sins!"
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say to this man, "Your sins are forgiven you"? Or to say, "Rise, take up your bed and walk"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus spoke to the man who couldn't walk.
"I tell you," he said, "get up. Take your prayer mat and go home."
The man rose and took up his mat. Then he walked away, while everyone watched. They were all amazed. They praised God and said, "We have never seen anything like this before!" Jesus chooses Levi.
Jesus went out again beside the Sea of Galilee. A large crowd came to him. He began to teach them.
As Jesus walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector’s booth. “Follow me,” he told him, and Levi got up and followed him.
Then Jesus ate dinner at Levi's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples. They were part of the large crowd that was following Jesus.
There were some teachers of the law who were Pharisees. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. So they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this and said to them, "It is not those who are healthy who need a doctor, but those who are sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance." Jesus asks about fasting.
The disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came to Jesus and said to him, "The disciples of John fast, and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but yours do not. Why do they not fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them. On that day they will fast.
People do not sew a new piece of cloth onto old clothes. If they do, the new piece will tear away from the old one. That will only make the tear worse.
People do not pour new wine into old wine skins. If they do, the wine will burst the skins. Then both the wine and the skins will be destroyed. No, they pour new wine into new wine skins. Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On one of the sabbath days, Jesus was walking through wheatfields with his disciples. And the disciples began to pluck some of the heads of grain.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look, your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath."
He replied, "Have you never read what David did? He and his men were hungry. They needed food.
That was in the days of Abiathar the high priest. David went into the house of God, and ate the shewbread, which was lawful only for the priests to eat. And he gave also to his companions.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
"Therefore the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath day."
Healing on Saturday
At another time Jesus entered the temple. There was a man with a withered and distorted hand.
Some Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They were watching him closely. They wanted to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus spoke to the man who had a withered and paralyzed hand. He said to him, "Stand up before everyone."
Then Jesus said to them, "What does the law say we should do on the Sabbath? Make it a day for good deeds or for evil? To save life or to destroy it?" But they remained silent.
Jesus looked at them with anger. He was very angry because their hearts were hard. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched out his hand, and his hand was restored as good as new.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians against Jesus, how they might kill Him. Multitudes were following Jesus.
Jesus went with his disciples to the Sea of Galilee. Large crowds from Galilee followed him.
The people heard all that Jesus was doing. And many came to him, from Judea, Jerusalem, and all the surrounding regions, including Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and around Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowd, Jesus asked his disciples to prepare a small boat for him. This would protect the people from crowding around him.
Jesus healed many people. Therefore, the sick were pushing forward to touch him.
When the people who had evil spirits saw Jesus, they fell on their faces and worshiped Him. The spirits cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them not to tell who he was. Jesus appoints the twelve apostles.
Jesus went up a mountain. He called some people to come to him, and they came.
And he appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles, that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach.
They will have authority to cast out demons.
So Jesus appointed twelve, and among them was Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter.
There were Jacob, son of Zebedee, and his brother John. Jesus gave them the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder.
And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus. Also, Thaddaeus and Simon the Zealot.
Judas Iscariot was one of them. He was the one who would later betray Jesus into the hands of his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebub
Jesus entered a house. Another crowd gathered. The crowd was so large that Jesus and his disciples could not eat.
His family heard about it. So they went to take care of him. They said, "He has gone mad."
There were some scribes. They came down from Jerusalem. They said, "He is under the authority of Beelzebul! He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons!"
So Jesus said to them, "How can Satan drive out Satan?"
If a kingdom fights itself, it will not stand.
If the family is divided, it will not stand.
