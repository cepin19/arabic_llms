If my brother is blind
He refuses to improve himself or those around him.

No, no, no, no, I don't care what you say.
Walking in the street.
And some dates, two stuffed dates.
And you're hungry.
Do you eat or not?
No, I'll eat.
Tell me, has it happened before?
Your husband is too old to accept that.
I'm tired of him.
This is our chance, our cars are shamefully old.
Try to talk to him, please.
These things are common and normal.
The fool! He lacks self-confidence.
Wow, are you scared?
What really gets on my nerves
Is he responsible for the budget?
What is this project that he is responsible for?
It's a massive government project.
It's hidden downstairs.
I have the right to take the money.
Do you work in another ministry?
Oh mom, how could you forget!
And today at the factory
That means I will
I consider myself a participant!
I never get anything out of it.
Will I get nothing?
This means I'm involved too.
We're all supposed to take.
This is a government project.
But your foolish son won't understand.
I will talk to him.
What you reject of good
This is a government project.
This is your chance.
Just like others do.
The table of fortune is before you.
Take your share.
He didn't have a single penny in his pocket.
I heard it myself.
It is known that government projects are...
And the third is plunder.
His son climbed the ladder.
Went to the standing market.
It cost him one lamp eight riyals.
They budgeted for it.
At one hundred and eighty riyals each.
They said they hadn't done anything wrong.
You'll get bored of it.
"Seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan."
Oh, but I think he changes his mind.
God willing, my God.
He is the president and everything is in his hands.
Most importantly, don't forget about us.
We are your friends.
We must be together.
Such a government project is an opportunity.
Sure, Oh! Ali
We won't be able to do that without you.
Don't be afraid, Uncle Ali.
And with God's will, everyone included in the project.
Certainly
Yesterday, I was talking with our friends.
From your side
We are not worried because you are members of the project committee.
Worried about Saleh, the project manager.
They say that
Don't be afraid, Uncle Ali.
And tell your friends not to worry.
Oh my! Abu Fahd?
This is good news.
But, Saaid, don't forget.
No, no
Insha'Allah, everything will be alright.
Let Saleh agree first.
I'll take care of him.
I was wondering if I'd get some perks.
Is it possible?
Then you're involved in the project because you work with us in the same department.
But most importantly, it should remain a secret between us.
I found a plate of rice and meat in front of you.
I'll definitely do that.
Good appetite
What's wrong with you!
If you remain so oblivious,
What will happen won't work.
This won't work.
Or questions
If you need help, we'll be happy to assist you.
How are we going to get our share?
Or that it's logical.
What's his name!
Also, we're not the only ones who will take
Every participant will be required to contribute their share.
Why not!
Don't be afraid, Saleh.
We're the ones who will set the budget.
What land did he buy today?
Did he find it too?
No one can afford it.
Where did you get this information?
Call me today.
Because my brother's phone was turned off.
I said, "What's wrong?"
Inform your brother.
Another earth
The one next to the land he bought yesterday.
The sale has been approved.
He said: "Please call him to see if he wants it, I'll reserve it for him."
He doesn't want to share money with us.
Can you see our money?
We are considered participants with him.
Even if we weren't participants!
You're eating a big mouthful by yourself.
At least give some to your brother and mother.
I didn't come to beg you.
We are partners in the project as well, we have the right to ask for our share.
Tell her, tell her.
It is true that when the sultan came and asked him about his share, he refused.
But I didn't agree to it.
You have to give him a share of the project.
Phase one.
You are no less than anyone else.
Project Committee Members
I heard him speaking to them.
They are bringing in their brothers and friends.
I know that government projects are free for everyone.
We only want a limited amount of money.
I am from the shareholder capital.
That his brother Sultan attend the committee meetings if he wishes.
because it seems that the committee members
Project budget
But we want
Thank you
O father of Saleh
Your wife's brother!
You will love it.
The project will benefit.
Let's remind ourselves.
We divided the task, right?
You, Saleh!
I'll be responsible for the cement, bricks, and concrete.
And leave the rest, from water to electricity, to me.
O people!
Take your share.
I swear,
Sometimes I decide to take some money.
And sometimes I say
Let me take a cut.
No problem, Saleh, no problem.
Take what you want using your preferred method.
Above all,
And we too,
Even during this week,
Everyone sets the amount they want to have.
For example,
And after a few days, they change their minds.
And I ask for more than one hundred thousand.
Well, but why like this, right?
See what you think.
I agree.
Even the participants,
Focus on your looting work, ignore him.
And there are also the funds of orphans.
More budget.
Many people want to eat.
Who does he think he is?
This! Is this your father's project!
Yes, he is a sultan.
Oh, my brother Sultan.
It means he is a participant.
Is that the last name?
Your friend Saud adds a lot of names.
He keeps adding names, saying, "Let's take advantage of them."
So, in which group do I add it, percentage or amount of money?
No, put it with the beggars.
%pw How much should you allocate to him! Put twenty thousand for him.
Yes, enough.
They even added a note here saying
He is our neighbor.
But Saud's list is longer than Abdulaziz's list.
All of that will be considered as part of the Phase One budget.
As a bundle, no one will notice it.
Yes, here is the list that my mother sent.
She calls every two hours and adds people without permission.
Haha, live longer.
My eye that I don't want to tear, my son.
God bless you, %pw is sick and poor.
But the woman has no money.
May God bless you, I told you the last one.
Tell him it's a liver transplant surgery.
Wait! Yes, wait... How much is enough for you?
Enough for the liver, accommodation, and hospital!
Around one hundred and eighty thousand riyals.
How many livers are you going to transplant!
Just one, my sister is precious.
Yes, God bless you, put her name on the list.
Hussaina, yes yes, Hussaina bint Hilal.
You're giving her from your own money!
Reassure him and tell him that I didn't take anything from phase two.
Yes, one hundred and eighty thousand riyals.
Oh man, they're going to replace her liver with a new one.
Tell him, tell him to add two thousand, I want to buy gifts for my daughters.
Alvin
Write for me.
Yes, Haneen bint Hilal
I'm embarrassing you in front of your friends!
No, Mama.
I have a lot of work.
Later, I'll call you later.
He who eats from the table has increased.
The infrastructure is capable of bearing the load.
Don't forget me.
Write the number you want.
I don't know.
It's in your hands.
I am the chairman of the board.
And I tell you, you deserve a million.
They decide that the project will start tomorrow.
And they will pay us continuously.
How much! We want to know!
They will give it to us all at once or in installments.
Why does she get more than us?
If there's an electric shock or looting, it doesn't matter, the important thing is to stay quiet, we're waiting for them and they're coming.
He told you to stop talking, so you stopped talking.
What shames you.
If you hear someone speaking
I will sew his mouth shut.
They kept us locked up for a long time.
You know this is money, it's not a simple matter.
What was its price before?
Fifty million
It seems you're taking a big bite.
You are the boss after all.
We don't want a headache.
Let's approve the budget.
Mr. Saleh, from your speech about the project, we noticed that it is a very exciting and important project.
And not this generation only
Yes yes
Tomorrow, the first phase of the project will be inaugurated.
We would like to thank you for your presence and congratulations once again.
And I welcome
On this occasion
I am from the United Nations.
Where to? To the project.
Where are we then!
I don't know where we are.
I'm bored.
I didn't see the officials speak, and the audience applauded them.
We are at the official opening, what do you have?
Alright, now talk, this means we're on the project.
Yes, we are in the project.
And people sweat.
And these dividers, I don't know what they put inside them.
Leave the box alone.
These divisions are the infrastructure.
The official opening of International Beaches
Third millennium, what bothers you?
I really don't know.
Ah, thank God, old age is a disease.
I wish I knew why I was fired.
He's just parking his car.
I found this visit strange.
But when you told me
No one told me anything.
I saw it myself, there's a big farm over there.
Praise be to God, you are well.
Get checks from the comfort of your home.
Why are you upsetting yourself, my love? Don't let anyone enter your mind, Manira.
You should thank God, Manira, for having brothers like Rashid, Saad, and Saqr.
Be concerned about your share and invest it.
Over there, look at my friend Huda.
Her brothers don't give her a single riyal from her father's inheritance.
We don't do that.
This is your legitimate right.
This is a matter of trust... Don't you trust us!
I don't know.
I'm satisfied with what my brother, Rashid, said.
He keeps reminding me of the check they give me every three months.
But, it's my right.
He always tells me.
Don't you trust us?
Financial and inheritance matters must be clear.
If you, my love, are not satisfied.
You know what he does to people.
And the mother of Salim is an example to you, this poor lady.
Who would believe she inherited millions?
For her brothers
Money destroys people.
But business is business, and it's your legitimate right.
And so, what next?
We run the company.
Investment in land, real estate, and money
No problems, no headaches.
She said she was passing through the area, in the desert.
This is more than enough for her.
I'm afraid her husband, Nasir, is behind this.
What's the problem?
Your sister started *searching*.
This is the problem.
She's planning to get us into trouble.
We're the ones who give her money.
Be quiet, Falcon.
We must find a solution to this. Oh, Rashid!
In my head
What is this?
My share of my father's inheritance
The charity they give me every three months.
Everything is clear.
No more than forty thousand.
As if they don't invest money.
I see, I see, I see, I see
Clear
Clear.
They said they'd give her more so she'd be happy and stop asking.
This is true, everything you said is correct.
They give it to me little by little.
If you only saw their wives.
It has many different diamond jewelry pieces.
And we have not that which they assert.
What they feel I deserve of my father's inheritance.
If you ask for it,
It's your right.
Legal and legitimate right
I feel like they're stealing from me and lying to me.
I don't feel comfortable with the way they behave.
Life is precious, oh my dear God.
They exhaust me, they make me sick, oh my darling.
They don't know the judgment and the penalty.
And that God will punish them for taking people's money.
And beware, don't mention anything to them about the court, oh! My dear.
They will be happy.
Is it due to overpopulation?
That's why I say, oh! My dear.
Calm down
Everyone has an apartment that resembles a skyscraper.
I only want what's rightfully mine.
I want to build a mosque before I die.
And give Zakat to the poor.
Um Salmien
Leave it to God, my love.
Do not mention anything to them about the court.
Or anything else
You know why!
At this time
Her rights are stolen.
You were inquiring with the accountant.
Who are you!! to ask him.
Answer them!
Yes, I am... No, no, I'm here for your sister.
The door through which I entered.
Don't be surprised.
Do you know the door I entered through?
No, no
No sorrow.
Alas, Saad.
Manar, don't get yourself into trouble.
If you want your share of the company and the property, we don't object.
Six hundred thousand
She was content throughout her life.
I'm sure she's his evil wife.
Because she is kind.
As if I'm begging them.
It is a well-known and defined legal rule.
He tells me it's either five hundred thousand or nothing.
What happens
Expect anything Oh! Munira
My father's company.
Eight buildings.
Without mentioning lands and houses
He says only six hundred thousand.
By executing the waiver document
No oh! Munira
Don't be fooled and sign the paper, be careful, I warn you.
It's your right to know everything about the lands, the money, and everything else, it's none of their business.
But the company,
You are a partner.
You were fired from the company.
No one can stop me.
Do you know what?
Is it your father's company?
You don't see him screaming.
Let me in, I'll tell you.
Leave it, there's no need.
He has a paper, I don't know what it is.
He's shouting at us, make him shut up.
We apologize.
My brother Saad went to the office and explained to them, they don't know.
Enter
See if Mr. Nasser wants something to drink.
Please enter.
Certainly %pw
You're going to lead us to disaster.
He will discover how much she loves him.
He will discover that we owe her four hundred thousand, not forty thousand.
Let's do the calculation.
In sixty-six months,
Here's the problem, multiply it by three hundred and six.
Eleven million, five hundred twenty thousand
Oh, okay?
Let him do what he can.
I'll tell him frankly.
This is our money.
Everyone who inherited did so.
Welcome, we're glad to have you with us, ignore what happened.
Welcome
Here is the accountant, Sami.
Answer any questions Mr. Nasser may have.
The whole company is under your control.
If you want to come in, don't hesitate, and don't ask any questions.
Thank you
Rely on me.
Go and get it, take it.
Let him access all the files.
It is supposed to take more than ten million.
They didn't mention it at all.
She said: "She was poor."
That her father left her.
Four buildings.
I thought they had three lands.
Every land is greater than the other.
God is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs, O people.
They are not doing this fairly.
Don't leave them alone.
What can I do, Mother Salman?
I must sue them; there is no other option.
He will speed up in reading two papers.
The case has been postponed.
Beware, my son, Owi, Nasser.
Don't mention anything about the court.
Oh my god!
Wake up, Mother of Salem.
Go to your room.
And all the Muslim patients
What he told me
Excuse me, who is speaking?
Ah, now I remember you, yes yes I remember you.
Yes yes yes yes
As for why, my brother!
It doesn't matter, thank you.
Now that he knows we have money, he's gone crazy.
Do you think Abdullah, whom I sent to them?
Is he a close friend of Rashid?
He knows him well, for years.
Do you believe Minira?
Even Abdullah gave me some advice.
Follow them.
Don't leave them alone.
Try to take as many as you can.
Do you know what Abdullah says to me?
It's not for people who live seventy or eighty years.
It's for people who will live for at least two hundred years.
Um Salmān, may Allah have mercy on her.
God willing, may God have mercy on her, she used to say.
Our population has reached four hundred thousand.
And if the case takes ten years or more.
Do they force us to *mummify* ourselves in order to consult the court?
This is it.
Yes, dear, do you sit with them?
Good luck.
By the way, he's an old friend.
Life is short.
And I ask you for my benefit.
And you come from a large and well-known family.
Deeply rooted.
Oh Rashid, please, we are friends.
Please go while I'm still calm.
Or you'll get a beating.
Go away, and forget about friendship.
Are you going up or what?
Paid one hundred and eighty-nine thousand for a diamond jewelry set from the jewelry exhibit.
Where did she get all this from?
They waste money on their wives.
And she deprives her sisters of her wealth.
Do you have hope, Nasser?
They fought with you.
When I spoke to him yesterday at the mosque.
Let me do what you commanded me to do.
Well-known people and their roots are deep.
Perhaps, why not?
But, I also suggest
O Allah, bless this conversation with these radiant faces.
O God, enlighten our hearts with what is best for us in this life and the hereafter.
You, listen
If you have something to say other than the matter of my sister's share.
It's true.
It's better to go than to get slapped in the face.
What matters to me is what you say.
I begged you for months, and you refused.
What matters to me.
I'm leaving tomorrow morning.
Give me
Hello, hello
Don't believe her.
You won't go to court.
The day after tomorrow
We'll give you a chance to see what you'll do.
Goodbye
There's no use being kind to them.
And they realized that their reputation was at stake.
We'll see what they decide.
Saad, are you busy tomorrow?
I've decided to take legal action against them.
I asked her to postpone it until tomorrow so that we can go there tomorrow.
What is this?
You are right.
I asked why.
You want to go to court and sue us.
To get your share of the inheritance
Yes, I did.
Insha'Allah, your life is sweet.
Inshallah, a happy life.
Why, I told you we want to go the day after tomorrow.
Upon your arrival, first park your car in the parking lot.
You'll see the security guards.
You go to the eighth floor.
The judges are on this floor.
Business cards of all the lawyers in the country
I'm sure you'll need it.
You came here to laugh at us.
We want her to sue us.
Go to court.
Listen to Manar.
And he signed a waiver document for us.
What's happening
You know the way.
Show us the way.
Go, brother!
I forgot to give Mona something important.
This is the Al Raya newspaper today.
There's a nice article like this.
It was written by a woman, I think she's a doctor.
I want you to look at her, as a gift *from me*.
His status as a resident must be changed.
It's sad.
He has four children, but his house is miserable.
He will do that; he has lost all his wealth.
Invest in this project.
Someone I would never expect to start a business is Bou and Waleed.
Eat, eat, the new merchant's sons, Bou and Walid.
My love, do you want me to get you something to eat?
No, I'm fine.
Get up and move, buy some fruits.
Oh mom, I want a game for Hamood.
Bon appétit, bon appétit
My son Waleed, put some candy for your brother.
Congratulations on the project, Oh! Bou Walid, you deserve it.
My friends found me an excellent accountant.
Thank you, son.
Father, when we become big merchants, I want to have my own room.
See what he asked for, he has no ambition, my dear son.
Alright, I'll get you a large-sized BlackBerry.
They forgot their wishes now.
Like everyone else.
Replace our small, humble house.
First and foremost, let's pay off all our debts, and then we'll see.
It seems you're very happy, Bou Walid.
He eats more than before.
He's a trader, luck is with him.
All my father's hair is gray.
Blessings to the project.
Leave some for my friends.
God willing, bless us, O Allah.
I met a Japanese man, he was among them.
When we were seated, I exchanged my seat with him, he gave me a catalog as a gift.
Later, one of my friends saw that.
He said, "It's an opportunity."
Multi-purpose halls?
"That's always the way it is."
It's a computer lab.
Click on the cinema.
If you want the field...
This is magic.
They were amazed, and all said yes.
I took a loan from the bank, some from my relatives, and sold some of my land, praise be to God.
Now, with the committee's approval,
Why didn't you request it and get approval from the ministry?
And then an email will be sent to the factory.
He will call you when he arrives.
There's some rosemary tea.
Nothing, I'm still waiting at Ali's office.
And the secretary called, my brother.
And to be away for ten days.
It's sheer luck.
My papers are ready.
And the committee approved it.
Why don't you sign it?
Aren't you a fully authorized manager?
Why don't you go to him and sign for you?
I told you he can't.
He's just one of the employees there; they all do the same thing.
Appearance can be deceiving sometimes.
You must thank God.
I was there trying to get the signature, and I was anxious.
Finished?
How will I finish this when Bou Fahd didn't show up?
What can I do?
After that, I will lose my money.
I want him to sign as soon as possible so it's done, I don't know what to do.
I'm afraid the manager is asking about you.
Tell him I'm sick, anything.
I'm waiting.
You say you're his secretary, but what about us?
And give me your phone number.
What is a secretary, please, please, it's not him, what's going on
Don't call, you scare people, they think you're the secretary.
No, we're still waiting for Bu Fahad.
%pw, My money for fixing the bathroom.
He is stupid.
Oh people, wait, wait.
Quiet, quiet.
He told you to shut up, enough, be quiet.
Bu Fahad left for the airport.
How did it go?
Let's see that man by the car before he leaves.
What's his problem?
God bless you.
Wait for Boufahd.
Don't blame your father, my dear.
But he behaves strangely.
And if he did not receive the goods,
He won't be able to get his money back.
And now she needs it.
Where is he now?
What are you looking for?
It's here, in front of you.
You're calling me in the middle of the night.
Brother, I told you.
I told you.
It's out of my hands, my daughter.
I know, Dad, but that's not fair.
The lecture will start next week at the university.
If I don't enroll, I'll have to wait until the next semester.
Three months of wasted time.
Oh my God! My love, I'm trying.
Don't you think I go to the ministry every day?
Wait until Bou Fahd comes, Bou Fahd.
And I'll stay at home.
I don't understand!
Don't call me during lunchtime.
This is the fourth time you've called me.
You are stupid.
I know you need the money.
But, we hope that Boufahd will sign the papers this week.
They are giving him the first installment.
I don't know what to tell you, sister.
He wakes up in a panic.
He walks around and talks to himself all night while sleeping.
If Bu Fahd doesn't sign,
O God, help.
Therefore,
Fahad must sign this paper this week.
What is he waiting for?
He comes to the office once.
And travel for a year.
And left the care of people.
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Do you feel better now?
Break me into pieces
This strange fever drags me, pulls me.
What does he want?
I heard that I'm going to the ministry.
To process my papers.
He told the staff that he would punish me.
The end of the time period is approaching.
Give me the phone, give me the phone.
He is Secretary to Bu Fahd.
I'd like to tell you that
Bu Fahad will come tomorrow, for sure.
As soon as I call you
Come directly
"Khair bu"
You were never that kind of person.
I'm talking to you.
And your eyes on your phone screen
I said it's a pity.
Until you feel responsible
And if you are committed
I'll take you back to your department.
Fifteen boxes of printed newspapers
Fifteen boxes of paper for printing.
It's sad.
The manager punishes him.
By taking him with us
Have you heard about the factory?
He's going to lose his money if they don't sign his papers today.
If he goes while the manager knows.
Ah, yes, tell me.
What if the manager asks about him?
We'll take care of that, just let him go.
Bu Waleed
I'll go, but I'm expecting a phone call.
Tell me
God bless him.
Wait, people, wait.
How can I know where he is going?
Wait, Fahd.
Do not move.
Don't sit.
Wait, Fahd.
Don't go to work.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Wait, Fahd.
Wait, Fahd.
To go and look for him in Uzbekistan.
Room by room
Street by street
Tra
Call the hospital, quickly.
Do not call the hospital.
Wait, Fahd.
I have lived my entire life as a messenger, for many years, until today.
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
What were you thinking?
Perhaps about fourteen years.
As a messenger
Such a headache.
And sweat without air conditioning in past years.
Do you think riding a bike was easy before?
With a yellow mark
It was a very difficult period, oh! Bou Said
Alas, my son!
But what can we do, son of Adam?
Bu Saad
Alright, sorry guys, the manager has arrived as he said, let's finish our work.
The manager has arrived. Oh! Beautiful, let's go.
Congratulations, Bou Said.
They said your son Khalid is an employee.
What I told you
I told you, God willing.
Pigeon thief
I told you when my last son graduates, I'll resign.
Graduated and got a job.
Alhamdulillah, I'm going to finish my work.
You performed your duty to the best of your ability.
Praise be to God.
Change your opinion, Abu Saeed.
And you deserve it.
Thank you very much, Uncle Abdulaziz.
I am truly grateful, Abu Abdulaziz.
Yak
We have done our duty.
Let them continue the journey.
It's your right.
After all this age and work
It means they all come and go.
You need to rest, Umm Saeed.
After I leave here, my wife calls me.
Celebration of my retirement
A pot of coffee and some dates, how wonderful.
When will we finish, my son?
You are in a hurry because of Khanfoush, oh! Bou Said
Don't be afraid.
Ready-made thief
Jay, sure, goodbye.
I told you the khanfroush is ready, waiting for me.
I'll finish all your paperwork now.
This is your chance to submit it today.
He told me that their manager would travel.
I don't have the energy or motivation.
What I even want to move.
Send it with someone else.
Now, you are officially free.
Thank you
Now, you are free to rest.
Thank you very much, Uncle Abdulaziz. Goodbye.
Congratulate me
No work after this.
It means you're free, Papa.
Alright, please, Father.
Yes, Human Resources
Thank you, goodbye.
Zohra is throwing a party to celebrate her son's passing of his exams.
Baking a cake.
I can't.
I've already sent my dad to get some papers.
Zahara will get angry.
Alright, Mom.
My father left work.
"O God, help him now."
Enough work, let him rest.
Let him rest.
He asked me to cook some khonafrush.
I prepared it.
And I was waiting.
Fear God and have mercy on your father.
Your turn now.
He will eat it tomorrow.
He wants to rest.
You made this old man tired.
As soon as he returns,
He was tired.
Don't restrict me concerning them (singing)
Don't restrict me concerning them (singing)
I wanted to take these papers to the bank on my way to work.
He said that he would punish anyone who was late.
Sure, my love.
Go to your work.
On this nose, and those small Chinese eyes, goodbye.
Bu Sa'id
He sends you to a place every day.
As you wish, Umm Saeed.
Smell
In my nose
"Seller of dreams, selling dreams."
Why did you go to the central bank?
No, Father, take it to the market branch.
And you're there
Are you sure? I don't want to go there and they tell me he's not here.
Okay, goodbye.
I got sunburned.
The sun hit.
I entered our neighbor's house.
The maid recognized me.
She asked me what was wrong.
What makes you do that?
No, Mother Saeed, I can't eat khanfush now.
Oh mama, where is papa?
Back and forth
She didn't tell him which bank to go to.
They told him that some of the papers were missing.
I asked him to take a taxi.
Oh mom, we had a meeting with the director.
How is my father now? Is he better?
I slept a little, the headache is gone now.
I'm telling you in front of his eyes.
Leave your father, let him rest.
Alas, O Mother of Saeed
They must adhere to their tasks, they will be evaluated, what can they do?
As you wish
%pw Bo Shayne
You say I retired, but I didn't retire.
How does that mean?
Before, in the past,
My fate is misery.
Your children have become adults.
I must help them.
They were telling me.
You are wrong.
Do you think that all young people without a father don't complete their personal work?
It depends on the job.
In some jobs, they let you go to get your personal work done.
"O Allah, reward you with the best."
Come closer, there's a cafe behind you.
Where are you going, Shahin?
With God's permission, I will finish some papers for my son Saeed.
In this ministry, which is next to this cafe
I'll take her to the land department.
Goodbye
What's the matter, Mom? Okay, I'll see you later. Bye.
This won't help you.
I warn you.
I heard you say this to Saeed.
Your father is sick.
What matters to me is you.
If your father doesn't complain
He is silent.
And he doesn't talk about her.
"You've exhausted him, fear God."
Your very loud screaming woke me up.
Oh father, I was a government employee and know well what hoarding means.
They are writing this first.
And now they are %pw, doing this.
Tomorrow is the last day to repay loans at the Development Bank.
No, no, who said that?
Alright, son.
I believed his lie.
He says he has a neighborhood committee meeting tomorrow.
Inshallah!
%pw, as you like
Go now to complete his work.
Nothing, nothing
He has been silent since he came home.
What replies to me?
You have no shame.
I don't blame your father for being angry with you.
If you agree to this.
"A lot, and may God reward you."
He was supposed to call you.
Why does he pretend to be his servant?
You deserve the most respect, O father.
And I thank you.
May God forgive him.
Let me teach him.
From now on, father!
And relax.
"Khanfaroosh Khanfaroosh (Singing)"
Thank you, ...
Your satisfaction, Father.
O Allah, make it a charity for You.
We decided that from now on,
We'll do our own paperwork.
Thank you all very much, may God reward you well, praise be to God.
But, O father!
Consider it the last.
But I can't.
Call me now.
Father, I'm not going to the meeting. I hate meeting the minister.
The minister will be angry with you.
No, no, no, this is impossible, the minister cannot be disturbed, you must leave, even before him.
I don't want to go any further, what I mean is, I don't want to bother you.
Don't say that.
Your papers are with me, consider it done.
He'll be on his way once you finish Saeed's papers.
O Allah, my father.
Consider it the last straw for me.
I am happy to be at your service, Father.
But your son is supposed to sign this paper.
You mean I should come back to give it to you tomorrow.
I advise you to return it today.
And if they do not see the newspapers
You'll have to wait for two months.
Don't give it to me until he signs it, then I'll come back to you.
No, no, no, no need.
Tell him to call me and ask him to come, just for two minutes.
I'll finish it.
Do you know Saeed?
No, he's on vacation.
And return after sunset.
All our friends are there.
Whenever I ask a friend: Where are you?
He replies that he is with Saeed.
I wait until the end of work time.
Alright, man.
Why did you come to finish your paperwork yourself?
Why didn't you send your children?
You don't have any children.
Are you okay, sir?
Sir, please take them.
Many thanks
No use.
I will leave you.
Go to the old people's home.
What I want to tell them is where I'm going.
What are you telling them, Abu Saeed?
I will write something else.
Yes, praise be to God.
He got out of prison yesterday.
She's not really my sister.
Why are you exhausting yourselves?
I told him never to appear on TV or radio.
This talk about "stopping corruption" is what got us into trouble.
O Allah, guide him to the straight path.
Okay, sister, goodbye, may God bless you.
Did he go to prison?
I was far away.
What can I say to you?
The program named it "My Last I Think".
Talk to the man.
Khaled Jassem
He told him to stop the corruption.
His colleagues heard from him.
He started talking about the government.
Even oil and money
I don't know what happened to him.
None of his friends
Those who were encouraging him to do so,
He left it.
O Allah, guide him to the straight path.
Sorry, I must go and cook now.
Welcome anytime.
Come, my son.
Sit here.
Stop corruption, son.
I'm tired and can't be bothered with this.
I've been in the hospital for two days.
You deserve it, my mother.
Sorry to hear that happened.
I told you about this.
What is this, Mother?
And he screamed.
This commitment
God kept you safe this time.
I warn you.
Don't worry, Mom.
But let's not talk about the subject.
Stop corrupting.
Why did the manager fire the employee?
It's sad, after all these years, you're firing me.
What are you hearing?
Stop corrupting.
Again, please.
Yes, correct.
You are a reasonable man.
Those who follow public affairs and criticize.
Well-informed
We just fired a few people.
And you are one of them.
There's nothing personal.
Okay, goodbye.
Uncle Saleh
I hope your uncle, Manira's father, didn't find out.
He's angry with you.
Who will know it?
If he asks you
Tell him that I'm working.
I told you they were going to fire him, didn't I?
His mother said he was still working.
Of course
His mother says
What do we do with it now?
We can't let our daughter suffer with him.
What you see is correct.
I'll give him two weeks.
But, if he doesn't find a job, I'll take him to court to divorce my daughter.
Drink your coffee.
You only spin around yourself if there's something on your mind.
To be honest,
I want to go out.
You have been suspended.
I know you want it badly.
Go to a cafe.
Until you talk nonsense
Go to your room and sleep.
And tomorrow morning I'll look for a job.
God willing, I will wake up early.
Oh Mother, I told you, I've gotten rid of that habit.
I swear
Oh mother, to be honest, I'm a little bored.
And don't talk nonsense.
Act deaf.
It has changed.
Look, man, something's wrong with you. Where's your voice? Why aren't you speaking like before?
We want to hear some of your words about fighting corruption.
Stop corrupting.
Stop corrupting.
Salih is here!
He must be sleeping.
Did my son do something wrong?
We just saw him at a café.
"A thing if said"
He did the right thing.
Because there are a lot of people around.
Say to him
Don't waste your time.
If I see you here, I'll cut off your leg.
If it wasn't your fault,
His mistake was not stopping you.
I know you well.
You're like someone who's quit smoking.
Do we talk or not, do we give anti-corruption talks or not?
I warn you.
If I hear you speaking on the radio
Or righteous... Stop corruption.
Mr. Saleh, you are a good citizen, you are very patriotic.
We can't offer you the job.
What can I do?
Sorry
Hello Saleh, how are you?
I hope you didn't go to the trouble of coming, we appreciate it.
Later
I yearn every day to hear that, stop the corruption.
You are a very brave man, you fear nothing.
Please say it, just once.
"May Allah bless you."
Is it a cigarette? Just say stop corrupting, please.
He's begging you, take it for him, just once.
This is wonderful
Now, my dear
For the job
You are a loyal citizen, and very dear to us.
We wanted to call out to you to let you know.
He would humiliate you publicly.
You're serious.
They all said there were no vacancies.
They really wanted to hire me, but there are no openings.
And now, how will you save money for you and your mother?
And do not forget that
She has four children.
God bless you.
Do not despair.
Don't lose hope.
Never stop.
You must look for a job every day.
So my father won't get angry.
I'll take any kind of job, just for you.
I won't tell you to stop being corrupt again.
Stop corrupting.
Do you know what he's doing these days?
I told you.
But you never listen to me.
"O Allah, guide me."
I can't go to the minister and tell him about what this man is doing.
The minister will think.
He will surely think so.
You are right.
But, it's a serious matter.
We have to do something.
They say he's going to replace you, you know such rumors are very effective.
I'm trying to find a way to stop him.
I don't want anyone to feel like I'm behind them.
I agree with you.
What's your opinion?
The only way to keep him from influencing our interests.
Have you heard about Saleh stopping corruption?
He lives in the neighborhood where I live.
He will take care of it.
We miss your voice.
No good
And I am a fan of yours.
Salih is a very good man.
And God willing, soon.
He will return, and we will enjoy hearing his voice.
Bu Fahad is asking about you.
Tell me, Saleh.
Why did she resign?
I faced some problems, some health and psychological issues.
Frankly,
You are a messenger.
I haven't heard it in a long time.
Oh, wow. Saleh, please.
Just once, do it for me.
I want to hear you talk about it.
Salih says he agrees.
No, people, it's too hard.
What's wrong?
The man begs you.
Abdurrahman, she has already resigned.
You didn't tell us you were looking for a job.
Okay, this is your chance.
Assure him and let him hear your voice, and go to him the next day to ask for a job.
He will certainly hurry you along.
I want what's best for you.
Do you know what?
Forget about it and go home.
No, no, no, we no longer want your help.
Alright, wait, man. Let's discuss the matter.
No, we don't want to.
Okay okay
Well, if I've spoken for the last time now, I've left it but I'll do it one last time.
What does Boufahd want to hear?
What is the problem that concerns him the most? You see, there are also many problems here, far too many.
What does he prefer to hear? Or does he prefer the slaughterhouses? I don't know, tell me.
According to the executed contract.
Use his authority.
Bears eighty-eight = centimeter
Demolish it.
Don't interrupt me.
Why did the employee do that?
Where is number seven? Seven.
Don't interrupt me.
Number seven, the minister.
Why the employee?
When the ministry moved to its new headquarters.
His brother's car garage
Oh people, stop corruption.
Since your return, we want you to stay in touch with the program.
I am from a dear people, meaning, this is the last time.
Because, frankly, I had left.
Oh Mother, didn't you say he had left and that you had stopped him?
Yes, my daughter.
Yes, my daughter.
The man who stopped corruption, they talked about him on the radio.
What I heard, but some people told me.
I'm sure someone from the ministry exposed her.
Reddened him
He is free.
Alright, the minister.
Don't be afraid.
My entire day is dedicated to serving the ministry, bless me, O Lord.
Did you hear him?
I only said that for you.
Ignore me.
Never spoke to me.
Abdurrahman told me he would sign a contract with me.
Never spoke to me.
You are Faig Saleh.
I feel sorry for you.
I am Secretary to Bu Fahd.
And I know the case.
They used you to achieve their goals.
And unfortunately, they reached her.
Do you know who planned all this?
Your neighbor, Abdurrahman
He was behind all of that.
Bu Fahad doesn't use you.
You will do the same thing to him.
As long as I'm known.
No one will take you.
I want to take you to court tomorrow for a divorce.
I found a solution.
We are the best community in the world.
Free of any problems
No, we don't.
We never have problems.
We are happy.
What is nepotism?
Everyone stands in line.
Because that's the system here.
To get his rights more than the foreigner.
We do not rely on foreigners.
We don't have that.
Your efforts and work make you the best, we don't have any problems.
Or an important officer
And expel him.
We don't have this here.
My regards
Saleh Rashid Saad Rashid Al-Bahiri
Known as stopping corruption
I didn't want to eat dinner.
I was running and pulling at my shirt, tearing it.
He's jealous because you're wearing a new shirt.
Walid saw you wearing the shirt we bought from Villaggio.
He dragged it jealously, tearing it apart.
He has a kind heart, he cannot scold.
I think
You, Adoul, saw my child handsome, so you envied him.
What concerns him
Why did you take off Walid's shirt?
I saw him wearing a new shirt and felt jealous, tell your father to buy you one.
Look at yourself.
Why did you tear Waleed's shirt?
I'm telling you
Don't make me hit you.
Sultan, my brother
Why don't you punch his face and break it?
He's a little child, not your age, be ashamed.
Is this a child?
Yes, a child.
He needs people to raise and correct him.
Not just the left.
Be careful with your words, Sultan.
I think you're a child, to correct me.
You are arrogant.
Raising a good child
Even if I am unable to do that.
I respect him.
What I want is to scold him in front of his wife.
And brothers
If Adol defeats Walid again,
I will punish him.
It's me who's wasting my time arguing with you.
Act politely.
Let me go and show her.
The fool argued.
Where are the days of time?
And the intentions are clear.
Forgive us.
Do you have a larger one than this?
No, no, this one is the biggest.
Leave everything and come now.
Come and see the trouble we're in.
Yes, but my love, tell me what happened.
Mr. Ahmed, I'm sorry, I have to go home. I have an emergency.
Adol's pants are gone.
He is a resentful person, tired of hatred.
It's... It's Sultan.
How did the child cut all these clothes?
God forbid, I didn't use them, God forbid.
I'll show him.
Sit down, listen to me.
If you go and talk to him, he won't confess. He'll say it was the child.
So, what do we do?
Walid, do you know how to ride a bike?
Yes, I know.
Wael, my love
Yes, I'm telling the truth.
But tell me
Where did you put the scissors, my dear?
Under his bed.
Destroy them, O God, destroy their lives.
But I'll show him.
I will not remain silent.
He is crazy, insane.
Until now
And don't change it.
But the computer is something else, I'll show him.
I will not remain silent.
Do you think our son Adoul is the one who caused their computer to malfunction?
Ask him to come, let's see who's behind this talk.
No *
Go bother someone else, maybe my friends and not me.
I told you it's Advil.
And he laughed at someone else, "Oh! Fahd, it's not me."
Live, come please.
Their hearts were tender.
And the intentions were clear.
Is there a child?
What I go to find them
"He laughs at me, not I, oh!
To accuse me falsely.
Grab those scissors.
Act politely.
Hello, Abdel Rahman. Come quickly, my son.
Come and see your brothers Fahd and Sultan.
They fight every day, my son.
I don't know.
At such a meeting,
We must be.
So look at our works.
And the works of those who preceded us.
We see,
It will be a lesson for us.
We must learn from them.
Don't do this like children.
As big as a camel.
You have children.
With zero knowledge
You are his role models, not them.
His role model is his father.
You, Sultan
And you, Fahd
And I am your older brother.
To me
I'll make him pay for the computer.
He raised his hands.
We forgave each other.
No, I just shook his hand to escape.
From the well-known words of Abdurrahman.
Where are you going?
I swear I won't leave him.
Did you make the tea?
Get out, don't hide.
Open the door, if you're a man.
You were saying that Abdurrahman had reconciled with you.
But, I swear to God, if he doesn't calm down, I'll destroy his room.
Your brother
Crazy
Your brother is crazy.
I'll show him, keep the tea.
On his head
Be quiet, be quiet, stop! Oh! Children, they have no shame, hitting each other.
You're acting like little children, stop, oh! Son
I swear I'll show you.
Hit him, hit him, oh! Son of a giant!
Blood, mother
I was afraid of your screaming.
Oh God
Leave us alone.
Shame!
Even if you make peace with each other.
I won't leave you.
When he came at night to reconcile them
He didn't have time, my daughter.
May God compensate him.
Inshallah
He speaks fluently.
But, oh! The girls.
"O Allah, guide me."
You must calm them down.
Don't provoke them to fight each other, girls.
What happened, I hope it's good.
You disappointed me, Abdurrahman.
I wanted you to help me, not do the same thing.
You are the understanding brother, oh my son! Allah, guide him.
Two consecutive strikes.
*Stretch your arm*
You embarrassed us, Allah guide us.
Our neighbor Saeed is laughing at you.
Officer! We've told him repeatedly.
Don't believe him, officer.
They were throwing stones, the three of them.
Sorry
No *
Believe me, officer, I saw them *from my window*.
Did you hear him?
It means it's too far away.
My brother was right when he said he was healthy.
I'm sorry, but now that you've signed that your children won't do that again,
Thank you, thank you.
Hello, brother, hello.
Officer, how are you going to release them, I'm sure, believe me.
Listen to me.
What I wanted to say in their presence.
Abdulrahman, the eldest brother
Is the assistant a subordinate agent?
The middle one is the head of a public body.
Take two Panadol tablets and rest.
Panadol! Officer.
Do you have two Panadol tablets here?
O Allah, be our helper against our enemies.
O Allah, be our helper against our enemies.
O Allah, take them away, they have tired me out.
What is this?
A child throws it away!
This is an adult hand, it looks like his father's.
Do you believe that?
He seems to be from a respectable family, kind and polite.
That's because I come from a poor family.
So what?
He's following you.
He doesn't take his eyes off you.
And your annoyance
And you say that you didn't get the chance.
When she saw you passing by, what did it mean?
Coincidence, you think!
You turned your head, and she turned her head, at the same time.
No, but there's definitely something.
I notice when you enter.
She feels happy at heart.
Go and ask her about a pen.
Give her your notebook.
I don't know her name, can you believe it?
Romantic, more than it should be.
Dude, we're in the 21st century.
You're really desperate.
Frankly
It's been a long time since we've sat and talked like this.
No, this is the good news.
From now on, I'll have more time to sit with you.
But you must go now and rest.
Especially after yesterday's outdoor photoshoot in the desert.
We were exhausted, the horses were %pw, I told the secretary that I didn't want any press or TV interviews, nor contracts.
I want to spend some time with my family.
O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad.
Even when you're busy,
The first thing that came to my mind
I have the owner's number, I'll call him today.
Late for what?
The villa has now been sold, and the buyers moved in a few days ago.
I was busy with series and photography.
Umm Abdul Aziz says they are poor and *
This is what God has decided for them, and we will not interfere.
Good morning, uncle.
What's the problem?
This car, my son, stops every now and then.
It seems to be the battery.
No problem, don't worry, I have a charger and I'll charge it for you.
"O Allah, reward him with good."
At any time, uncle.
Peace be upon you
Wael is right.
Alright, from tomorrow, I'll start looking for a villa nearby to visit you daily.
What do you want now?
Alright, enough already, man.
Take it.
What's your full name?
Rashed Abdullah
The same name?
I said that to your father.
Your mother is right.
I was very happy when I found out that Rashid Abdullah, my favorite actor, is our neighbor.
Everyone loves him.
They say he is kind and humble.
Neighbors before houses.
I want to take a picture with him.
For my colleagues to gain my trust
I couldn't believe our house was next to the actor Raed Abdullah's house.
Talk to him until he believes.
What a life!
What we used to see on TV
And we hope to see him.
Our neighbor has become, praise God, oh my God!
If they need a sailboat, I have one.
Happy to help you, but good Lord, don't overwhelm me, I'm not used to it yet.
I heard about that.
That was very generous of him, may God reward him well.
Peace be upon you
It has been confirmed that some employees will move to the ministry's new branch in Doha.
Did they tell you who's moving?
I didn't hear the names.
But, what I heard and am sure of
He is Bu Ali among them.
My name!
But, we don't exactly know who we'll transfer.
I can't go, please, the smoke is too far from me, I can't.
Whether you are able or not, work is the work of man.
The committee is still considering the case.
But if they choose you
Thank you for your visit, Abu Waleed, please come in.
Thank you, thank you very much.
Forgive us, the furniture is old.
We are neighbors today.
We're like family.
This is very kind of you, Uncle! Oh! Bou Walid
May God reward you with good, Abu Waleed.
I've spoken a lot about your kindness.
O Allah, perpetuate this love forever.
But, oh! My daughter.
I'm willing to walk around the market for you until you find the most beautiful and cheapest furniture that suits you.
When? To be honest, our furniture is very old.
We need to change it.
Inshallah
I've told you this before.
If you need anything
Consider me your sister.
I never cry over something like that.
Where did you go, my love?
I forgot to scold her when she called me yesterday.
Not because it exhausts you
No more
I can call you later, goodbye.
In fact, I was talking to her.
But these people are different from us.
They are rich, and we are nothing compared to them.
Don't be afraid, Mama.
Wait a moment.
Wait a moment.
And I give you permission to introduce me to her.
I told you.
No, Mama, don't think.
And she comes to ask me to propose to her.
Put the dinner in the living room.
If you want to have dinner.
The driver will take her to the university now, God willing.
We had agreed that we were family.
Whose car is this?
And soon, God willing.
I called to thank her.
Good people love charity.
Yes, you are right, father!
Even our relatives don't do that for us.
Confirm! Is my name listed?
Are you sure?
Oh our misfortune, why do problems chase us?
I don't know, I'm confused now, I heard this news, what should I do, I don't know.
Go, go, go, go! Go now! Okay, okay, thank you. May Allah bless you abundantly. May Allah bless you abundantly.
What happened yaaaaaaaa
The committee met today.
And a list of the names of the people who will be transferred to Doha.
My name is listed.
Talk to the manager to get your name removed.
I don't think it will be useful, oh! Umm Ali, I don't think it will be useful.
I spoke to him, he said "No, never."
Famous actor
Take into account that your name was never on the list.
Bless you, thank you very much, Salam!
If you don't mind
I want to take a picture with you to show my children.
My children will be happy.
God bless them.
Can I take a picture with you, actor?
Of course, God bless you.
Come on, man, come.
Sure, I'm happy to help.
You and those you love
Tell me a day or two in advance.
Oh Mother, get ready.
Ready? Ready for what?
You're crazy, what's wrong with you?
She said: "I don't care."
Let his mother come.
Go to them.
But, my son
What I want is for them not to feel that we are poor people.
You have to be neat.
I don't have any elegant dresses.
You got me into trouble.
Why are you taking out all these jewels? It's the first time I've seen you do this.
What is mine?
Mother of Ali
Umm Ali will serve her son.
You want some elegant clothes and jewelry.
She wants to show them that she is rich and wealthy.
(Surprise) God willing
Luck is with her.
Inshallah, is this my wife? She is taller and whiter.
God willing, I'll listen.
You are a queen, God willing, a queen.
You must be prepared as well.
They will ask you about your meeting with her father.
I'm sure I won't go in these clothes.
When I enter with my new clothes
Oh mother, be careful of her belongings.
It's the kind of thing a mother would give you, so use it carefully.
Yes yes
Therefore, we must be like them.
Why didn't his mother go to ask for his hand in marriage?
That was for the women.
I have to go meet the men.
As you can see, God blesses you.
Simplify what's left, may God give you health.
Oh people, help me.
They were helpful, but Bishat is the one who stayed.
I want to borrow it from you to complete the outfit.
All the people stand with you.
Yes, but brother Rashid, am I supposed to loosen it like this, or hold it tight?
No, look, first
You need to press this.
It's preventing me from breathing.
The garment (the man's garment) is loose, but
God bless you.
The left hand should be in...
The right is loosened, like this.
You are the one who holds the earth up.
Wow, wow
How wonderful!
Your steps need to slow down a bit.
Ohhhhhhhh
Now you look like a millionaire.
What did they give you, okay, seconds
Put your left hand, like this, to your left, in this way.
Do you know my friend Aisha?
What's the matter with her?
You know what she was telling me earlier today.
She told me, "Because you are my friend, and I don't want us to part ways."
I will ask my brother to propose to you.
Tell your friend not to ask her brother and embarrass herself.
I see that many grooms are interested in you these days. A few days ago, you told me that Sa'ad wants you for her aunt, and today this one wants you for his brother.
They want to take my beloved.
I'm sitting and watching.
Do they know about our relationship?
No, they just know we're colleagues.
Alright, then.
From tomorrow, they must know.
Why did Waleed refuse?
I'm shouting.
You reject my son Waleed.
The actors are more honest than you, two-face.
But you
You behave your whole life.
This doesn't reflect your personality.
To serve people
People lied.
Wear costumes in life, in front of everyone.
I wore the bisht while acting on television.
It's me, not you!
You were putting on accessories, gold, and jewelry.
Plays
To get married
What is the scene?
A man walks in front of his wife.
Wearing a keffiyeh (traditional Arab headwear) draped over the sides of the face.
What turns not to the dead, nor to the right nor to the left.
She reminds me of your friend, the one you were talking about, who works in the same office as you.
Is he with a girl and a boy?
Why is he walking like that?
As they said,
"May God keep him, man."
Walk straight, don't stop.
He has no personality at all.
He's laughing, he's happy!
Show us the city center.
No, no, no, it doesn't look good with you sitting.
You look better when you're awake, when you're standing, stand, stand, stand.
I beg you, Thursday.
What's wrong, are you going to the city center?
Come, I want to talk to you.
Wherever you go, stay with us for a while.
His wife annoys him.
You're satisfied with that!
Oh! Thursday
Run it, and if the host is female.
I change the channel because I'm afraid it got me into trouble.
I swear I'm at work.
I'm sitting with Salem, my coworker.
Talk to her.
She hung up on me, take it, take it.
I've cut the line, and now you're going to make it difficult for me.
Now you say I allowed you to talk to her because there's a woman with us.
Now you can throw him out of the house.
Get out!
You're not the first to get divorced.
No, no, no, I can't, oh! My brother.
What I want is for my mother not to suffer in her grave.
Deposit me
She said, "Don't shoot."
No, no, no, I can't, it's impossible.
Are you trying to find something?
No, no, no, please stay, stay.
You are completely crazy.
Don't drive me crazy.
Tell me, I want to know what's wrong.
No, no, no, Mother, don't say that about him.
Salem, in particular, is one of the best men in our city.
He is asking you for a divorce.
Even if he asked me for a divorce, am I stupid to agree? That's unreasonable.
Thursday, I went officially crazy.
Leave me, leave me, please.
I was talking to him, alone.
"O Allah, guide me."
Poor, how sad.
I want to give him an important message from the minister's office.
Do you want to give it to him, to whom, may God guide you?
No, no, no, nothing, nothing
Give it to me, I'll take it for him.
It's about meeting with the women's delegation tomorrow.
Women's delegation
What's this talk! Won't you sleep today?
Hello Salim
I am your brother, Khamis.
No, I'm really talking to you consciously.
Oh brother!
Remove my name, so I won't attend.
How can we delete your name?
The only one who can remove your name is the Honorable Minister.
It's a meeting at the ministry.
Official meeting
Who are you talking to?
Healthy, healthy, healthy
Tell me the truth.
Who is the lady you were talking to?
Salma, Salma, Salem, I swear she is Salem.
If you were talking to Salem
Will you speak?
This lying does no good.
Don't lie, Khamas.
Don't eat the truth!
You are wearing casual clothes.
I thought I was talking to a woman.
Oh, the indignity of life.
May Allah bless and grant peace to the Prophet, may Allah bless you, O peaceful one.
Please, just believe.
He asked you to call.
None of your business.
Don't meddle in other people's affairs, or you'll see something that's none of your business.
And she complains about you.
Hello! Hey, you!
How can you bear to live with a woman who has a sharp tongue?
Let's start the meeting now.
Hassan is going to sue Thursday.
Alright, let's discuss the real estate budget first.
Let's start.
Let's hope he finds it.
Terror when he saw the ladies.
I searched the entire ministry and you were hiding here.
Go, go, people are waiting in the meeting hall.
I can't sit with the girls.
Oh Thursday! How do you know your wife?
I'm afraid she'll call.
*Oh my God*, do you want to doubt me, don't you understand?
If I don't answer the girl's call, how will I get home?
Will your wife call at this hour!
Of course, since your company is large.
This project, which your company will implement for our ministry
One of the largest projects in the history of our ministry.
Oh people! Why is the table shaking?
No, long ago, not the table, me.
You can answer the call.
Who is this?
Excuse me, who do you want to talk to?
This is my phone, %pw
I'll explain to you, wait, wait.
He fainted because he was afraid to go home.
Her brother came.
Tell him she said not to come home unless you change your job and stop working with ladies.
That's why I sent a letter to the ministry to transfer him from our department.
Yes, exactly, the minister himself told me that he approved it, what more does he want!
What does his wife have to do with it?
This is madness.
I ask him who you are talking to.
I told you he's crazy.
What should I do! Your wife and kids are coming tomorrow.
I don't know what to do.
As long as you did what she wanted, why are you afraid to go home and see your children?
You want official proof.
Alright, give her the papers.
Alright, this is what I did, I sent the paper with her brother.
Until you see the minister's signature and confirm it.
And I hope we agree, if you agree, I'll go home tonight.
Sister, this is the minister's signature.
What else do you want?
Work in the new department will start tomorrow.
It means an office and a job, other than the job he used to do.
Where is this department, please?
Yes, please God, here then is the minister.
Nothing, nothing, it's that one, on your right.
Yes, password, God bless you.
Please enter, your office is ready.
Saad and Abdulqadir, God willing, a big office, yes.
Goodbye
How do you request a ride?
Women's section
My wife
No one can enforce another decision except the minister himself.
You have to work until the minister returns.
Oh brother, get along with your colleagues.
And address them by male names so that your wife won't know.
And I added two more for the new employee.
The new employee, officer.
A few days ago, the minister's office referred a man to work with us.
You're serious!
It looks funny, man, a man working among five women, it looks funny.
They say his wife is very jealous of the women around him.
Blind jealousy
Oh poverty, he is in need.
But he asked us to be quiet when his wife called, we complied and didn't speak.
Oh Abdelkader, who is with you in the office?
Is it your size?
My son called and said my wife is on her way to the office.
What about you?
Walk straight, it's the first floor on your left.
This is in the welfare office.
With the fifth ***
These are six employees.
And these are here, I'm sure he came to work.
These lies don't fool me.
My wife is jealous of the women around me.
Because I'm handsome.
"O Allah, guide him, O Sultan."
But we want to know what stage we've reached.
Oh uncle, I was with Saqr at the bank yesterday.
that the project
Peace be upon you
Brother, I have an important meeting at work today.
Go to the kitchen quickly.
I'm dressed and ready to go out.
In fact, your place is the kitchen.
A woman must obey a man.
A scorpion's sting is painful.
This is important for precipitation, look look
Look, uncle.
Aisha, please contact the secretary and ask him to inform the staff.
If the new date for the meeting is tomorrow.
I hope it's not serious.
They issue orders.
We are compelled to execute.
They must realize that you are an important supervisor.
And he will have many responsibilities and obligations.
They consider women to be servants.
I haven't seen people hate women as much as them.
How old do they think they are going to live?
They asked me not to go to work today, and to go to the kitchen to make tea instead.
Where are the servants?
And the second one escaped a week ago.
Even the servants couldn't bear their humiliation.
I understand them.
O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad.
There are few banknotes.
Tea
Oh uncle, they mean
In fact, there's no such thing as a villa compound without a garden.
Alright then, the park...
Sister, before you leave, I want to talk to you about something.
My dear Fatoum, I must go, I'm late.
Alright, tell me, what do you have?
Speak or I'll leave.
And I play it at school.
A committee from the Women's Association came today.
And the school nominated me to be in the league.
You're crazy.
And you want to go to the league.
Do you know that if you tell your uncle and brother about this, you won't see any good.
You are the culprit.
We warned you.
Why don't you come and see me? I haven't seen you in a long time.
A year has passed, a year since I saw you.
Is he married?
Oh God, may He guide you.
Who agrees to marry an illiterate woman without a certificate.
No, no, no, it doesn't matter if he's my mother, he's a man.
And Thursday is the son of the scorpions.
The scorpion's sting is painful.
And also, he must marry someone from the same social class.
An ant like this is an ant.
God bless you.
What should I do, Aisha?
Since the minister's departure, all the papers have been sent to me.
I informed Mustafa, the head of the HR department, that I want to meet with him tomorrow.
But the ministry's guests arrived today.
You have the table.
And now I'm free to talk to you, Oh! Aisha
Yes, Mary.
Alright, coming, alright, I'm coming now.
I can only say, "O Aisha."
My brothers are the source of all this trouble.
I don't know what happened.
It's alright, dear. Compresses are necessary for your face so it doesn't swell up.
We warned her not to go and talk to them about it.
She went to them, they had beaten her.
Do you know if I told them it was a football?
They used to give it to you a long time ago.
Oh, the shame, you play football!
Next time, we'll break your neck.
Know who you're talking to.
Giant ants
This little one
Yes, but uncle, I didn't hit her, Sultan hit her.
Did you hear that?
I chose economics and political science.
I chose graphics because they are in demand these days.
Architecture!
It has not yet come.
You were given the opportunity.
Don't be selfish.
Okay, scorpion.
He hit her, breaking her teeth in her mouth.
Let me hit her.
She is here with me.
Go to the Scholarship Department.
And the removal of architecture.
Take your time.
To make sure
I spoke with Sultan and I will read.
What matters to them is that Munira gets married.
What else do you want?
Yes, our son Khamis deserves all the best.
I'll arrange a meeting with them and let you know.
Your nomination to join the delegation.
I understand your personal circumstances.
But give yourself a chance to think about it until tomorrow.
Believe me.
They are very interested in you.
And your nomination by the minister.
It's correct.
I know my brothers well.
They will never agree.
I am astonished.
Their car rental is paid from my salary.
I feed the house.
And you want me to travel with her too.
We're not getting married this week.
What do you mean?
Thursday is a donkey who doesn't have a school certificate.
Get married and travel with him.
Done, let's go.
This is shameful.
They'll kill her if she refuses.
Oh, my son! I've told you more than once.
Why don't you go?
Tomorrow, tomorrow I will go tomorrow.
What matters, as long as I'm one of the wolves.
Appearance doesn't matter.
What I want is to marry Khamis.
Go to the kitchen.
Put it in the living room.
Madrid vs Barcelona match tonight
I hope Valencia doesn't defeat us.
My sources are reliable.
She is loyal and works hard.
What's your opinion on this talk?
What do you want me to do?
We have to go.
Please go to your offices.
Thank you, may God give you a long life.
Long life
Coffee is served there.
Her Serene Highness
Oh Allah, lengthen her life.
Hello, may God grant you a long life.
Peace be upon you, Ambassador.
Yes, God willing, your life will be long.
Did you wash the coffee cups?
Go down and pour coffee for Captain Emad.
And also
We play in China the day after tomorrow.
Yes, Captain, I forgot to introduce you to my sister Mary.
I will go to the official engagement party.
You are stupid.
You don't know anything in life, and you want to marry a minister.
Say hello to %pw
Yes, ma'am.
Pour it and make a new one.
Actors' conversations
You know, Mashael called me a few minutes ago.
What should I tell her?
This is sad, Nawaf's role doesn't suit Meshal.
Noof is a sixteen-year-old girl.
And it seems that Maimouna is in her twenties.
Alright, why don't you take Mary's role?
Suits her better.
Nouf is thirty.
We need to get rid of the hardliner on the committee.
It's a problem, I'm sure he won't let it go smoothly.
It's detailed.
He will talk about art, family values, moral art, content, etc.
Who chose him for this committee?
The minister is the one who formed the committee.
I, you, and Hamed can have an impact on him.
No, no, no, this is impossible.
Nothing indicates that it's our property.
Even if he went and asked at the Ministry of Economy,
He won't find our names.
The company was issued in the name of Hamad's wife, may God bless you.
Don't be afraid of that.
I don't give a damn about you, frankly, from the chairman of the committee.
The last word is mine.
No, man, everything's fine, come in.
I just talked to them and we agreed on everything.
Peace be upon you
Hello, welcome Rashid, please come in.
As you know, this meeting is specifically to determine whether we will approve "Conscience Leak" or not.
Produced by the Modern Touch Institute of Arts
It's a good, unusual, and bold action series.
I agree with Hamed.
The story of the series is very nice.
I agree with you.
I liked it when you took the gun and killed your neighbor.
She wanted to hide the gun, so she put it in the car.
Not knowing he was her son, it was exciting, and when the police came
And his daughter comes from school.
Strike the box.
So he slapped her, and she flew into her mother's window.
Here comes the surprise.
This part of the box goes into the mother's room.
It is indeed the best local company producing this advanced level of output.
We should encourage and support them.
Mr. Rashid, you didn't tell us your opinion.
You've left me something to say.
With all due respect to your opinions and reflections on the series, this is "conscience extortion."
Human values blackmail
Disgusting surprises
One and a half people per episode
The other half is left for the next episode.
This series is written without social awareness.
What carries a moral message helps society to progress.
Falling tears, why do they make us taste sorrow?
Sorry, Rashid.
You gave us your opinion, Ali gave his opinion, let Mr. Rashid express his opinion.
It is clear from the meeting.
There is an agreement between you.
You're the one who arranged them.
Some people understand, and this is their field, while others have nothing to do with the field.
I reject that chain.
I'm afraid he'll lead us to disaster.
Ignore him.
He doesn't do anything, he doesn't do anything.
I'll do what I want.
He gave me the bag and said, "A gift from Lady Samira."
I don't know what to do.
How true it is, oh God! Oh, Nasser!
This is for the new series we will produce soon.
What makes the driver rape the girl?
About the blessing we received because of her.
The first blessing is the beautiful ring on your hand.
I'll tell you how.
Therefore, they presented it in the name of Hamed's wife, who sent you the ring.
And your husband's role was to protect them.
He owns a five percent share of the production.
It's a nice role.
I've played a similar role, haven't you watched "Lost Dreams"?
By the way
It's called blackmail or something like that, I don't remember.
Yes, extorting dreams.
Why are all the names similar?
Last year's series were all about girls.
You notice that every series has more than eight or even ten girls.
Your place is guaranteed.
You are dear to us.
How lucky you are!
Yes, Omar.
Oh, okay. Sure.
Sorry, my love. I have to go to work. I don't know what's happening there.
I eat and walk.
He said he wanted to see me about a very important and urgent matter.
I have to go.
I heard that Rashid met the minister.
Spent half an hour with him.
She told him that you would bother him.
I told you the minister suspected us.
What happened was that the minister's office called and wanted to meet with me.
I also fear that the minister will believe his words.
I will meet with the minister.
The man came to clarify his viewpoint about the series.
This is all.
That is true, may God exalt you.
But first, sir, I would like to say that it is unacceptable to speak about your colleague behind his back.
Everyone knows Rashid.
He envies everyone around him.
He is only interested in financial gain.
But it's his specialty.
But, bless you, not everyone who learns can handle these technical matters.
Special Television Productions
The extortionist conscience, the series we're working on.
It's a massive production.
We will launch a media initiative at the Gulf level.
Strong distribution
Certainly, your field of expertise; you know more about this than I do.
I promise you a wonderful series.
This will stand for our name.
See what the journalist Abdel Hamid wrote, listen listen.
Also, one of the actors said:
That the series promotes unethical ideas.
He is limited by the loss of modesty.
This is indeed a bold and strong criticism.
They will be in big trouble if journalist Abdelhamid continues writing about them.
And if those whom I am responsible for know about that.
But they are sharp, they know how to handle her.
They are old.
We need to create our own website.
Put all our company's activities on it.
What's the company name again?
From now on, you're the media advisor.
The series "Al-Dameer" produced by Mercury Media is considered...
A Quantum Leap in Arabic Drama
Because he carries moral values and ideas.
It's a series aimed at developing society.
It's the same journalist who criticized them a few days ago.
Is it possible for him to change his mind to the opposite?
How can he accept that?
The journalist Abdelhamid and others like him
Don't worry, Professor Hamid.
He said: "What do you think about the series?" I told him, "It will be the best in the Arab world."
I hope so.
I feel like my series is going to be a hit.
I don't know where he is.
The other one is wrapped and ready to go.
A lackluster beginning.
Your stories lack realism, and the events didn't actually happen.
It's clear at first glance.
Your book is stupid.
*May happen*
Your series is stupid, stupid.
See what you think.
It's so tragic.
Other bad series are no excuse.
He can understand this production at the first attempt.
These are subtle lines and dimensions, it needs a focused person to discover them.
Okay, it's a political drama.
Unfortunately, he was seen.
What's the problem?
I wasn't this nervous yesterday.
I was with Ali at Souq Waqif yesterday.
We were at a café.
I ignored myself.
Nasser, what do you think about what happened? If the minister is angry, it's a big problem.
Within a week, we'll all be expelled.
Oh failed serial, all the people who saw it said it was a failure.
I heard that Rashid is planning to visit him.
And tell him that the series is a failure and there's no work in it.
This is a disaster.
Leave it to me.
See what Nasser will do.
Listen, Eli.
From now on, I don't want any criticism of the series on your page.
Ellie, please.
A few days ago, I saw an article that not only criticized the production but also cursed it.
Don't make me angry.
I'm sorry.
That day I was on vacation.
I wouldn't have let them write that.
But frankly, I haven't received any messages of praise.
Once again, a great success.
Goodbye
My brother Rashid,
Should I believe you or the newspapers?
Conscience blackmail is the best TV production.
May you live longer, they have an agreement.
Read what the other newspaper wrote.
Do they also have an agreement with the viewers' page?
I almost had a heart attack.
A little later, they told me.
How lucky you are, the minister is pleased.
Honestly, Nasser,
Get ready to watch "Conscience Violation 2"
No, no, no, no, enough! Oh my God,
He said the series, he said he won't write again.
He prefers to stay in his miserable job.
Part Two, After All This Trouble
Third and fourth as well.
You all seem to have no good in you; you don't want to benefit.
One of his friends told me.
Here I am
What can the magician do?
I wish you more success.
Tell us what you think about this success.
I thank God for that success.
These are the enemies of our success.
I find that strange.
That this series wins awards while being a failed series.
But they are the experts.
They awarded them prizes for it; there's no doubt they see what we don't.
Get ready for the second part of the series.
Alright, you've always been like that.
A real wizard.
You will see, "coercion of conscience" will
I saw you talking to the minister at the beginning of the event.
TV festivals are lies, too!
I heard him say, "Get ready for part two."
It's the same thing.
They are taken to the bank to be washed and purified.
All the weak, silly, unethical series you watch.
They nominate her in Arab and Gulf festivals.
To clean it, give it awards, and even consider it high-class.
Yes, that's correct.
As long as the judges are the producers themselves.
Peace be upon you
Hello, praise be to God I came.
True, we signed a contract with them, but they want to lower the prices.
Come to my office.
We are not a small bakery or a bread shop.
We are one of the largest bakery companies in the world.
We won't reduce it.
"Or we will terminate the contract."
We signed a contract yesterday.
With the British company.
Cup and iPod
As you wish.
He did a great job.
It will be the first in the world to produce this product.
What is not the best bread baker in the world
I'll tell you.
How does bread go with a zipper?
Either you open it with your hand or go to the kitchen and look for a knife to cut it, and it might cut your hand.
So he made bread with a zipper.
Put the cheese back and close it again.
This is not bread, but pants.
So what do you think, in fact, it's a bag of bread.
How do we remove that zipper?
So one can say to his friend, "I ate two teeth."
Why weren't the Norfolk Hospital pies delivered yesterday?
I know, but why didn't you give it to him yesterday?
The bakers who make them
Once again, use the bakeries.
This is what happened, sir.
Why are you shouting at him?
You're wasting your time with football and delaying my work.
You know your son loves football.
What's the problem if he takes some employees from the company to have some fun?
I have four hundred employees in the company.
11 key players
Four substitute players and two administrative assistants, that's all, just seventeen.
And the team's spokesperson
Why are you upset with him?
But this is good for now. Although the fans are the most important players on the field, they are the twelfth player.
I'll let you play with them.
We signed a contract with the people.
When I first told you he wanted to play football
Your hearing
Didn't do anything
You're not angry with him just because he took some employees to play football in front of him and enjoy themselves.
I told him he couldn't take some of the employees.
Even if some of your friends need some staff, you can lend them one.
Breadmakers of importance
Son, why do you take the bakeries' mission, this cannot be
Next time, inform me before you hire any staff.
No, no, let Hamdi finish these papers.
He is in the hospital.
Why, I didn't take you.
I finished work, and as I was driving home...
Nasser called me.
Went to him.
He said they couldn't find the goalkeeper and they have an important match today.
He told us to find a goalkeeper, and then we arrived at the practice field.
Wear the goalkeeper's outfit.
I have never played soccer in my life.
That situation.
Stupid
And we'll find you a job instead of wasting your time with football.
Let me explain.
Father, you want me to disband and dismiss the team, right?
Yes, that's correct.
Alright, Dad, please, I beg you.
I can't bench the team, tomorrow's the final.
No, no, no, he's right.
Agree with you
Congratulations to the winner.
Congratulations, Mr. Nasser, on winning the cup.
We wanted to know how you planned to win.
See, I've prepared the team psychologically, physically, and mentally, and the coach has worked hard.
At the hotel
Congratulations to you all, and there will be a party, as promised.
It seems your father is happy.
I'm afraid he's just being nice and polite.
Oh Uncle Abu Nasser, firstly, we would like to congratulate you on the great victory of your team, the International Bakeries Team.
This great success.
O Allah, send blessings and peace upon the Prophet, no, no, no.
There's no picture without a bisht (traditional Arab men's cloak), wait, wait, stop.
No, no
He is wearing a bisht.
Your care, attention, and creative input played a significant role in this success.
And the coach's plan
But they played 5-5-3-2 in the finals.
And as a player, you know that changing the game plan confuses players, yet it didn't confuse the Packers and they didn't do a great job.
And the coach's plan
Bo Nasser, as the first athlete in the International Bakers Team, what do you suggest players do?
To infinity
Hello hello
Long life
They are welcome, is Hamad Sultan with them?
Welcome them, but they must have dinner with us first.
Dinner, done!
Thank you, Abu Abdulaziz.
And it is considered a contribution to the private sector.
The team is still young.
Don't envy me.
No, who?
Bu Abdulaziz
The engines we use in the factory.
Look
I've wanted to know him for a long time.
He passed me the football, I reminded him of that.
I said to him, "Oh! Abu Abdulaziz!"
You've never been interested in football your whole life.
What's your involvement in the matter?
The ball was close to me, only fifty centimeters separated us.
Has Bou Nasser arrived?
No, he didn't show up today either.
There is a seminar on football injuries, he is the platinum sponsor, he should be there.
You will see more.
Did you see the building behind the bakery that he wanted to convert into worker accommodation?
He is obsessed with football.
As usual, we tend to meet and interview a figure in the sports field.
This man inspires the bakery team with his great ideas.
Show us about the International Bakeries Team, we heard you're marketing a comprehensive development.
Compared to offices, all efforts.
It's a small amount of money, just a million dollars for all this effort.
No, man, be generous.
What's my fault, brother Shayne?
My mistake.
So what's my mistake?
You told me you needed players for the Gulf countries.
Gulf prices are the best.
That means if the player costs two thousand.
For the fault, it cost three or four million dollars.
What I understand, explain to me.
Send me a fax from here.
Read it to me when you have it.
My father bought four new players for the team, in addition to a new batch of four players.
You know, he's amazing. He can easily beat Billy and Ronaldinho.
But it says eight hundred thousand on it.
Yes, that's correct, and may God bless you, but a Turkish club set this price.
In the UAE, it is sold for one million and two hundred thousand.
Don't challenge me.
Okay, can we inspect the goods?
He is here.
Leg of the leg
It's good, okay.
No, no, no, I can't guarantee that to you.
He is fat, God willing, praise be to God, he is fat.
This is a skinny one, good for the center.
The attached muscle
It's the most important muscle, a player is useless without it.
Thank you
Tell the driver to take them to the Automatic Club, Automatic, what did I say! Automatic
How does that mean?
Hamdi, come here.
Congratulations, congratulations
These, may God protect you, are young players.
Yes, we bring them from the forests of Africa.
We feed them and raise them, then release them into the playgrounds.
My happiness, you can take it, do you have a place for it or shall I carry it in the truck?
When we saw them pressing us.
The forward player was asked to play.
He who does not know how to weep does not know how to laugh either. No.
Ask the defender to play.
Kagumakakani Lololo was supposed to play.
He is a beginner coach.
Even if it's on Mars.
Spain! Even if it's trained on Mars.
I love the way he manages the game.
This one should be on the north road.
There are rules to the game.
Even if it's just two days.
What's going on? Why are you screaming?
Your foolish son
I'm not convinced the coach is an expert in football.
Hear her, she talks like Mitsu.
It is known that the offending player, Selolo Tekawawa, is a good center player, as Ahmed Al-Taib said.
No one gives you a headache.
Just stay away.
I know how to handle him.
Why did the team lose?
The team is supposed to think about changing the plan.
Because the players are not playing in their positions.
If the player is out of position, he should be moved to his usual spot.
Ask the coach to change ...
Dismissal of Hopway Malalo
Okay, okay, okay
No, no, no, no, what's happening in the stadium?
This is not supposed to happen.
The coach shouldn't do that.
Please postpone these matters until after the game.
People see this, it happens in front of the camera.
Fourth goal for Team Success, the ball entered the goal area.
He scored the fourth goal, he's the star of the match today.
This coach is stupid.
Tell him, Uncle Bu Nasser, that they no longer want your services as a coach for the team.
And you, be quiet.
I'm watching the game on TV and you stay as a reserve player, do as I ask you.
Don't do that, it's not good.
We have a match tomorrow. How are we going to play without a coach?
What is your father doing?
Enough, oh! Rashid
What's wrong with you? You're making me afraid, tell me, what's wrong with you?
Divorce me, Mama, divorce me.
"I divorce you! How?"
I don't know, Mama, I don't know.
Why did he divorce you? You were married for less than a month.
I swear to God, Mama, I don't know, I don't know.
He divorced you without any reason!
Yes, Mother, yes.
I swear to God, Mama, I don't know. He suddenly came and told me to go to your family's house.
I asked him why? He said: "You are divorced."
I swear, I don't know what's happening?
Their marriage didn't last a month. What will people say about us?
I agree with you.
I don't know what to say.
I know he divorced her, from you now.
Sit. I'll be back in a minute.
For her high morals.
She cursed Barcelona.
Light of my eye, Abdullah.
He came to me crying.
He said she had disrespected Barcelona, a team he loves and respects.
I insulted him, mistreated him, and influenced him.
He told me, "Mother, she has wronged Barcelona," so I said to him, "Divorce her and I will find you another wife."
Tell him your daughter got divorced because she disrespected Barcelona.
So just divorce her, are you serious.
What matters to me.
Is it easy to hurt someone's feelings?
A wife questions her husband's loyalty.
How true what I hear!
We need girls who respect international differences.
This time, you started making fun of Messi.
Problems arise between couples and must be addressed.
One thousand daughters instead of one son.
There are many girls who want to marry him.
Listen to me.
I don't want to hear anything.
And don't interfere. He is my son and I know him well.
I told you this is none of your business.
I'll be upset with you.
Don't tire him, my son, and don't think about it.
Instead of one, there are a thousand girls.
Why are you upset!
But when I remember her words
Real Madrid is better than Barcelona.
Alright, dear.
What's wrong with her!
Her name is Mona.
Married for one month?
If I tell you her story and why she got divorced, you won't stop laughing.
To involve you with him, we need your attention.
What's the interest with this person, he divorced his wife for a football team.
The hairdresser knows them and told me the whole story. Mother, don't let me join them, I don't want to get involved with people like that.
That's all, you're listening to hairdresser's nonsense.
Tell them I didn't accept.
Let her say her nonsense and say what she wants to say.
Wealth is coming to her.
I told her, "Oh! Girl, don't stop at your luck."
If it's just her luck, I don't care.
But she will stop her fortune and ours with it.
This building
He never said no to me.
May God preserve this bad thread.
They hear a rumor and spread it.
Don't believe her.
Tell her and make her understand not to close the door of luck that will open for us.
He knows how to convince her.
You're joking. Do you think he divorced his wife because of Barcelona?
Forget all these foolishness and don't be crazy.
Don't miss the opportunity.
And perhaps she is the cause or something wrong with her leads him to divorce her.
Listen, my daughter, don't neglect Abu al-Burjina.
What is this, Abu Burjin?
But when they get closer, they discover that they are two towers.
That's why they called his father Shayyen Abu Borgin.
God welcomes you.
Oh, no, no, no. Sweet. Thank you. Thank you.
Ah, thank you. Please.
May God grant you a long life (proverb), they have already taken the money, they signed and spent the money.
Happiness delivered, I was absent-minded and you seemed very busy, that was a month ago.
The first marriage was a month ago, this is a new marriage, divorced.
He was married and divorced.
Oh, this is his third marriage.
And this is his story, oh! Brother, be firm with him.
Oh man! This is a tough generation.
Opinion and Counter-Opinion
Congratulations, congratulations my daughter!
My daughter, don't forget your coat, I put it on top of the bag.
So you can take it with you when you board the plane.
Upon your arrival in London
Son, don't you want to go to London?
Hello, Mama.
Alright, that's good.
Come with us and shop as well.
Malaysia, Malaysia
Take the fur with you to Malaysia.
Goodbye, Mama.
What's wrong with her?
I don't know.
I ask her and I don't know what's happening.
Tell me, my daughter, what's the matter?
You did well to ignore her.
She is nothing.
On your honeymoon, you're supposed to be taken care of in every way.
Is it logical that she sits while you pour the water!
And the bottle is next to you, why don't you pick it up and let me drink.
She was not brought up well.
You should have told her that since my birth, I only drink water from my mother's hand.
What's wrong with her?
You look very sad.
And what's this lady got with her?
His name is Mashal.
How unfortunate, she got divorced during her honeymoon.
Would you believe me if I told you her story?
God bless you, auntie! Thank you.
Your aunt and your aunts requested.
Oh, but I don't know where the mother booked us?
Hello, Mama.
Where did you book us?
Because she wants to go there with us.
There is no god but God.
Why did he do that at the airport and why did he take the boys?
What's happening between them?
Your question to me, I don't know what happened between them!
In fact, it's nonsense.
So, where is Manira?
She's in her room talking to that idiot.
Now she says she has been calling him for two days and his phone is switched off.
She's finding it now.
We'll wait and see what he has.
How do you know he's upset? The boy is coming from outside, tired, and wants to relax.
Every day I tell my mother to peel the apples, but she doesn't do it. Every day she annoys me.
And you know I don't like the apple with its skin.
Peel the apple.
Hello, let me tell you
You are divorced.
And one extra if necessary.
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Monira, what did he say?
Why are you upset too!
Call him three times and tell him you're divorced.
Be quiet, please.
I don't know what my mom saw me doing at the disco in Spain and told him.
He has nothing to say.
True, he has nothing to say.
You will dance twice or three times.
And if my daughter divorces, let her die.
How did he divorce you?
Where are you going?
Where am I going? I'll pour my anger out on this wicked man.
She has a tail like a peacock's.
Embellished with gold, rubies, pearls, and diamonds.
And the other girls are just toys for you and your son.
They don't have families and mothers who taste the bitterness in their mouths.
What you're doing is funny.
And We bring them forth from the wombs [of their mothers] as [new] creations.
I helped you with drinking water, you curse Barcelona, divorce her and forget her.
The one who went to a nightclub.
Without shame and modesty
A ministry agent, Arab and Muslim.
He is concerned about his reputation and that of his sons.
Stay still and don't move.
Show some humanity.
It was my father's.
Who sells such land?
Abu Sakr took it from the father by force.
Why are you selling it?
God guide you, if Abu Saqr wants something, no one can say no to him.
Leave it to God, man.
Enter, come in.
Let's go, let's go.
What's the status of your project, Abu Saad?
As you know.
Okay, so last week you said you were going to his office?
I told you, if you want to run your project, you have to start by funding it.
Abu Sakr, this great millionaire
What does he eat? Isn't there anyone in this world who doesn't eat?
This is not the problem, brother. We'll let him eat, feel full, and fill his belly, but the problem is how to get to him.
And you must know Abu Sakkar's key, so that all doors will open for you.
I meet him in Umrah and greet him more than once.
All you need to know about him, as long as you are paying him and managing your business, is the right time.
When the secretary told me that Abu Saqr was waiting for you at dinner.
I came immediately.
Abu Sakr, may God preserve him, has a feast every day.
Oh man, anyone.
He loves to socialize and hang out with friends.
It's wonderful to spend the night at this farm.
Sir, this is Abu Nasser, the owner of the car agency behind the center.
He wants to meet you, sir.
Get the license.
Like my son who got his license.
Thank you, may God keep you.
Congratulations on your license, Falcon.
God bless you.
Abu Sakr
I told you not to disappoint me, say yes.
Say yes, sir.
As a gift for him.
And please, don't say no.
My business is doing well.
This means you met him and talked to him easily.
Don't be stupid.
Ah, that's enough, Abu Nasser.
Tell me what technology is, what has it done?
Circumstances were in my favor.
When we were sitting with him.
His son just got his license.
I have a gift for you, a falcon.
If it's about the car,
This is easy.
Come, come take me to him.
Yes, that happened.
I just got out of the hospital.
He cut his skin.
And if God wills, he will throw a feast.
Your son deserves health, sir!
We hope he gets better, we hope he gets better, God willing, he will not see any harm, God willing.
And we met at the florist's.
I think so.
Man, we're starting to forget and grow old.
They told me your son Shahin was in the next room and had already left.
Therefore, I thought I should visit you.
And I congratulate you on the safe return of the falcon.
Listen! Sir, you must not go without dining with us.
I'm not in the mood for that.
Say yes or no.
Because our beloved son, Saqr, has left the hospital,
In Corniche Tower
Just say yes.
Oh, my son! Don't be stubborn.
Mom, don't try, I don't like business and I'm not inclined towards it.
Who can start a business without capital these days?
At the car and bulldozer agency, he just said let him point.
Love is from God, and people love you because of their love for your father.
Until university,
All the doctors love and respect your father.
Most of them are in his office every night.
Masha'Allah, everyone loves your father, just point him out.
Oh my god!
Am I sitting in the supermarket?
Did you open the pickle shop?
This is also something new.
This is a falcon, the apple of my eye, he brought them to me yesterday and said, "These are samples, try them."
He only took their agency yesterday.
Look
He also told me that all businessmen are like me, and God makes everyone like you.
Yes, Your Honor.
On my way to the office,
I saw a new supermarket.
They were preparing to execute him.
I really love her.
I don't know who owns it.
Congratulations, congratulations oh! Uncle Falcon, congratulations
God bless you.
In the name of God, In the name of God
Who is he to come as a partner and take it easily (like that).
You, you can now say no.
So, what's up?
What are you saying?
Be her partner.
Do you know who his father is?
Who doesn't know his father!
I told him I was a friend of Qasim Abbas, he asked me if I had experience in the field.
I said I have a bakery, thank God I live off it.
No, no, I don't like the name.
I didn't notice it.
No, oh! My brother, the name is not nice.
So, this is a suitable name for Iranian bread.
Understood, big bread.
Qasim, we'll call it the Big Bread Bakery.
Wait for me a bit.
Peace be upon you
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you, my Lord.
Excellent, excellent. So, do you need anything or any assistance?
No, thank God, everything is fine.
Ayad, she's a new employee here!
Sir, he sent her car for repairs, and she came to take mine because she's an advertising agent in a marketing company and she can't do anything without a car.
You may need your car as well.
No, I don't need the car today.
Alright, no problem.
This is the age of science, knowledge, and study.
I agree with Dr. Rashid, everyone should have sufficient knowledge in their field, whatever that field may be.
Excellent! Oh! Dr. Sami
Yes, Your Honor.
Study and study.
You're repeating what's in the books.
He didn't study business or economics.
He never read a book in his life, not even a newspaper. I never saw him hold any paper in his hand.
You all know who Falcon is today.
I wanted him to enter this business field and %, but
His uncle Abu Nasser is still alive and present before you.
What he loves
But there are people born for trade, and their nature loves trade.
You're right, Doctor!
God willing, Shahin, that you will be like your brother.
God willing, God is generous.
But it's still early.
This depends on upbringing.
No one is like you (a proverb) Oh! Doctor.
To be honest.
How did Falcon, who hates trade, easily reach that great economic feeling?
If they count a hundred billionaires in the world today, they will count them among them.
Do you know Abu Sakr?
They chose Falcon for the market horsemanship.
Peace be upon you
How are you, Nasser!
Mohammed called me and told me that Abu Nasser is in the hospital.
Do you remember when you once told me that you heard Falcon, son of Hawk, wants to take over the car dealership from his father?
You no longer have the agency.
People are never satisfied.
The father helped his son enter the market.
He opened his eyes to commerce.
To be honest, the doctor said he was in critical condition.
This won't work.
Nothing works.
"I'm shocked, I tell you, he's going to divorce her, he's going to divorce her, and he's going to divorce her."
There is such a people in the 21st century.
We meet our dear viewers with one of the kind and generous men in this country.
A man who knows the way for the needy and deprived.
So, we have the founder and owner of the Falcon Charity Association.
Of course, if we speak about this organization, Sir,
We all know your noble goals that you are trying to convey to the world and, of course, to everyone.
Without deceit or a desire for fame, God forbid.
Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds, thirty relief convoys have recently been delivered to our brothers in Africa.
And now we thank God, we are ready to surrender.
Seven boxes of candy for our children in Gaza.
"Masha'Allah, sir, God creates people like you."
My wife and I just left the house.
But my wife will be passing by for half an hour to open her new project.
And I'm waiting for her.
It's a good thing.
I really love their atmosphere and I really enjoy sitting with them.
And a source of income for my children as well.
My whole life
I think you want to waste my time.
Stay away from trouble.
Sweet hot bread, hot bread.
Go, people!
There is such a people in the 21st century.
There is such a people in the 21st century.
If anyone wants to dive, diving requires effort.
You need brave men.
"Souk Ouakf" in
You deserve it, you deserve it, congratulations, congratulations.
God bless you all.
Mashallah, everyone loves you so much! Shehan, love is good.
I want to say something, but please say yes.
On the occasion of his license, my son Shahin had to go to the showroom and choose the best and most expensive car as a gift from him to me.
The wind blew upon us from the valley's cleft.
Oh breeze, for love, take me home.
Hello Fadi
How are you, Anoud?
No, no, no, no, no.
You told me the dress would be ready in a week, and you sent me a message yesterday saying it would be ready in ten days. Oh! Foolish.
And you want your dress with crystals, which takes longer.
And if God wills, you will start talking to Al-Anood and ignore me?
How many lights do we have?
No, no, no, no, no, let the whole world be angry, but Anond will not be angry.
See what Fadi needs, they're starting to get jealous.
Oh my God, I love the way they speak, I'm jealous of them unlike our people.
Don't forget the subject.
Is my dress ready?
Here you are, Fadi.
Thank you, brother Fadi.
My brother Fadi, I'll come by next week to get the dress, okay bye bye.
How can I assist you?
Send the dress to my house.
No, I didn't like it.
Masha'Allah, today I went to Fadi at the shop, he's doing amazing work and girls are coming and going.
Praise be to God, we were very successful in this project.
What is it?
Abu Nasser, my uncle.
What's wrong with it?
Look at the jealousy!
And we have not heard that he started a business, where would this bankrupt get the money from.
They opened their mouths, plunder!
And when he starts his work,
Are you sure?
I heard some rumors.
And if God wills, you will do nothing?
7 a.m.
Do you want them to bring you breakfast?
No, thank you, I've already had breakfast.
But, I want to talk to you about something.
I heard that you
You want to start a business.
I don't know anything about such things, God guide you, uncle!
Design, women's fashion design, and so on?
Who lied to you?
I'm a businessman!
No, no, no, no, no, no, but I ...
You need advice, you need %pw. I'm ready if you need any help.
Thank you, thank you oh! Auntie, thank you.
So give me, I have to go.
Enter, my lord.
The first time you tell me if you need more.
Come on, Fadi, clean the shop. Aren't you busy?
The store is no longer enough.
I told you I'd rent the shop next to ours, so rest assured and take it.
I hope so.
Did they rent the shop next to us?
Is there anyone named Khalaf Sultan Al-Seifi who is not your relative, Abu Nasser?
No, isn't there?
I'm from the Ministry of Economy, I saw his name on a transaction at my friend's place, his name is Ismail and he's in charge of his papers.
Women's fashion design
Are you sure?
I saw the ring and his name was written on it.
What's wrong with him, what's wrong with him, what's wrong with him.
What's wrong with it, what's wrong with it, what's wrong with it, it has a flaw.
Your sick heart didn't stop you.
When I saw that my project was successful,
You told me to destroy it.
This is an open market for everyone.
%pw Abu Nasser.
Is he a shepherd? What does he say?
And I was trying to probe you, I asked you, "Do you plan on opening a business?"
I didn't lie to you, man.
Secrecy is the best policy.
I don't care about you or your demands.
But this doesn't lead you.
Man, it's a living, and everyone takes their living.
You defeated me.
Come on, you're tired.
No, no, no, Abu Saleh crossed the border.
You hit me in my own home!
Open to everyone!
You are brothers.
I advised my friend Ibrahim to do so.
A Lebanese designer bag.
I am a lady, ask me.
I know our girls, they love Lebanese men.
Oh my God! Madam looks amazing, no, no, no this, this doesn't resemble anything in all of Doha.
Grandma, this suits you. With the sweet talk and the piece that's worth a thousand, they sell it for thirty or forty thousand.
Ah, just do the same.
As you know, the cabinet I had made last year when the Lebanese carpenter came.
Grandma, I'll design a wardrobe for you that you won't find anywhere else in Doha.
Look, if you want to succeed
What's the exact story?
Why don't you know?
This means he stole the clients.
What do you think about moving to another place, sir?
Don't mention it, don't mention it! Oh! Fadi.
And at this time, they will play alone.
This means that we were defeated, no!
We must confront them!
And to get our clients back, whether they like it or not.
Do you have money to pay?
I'll pay.
I'm ready to do anything.
But most importantly, he won't defeat me.
This dress that you chose costs sixty thousand riyals.
Of course, no ties in the middle.
This is a gift from the designer, from me.
I placed it in it a ruby for you, there are only fifty ruby pieces in all the countries of the world, and this piece is very unique.
Of course there's no discount, our prices are globally recognized.
No, of course not, who would do that?
My lady, wait, wait, what happened? What's wrong?
They harmed us! Oh, Saad, they harmed us.
Is this what they do?
They killed us; we have no more clients.
This is called war, Abu Nasser.
We won't stand idly by!
We must fight them as they fight us and also respond to them.
Tomorrow I will take out a loan from the bank.
And I will start a war against them, and you will see what I will do.
Abu Nasser won't stop her.
Check the ad!
Check the ad he's posting!
We offer two free evening dresses with every wedding dress.
She made four evening dresses to go with each wedding dress.
We publish a quarter-page ad.
Look, he posted a half-page ad.
I don't know what he meant!
Believe me, Mother of Nasser.
For six days, not a single customer has entered their store.
They preferred to keep it closed today, rather than opening it.
And you will hear that he has put his shop up for sale.
I kill him, I kill him.
Even they cannot sit there, he sat outside.
Alright, drink your tea and go to him.
What tea has God given you? I can't drink it, that's a problem.
Is there anyone who bears a grudge against you?
There's one, God bless him, who sprayed the place with this scent.
And these are the chemicals.
Are you sure someone sprayed a scent in the store?
You are both adults, you are too old to fight like children.
He came at night and sprayed a foul smell in the place, is this fair?
"What did you spray? That's your scent."
Don't cross the line.
I signed an undertaking at the police station.
Don't be afraid.
This time,
I prepared a hellish plane for him.
Without letting anyone catch me red-handed.
No, everything is fine.
This is what confuses me.
I swear I don't know what's happening, this is the fourth day that not a single customer has entered our store.
Oh my God, this isn't the store, we have to go to the other store, I've revealed my face, God guide us.
And what did the doctor say to you?
The shop is empty and no customers enter.
I don't know if their magic will work on him.
No women or girls are allowed near the shop.
As if some magic had turned Saad into a beast.
It's possible, anything is possible these days.
There is magic, and it is evil.
Well, is he asleep or awake?
Go and see him! Oh, brother, go, I'm afraid the roof will fall.
Lost, O Sultan, lost.
I don't know, he turned him into a dog!
Leave him alone!
Calm down, brother, don't get upset.
I don't know what to do.
Tell me, my love, what did you do to him? His friends are said to have started collecting money to pay off his debts.
Its designer
What is not Lebanese.
You told him, didn't you?
Don't you know where he is?
The stars are here and we are desperately searching for that extra one.
Call the man again, he might have an emergency.
What's wrong with you, what's wrong with you, O Imran Hamad!
"See what's going on, Ahmed! You're just sitting here while the director is yelling at me! What should I do? Where are those extra actors you said you'd bring today?"
It's better for you to leave me, I've called him and got a headache just to ask Mr. Abdullah.
First, don't shout, we're actors and we want to relax a bit, we need to focus on our roles. Second, the man has called more than once in front of me, just relax.
What do you say, Professor Abdullah? What do you say?
Oh my god!
Alright, guys.
We want to finish, but the extras who are supposed to act in the scene haven't arrived yet.
No one wants to be shouted at, right?
Work quietly and without shouting.
This is always our case, screaming since morning. We need to focus.
I've found a solution for you.
See what you think about managing yourself in a scene until, God willing, I can get you an actor who can do a good job.
It's true that he'll play a role in one scene.
But that scene is the most important scene in the series.
But sir, please go and catch it now, please.
But if I'm not ready today, I'll resign.
Guys, let's take the stairs.
I'm asking you, is there a Filipino person, is that good?
You don't know Abu Walid, he'll resign immediately. We need someone who's elite, both an elite and a Qatari.
Dude, he'll disguise himself in a cloak and scarf, no one will notice him.
Are you serious, Ala'a? You just want the easy way out, that's generating respect for people's feelings and being intelligent.
Alaa gave you all the responsibilities, distributed the tasks, and you'll be comfortable.
Quiet, let's think. Reim, think with me, you can remember one of your friends.
Who is he?
Does Ahmad remember a person named Saud Bull's Thorn in the Al-Salata neighborhood?
"The same thorn of Saudi Arabia"
"Saudi Arabia Law"
The director said he needs a wealthy man of stature, and you say cans.
Dear, at the end of the day it's an extra role, you'll bring a rich and famous man to an extra role.
But with a little makeup, Reem, in her abaya and clean dress, and the luxurious car.
Insha'Allah, it's suitable.
How can we reach him?
I know their house.
Peace be upon you
Happy was?
So, who is he?
Yes, yes, yes, that's it, that's it.
Yes, it's him, thank you very much.
And now, how are they going to work, Mama? There's no other alternative but this equipment that Uncle brought from abroad.
My son, you have only what you are wearing.
My son, it's in here inside the closet under my clothes.
What are people waiting for outside? What should I bring?
Oh God, help him, O son.
This means I'll see you today and you'll be on TV.
Yes, Mom. They said I'd be on TV as one of the elite.
Sit down, you failure!
Dude. What is this? Curse you.
Inhaler, inhaler.
Here it is, Mom.
Quickly, Mama, did you do well?
God willing, son.
God forbid, hopefully they give you money.
God bless you.
Pray for me.
I answer you with a Saudi laptop, it was Saudi.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Is this Abu Bakr, the son of Fatima, Abu Bakr?
Hello, hello.
Hello, Saud?
Who's going to fix the scene?
Oh, I hope he does a good job, calms down and shuts up, so they give him a complex role.
Tell me how your mother is.
She is not the same person who used to gather the thorns of the hawthorn.
Shame on you, shame on you, be quiet.
You are now wearing glasses.
You are an old man now.
You haven't changed, I'll regret nominating you.
The man they brought to play the role of Abu Abdulaziz's father.
He's here, they've brought him, welcome, welcome, welcome.
Do your best, this is our manager, Mr. Ghafel Fadil.
Most importantly, don't be afraid of the camera.
Brother, I am only afraid of God.
Don't be afraid, be quiet and listen to his instructions, and say yes to anything the manager tells you.
Oh my god!
Come here, boy. Come here, boy.
I'm talking to you.
He's light, the role needs a serious person.
Everything is acceptable from some people.
Ask me why I speak like this.
My brother, we bought this for filming. Listen, I'm going to take you to the makeup room now and explain your role.
Shame on the mole, shame on the mole, shame on the mole.
Come here, please.
Offer it to me.
Stop, stop, stop here here!
Praise be to God that you're here, come in, come in.
Boss, the car you need for the scene is ready.
Saoud, he will purify everything, he will fix it.
Let's repeat it again, and the assistant manager is here to meet you and reassure the manager.
Imagine yourself as a well-known merchant.
You're saying this?
Oh, oh, I'm telling you, wait, wait, don't rush, I didn't expect this from you. Oh! (Abu Abdul Aziz), say you're Abu Abdul Aziz.
To get our rights.
Sweet, and you should know!
Let him brush my teeth, brother!
Abu Abdulaziz Falah Al-Marzooq, gentle, went to wash and complete the name.
Sweet, progress, progress and think.
And consider your daughter divorced.
Don't bother trying to figure out why she got divorced.
Your daughter is divorced, is she beautiful? Is she beautiful?
She's beautiful, go and consider yourself, we're not getting married.
Why shouldn't I curse his father?
Great, you're amazing and he remembers everything, amazing.
Let %pw use my teeth.
How? Why?
Oh man! The homeowners surprised us and they need the hall, so the director decided to finish the hall scenes, and then we'll shoot the exteriors.
How is that?! They don't want %PW!
Yes, they want to, they want to, but it's been postponed to a later time. They'll shoot another scene, and we'll catch up with them, God willing.
Should I tell them to bring you some tea?
Peace be upon you
And peace be upon you.
Good morning, sir.
Hello, what tribe are you from, man!
My name is Sidi Salem Abu Shwei al-Shwei.
* * They are well-known.
You deserve it.
Tickles, my nose is big and you can put lips here too.
Tell me, O brother of people, are their noses high now?
I'm holding myself.
If it were someone else, he wouldn't have stopped laughing.
Keep this for a minute.
Hello, Mama.
Mom is very sick, I have to go quickly, Oh! My brother!
You will wear those clothes.
I don't have time, I told you my mom is sick, she's very sick and he's saying!
Listen to me, you can go like that, but when I call you, you have to come right away.
He and I, we can't leave the place.
Alright, alright, I'll try to find a taxi. Oh! My brother.
Is it a taxi? If you try to look for a taxi for a year, you won't find one.
You know we rented the car for the scene.
Take it since it's free.
Oh my god!
He's in the car.
I need a wheelchair.
Wait, wait, I'll get the wheelchair now, just a moment. Oh, dear!
Can I tell you something? Can I tell you something?
My mother is very sick in the car and I need a wheelchair, please.
Where is the patient? Inside the car?
Oh my son, oh my son, what happened?
Be quiet and don't speak, just look and remain silent.
Peace be upon you
Nothing, but Mama, your wife, she has asthma, quickly.
I'm telling them to make the bed.
Alright, alright.
And don't tire him out.
God enriches you, what have you done?
So cool! Rashid.
Take care of our son, Rashid.
As you wish, come with me, Mr. Rashid.
Come with me, Mr. Rashid.
And I took Mr. Rashid and I will do what is necessary for him.
This is expected of you.
I'll tell the nurse to come and ask you what you'd like to drink, sir.
Come with me, Sir Rashid.
Sorry.
What am I going to do with all these people, just wait!
The problem is that no one cares about us.
Sir, what would you like? Tea, coffee, or cappuccino?
You're not the first; Nasseer, who works in hospital security, married a Filipino woman.
Who told you I was rejected?
No one cares about me, not even women.
They think philosophically and demand.
He doesn't have a certificate, I don't want to be your mother, what is this, I don't want to be your mother! Go and look for your friends.
Oh brother! There's a girl in the hospital, I like her.
If she ignores you, look for someone else.
I can't, brother, my heart is bound.
Your brother has fallen in love, can you believe it, when I see her.
Take this to Dr. Mohammed.
What's wrong with you!
Go now.
God damn you.
My lord, my grandmother is now in good health.
You're a professional actor Oh! Saud, oh! Guys, it's my turn!
Bravo, see how they applauded you and praised you.
Now go and change your clothes and remove your makeup.
Oh man! Forget about it, come and complain with me first.
Yes, from now on, my name is Falah Al-Marzook.
Forgot to write Saudi.
Saud died.
From now on, my name is Fahad Al-Marzouk, Abu Abdulaziz.
God bless you, dear.
One table!
I made two.
I even heard one of the relatives of the bride and groom say, "Goodness, they are so stylish. I don't think anyone could do something similar to what they did at the wedding."
Okay dear, bye-bye.
Look at this, Mom.
I have to bring them something for the occasion of signing my marriage contract.
Is something wrong, Mother?
Look at your brother who's going to destroy us!
Oh my god, this is embarrassing, by the way, it's cheap.
But this is based on our budget, it works.
Leave this for the maids to eat.
He wants to laugh at us.
Praise be to God that I saw him.
This type is the free class, it is for the sophisticated society.
Almost above average.
No, we want something unusual, something no one can afford.
Sorry, my lady, you can't blame someone who doesn't know your capabilities (a popular saying).
Shut up, just shut up, you don't know anything.
I'm afraid the money I have isn't enough.
Don't make us blush, pay with your credit card.
This is luxury, it's very sophisticated.
Yesterday, Saleh signed his marriage contract.
Salih Nasser!
I'm at your service, I'm at your service.
I'm coming.
They reserved the small ballroom and the food was disgusting.
Very cheap.
What she said about the happy wedding.
Certainly, everyone is saying the same thing.
This is what scares me!
Dear sister,
He's only worried about the money.
And we don't care about anything people say.
He wants to laugh at us.
But we're supposed to come up with something based on our budget and circumstances.
People take out loans and sell their houses and cars just to have an extravagant wedding and prevent people from talking about them.
Leave it to us, cheap chocolate is enough to embarrass us with.
I said the director liked the Chinese girl and took her home.
Alright, if the bride's family said we choose the wedding hall, the stage, and prepare everything ourselves.
And you think we'll choose anything!
No, nothing, but the store we go to earlier has a very suitable price.
By the way, this store designed Abu Dhahb's wedding.
Has anyone used it before?
Believe me once.
At the wedding of His Excellency's daughter, congratulations.
No, no, no, we don't need anything that's been used.
I need a phase that we'll be the first in the world to use.
This means you want to excel.
Show me what you've got.
This stage is used for the first time in Qatar.
Inspired by the information revolution, like Facebook and Twitter.
Very modern and up-to-date with the latest fashion trends.
How much does this stage cost with the other arrangements?
I'll calculate it for you now, but it's not less than one hundred and twenty thousand.
Mom, mom, at this rate our money won't be enough, everything is more expensive, better, and exclusive, all of that costs money.
Everyone wants this.
Be quiet.
What is the decision?
So, did you like this?
This is Noah's Ark.
Both are new, but Noah's ship is twenty thousand more expensive.
No, God bless your parents, I think the mouse stage is much better.
Be quiet, I don't need Noah's Ark.
This is marriage and its costs. By the way, we're considered middle-class.
Do I have to pay a down payment of one hundred and fifty thousand and a dance hall fee of one hundred and fifty thousand for the hall I booked, which you call King's Hall?
I didn't say box, but why is there this display, and everyone wants to see the other and everyone wants to be better than the other.
It's a battle of pride, and only wedding shop owners benefit.
Who knows that everyone wants to be special, exploiting us and lying to us.
I swear I know one of my friends who says his brother has a wedding shop.
He says that the theater doesn't cost more than two thousand riyals.
I'm waiting for the moment when his father says yes.
Alright, do something.
Like any other men, they get married and manage their affairs.
Hello Sheikh, Sir.
How are you?
I know you love to stand out.
That's why I'm calling you.
For the first time in Qatar, designed by international artist Peter Salomon.
A collection inspired by the nine planets.
I am from the solar system.
With the Noah's Ark stage, it will look amazing.
There's no such harmony, you'll be the first to use the nine planets in Qatar.
Alright then,
It was one hundred and fifty thousand, and now?
Alright then,
"We belong to Allah, and to Him we shall return."
As You Like It (play)
Too many expenses, my brother.
By the way, I couldn't get the eighty thousand.
All I could gather was sixty thousand, and I took twenty thousand from my brother.
Thank you, thank you very much. Oh! My brother. Oh! Fahd.
How can I calm things down? Oh! Fahd, as long as we boast at weddings, we'll be in trouble.
Without any showing off.
You will surely get the invitations you want.
Oh, this week, God willing, we'll start on the wedding invitations.
Our marriage will be better than theirs.
Oh, Mom, look at the invitations my son chose for the wedding.
Where does your brother live?
People now travel to countries just to design their invitations.
Unlike Amina's family, they went to Italy to design their invitation, print it, and came back. As well as Manar's family.
They go to France, even those who can't afford it go to Lebanon to get their invitations.
How does the system work in the country, do you want us to be different?
So, which country do you want to travel to?
We saw some wonderful invitations.
By God, it's expensive but...
But it's private, and no one has ever done it before.
Sparkle, I don't like it.
Gold is much better, sparkling.
Oh brother, if he can't afford the wedding expenses,
So why did he involve himself?
And leave off all this boasting and pride at weddings, and all these unnecessary expenses.
The only beneficiaries of our madness are hotels and wedding planners.
That's it, he's leaving, God protect him.
Let me take it, he might not find someone to take it.
Come, I'll give you a ride.
Thank you, Abu Nasser!
Oh brother, the bride's family should support you.
I tried once, just once.
I said there that there was no need for a ballroom in a very well-known hotel.
Why, we found our daughter on the street and others are no better than her.
This is the problem, everyone is looking at the other.
Who told you I got married?
At least they don't have that pride.
It's just a simple party and a few expenses.
Oh man, they're getting engaged on Facebook today.
Cheaper and less costly.
This means you won't marry from your country.
Forget about it, do you want me to go crazy?
You will see,
If I don't invite Abdullah, Rabia, or Nawal to my son's wedding.
Curse her, she won't be better than me.
I want to ask you something, dear.
If you have Roischd's number, give it to us so we can contact him.
Alright dear, thank you very much, goodbye.
Mom, we agreed on the DJ. Why did you change your mind?
Can Umm Nassar be better than me?
I forgot who she is and who she was.
The people who were below us have become better than us.
It's like this, Mom, but look at my brother Saleh. He breaks my heart, and we shouldn't pressure him too much.
By God, he broke my heart.
Wow!
In the hospital! When and which hospital?
I don't know, it suddenly fell.
Upon hearing this, she collapsed.
There's no need and no one can blame her. After she prepared everything and people knew, he said he didn't want to get married.
He wants to embarrass us.
What did the doctor say?
He will embarrass us, he wants to call off the wedding.
God willing, everything will be alright.
Don't break her heart.
My son, you are a man and you are the provider.
Go, go and reassure her.
I swear, if I told Abu Yusuf, his heart would stop beating.
Do you know why the minister is still keeping Abu Youssef?
By the way, he should have retired three or four years ago.
No problem, he'll help me.
I swear to you, you're crazy.
Did you understand what I want from him now?
And you ask him to hide the documents and statements until you return the money.
They call it amount cooling postponement.
I don't talk, and I don't know why you're panicking.
No need to worry, I'll settle the amount with you by the end of the month.
You know what they call me, you know what they call me?
Disciplined, disciplined.
Oh my uncle, oh my uncle, I tried, but there is no other solution.
If I give you and then reviewers
They are strict in their scrutiny, they will take me, quickly, quickly.
Quickly, the grains, the grains, the grains.
I ate, I ate cereal.
No, no, God willing, we'll be in the ballroom to receive guests from 7:30.
No, we will definitely be there.
I'm throwing a wedding for my son, it's going to be the talk of all of Doha.
Surprise!
Alright dear Fatima, I'll talk to you later.
I'm afraid they'll envy you, my son, if you walk in on them tomorrow with that bicycle.
Oh mom, is the length of the bisht okay?
The police are here!
Inshallah, there's nothing.
Police, just stay here and I'll be back.
"We do what We will, O Salwa."
Forgot your wedding.
Marriage cage, now he will go to the prison cage.
They discovered the document I hid for your loan, and now suddenly, they found out about me.
Why are you upset!
I've heard of worse disasters than this.
What do we say next!
A respectful and honest employee
He who loves his job, the ministry contracted a company for maintenance.
Concerned about his job, the employee went to inquire about the materials.
He found out it costs four hundred thousand.
It will save the ministry one million six hundred thousand.
Punish the minister! No, no, no, I don't believe it.
Why can't you believe!
Here is Saad.
Of course, he has all the news.
He dismissed him from work.
What has happened to the world? Where are the values?
They say he called his office manager.
He told him: Let her work instead of Uthman.
And who is she?
She is the daughter of the manager of the same company that submitted the maintenance offer.
I discovered Uthman.
No, no, no, no, this is unbelievable.
You're always amazed, Saleh!
Who does this company belong to?
For whom?
This is how we became!
What do you say!
What matters to me is what I say, this poor employee Uthman, what is his fault!
His mistake is that he is honest and trustworthy!
Do you think the manager is in his office?
Yes, he left just now.
What's happening in the world!
We started seeing some strange people.
I agree with you, Uthman doesn't deserve that, but (the saying goes) there's nothing we can do about it.
What an injustice, Sir. He has seven children and doesn't have a passport.
He lives off this work! What will he do now and where will he go?
Do you know what happened?
The new employee whom the minister appointed,
I entered Uthman's office and started working. The poor Uthman came to take his belongings, I stopped him and said, "Go, and I will send your belongings with the tea boy."
Where is he now?
Things have changed! Oh! Uthman?
This is the reward!
This is God's will (proverb).
O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad.
Oh great and generous God, O Uthman, may God not forsake you, goodbye.
What's wrong? You don't look well!
I know, I know you're very sensitive.
Oh my! I can't do anything, I'm leaving now.
It's an opportunity to pass by my mother's place and pick up the things.
What I want is for you not to stay angry like this.
Why are you shouting in my face? I'm your mother.
I'm not shouting at you, I'm asking you.
How is it right, by what right do you go with him? Is he your husband, or your father or your brother?
The world has changed, where do you live?
I don't know, Mama!
You're crazy.
People are free, the world has become a small village, where are you living!
But what can I say!
Be modern, live these times, and don't be backward.
Get the stuff out of the car quickly! Go, don't look at me and lock it.
Something's wrong, God! Saleh, what's wrong with you?
No, you're not fine today.
She shouted at the poor maid, it wasn't her fault.
You know I didn't mean it.
No, no, no, I don't have an appetite.
To forget the disasters I've seen.
Dear, don't cry.
The president is a bit angry.
It is an honor, sir.
Thank you, thank you very much.
Hard work and perseverance.
Indeed, how amazing.
Above all,
The most important thing for me in this ministry
That is correct, sir.
Tell me, what's the use of an official who doesn't take bribes?
He is useless.
That's why I want you all.
There is no place for sincere people and those with outdated principles and values.
If one day you discover
He will only blame himself.
Justice is a principle regardless of the reaction!
That's why I want you to cooperate with me.
If you have a doubt
Just tell me.
We are thieves and sons of thieves, and no one competes (a popular saying) with our sisters.
If Nora doesn't take a bribe one day, she steals government tea before going home.
Excellent, excellent, bravo. This is what I expect from all of you, I don't want it to be just her, I want all of you to be like her.
God bless you.
That's why I want you to leave procurement and become my office manager.
Believe me, you know how to choose; you picked the right thief for the right place.
Enough, O mother of Saud, do not torment me any more.
What I want is not to live in prison.
But God has protected me from their magic, He has guided me and made truthfulness beautiful to me.
He told me to be honest.
You are a father.
Why suffer for truth and honesty?
You have been a thief and lazy your whole life.
Thank God I wasn't religious.
Let me talk to your father.
Never repeat it.
One must be on the straight path, enticing, stealing, and hypocritical to live easily.
My father is in prison because all his money is illegal.
Stop, stop.
This is something you can wear!
We are a respectable family.
You lie.
Where is your stomach?
Why wasn't it discovered?
Do not be ashamed, you do not fear shame.
I'm shy about wearing my brother's clothes.
Is there any shy girl these days?
Why are you shouting?
Look at what your daughter is wearing!
Is there any respectable lady who wears such a thing?
Will you walk in the street without showing any part of your body?
I'm tired of her, she doesn't listen to what I say.
I wouldn't stop supporting here.
I bought her see-through clothes, which was unnecessary.
I'll warn you if I ever see you below the knee.
If you knew the situation, you would never blame me for the consequences.
We are here, God bless you.
God willing, it will be a fun and playful game.
He is like his father.
As you can see before you,
He is a very good man, how can we find someone like him.
Don't be afraid, Uncle, I'm a monster.
You're a good man. To be honest, I love my daughter Sarah very much and I care about her future.
We only heard about it afterward.
Alhamdulillah, her reputation is very bad.
I arrived home at three thirty in the morning.
She came home at 5 a.m.
Hello, hello, what! Hello.
Come and take me from the bar.
Start your car and come pick me up from the bar.
This is the first time I've seen a father not obey his son.
Stop, Dad. Start your car, I'm waiting for you.
Mary, I love you.
I love you too, you've disappeared, disappeared, disappeared.
Look, look, Father, Dad is here.
Where is he?
He is brave, unlike my father who doesn't enjoy it.
Let me introduce you to my friend, Majid.
No, Dad, Abdulaziz was my ex-friend.
Welcome, please come in, a grassy opportunity.
The Arab and Israeli satellite
I discovered that many Palestinians did not cut their nails.
As committed by the State of Palestine in the comprehensive peace agreement,
In any case, the United Nations meets today to discuss Israel's request to send special inspection committees to examine Palestinian fingers.
To find out if their nails are long or not.
There was a condition that nothing was to be cut, or wounded, or anything that would draw blood.
State of Palestine
I call on the entire international community to visit Palestine.
From the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.
It's made of pine.
And olives, man.
We press the olives like this, this is how we press the olives.
We and our Arab brothers call upon the international community
To conduct inspections of Palestinian nails.
And now, let's start the voting.
No, no, no, no, it doesn't come to that, no.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Salih, Salih, what's bothering you?
What did you dream about?
I dreamed of an upside-down world.
O Rashid! You have a strong personality.
Now, brother, this school that you will work at tomorrow is number ?
I am a teacher like you.
Why haven't I changed my school since I started teaching?
What a character, brother!
But the problem lies in his weak personality.
By the way, the teachers who are with him are the ones who complained about him.
To that extent, brother!
That's why you see him calm.
And then, he started teaching.
It wasn't ketchup, it was mayonnaise with %bio.
Oh brother! We don't say this to anger you.
We're telling you this because it's your last chance.
And he told me, "Rashid accepted, although he is a weak character."
He is very good and hesitant.
Whatever the case, he is a citizen.
Why are you so silent, brother?
Because everything you say is true.
Everything you say is true.
From tomorrow,
New Adult Master
Mr. Rashid,
You are absolutely right.
Alright, forget about it.
And from tomorrow,
Oh, this is good. What's next?
Here I'm telling you,
I am a teacher who does not like mistakes.
Say, if a boy jumped and told you just as the other boy did at your previous school and the inspector there,
And take your bag!
Slowly, slowly, open the door.
Well, one learns from one's mistakes.
From the first minute,
Here I'm telling you,
I'm confused.
It's up to me!
Shut your mouth.
It seems he said: "Shut up!"
Did you hear him?
Tell him Mr. Rashid fired me.
It seems he said, "It doesn't matter to me, but he will see, I don't want to see your face here in the class."
Teacher, don't you know who he is?
Whose son is he?
Here comes Mr. Rashid.
Saw it?
The doctor is the problem if he tells his father.
Well, where do you usually see him sitting, sitting during the break?
You might find him sitting in the chair area.
Above the chairs.
Chairs, chairs.
At the end of the day, you're human.
But you shouted in my face!
Friends joking, you're joking with me.
My father is out of the country and will be coming next week. When he comes, I will tell him.
No, no, no, no, Abdel Rahman, may God protect you.
We are friends. By the way, strawberry ice cream is very delicious, you might not have tried it. It has a slightly sour taste, but it's wonderful.
Alright, go and get it quickly.
The only thing I'm afraid of is that he'll tell his father.
I said his father is abroad.
Oh, he's out, and his father won't return? That means they took his father's belongings and kicked him out!
I hope there won't be dire consequences.
I carried his bag and sat it down for him, gave him your phone number, and told him if he needed anything to call me, your friend.
Ah, but.
Ah, but what?
It was you who told me.
Scream and claim that you are strong.
The bathroom, the bathroom, the bathroom.
Ohhhhhhhh
Name, you can sleep, you can sleep, don't tire him, sleep.
Mr. Abu Nasser, Mr. Rashid is in the bathroom.
One juice.
Come here, come here, come here, come here, give me.
Go, quickly.
Put them on the table.
That all people are equal.
That's why I've gathered you, to hear your opinions about the party.
How can one guarantee a boy?
We're going to get into trouble, he, he, he's calling.
It's three o'clock.
That is, hello. The line went dead, I swear he was joking.
Faster, faster.
Peace be upon you
Get up, stand back, sit down.
Yes, I'm at your service.
Professor, come here, please come here, Professor.
Are you done screaming?
I don't mean to laugh! Man, I'm just asking you, are you done?
Whether you're done or not, where is the teacher's authority? By acting this way, you're disrespecting yourself and the teaching profession.
Alright, alright, okay, okay.
And you're raising your voice too?
Yes, I raise my voice, first you have to know who this boy is?
Faster, faster.
Just two cars.
Two cars, no, no, I want four or five cars. Make room, make room, we have enough space. Go, go, go.
He thinks he owns the neighborhood!
Abu Nasser used to do this and not do that.
May God keep him safe.
I'm the boss here.
It is known that Abu Nasser
He was giving all the teachers extra classes.
Except me.
Who's the boss here?
You are the manager, God guide you, what's wrong with you?
Put your leg down.
I didn't put it on your head, it's on the chair, brother.
What do you mean?
No need, I swear to God I'm being honest with you, I want to relieve you.
What is it they call it?
So, what are you doing to me now?
Act better for your own sake, and you will study extra lessons whether you like it or not.
See what you can do, get up, get up, get up, out!
Alright, I'll leave.
As you like it, we told you, man!
We must stop his boundaries.
Wait, people, wait.
Don't blame us, Abu Salma.
Oh my god!
I am not my father's son.
You'll see what I'll do to him.
Faster, faster.
Goodbye, Judge.
Oh God, when did he buy this new car?
I told you, but you didn't believe me.
He shaved his beard and his face became red.
Do you believe that when he came, I didn't recognize him, but when he spoke, I recognized him by his voice.
Did you know he was promoted a week ago?
This means he is responsible for eight schools for boys and girls.
What is this magical secret? Ask him to tell you, what is the secret that got him out of the bottom!
Here I'm telling you from day one,
I don't want to hear any sound when I'm teaching.
Not even a breath.
Act politely.
And you, too, answer me, you, too, argue with me. Get out of my face, get out, get out, get out.
When you are appointed a minister, look for a good staff to work with you.
So, don't tell me to come and take this job.
"Or the second job, no, brother, give me options, different jobs, and I'll choose the most suitable job."
My brother is a minister!
I swear, I didn't feel comfortable after the call I received.
Everyone congratulates me.
What they say, oh Mother, may God guide you.
This is very common. Every minister appoints his friends and people automatically.
From this side, don't worry, meet %Pw.
They know I'll become a minister.
So, they're bribing me, it's just flattery.
Wealth will come to us, a treasure, a treasure that will open to us.
The big earth.
Go ahead, all of you go to congratulate the new minister.
Go, go, go.
Congratulations, Your Excellency.
By your virtue, congratulations.
Congratulations, Your Excellency, you deserve it.
You deserve it, Your Excellency the Minister!
Brothers, the responsibility is great, may God make it easy.
As they say, you are very qualified for this job (example).
You left, then Abu Saleh's phone rang.
He was far from him.
Forgot it.
I'm amazed to see how much he loves him now?
And Abu Sultan is not naive.
Yes, I opened the car door for him.
Bravo, you've done a lot!
We expect our brother to become a minister.
I told you, Mother! But you don't believe me.
You were saying they were café stories, café stories.
After her husband's death, she said I had envied him.
There is no god but Allah, there is no god but Allah.
Ah, you have nothing to say, you have nothing.
Oh, mom, let's go, enough is enough (a popular saying).
What do you mean by "none of your business"?
You just need to relax.
I interrupted them because they were annoying me.
Yes, they are right.
But I didn't want to say that in front of Mom, you know Mom will tell someone.
You blab everything you hear, they call it a sieve, we don't want a scandal.
So, what guarantees do you have that if he steps down from power, they will put you in his place?
Because I asked.
If he's out of the office, you'll be the first candidate.
What guarantees do you have that they will strike him?
No, I'm very sure about this.
Don't remind him, I saw him leaving the office just as I see you now in front of me.
I bewitched him.
But the plan in my head is foolproof and effective.
Plan to burn her and expel her.
I'll make him attend every event that takes place in the country.
At that time, he will be burned. When he is burned, he will leave his position. When he leaves his position, he will be expelled.
I swear to you, brother, I don't know what or how to tell you!
Your visit this time, this participation reflects the extent of your love for your homeland.
Do you believe that?
Today you are a statesman, you must always be present.
You must participate in everything, sorry sir, sorry, sorry.
Before I forget, thank you for the sheep you sent me yesterday.
Come on, it's just a small party, it's not beneath you. What do you think your honor is? Will you come with me today?
The man is waiting for you outside!
To be honest,
What I want is not to go.
I am sick, I am sick of fame, I am sick of it.
You are the minister today, he is right. As he said, you are social, think about your reputation!
God sends you this kind man.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Don't take my picture.
Take, take.
Today I took him with me to the poetry night and to a wedding, and they took at least a hundred pictures of him.
I'll also tell you about something very nice to take to him.
Listen, I've also arranged a very nice educational activity for you.
Yes, like this. Let it shine, I want it to shine, shine, shine until it shines. I'm looking for that shine.
The delegate, thank you for the congratulations, congratulations, blessed bicycle. %PW Picture, picture of the Minister's happiness. Take a picture, take a picture. Don't take my pictures, I'm far away, take them.
This is the bicycle.
A blessed beginning and congratulations, His Excellency Mr. sends his greetings.
Picture, picture like this. You are my flesh, my flesh, my Lord.
No problem, please.
Go to the second page.
No, he doesn't know him.
It's a national contribution.
Say "Mashallah."
This is the fourth friend who has called me today.
Everyone praises your activities; Um Khalid says you are the active social activist.
I heard a hurtful word yesterday.
The party that Abu Sultan took me to yesterday.
The young children's victory at the swimming party.
A person was telling his friend,
They thought I hadn't heard them.
This minister said
I want to buy a birthday present for my nephew.
Hello, hello.
I see you every day, sir, in the newspaper.
Correct, correct,
You've brought light to this place with your presence, because of that, I'll give you a discount on everything you want.
Whether you want to pay or not, no problem.
This means you won't be wandering around and getting to know your minister.
I, I am Abu Saleh, the minister.
Abu Sultan didn't come to take anything, I'm waiting for him.
He put me in the front row and then went to the car to rest.
We don't need it from you, may God guide you.
Blessings upon his mother and father, and ask Him for me. I'll call you later just to check.
And you are inviting yourself.
People give us discounts.
I told you.
This work is wonderful.
But let this man come to me!
The minister's happiness annoyed me, may God humiliate him.
Hello, hello Minister.
No, but I'm tired today.
Alright, if you're that enthusiastic, we're at your service.
We are at your service, but my brother Saad will take you and show you around, and I hope he finds you a party or something.
Then a party?
No, no, we don't have any activity today.
No, we don't.
Okay, where can we find?
Yes. Thank you, thank you.
Is anyone asking?
God willing, my brother.
Sleep and rest.
A moment of happiness.
Even the henna night?
Welcome, that's good.
There might be extra time.
Take him! Put him in the cabin and find a photographer to take some pictures of his face.
Okay, okay, bye-bye.
What did you find for him?
I don't know, some minor league game. Let him sit alone in the stadium!
What's this! This minister is turning the tables on us!
Sweet, meaning he reached the top.
It was very near its end when it became the talk of the town.
My lord, he has become much more popular than you.
Sir, if you go somewhere and take Abu Saleh with you,
Oh, sir,
His star shines.
We'll turn it off and return it to its normal size.
The minister came, came, came. The minister came.
Don't take pictures! Don't take pictures! I swear to God, if any of you take my picture, I'll hit you. I'm not going out.
Brock broke their cameras, I don't want pictures.
She sends you her greetings.
As they say, I missed the train.
This is my sister, Khulood.
There is no god but God.
Why?
This is the first time I've seen him.
The first time you see him!
The first time I've seen him in years.
Oh my God
Is this nonsense?
I haven't seen you in ages, come here, my love.
What should I do? He's so attached to her.
Praise be to Allah and there is no power except with Allah; we've returned to the same topic.
Get out, get out and don't give me a headache. I came back from the wedding at 3 a.m.
Let me rest and don't make a big fuss about it.
Your brother is a girl.
I swear I'll tell my father, look at yourself, you look like a girl.
This means that he was playing, playing.
Ah, he was playing, I tell you he was playing with the makeup palette.
And this is Saud; I know what to do with him.
Oh, how wonderful it is to be alone, I wish all children were like him.
About these campaigns and the nonsense he creates about his brother.
Come, my dear brothers, come and say hello.
How are you, dear?
No, dear, we're not going to Spain this summer.
Who are you talking to?
Fahd is from Kuwait.
Oh, Hamada!
Listen to what I say.
There is no god but God.
I'll let my dear Amal choose for herself.
But honestly, what do you think?
I say the one by the sea is better.
Even in the near future, if we buy a yacht, we'll go directly from our home to the sea.
Us and our children.
Please, you need to make a decision about the wedding date.
It's good, it's only one year and a few months.
What's up with your brother, he's spraying too much perfume.
Amal, frankly, noticed that your brother Khalid, I don't know.
But he is completely different from your brother Saad.
Different or not different, dear everyone is free in their actions.
And your fiancée is backward, she doesn't know that there is a unisex perfume.
Let your fiancé keep his opinion to himself!
What matters to me.
How truthful Khalid is!
It's not your perfume that you use like women's perfume.
You even use their colors.
Why are you doing this, Khaled!
Honestly, you have nothing to say.
Oh, Mom, why don't you trust anything about him? Don't you see his actions and behavior?
Now perfumes are gender-neutral.
Here I warn you.
Did you see the Bluetooth?
I heard about it from my friends in the council; they say it's very common in Doha.
I've heard about it, show us.
You have to watch him, and I'll tell you later.
Look how this girl dances!
Look at the moves!
These are girls! Look at this one who says she dances well and does some moves, do you know who she is? She's Khalid Mohammed's relative.
"For my ugly aunt, Khulood."
Alright, you'll see what I'll do with it.
His brother Saad is waiting for him now.
Why? Let him come and see, let Saad come! I'll send him the Bluetooth so his family can see it.
Peace be upon you
"Peace be upon you, welcome, welcome."
Of course, I was defeated.
Why is my uncle sitting far away?
Nothing, but is your Bluetooth on?
No, but I'll send you something.
No, thank you, Your Highness.
He ran away from his family.
You're crazy, Saad!
And I will travel tomorrow.
I won't show my face in this country.
Where are you going alone? (Proverb)
What do people say?
They will tell us that their son left them and traveled, you won't cause us any trouble!
Oh, wow!
What your son Khalid did is an honor and a source of pride!
A man who becomes a woman, isn't that a scandal?
I can't face people if they say this is the brother of the devil.
Tell him he travels for treatment, study, work, or even to commit suicide.
The most important thing is that I don't live in a place where scandal chases me every day.
So, where are you going?
What matters to me is where I'm going (proverb).
This is the end.
The other one we don't know where he is, and the one here is packing his bags to travel.
Not even we know where he goes?
What did you expect from him?
What happened to you? I came to console you, and you throw harsh words at me that break my heart.
I was telling you to take care of him.
What you leave to the slaves.
You don't know anything about it and you weren't busy.
And your father is busy with his work and left the responsibility to you.
You are right, Mother.
What's the hope of your sister?
In this, you are right.
What you did has humiliated us among people.
I don't see anyone.
Did you say anything to him?
This is the biggest flaw in my father.
We are at the strange case of the cell phones.
I told him.
Put it on a CD and give it to him.
Only when I go to the airport.
I'm very worried about him.
Our house has to reach this level, Ammal.
Don't be surprised.
Khaled and his peers do not care about their families' reputations.
And the reputation of their brothers and sisters
What they call religious values
They are dancing and celebrating.
In a swamp of evil.
Oh my son, I am perplexed.
Goodbye, Daddy.
Take care of yourself, son!
Yes, Father, I have a small gift for you.
A gift for me!
Now put the CD in the laptop, I'm afraid of what will happen, come with me!
All right, Mom.
I can't believe the father is still watching the CD, it's only three minutes long.
He may go out.
Where is he going? There's not enough time for him to go anywhere.
Answer me, what's bothering you, Abu Saad?
Oh, Daddy!
It's a good thing, oh! Hope.
And if I search, I will fail.
To find someone with your morals.
But spare me.
God help you.
I see your entrance to the roof!
Yes, my love.
We live in an age of freedom.
The age of human rights, and no one owes us anything.
If someone has one riyaal, they can take a thousand "There is no god but Allah"! My light in the eyes.
Certainly, I can handle it. God bless America, my love.
Do you know that salaries are high now?
It's twelve hundred.
God enriches you; every time you speak to a driver, you ask, "What's your salary?"
My salary is very low.
If he sees me, he starts complaining, "My salary is low and it's not enough." We agreed with him that his salary is 700 and we increased it by 100 when he got the license, what more does he want?
I told him, when you finish your year of work, we will increase your salary.
He seems greedy and we're going to have a tough time with him.
Stop, stop, shut your mouth, just shut your mouth, just shut your mouth, send it back and get rid of it.
This word is easy for you, easy.
So you'll let him complain, I hate going out with him in the car.
Alright, leave it to me.
I've told you the story now, I'm the man of the house. Shh, stop, you too be quiet, I'll handle her.
Get up, get up, get out, get out.
Come and stand.
What did I tell you?
I told you your friends don't come to your room. Did I say that or not?
Oh boss, this is not my friend, this is my uncle.
He came for five minutes and will leave, God willing.
Five minutes!
And keep it in mind!
"You tell the lady I need a raise, I need a raise!"
Everything in the world is expensive now.
And when did I give you eight hundred?
Boss, I have a lot of problems at home.
Those drivers in Doha take one thousand one hundred, one thousand two hundred.
It can be three thousand three hundred.
Wait, I'll think.
Listen, I'll raise 100% and fold, I won't raise you.
Don't say I didn't raise you right, get to your job!
What did he say?
I'll tell you.
What's the use of water?
What's the use of two hundred?
I'm afraid the screen.
Why are you afraid?
All the drivers fled.
Because they work outside the home for three or four thousand.
What's the deal? If you work at home, it's not worth it, but if you work outside, you earn more.
I'm very scared.
Look at them, they are all drivers.
How much?
Two thousand five hundred.
But I'm afraid of the police who will take me and put me in jail.
No, don't be afraid.
I guarantee you.
I was wearing my cloak and about to go out.
I was calling, but now no one is answering me.
He opened the door of his room and found the closet empty.
Monira's maid ran away for a year.
I will just say, God is sufficient.
Alright, I'll come to you.
I went to the police.
If you have reported, you have no liability.
We'll do everything we can.
And you too, look around the neighborhood, you might find him and let us know.
Yes, he will make money and when he is full, he will surrender.
We bring them, spend money on them, give them clothes, food, and driving lessons.
He can't make up his mind about it.
The match is starting now, come in, it's best you come in.
Yes, we were worried.
These are foxes, and foxes are not easily caught.
You know if we don't score more than three, it means we won't win; we need ten or fifteen.
This is clear sarcasm, clear sarcasm. Let's make it clear that this is clear sarcasm.
This is her level. If she doesn't score more than three, it's not the Foxes team.
Take it from me.
In ourselves, in the players, and in the performance.
They have nothing, it's a relief for them if they get less than 3, it's a relief for them.
Any goal, these are just appetizers. Our team is still hungry, this is the Foxes team, leave us alone, man.
Your aim now, you are comfortable and happy now.
Do you think there are other goals, or is this it?
This fox is very good, it's very smart. It goes here and there and no one can catch it, you'll faint. This fox eats chickens.
No, I don't have a car.
You are my friend.
Did you hear what he said?
This fox said it's a big problem.
You can't catch up with him.
Yes, oh! Sir.
Do you know or not?
He is a fan of the Foxes team.
Sometimes "Recharge" appears in the program.
They will win today and you will lose.
I swear I will defeat you. The Foxes team never loses, it's always the winner.
Clothes, what do you think about the result today?
Why are you asking me about the result?
It's over, the fox is the winner.
The birds came to take their livelihood and fly.
Let's be realistic, don't say the fox won and flew away.
These are the foxes, my friend.
This fox takes the chicken and eats it.
I didn't see Your Highness working at the stadium.
What stops the audience from laughing at him.
It's clear on the field, and thank you for listening.
The true fan with genuine loyalty to the club.
He hangs out with the Qatari elite who go to malls and such places.
He invited me for a cappuccino.
What a strange world, human.
The boy gave me five hundred riyals in front of my eyes and cashed the check.
Let's say the poem you wrote about our match against the frogs.
Thank you to all the listeners here.
You are a frog.
Don't be ashamed that my team beat yours by four.
Talk about filth, talk about the filth of the club and the team, and see what happens!
Don't say that!
When one of the foxes was expelled
The reason behind that is the ruling.
A player was expelled from the Foxes team.
I changed his name from Hakim to Ahmak.
Thank you, thank you, thank you to all the listeners here.
Every month, we met to choose the best fan.
Amazing, who did you choose to honor this month?
The club board members will decide.
There are no children, and each of you is the size of a camel.
I manage this big club. Shirts.
Come, come and see the driver who escaped from us, he's on TV, come.
Is this it?
One of them speaks well, and the other is silent.
Do you think this is a pen or a watch?
Now, I know how to communicate with him.
The crowds left.
Leave after him.
He lived here.
He was driving fast.
We've lost him now.
Great!
Shut up, you're not the one who decides. I'm the man of the house and I'm the one who decides.
We must be certain.
Majid Abdulrahman Al-Subaie
Yes, yes, yes, God bless you.
I am from the Subai tribe.
Buy it and register it in my name. No, no, no, I don't want to live in it, I have a house.
I just want to invest.
Because the investment price is rising, God bless.
How can I help you, people? What do you want?
* * May God bless you,
Come in! People, want some coffee?
You don't have anything to say, God bless you. You don't need anything, God honor you.
You say I'm sure, is that good? We'll be ashamed of ourselves in front of the elite!
I'm very worried.
Oh mama, oh mama, I am mama.
Now, I don't know what your father will do with us.
I didn't mean it, Mom!
Oh my darling, don't tell my father.
Tomorrow, he'll make a mess at home.
Of course, he's going to kill you now.
Oh mom, I swear I didn't break it on purpose.
So, Mom, why don't we buy some glue and stick ourselves together?
What will we hold on to?
How do we find something like it? I don't know where your uncle bought it, it was a gift.
I'm worried about you from him.
Oh mother, I'm afraid he will hit me.
Close the door until I find a solution to this problem.
Quickly, go to your room.
Uncle, uncle, uncle! Are you blind!
You're blind, you break the bottle, are you blind?
Oh, Mom, what about Dad?
No, oh! The son didn't come. What happened to you?
He ran out of the house, afraid of his father.
This is not true. Have mercy on the boy!
This is not upbringing. May God guide you, daughter.
What should I do now, mom?
I don't know what to do!
I don't know, but I scared him with the cars in the street.
God protect him, I think he went to the supermarket or went to our neighbors to play with the children.
Yes, she is sweet, kind, and beloved. Oh! My daughter.
No, no my daughter, seek refuge in Allah from Satan and do not worry, God willing, everything will be alright.
Okay, bye-bye, my daughter.
Where is Walid?
Dad is going to hit me.
Oh grandmother, my father will kill me with beating.
Don't be afraid, uncle! My light of my eyes.
Don't be afraid, my love.
I won't allow him to hit you.
I didn't mean to break it.
My son, come and drink some water and rest in my room.
Your face turned yellow.
"O Allah, guide him, O Allah, guide him. Come with me, my son, a little bit."
O Allah, the Generous
I'm afraid my father will come here.
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
No one interferes with raising my son.
This is my son, and I raise him as I please.
But the poor buyer is anxious, trembling and panicking over something he didn't intend.
Why doesn't he have eyes?
Let him see!
The bag accidentally knocked over the vase, believe me, he didn't mean to do it.
You! You must support him!
Please don't say anything to him. Forgive him this time, the state of fear he's in breaks my heart.
But where is he now? Why is he here at this time?
What can't be helped can't be helped.
He's here! Where?
Enter, come in!
No, no, I'll take it to my brother today.
Why don't you bring something new instead of the old one!
Oh, Naser, come! Brother, we want to play!
And your mother says you're studying!
Dad, this game is just for fun, we'll study later.
Don't you have an exam tomorrow?
Yes, Father.
Oh dad, come on, don't ruin the game.
Oh dad, it's not important at all. Come on, come on dad, let's study.
Don't say such things! Listen to me.
If I go, I'll call your uncle Abu Waleed now.
No, no, no, no. Don't tell my uncle, don't tell my uncle, no!
What matters to me,
I'll tell him you don't obey me.
Go. Take your books and start studying.
Alright Dad, put your phone in your pocket, we'll study, Dad, but don't tell Uncle.
Oh, Mother, I am so confused. I don't know what to do.
I fear that if he knows, he will cause us trouble.
Of course, he will ask me, "Why are you taking him to the hospital?"
So, what's the problem if you tell him?
If he finds out that Waleed is wetting his bed, he'll kill him.
Oh my god!
Oh, my daughter! It has a psychological impact.
The boy is not a child, he is now twelve years old.
It's a good thing, oh! My daughter.
You will come to have lunch with us and I will give him some signals.
And I will see his opinion.
Her mother went to Bahrain to buy abayas.
It's just an excuse (like always), my daughter.
Fun and shopping.
She says he wets the bed every night.
My son wets his bed every night and don't tell me the story.
He told me I should take him to the hospital so they could treat him.
Her husband is stupid.
And we understand nothing.
He is right.
He needs to go to the hospital, son, so they can find out what he has.
He is looking for a good dry hose.
He beat him until all the neighbors heard the screams.
Sit down!
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh
No, I didn't say anything.
Take it and go quickly and have a bath, I'll get you some clothes. Go!
Please, I beg you.
I must punish them.
Don't interfere!
Is this what you call a pass?
Khaloi got forty-nine out of fifty.
Is this a pass?
But their grades are good.
He told them they would be punished if they didn't get fifty out of fifty.
Please, don't take them to your brother!
They must be punished.
They are my children.
Alright, I swear to you, uncle, this is the last time.
Why don't you get fifty out of fifty, fifty out of fifty?
Give him another one.
I tell him, don't go with us to public places.
Yesterday we went to the hospital and they told him not to enter. You're not allowed.
You're different, don't go with us.
Shut up! Let me punish his brothers.
Stop, uncle, I'm about to die, stop, stop, stop, stop. I'm about to die, stop, uncle.
Let me punish you.
Remember, this is not a punishment. What you'll see at the end of the year if none of you get fifty.
I will empty the pool.
I will fill it with oil.
Where is your certificate? Where is your certificate?
They said it will be ready tomorrow.
Khaled Abdul Rahman.
Good job, Khalid!
Faisal Abdullah Rashid.
Excellent, Faiez
God bless you.
You are an outstanding student, and you ranked second in your class.
The teacher is crying because he got forty-nine out of fifty in math.
The professor is afraid of his father because he wants him to get a perfect score.
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Call, call your friend.
He said: "I saw him by the school entrance."
Call, call your mother, she might be at your grandfather's house.
No, he didn't go there.
So, where is he? Where is he?
There is no god but God.
What's wrong with you, brother!
Ah, of course he failed, he's afraid of his family.
No, he didn't fail, rather he was an excellent student and was second in his class.
But he was terrified to go back home.
Because he only lost two marks in math.
"We belong to Allah, and to Him we shall return."
Wael, Wael.
Wael, Wael.
Come here, Waleed.
Eighty-four, ninety-four, you've lost a mark or two, that's fine. I won't say anything, I won't scold or beat you. Walid,
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
and nuclear energy
which accounts for sixty percent of the world's oil reserves
Saudi Arabia ranks first with 24% of the world's reserves.
Then Libya, the United States, Nigeria.
3% for each one, then the rest of the world combined with 15%.
Therefore
In addition to production
And perhaps this is one of the secrets and reasons behind the attempt of the major industrial nations to occupy this region and its countries.
And thus, the United States of America tops the list as the world's largest consumer of oil.
But oil prices are on the rise.
With the decline of the US dollar
The unit of measurement for oil prices
Where the price per barrel reached yesterday
This led to an increase in income in producing countries and at the same time
To increase its inflation
Where inflation in some of those countries reached 15%.
The most important source of energy in the world.
Commodity prices and the cost of living
In a direct conversation with the Deputy Prime Minister
Qatar's Minister of Energy and Industry
Abdullah bin Hamad Al Attiyah
And for viewers who wish to participate, they can contact us on the program's contact numbers.
Honorable MP, welcome.
I would like to start with you on the unprecedented oil prices.
Where might prices go?
Of course, where prices might go is a perplexing question.
Or what we call the power of the market.
Is it not to be OPEC?
And not the producing countries?
And not the producing countries, the OPEC has nothing to do with oil prices.
Is the only relationship of price between supply and demand?
So far, supply and demand have nothing to do with it.
So what are the factors?
There are other factors besides supply and demand.
What made investors
I feel so much pressure and I've turned to oil and gold, or what is called (commodities marketing).
Investors losing confidence in stock markets
And gold as well.
We've seen gold rise from $350 in past years to $970 today.
And to this day, as I mentioned before, one hundred and nine dollars.
But they are all on the rise, and if they fall, it will be only a slight decline.
Let me remind you that the first quarter of this year
It is the second quarter that is expected to see a drop in prices due to lower demand for oil.
But we saw the market in an exciting and strangely changing way.
In the second quarter and at the beginning of spring, it exceeds one hundred dollars.
But this means that the previous factors that determined the rise in winter prices and consumption have now changed and there are other factors.
And economic growth
At the same time, we see oil prices rising to this level.
He mentioned political factors, stating that political tensions play a role in this.
About Iran. Do you think that Fall's resignation in light of the political complexities...
What was accompanied and today led most activities of American newspapers and world press. May affect oil prices.
Yes, one hundred percent, and today is...
We are today in the era of globalization and its impact is rapid.
Irreal factors may influence.
And created a kind of disruption in the market.
Also created some types of political rumors
He said there was no plan, but did not rule out the existence of other options that could be applied to Iran.
And markets always react to uncertainty.
Of course, there's nothing confirmed that America is at war with Iran.
And I am one of the people who don't see this scenario.
And perhaps there we did not see what would happen in the future.
But we, who work in the energy sector
We observe these political tensions.
In the world's oil supply
In contrast, there are very profitable supplies.
This shows that there is oil going into storage.
There is absolutely no shortage of oil supplies.
Perhaps preparing for the next war.
In light of this faithful picture you're talking about regarding supply and the absence of supply chain disruptions
In case President Bush and the United States decide to change their plan.
This is something else.
Prices will rise to record levels.
Oil prices may reach
World oil reserves
You are here, today the Gulf represents the most important places.
In addition to Iraq, Iran, and other Gulf states
Now they account for more than 60% of oil reserves, that is certain.
You today
If a very minor accident occurs.
Therefore, it indicates.
This means that in the event of any war with Iran, there will be no guarantee as to how far oil prices will rise.
God knows, maybe you'll arrive today, we arrived without you.
War until one hundred and ninety-seven dollars, and it may rise to one hundred and ten. God knows.
Today, oil, as I told you, is living under political and psychological tensions.
And speculators climbed on these tensions.
Oil investors only
Or what is called a non-investor in real investment, of course, neither future buying nor future marketing.
It is called olive paper.
And they are all guesses on a piece of paper.
Its total production is around three hundred thousand barrels or less.
These people may lead to more purchases and then to more upgrades.
I wish April were a liar.
I hope it isn't
It is said that Cheney is coming to the region, and this is on his main agenda.
The Chinese is the owner of this project, as many politicians and media personalities have said.
I don't know what's in the Chinese bag.
And I expect it, meaning
Will he ignite the war?
America is in transition.
And why doesn't the son do something else?
Let's see what happens, if we're talking about April, April is coming soon after a few weeks and we'll be in April.
And the world may pay.
And America is a huge consumer.
In the Gulf countries
The Gulf will be the tough number.
You can't throw this number away.
Their production cost is very cheap.
Compared to West African countries, most of which rely on
The Gulf, no country in the world can
Look, we've been hearing this talk from the West and the United States for many years.
Use
To the end, I remember the story of the Caucasian War.
What are these dreams?
When you sit with Westerners in a closed circle
You hear them speaking in a different way.
What do they say?
On supplies, the importance of the region, and the value of reserves.
When I asked a European official, I said: "It's strange that you talk to us behind closed doors."
Walking the way you talk in front.
Or the media, as he said: for political reasons.
And of course, there is what is called double standards or two languages.
The language you know is Arabic, and the countries of the Gulf are known as the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, which include Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman.
It is as important today as Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
The largest producer and exporter of oil in the world
And entering into them
Despite all this
Leader of the Central Region
Start a war with Iran
Even with an air war or air raid as they say.
In the supplies
You're not late, you're very generous.
I don't agree with what you say.
We deal with Westerners.
We deal with America.
Where the prices are good.
Regardless of the nationality of this market
Situation, I mean non-renewable energy.
For generosity
Arab generosity
Go ahead and give it to me.
Observers say the real price of oil
The reason behind the rise in oil prices
Oh citizens of the Gulf, OPEC, and the Arab states
You are very generous with Americans, insisting on keeping their currency.
I said the price of oil should be seventy dollars.
I said the true price, in light of the decline of the US dollar, is sixty to seventy.
Okay, now the price is one hundred.
One hundred and nine because the dollar fell by thirty percent.
And now it's over a hundred dollars.
If we take the ratio and the rate
No one denies it.
One of the main reasons
Compared to the decline of the US dollar
If we take
This is a comparison.
Oil prices
Because the United States of America
Certainly it is in our interest at the moment for the dollar to fall.
Weakness or stagnation in the American economy, the United States cannot "do anything."
So what happened to this economic weakness and recession?
You also become
The United States cuts interest rates on the dollar.
Why the insistence on linking oil to the dollar?
Let's talk about why oil prices are tied to the dollar.
The early ones who, more than 100 years
The first country to produce a barrel of oil was the United States of America.
And they were exported in dollars.
And has been from the twentieth century until today.
Pricing oil in dollars
Historically, it has become
And for a hundred years, the world has been repairing and appreciating.
In it, Norway is today considered the third-largest oil-producing country.
A source of oil
Russia is the second-largest exporter of oil.
North Sea field production in Europe
Pricing in dollars, not
Everything is changing in the world; there are other sources and information pointing to something other than this.
The Gulf states
You have secret agreements with the Americans.
And oil became the real cover.
This is true and does not exist.
And these agreements
It continues as long as oil remains a cover for the dollar in exchange for the United States continuing to cover these regimes.
This is not true, and there are no secret agreements.
Today let's take OPEC.
You have sixty-six percent honorary members.
From thirteen countries.
Out of the eighty-five barrels, forty percent are for the OPEC member.
In oil production, there are many large countries.
Outside OPEC
What are the obstacles preventing pricing in another currency?
Search for pricing in another currency.
This is only when the elderly people decide.
You, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, are a summer cloud.
Today's OPEC class is like everyone else's.
There are sixty percent.
Even if we assume that OPEC wanted that.
There is an agreement among all oil-producing countries.
There is a trend and an intention towards change.
What kind of attempt?
But these countries cannot now change the pricing currency.
Unless there is an agreement between
What is the impact?
Let me speak now why European.
Don't export their oil.
From the North Sea or Russia or Norway in euros or rubles
Because it's in their interest, their currency is high and expensive.
No, on the contrary.
Here is where they lost.
With one euro they issue one and a half barrels.
No, you are the one losing because your currency has dropped since it's tied to the dollar.
He is also a big loser, a great loss.
The currency's connection here in the Gulf has a historical relationship.
Do you remember when the dollar was the strongest currency in the world?
And now you're attached when you talk about detachment.
Like marriage, when we get married.
And if you want a divorce, it's not an easy matter.
No, here.
Or married a Catholic for money.
And costs must be examined in a way
Inspect professionally and inspect.
And Kuwait did the same, dismantling twenty-five percent of its dollar currency.
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE, and Qatar
You may adjust your currency's rate.
Today you're talking about the subject, but that means you don't intend to study or think about it.
The examination, of course, varies, stated the Honorable Prime Minister.
I declare that the Qatari currency is undervalued by thirty percent.
To be in this study
What direction are you going with this issue on your own?
Kuwait also followed in her footsteps. Why don't you follow in her footsteps?
Economists say it is more profitable for countries and their people than losing.
But we
And nothing else
for these four Gulf countries to announce
Everyone believes.
And I mean those who support her personally.
You will support her.
It must be included in the study.
In itself
He made what he made from one or two countries.
Until the advent of money.
So you won't save the situation now.
Certainly, there are experts who will conduct this study.
And they will be the ones.
They are not experts, this requires a political decision.
Let's wait and not rush now, see what happens today.
People began, I mean
Certainly in a position of complicity
Honorable Deputy, the inflation rate in Qatar reached 14% in 2007 and will reach 15% next year.
He ate people's salaries, swallowed their wages, the wages of the workers here.
Salaries of residents in Qatar decline by 35 to 40 percent
We'll be back after the break to find out the extent of the increases that will be in salaries.
Many of the staff are in Qatar at least for the coming period, so stay with us.
Welcome back to "Without Borders" for this episode where we host the Deputy Prime Minister, Qatar's Minister of Energy.
"On industry, Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah spoke about the massive increase in prices."
in oil that brought tens of millions of dollars to the Gulf states and producing countries
About oil, and my question was about the upcoming increase in employees' salaries. However, before this increase, I would like to give you some important information.
Seventy-nine and eight-tenths billion reserves and two and six-tenths million production.
Tons and the report in the Kuwait Times is an economic report, Gulf revenues are one of the greatest.
The expected revenues from Saudi Arabia in 2008 are $109 billion.
And it was
One hundred and seventy last year, sixty-six this year, and fifty-seven was expected.
Kuwait 64 and Canada 54
One quarter of oil plus fifty-five billion.
It's a gas, as other reports have said, and God forbid there's envy, I mean, we don't envy the happiness of the deputy.
Iraq seventy-four billion.
One and a half trillion
In terms of spending, it was one and a half trillion dollars.
Exporting from the Gulf countries by a thousand billion means a trillion.
The dollar was diverse from imports.
U.S. investment was three hundred billion.
Nine out of ten billion
In Bahrain, it was 3%.
In 2007, in Oman, it was six and a half percent, but it will increase to seven percent. In Qatar, it was thirteen and a half percent, but it will increase to fifteen percent.
That means those living in Qatar expect the cost of living, goods, and prices to rise.
Life is expensive, prices are rising, and they are reaching high percentages and more in Qatar.
We empathize with everyone.
So the solution must be
And the solution means that it aims to control inflation.
That means you'll increase their salaries by 50%.
No, they will say you are against raising salaries.
What happens
Against the salary increase in the Cabinet.
There is a problem and the solution must be the ideal one.
It's not a temporary solution.
Okay, there's a balance between the two.
If that's the case, there's nothing.
The most important thing is to solve inflation.
And here in Qatar, there is a committee.
His Highness issued the formation.
And he places
Laying strong foundations.
To solve the problem and control inflation
What matters now is controlling inflation.
Inflation
If you don't control it
But, Mr. Deputy, now
Specializing in market research and published last February, just days ago.
Among them because of salaries.
Now you will solve the problem of inflation and let inflation eat away at those people's income.
Many of them now
Entering other countries
Raise our salaries, then solve inflation and lower them again.
I repeat what is said, which is to balance the subject.
But now
It's not a temporary solution.
Increase it to a greater extent.
Therefore, here.
To end inflation
Boredom will always exist.
Because the increase was enormous over the past year, right?
The second point is
And those who work in the private sector are not like those who work in the public sector.
The private sector is very neglected.
So this question of increase must also be looked at fairly.
I don't know where you got these notes.
We live in Qatar, sir, not Germany.
I tell you, on the contrary, today the private sector has started to pay.
that most
Among the Qataris who were working in government offices, some have moved to the private sector.
Due to high salaries.
Facing a problem
Moving to the private sector because it is more vibrant and dynamic.
And he gives good salaries.
Attached to what is called market power.
Or market power
They don't come with very high skills.
They don't come to Qatar because Qatar's salaries are low or its expenses are low.
Or they come with expenses.
Agreeing with our clear understanding
I don't predict events, nor do I say there's a raise in salaries.
No hope either.
To control inflation
Let's give him some time.
On controlling inflation.
And with God's permission, this is what the report said Qatar was in 2008.
Insha'Allah we say.
We observe that these numbers will change.
Sprinkle some on the people.
It's a professional process.
Certainly, with all professionalism and everything.
From inflation
Because spending
He often works on different projects.
Let me take some questions from the audience and I hope everyone asks a straightforward question. Abdulaziz Mohammed from Morocco, what's your question, brother Abdulaziz?
Based on the ruling families of the Gulf.
Therefore, I don't think the justification for that is the dispute between OPEC.
Secondly: The total oil revenue goes directly to the governor.
Then to the royal family, and the rest will be spent on development.
In the absence of accountability, the situation will remain as is.
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.
Hello, Brother Ahmed
I won't belabor the point. The brother referred to the regimes' systems and the issue of linking the Qatari riyal to the dollar or other Gulf currencies to the dollar but
America wants to globalize the world and compel its peoples to be loyal to it.
America's deficit has grown; Sino-American trade has reached eighty billion dollars.
The European Union is with her with sixty-eight billion dollars.
This means that all trends in global politics are against the dollar.
And we are paying the price of its consequences now as Arab countries and oil-rich Gulf states.
You'll end up with a confrontation between America.
Among the advanced countries in the world such as China, Russia, and others, it may become
Military engine
Chinese bombs, Russian bombs, Japanese bombs, and American bombs as well.
Many thanks for this clarification and information.
Your question, Muhammad.
Hello, your question.
Can you turn down the TV and ask your question?
Okay, your question is...
But from what I saw, Mr. Joy's insistence on not replying.
The topic of decoupling from the dollar because the dollar is declining.
And with God's will, you will reach the bottom.
And he is a good man.
He should not follow the style of the Arab brothers.
Thank you, Brother Mohammed. Thank you. Now we request the final intervention from Ahmed Hassan from Qatar. Your question, Ahmed.
Good evening to you as well.
Thank you and thank you for the wonderful interview.
What is required is a salary increase, God willing, things will get better.
It's true that we all face problems, not just in salaries.
Salaries are according to God's will.
Alright, tell me your question quickly.
You're going to cut your line, do you have a question?
All this is because of the high prices, the increase included all goods, all of them are exported.
I am from European countries.
We have factories and laboratories in the Arab world.
Thank you, Ahmed. Thank you. You took your time.
Now, the issue of rising prices is an important issue.
In the context of supporting the poor, the man told you to stand by the poor, my lord.
Anyone who doesn't have a billion here is considered poor.
Here for some brothers we are.
He who does not know Qatar.
For the State of Qatar, this is not true.
Today, anyone coming to Qatar can see the indicators.
What are the growth indicators in Qatar?
Highest growth indicators in the world
Where does this money go and what is it used for?
What within the framework of the response?
When the Moroccan speaks, he speaks in a way that is neither genuine nor realistic.
"What the eye doesn't see"
If he comes and sees Qatar and the massive developments taking place here.
As you see, you were right to ask.
And every person has the right.
And you have a small population, so where do you bring people from?
Do you really mean that you'll bring juices from China, for example?
No, we don't export, thank God.
The country is built on a plan and
Complete independence from the amount of money coming from oil and gas, and we all know that oil and gas will run out one day.
that the State of Qatar will be
It is considered one of the best achievements in the Arab world.
Likewise today.
Focus on
Which will have a great impact.
Beyond Oil and Gas
So you're not copying Dubai.
Every country has its own peculiarities.
In the State of Qatar, we focused on education.
About the voters
There will be a medical city where people come for treatment.
There will be a media city that will adapt.
Of course, the world today, today we must build.
Building a vision
Beyond Oil and Gas
There were fatal errors.
Unfortunately, we did not welcome this surge as it took us by surprise.
And we were not prepared for it, neither humanly, nor technically, nor even educationally.
Now it has changed after thirty years.
And better yet
Today there is a vision.
"And the vision"
And the vision
Thank you, Mr. Deputy, and I also thank our audience.
Follow us in the hope that we have provided you with
Qatar's foreign policy appears vague to many observers.
Qatar enjoys special relations.
At the same time, Qatar was dealing with Israel and still is.
Islamic Resistance Movement "Hamas"
Qatar presented.
started
The largest Arab country
That angered the regime in Egypt.
To the extent of accusing Qatar of conspiring against Egypt.
Similarly, Qatar was not far from important files.
Like Darfur, the Houthis in Yemen, and even Israeli prisoners.
Qatar's foreign policy reaches out to Gilad Shalit in a way that bothers the largest Arab states.
And what kind of power do you put in such a position?
These achievements
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani
Or write to us via our website at www.Aljazeera.net
Hello, Your Excellency
In September of 2007, to Saudi Arabia.
A visit that differs in the relationship between the two countries at least in the past two years.
Redrawing the borders
Wash what was stored.
This is what was mentioned.
In a newspaper or magazine article
What was done with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, you resumed contact, and the Saudi ambassador returned.
To Doha
Firstly, your definition was long and required many answers without your last question.
What I believe you gave him
Especially on the Saudi topic.
What is flour?
Saudi Arabia is very important to Qatar.
Between the two countries
I spoke about the silence of the island.
I spoke about a revolutionary movement.
I believe these matters have been clarified from both sides.
And we accepted the explanation.
In the State of Qatar
Dispute with Saudi Arabia
He was always limited in scope.
From perspectives
And thanks to God, this was due to the wisdom of the two leaders.
King Abdullah and His Royal Highness the Prince
In the Gulf, significantly.
More than a hundred years ago
The relationships were honorable and based on trust.
I want to clarify a misunderstanding between two parties.
This issue has been addressed and was not conditional.
In solving any issue
But there was understanding and there was sincere intent between the parties.
To resolve this pending issue
And it is not seasonal but a strategic relationship.
We hope that it doesn't just continue but evolves.
A pleasant diplomatic conversation.
Saudi Arabia withdraws its ambassador from Qatar.
I'm not used to speaking diplomatically, or I would have prevented a lot of problems.
I always say what I believe.
Therefore, it is not diplomacy, but faith, Saudi Arabia.
The island's topic under the media
Between the parties and the involvement of many countries in the middle.
Thinking that he might gain points at the expense of other countries
Or at the expense of Qatar.
Or at the expense of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
Reconciliation within the Gulf House
I mean the opposite of what was before.
It's a political agreement.
No, there was no agreement, only an agreement of love and care.
But apart from that, you can ask the island management.
Did you establish strategic relationships with Saudi Arabia to prevent what happened before?
It was originally based on a close strategy.
We can say it as one, two, three, and four.
And there must be unity.
Some differences were resolved accordingly.
Between some Arab countries and tried to reconcile other differences.
Because now, if we observe the differences in the Arab world, all differences are based on differing viewpoints.
When we have a viewpoint on a certain policy in a certain action in a certain case, and another country has a different opinion.
It is considered from two perspectives.
Some observers see that you enjoy criticizing Saudi Arabia.
For his criticism
Were you tired and decided to head in another direction, and from there moved to a bigger country, which is Egypt?
Alright, it's the same idea.
No, we don't enjoy either of those, or anything.
To deal with any party in this manner
I mean that the reasons for the conflict with Saudi Arabia are over.
Between them and I know that there is a very great understanding.
And you know that We have created
And there will be a kind of model.
But Saudi Arabia
Let me put this under two lines.
You started to collaborate with Egypt's Al-Ahram newspaper, 18th edition, last April.
The Egyptian Official Gazette
In a comprehensive investigation, she said that the extended investigations
Unveiling Hezbollah's network reveals a sabotage plan.
The three countries involved in targeting Egypt are Iran, Syria, and Qatar.
Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood
And Abu Manshar is a well-known media figure for his conspiratorial role.
Qatar is the smallest Arab country.
Conspiring against Egypt
We respect.
And what I struggled for over the years
What I'm saying isn't to manipulate anyone emotionally.
Let me finish, I'm not done yet.
We appreciate
Egyptian President
And who is the eager one?
On Arab relations.
The first point
Gaza Situation
As they say and as we acknowledge
that Qatar
Smaller size
To be part of such schemes
Because we suffered from interventions by other countries once, and I don't want to go back to that.
After the intervention of some countries in domestic affairs.
Therefore, the policy of His Highness's government
Now that they've discovered what they call a conspiracy
What I'm trying to say is that a house can be protected by its owner, Syria and Iran can defend themselves, I won't defend them.
If stability in Egypt
And why does Qatar want to change or interfere in such a matter?
And the pyramids do not bring things out of nothing.
She said that the small state of Qatar is seeking to undermine Egypt's role and its relations with Turkey and the European Union.
And you are seeking to organize a conference equivalent to the Arab Summit to steal the spotlight.
And you are using a media platform, which is Al Jazeera Channel.
Yes, please go ahead.
With Hezbollah
And we are not comfortable with that.
But I can say that we are certain.
"That what"
The principle is non-interference in such circumstances.
The arrogance of our brothers in Egypt, and that's why we blame the Egyptian officials.
The ongoing dispute with some members of the Egyptian government
But some officials have problems with
"Bima" (an
Coming for this.
Days of the sweet scent of peace and the cause of peace
which was previously held in Egypt
And then with us
Because Israel
We don't agree with her.
You don't have a problem with Idris.
And now, for the reasons of the conference, since that day.
Any Islamic conference, any Arab conference, they are sensitive to it.
This is an allergy.
Why don't you sit with them?
Let me finish.
We always hope for the best.
We discovered that this is an allergy.
Or three
The Gaza conference that was held
That Egypt does not want to hold in Qatar.
No Arabic
In Qatar, there is a summit in Kuwait, we told them.
The Palestinian people are under attack.
For more than two weeks
But we held it before any agreed-upon conference, the Kuwait conference that we were the first to attend.
People are being killed.
With procrastination
The conflict began.
And a small state cannot
I know there are some brothers in the government, and this is also an insult to Egypt, not to anyone else.
When they said that afterwards.
Okay, you're on the island.
The Israelis reported a day ago that there was a meeting to cease hostilities before any speech, for anyone or anything.
What is
My brother allowed medicine and food to be brought in during the strike that our brothers endured.
If they said the door was narrow.
We can't allow trucks to enter.
As soon as they tell us there's a deal on the other side, they should come.
Now is not the time we want to bring up Fatah or Hamas.
What concerns me is not Fatah or Hamas, but the one and a half million and six hundred thousand who are being beaten.
And those who do not have the medicine.
When we started talking about this subject and discussing the Gaza conference
Qatar's interventions in the matter affect the Egyptian regime.
Not an intervention
What we said was that Egypt will find the solution because it is the concerned region.
An official said: "We have uncovered a major plot from this."
He still hasn't told us about the plot.
We mean this officially.
He tells us that Egypt is very important.
Alright, we understand that Egypt is a large Arab country and we always say that Egypt is a big country.
That's why we ask so much of a great nation.
Because it's Egypt for us.
And you are invited to a conference where there was also provocation for them.
We weren't invited to the conference.
Reconstruction of Gaza
We coordinated and were in a unified position.
People are suffering in Gaza.
Forbidden, I know Turkey introduced things through Israel.
I would be happy to see him enter through our brothers in Egypt.
They are part of us.
And if Egypt wins or does good political work
We believe that this is in the interest of Qatar and the Arab world as a whole.
Egypt's stability is very important to us.
If he does good, that's important to us.
Let me finish your question. Your introduction took a quarter of an hour.
The situation now is that you've lost me, but
No, I'll tell you, I'll tell you now, anger.
On the officials of the Egyptian regime
We are behind the failure of the Doha summit.
The second is that they are the ones who failed the Qatar conference.
King Abdullah possessed a wisdom he desired.
And he wanted to reconcile.
That's why he intervened and didn't let some countries attend.
And I mentioned this narrative to our brothers in Saudi Arabia because we
I have no disagreement with Saudi Arabia, not even on this point.
Because, as explained, there are internal problems.
Or an official
Among high-ranking officials
A large country finds it hard to believe that a small country is doing such things.
That means there was someone there for you.
To take on any role
Darfur is part of the national security of Egypt and Sudan.
The five major countries decided.
Any country other than Qatar will be fine.
But these sensitivities will only exacerbate the situation. Why do you have to insert your noise into everything around you?
We want to solve this allergy, take an antihistamine, they should tell us what this allergy is.
Why allergies?
That some brothers from the government
They want, they have an internal failure.
They want to draw attention to a plot in Gaza Revolution.
As the English say, blame the Italians.
Whenever something happens
Not only for instructions but also for analytics.
We know what happened because
The issue must be resolved locally.
And it was not solved.
No, my priority is my country.
My top priority is to first look into the reasons that concern my country.
Then I'll see if I have enough time.
And to search for the reasons that concern my Arab nation.
Or Qatar tried to reconcile.
And thinking about any Arab issue in which she can contribute as much as she can.
Why is it provocative? Why don't you take it in good faith?
I can't fix you.
I can explain my point of view.
What are you throwing at me?
From our perspective
That sprang from his heart.
Let me finish.
When the reconciliation initiative was announced and all the presidents gathered in Kuwait, we wished for the best and welcomed it.
There are instructions.
Certainly the Egyptian official who clarified his heroism.
In a report, I believe, or a TV interview or something, I won't respond to that.
Because I have an answer for every point.
But to maintain the minimum of ties that bind us and unite Arab interests.
It is also in response to the call mentioned by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.
But what I can advise is
They strive to correct their mistakes, both internally and externally.
In politics, economics, or other fields, just as we have mistakes in politics and economics, no one is infallible.
Because they accuse Qatar of all these charges.
Are you denying the existence of a relationship between Qatar and Hezbollah?
This is a funny topic.
To distort Egypt's relations, undermine its role, and weaken its ties with Turkey and the European Union.
While we are few in number above all else.
If we can play this role
This is not correct.
There are some accusations against you personally.
Paying Shalit's money so that Qatar takes it and replaces Egypt's role in this matter.
They always accuse us of paying money, the moment we pay money and don't tell anyone that we're giving money.
But this situation
We support Egypt to resolve the same thing as we support Egypt and still do to resolve the issue between the Palestinians.
It was he who allowed the Palestinian president to stay until the issue is resolved.
We were there and among the first to support the State of Qatar.
The Palestinian Authority and institutions may remain until the conflict is resolved.
And we said:
"He is at the Arab League, but he said no, we did it because we believe that some people don't want this."
But we finished it cleverly.
Does he address his boss?
His Prime Minister
By God, I don't know about a problem.
"Some of them I know."
They decided now in the twelfth case last April exclusively with the Shorouk newspaper.
The political leadership in Egypt has decided to launch a satellite news channel to counter so-called Al Jazeera.
In a few days, everything will be over.
Are you afraid the island will become a thing of the past?
We are now living in a political adolescence.
And I also visited Saudi Arabia, where the Emir of Qatar met with the King of Saudi Arabia.
We didn't concede to them, nor did they concede.
We treated them as brothers.
A compromise for a small state in favor of a large state is Egypt.
There is one important point we need to clarify about Saudi Arabia.
Qatar's relationship with Saudi Arabia is different.
And then we talk.
Well, what's your opinion on the relationship between Qatar and Egypt?
We rely on her so much.
Let me be honest with you.
Or it's a dispute in core politics.
I hope this is not a personal issue because we have no personal issues. I've told you that we respect the Egyptian people.
If I asked you, you would tell me there are two problems: Gaza and the other one.
In this case, we were all deeply affected.
We want to solve this from a psychological perspective, that is, solve this puzzle.
Published in some newspapers
Minister of Foreign Affairs
In the presence of Prince Saud al-Faisal
We talked about everything.
But it's clear that things have gotten worse and haven't been resolved.
No, no, he wasn't listening.
I can't tell you about our relationship with Egypt.
They scold us, and it's their right as our brothers.
And we blame them as our younger brothers rightfully should.
With the big countries, we don't want to compare ourselves to any big country.
I mean, Egypt is big enough for contentment.
It's just a matter of time before the solution comes from heaven.
For us, if there is someone waiting for satisfaction.
Or wait for a way.
In Qatar
You will deal with neither father nor brother.
As a great nation, we are proud of Egypt as a great nation.
But if there was a person deceiving a person
I know Israel is doing this to us.
Similarly, the previous American policy under the previous administration was either with me or against me.
Therefore, I don't think they want to imitate Israel or America in this matter.
Even if we take their policies, they are also under pressure from third parties.
Let me finish in many cases.
We understand and know that there are some guidelines even for a large country.
What controls your policies?
We only move with one thing.
This is an internal affair for Qatar.
And whenever we can help the Arab world, we will do so.
Sources of power: Al Udeid Air Base and Al Jaber Air Base.
Can you say that this is not strength?
Our faith in God is our confidence.
Or seeing His Highness the Prince.
We don't want to ruin anyone's mood.
Let me finish my speech, we don't want to disturb anyone.
And we don't want to compete with anyone.
They say what they want, Great Qatar or otherwise.
But we have a point of view.
First, we closed the Israeli office, we shot at it.
First they said close the office, so he closed it, then they got angry and went to complain to the Americans. Can you believe these people?
Join the team, that's why we call it the Devil's Team.
What are they saying?
Americans and Europeans, these are my friends, and we know how to deal with them.
Plots
Created
This is our flaw, we reach a certain point and then...
Tell me now.
In bullet points, how will you solve the problem with Egypt?
Based on the fact that Egypt plays a significant role in the Arab world.
We believe it's important to look at him.
And I am sure that President Hosni Mubarak was cautious about that.
But some of the crew
We need to leave.
Occupying the Egyptian public opinion, government leadership, or other such nonsense.
Focus on Arab and Egyptian interests.
Are there any steps?
We are behind them, not ahead of them, because they are a great nation.
In the near future
Frankly, I can't imagine how that's going to happen.
And I know that there is a time for wisdom.
And a time will come from us.
If it were up to me.
Or from those who have it.
Large Arab interests brought them together.
We will find this issue one day.
You mean life is still going on.
That means we won't respond in the same Egyptian way you're using.
If we help someone, we'll give them an arm.
Now His Highness Sheikh
We weren't used to running.
Only on a solid basis are we ready to run for Egypt.
Standing with Egypt
Many rumors about Egyptian workers in Qatar and their impact due to this issue.
There are contracts for Egyptians working either in universities or in key positions.
You know that in this matter we are not abolishing jobs.
Because these people have nothing to do with this.
This is a market where demand changes, they cancel one and bring in another.
It's supply and demand, and there are other nationalities that have increased while some have decreased.
Okay, a quick answer.
The office was there.
We've bothered the office, so it's best we leave now.
We would ease up on her on the days when there was a campaign, all our losses in negotiations with Israel were because of this office.
That's why we closed it to let them fix it with Netanyahu.
He was a guest.
And it was our custom to invite all the ambassadors accredited to any foreign state.
That's why there wasn't an official invitation to honor Gabriela Shalev.
No, we didn't honor her before. When the relations, as they say, were good, we would have honored her. Now, it's a bit difficult.
There's no need for you to reopen the office during this period.
The office will reopen when there are no longer any reasons.
You did it.
Let it be like Egypt.
Egypt imposed this.
Let me clarify, our relationship with America is a strategic one.
In some things, and this.
What is the most important thing?
There are things in our area where we had disagreements with the previous administration in solving some cases.
Now we have high hopes for the administration, especially with the steps taken by President Obama.
We believe there is a great hope that this administration
Serious about advancing the peace process and serious about resolving the Palestinian issue.
They are our friends, and we don't deny it.
What is happening in Iran, and what is its likely impact on the Gulf and on yourself?
It is the Iranians who must decide how to resolve their issues.
Among them
In their usual ways, and I'm sure they'll overcome this crisis.
Iran's stability as mentioned by the Emir of Qatar.
It is important for our region, the Gulf region, and we share the same borders with Iran.
Certainly, we have special relations with all our neighbors, including Iran.
Because our country seeks peace and stability in this region.
And we intervene whenever a party wants to change the Doha Agreement.
And I believe that Saad Hariri said
Now it's over, and what remains is the strategic talk between the president.
Lebanese groups
How do you see?
What is your role in Yemen, or have they taken a stance?
I hear that it's known that we were for unity, and most of the Arab world was against the unity of Yemen.
We are the only Arab and Gulf country that stood with the unity of Yemen.
And in the south, we spoke with Yemen, and His Highness the Amir sent me to meet the Yemeni president twice.
And I explained to him that our goal is the stability of Yemen because Yemen is an important country in the Arabian Peninsula.
I did not respect this agreement, and I don't want to recall what each party did.
But what really affected me
Is it Qatar that took this position and then was accused of paying money to the Houthis and senior Yemeni officials?
Because we don't interfere in such matters.
He who stands for unity does not stand against it.
Another goal in the interest of Yemen, whether political, economic, or otherwise.
"We don't object to it, but frankly, I'm shocked."
Because I went more than ten times while His Highness sent me to Yemen among the Yemenis.
Unfortunately, this is a strange accusation.
Time is up, but briefly tell me these problems that occurred to you due to your pursuit of solving problems, will it change your policy of intervening in other Arab problems?
If only His Highness would listen to me, I think it's unnecessary.
There was a big show once.
Over five billion dollars at that time, if we had invested it, we would have had fifty billion dollars, better than a headache.
But I say this with conviction because the time for the Arab world may have come.
Conducted under these circumstances
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
Perhaps even unusual with Sheikh Hamad's condition.
What is the fate of the Doha agreement?
How did the Doha Miracle happen?
Giving the committee a mandate and providing it with all the support.
To discuss Lebanon after the Israeli invasion.
When there was an Arab consensus
And we went to New York, we were able to make a slightly balanced decision.
And we were striving in Doha for both parties to be eager.
We tried as much as possible not to hear her, otherwise it wouldn't be.
Because we knew the committee.
The reality on the ground and we know what the problem is after we sat with the Lebanese for long hours.
I believe it's a shared success.
But there was insistence.
I think Lebanon's problem is that the atmosphere of the region directly affects it.
Whether peaceful or non-peaceful
Lebanon was supposed to be here.
Under these conditions
And unfortunately
Externalities
I can say that the problem between Lebanese, even if there is a problem, won't be the first one.
Alright, Sheikh, I know the timing might not be right, perhaps it's too early to talk about the scenes, but
What happened when I came here?
Stop talking about commitment on the ground for now.
I wasn't even a second late.
I know exactly what was happening, even the Lebanese leaders were telling me what happened.
Not from the beginning
When I spoke with His Highness
I told him if we went to Lebanon.
I'll put forward the idea, His Highness agreed and supported it.
Where all Lebanese leaders will be present.
Because you're here in Beirut, you'll need to go to each area separately.
While they are in the same hotel and in the same place.
They met on the same plane and talked.
That's why we created this atmosphere, but our idea from the start was
And this was the most important decision the two of them had made.
Of course
And I feel that from the Arab League
Then we must be honest brokers.
Praise be to God, I think this has been proven to everyone that Qatar has made an effort.
On both sides.
To reach a mutually honorable solution.
And that there are solutions, and no one loses.
Before you move
The consultation was held at the Arab League and we found support.
What we did
And I said to him while we were there.
If we succeed in Lebanon, we'll take them to Doha.
And he recommended me.
Turning them off and taking away their mobile phones
We were able to get them there, and brothers in Syria also supported the situation.
And I told you from the beginning that the committee could do anything without Arab support.
Why did they want a solution?
I believe that the situation in Lebanon and the escalation that occurred
And this tension
Tension in Somalia, Sudan.
There are many things in the world.
And every time we put out a fire
It is in the best interest of the Arab world to avoid foreign intervention.
And we strive hard.
The forces are sent.
Even if he's a soldier.
For example, I think this is a topic.
There's a point that needs discussion.
He always said that the solution for the Lebanese file was...
Saudi-Syrian Agreement
To stop the Arabs, I mean Qatar and the Arab League.
What if what happened in Lebanon led to serious reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Syria?
We need self-examination in the Arab world.
Because of Arabic differences.
And any agreement between two Arab states.
And we tried this.
In seventy wars
When Arabs agree on a solution to an issue.
I think it's in her interest.
Saudi Arabia and Syria play a significant role in Lebanon.
Both parties must
Seize wisdom.
Arab relations are on the right track.
Because we here in the Arab world face many great challenges.
They all play in my backyard.
We have neither the strength nor the willpower.
And how can we stop playing in the square of Arab countries?
As Arabs, at least the minimum agreement.
Unfortunately, we complain.
While we were watching
Our difference as Arabs and the absence of trust among us; trust is missing between Arab countries.
and Arab countries
What is betrayal as much as it is a kind of.
Envy is a word.
This is a matter that needs the support of everyone, I mean, I think.
Alright, will you make this wish come true and actually call for an Arab summit?
We suffer when you suffer and rejoice when you rejoice.
He came in the middle of the conversation.
So is it possible for us to take a role in repairing the situation between Damascus and Riyadh even if
They are eager to find solutions, and I am confident in their wisdom.
They may reach an understanding.
Among them in many cases
There was harmony in politics, and I am sure, God willing.
That relations have become better.
It requires a step from both parties.
But I can't be sure that's what's happening now.
I'm sure if Arabs focus on resolving disputes between Arab countries and the problems of some Arab countries that I mentioned earlier.
Optimism and a sense of pride for the citizen in the presence of a general Arab awakening.
But I can't say that what happened in Lebanon...
That can be explained on the ground by an Israeli-Palestinian escalation.
There might be an American-Iranian escalation, perhaps other cases.
Will you still fear him in the coming months?
We, as Arabs
We can't just deliver food and medicine.
Electricity for the people.
We in Qatar are ready and always call for it.
More than one and a half million Palestinians are under siege.
And we do not want them to have neither weapons nor support.
They do all this.
No electricity.
And we give it to the Red Cross to deliver it to the Palestinians.
And we only provide food and medicine to Palestinians.
And our disagreements with them can continue.
And I hope that Palestinians on both sides will put the national interest first.
And leave your illusions.
The Palestinian rift is now a deep wound.
To find a solution
But they didn't commit
This is a serious matter, they must abide by the Mecca Agreement.
And they must ask to return to Mecca and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
This disagreement is resolved.
They won't benefit.
And any promises from any party
I wish there were a solution, but
Our position is known, and it has been stated to all concerned parties that we
We will not be a part of it and we will not accept being a part of any military conflict with Iran.
We have good relations with her.
But we are a sovereign state and they are a sovereign state.
Everyone is looking out for their own interests, but these interests neither harm them nor harm us.
We believe that the fate of the Gulf should be in clear agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council.
Cooperation and peaceful neighbor
But when Your Excellency says that Qatar is not a party.
Any details or clarifications
Just a sign.
No, never
Alright, I want to go back to the Lebanese file if that's okay.
Believe me, Sir, we are facing a major deadlock, but we have reached a solution in the last few hours.
There are those who linked what happened to what was announced.
The information might be disparate and unrelated, but what happened was...
What led you to this conclusion?
What happened in Istanbul, I know, if it had specific days before that.
For you know that there are negotiations.
Continue searching for a solution.
Undoubtedly, the support of the Kingdom is very important.
And changing negotiation tactics.
These negotiations led
To reach a positive outcome, we've gathered some parties from various parties.
And we started talking.
In this paper, there is an Arab and Qatari approach.
Tell me what is wrong with this paper.
And we started talking about the content, one after another.
At the last moment to overcome an obstacle that lasted until the end.
But the prince met with the parties.
And get rid of this obstacle.
And there was a solution.
We heard a word from the Emir of Qatar at the opening session in Doha.
What do you envision your role to be now?
Hear the most important thing: we stay away from the lights.
No territorial ambition.
Or even control another country or something like that because our state
Our size... We are proud of ourselves, we believe we are able to contribute to solving issues with our other brothers.
But in the Arab world, it is very important.
To have countries
We want them to do something, and it's important.
Some small countries are allowed to take this role and are supported.
In some things, it's excellent, in others good, and in some things less than good.
The last question, Your Excellency the Minister.
What is the central priority?
Is it a political priority?
Security or repairing enmity
or confront Israel
We stop playing in the Arabic court.
We fix what's wrong in the Arab countries, our problems.
Choosing an active member in Iraq
To calm things down
Locally and regionally
But if we become stubborn
Or have any hope.
Thank you, His Excellency Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani, for this meeting.
International efforts to end the ongoing war on Gaza
We start by requesting you to convene a meeting of the Council of the League of Arab States at the ministerial level.
As if you've changed your mind about
Request for an emergency Arab summit
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. First of all, I am happy, Brother Hassan, to be in this program.
Despite the humanitarian circumstances
Confronting our brothers in Gaza
Conditions require us to do a lot.
Qatar did not ignore the Arab summit.
In fact, when we went with the idea of the Arab summit before
Not only by a Security Council resolution, but also through
Unless it is trodden on or belittled
Let me put it in another sentence.
And we are being punished.
That the Arab street can no longer bear more, if we tolerate as officials in the Arab street.
You won't tolerate her.
When we were in Egypt
There were ten to eleven written approvals.
Some spoke at the meeting, and it was possible to hold a meeting.
To keep it as long as there is Arab consensus.
And I don't blame them if they had an opinion in the meeting.
And how can the problem be solved?
Because it will be solved.
This is the important issue.
Because our goal is not advertising. Our goal is to find.
So the summit wasn't ignored.
We even ask ourselves
We'll go to put pressure on the other poor side.
The previous and subsequent Security Council resolution, but let's stay on the topic of the Arab summit, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Speak clearly that the situation may call for an Arab summit with the presence of those who attend.
We found that the majority of our brothers support holding the summit.
With whom is he coming?
And I don't know what they mean by "scrutiny."
We are the only state.
The Arab nation only if we go to any nation in Asia in Latin America
Unsolved
Classified as moderate countries
And what is moderation in our eyes?
Will you abandon the Palestinian cause?
Just because we don't like them.
Are we interfering in the affairs of the Palestinians in any way?
No nation allows interference from anyone, whether good or bad.
Like Hezbollah, and who knows, maybe another movement will emerge tomorrow.
Is he asking?
Do we accept them as part of the Arab body?
As if the intention behind this is to engage in internal Arab fighting.
Alright, if we go to the Security Council.
There is no Security Council resolution.
I hope Israel finishes its mission.
Okay, the second Arab ministerial meeting I was invited to attend.
Dominated by discussions, disputes, and violent arguments
There's an important point.
This is not what matters.
When we call for a meeting
Change stations
There is no longer peace.
Are the ministers ready for that?
Because there are those who tell you that we should wait.
But we are in an Arab initiative.
Freezing peace talks with Israel.
We say we're at a party. He says we'll lose at this.
There is a greater loss than the one we have suffered now, but we have always been respectful, polite, and committed to decisions since the days of the truce.
You say that arguments are not important.
There was someone who wished Hamas would be destroyed and some of that talk.
This reflects a political stance more than it does a disagreement between two ministers.
Unfortunately, this happened.
But not everyone
I don't want to speak for others.
It is important to be men to ourselves and men to our state.
We do the politics of our countries.
Who is doing these things on his behalf?
I think
I don't think they'll respect us in the end.
Yes, are there people doing things in the name of the West?
No, and I hope I'm not accused of anything. I don't want to accuse anyone in this matter.
After the Security Council resolution
What is her agenda?
The situation began with a decision to exert Arab efforts.
And the dispute here is if Israel implements the decision immediately.
We say that there is a decision.
But Israel did not implement the resolution.
Are we ready now to go and ask for Chapter Seven? I am quite sure there will be difficulties.
What's the difference between not asking the international community and asking it?
He will be shy.
The state
Look, they did something for the Jew and the Israeli.
To take their rights.
This is the current Arab situation.
If the Arabs had not gone to the Security Council
And agree to hold a summit and make tough decisions.
And the Western countries will try to do to us
Because we are in the Arab world and there are a lot of people, and you can see how the Arab street interacts with this.
But this decision is important.
With the case of calling our leaders one after another
In the end, they said there was nothing and lied.
Okay, if we are now like Germany or what are our demands.
They don't have to pay any compensation because they carried out the attack, just say you have incorrect information.
And hundreds of thousands were killed.
This is because you are a weak Arab party.
We went as Arabs, some of us.
I worked hard on how to do it.
Introducing her.
In a way as if it were fate and the act of God.
If you send forces to Darfur, we will send forces to Darfur.
Arabs thought or that they thought about the decision of two thousand, eight hundred and sixty.
And our colleagues worked hard to issue the decision.
Issued by the Security Council
What I wanted to say was a victory or it wasn't.
And what will it lead to?
Let's assume that victory...
What will we do?
We're not supposed to collate with the rest of the resolution.
But I assure you that we will abide by the decision.
Unfortunately, the decision will be implemented even though it shouldn't be.
Even after the Israeli rejection, Israel came and agreed.
Means that we
Do you have an alternative, or better yet, are you the one calling for a ministerial meeting?
I don't think the Arab nation
In the meantime, I'm ready for any alternatives.
And I do not believe that the Arab nation is ready.
In implementing the Gaza blockade
For various political reasons
To make one group prevail over the other in Palestine instead of reconciling them.
We start by trying to make plans.
Once they held a gathering, I don't know, some European-Arab intelligence or something like that, without mentioning names.
And once they did that, I mean we participated.
In implementation
What do we need from the West?
But if we went
I want there to be sorting in this.
Of course, I'm not talking about the decision, I'm talking about...
Follow-ups because the Gaza issue started two years ago, not now.
I'll speak about the topic two years ago but specifically on the matter of the decision.
Do you have reservations about his terms?
Neither issued nor implemented
We weren't invited.
Perhaps they think we have a different viewpoint.
It was required that everyone have the same point of view.
Not everyone has to share the same opinion, but I think those who went made an effort.
And we thank them for that.
Regarding what has been happening in Gaza for two years, you have said the parties.
Giving priority to one group over another among those who participated in the siege of Gaza
Do you really agree with the statements, insinuations, or accusations that have been made here and there?
About a real Arab conspiracy behind all that is happening now in Gaza.
We are partially informed.
Let me tell you, on the subject, that we are not at all informed.
But I know.
The Palestinian conflict
It was fueled at both the Arab and international levels.
Even if there was no fuel, the difference wouldn't be significant.
And that was after the elections.
And Hamas came and seized power.
By a majority vote
We should have given them a chance and seen.
Do they want reform, or are they still revolutionaries who only know weapons and fighting?
But the day they come
At the Arab level, some of our brothers believed that these extremist movements should not reach power.
Some say there is an assault now.
Hamas, which breached the truce, or those Palestinians from Gaza who breached the truce.
Truce
The Palestinian people in Gaza remain hungry for two years.
This is good.
For reasons of Israeli security
It's clear we don't want them in power, but that doesn't matter to me in Qatar.
But what is the fault of the rest of the people?
And then who will decide?
That this or that, not every country has sovereignty in choice.
Our government
The main problem
But I'm sure it could have been solved.
If only we had worked hard, we had worked hard to ignite the conflict.
But it is clear that we were asked to allow one group to excel over the other because this group
We consider them terrorists or we consider them...
Everything that happened leads to
Even the promises they made to the party that they would grant him a decent life.
They didn't do anything for them.
We return to international and Arab efforts to put an end to what is happening, as you yourself said.
There is a Security Council resolution that Israel has rejected so far.
And there is the Egyptian Initiative which
And Egypt is in Cairo.
Those Egyptian efforts
Not at all, it's not a trick.
What is required for an important role.
Similarly, Egypt's borders are next to Israel and Palestine.
That we
And we want to stop the chaos now.
In Gaza, and we are bringing people to stop the chaos in Gaza because
This is not the path to peace.
It is necessary
That's why we always ask them to play a big role.
What was announced.
Does this mean you can't assess the initiative now?
Either to give the possibility of success or study.
I think his chances of success are slim.
If the brothers are in Egypt.
Make Palestinian perspectives more similar.
The party that should discuss the initiative is the one affected in Gaza.
Because he is the one who can say yes or no.
And this is an important point.
When Resolution 816 was adopted.
This is an Arab Palestinian problem we have.
What we want is not to hear any party.
But I really wanted it, when the Palestinian delegation left.
And when they went to the league, they asked to have someone from Gaza with them.
To show the Israelis that these are our brothers and we are with them.
This is an important point.
What we allow power to do
Our goal should be, not to build a policy
Staying in power
Sheikh now
I don't know if it's possible to discuss the Egyptian initiative since you haven't read its resources.
Do you think it is in principle appropriate for this to be a mechanism for implementing UN Resolution 1860, as some people have stated?
Balanced role
Now, not tomorrow or the day after, because
Every day that passes
There will be bloodshed for our brothers there.
Therefore, we do not want to delay or have the Israelis delay on this matter. When they finish their mission, we will put forward this initiative.
And I am sure that the brothers in Egypt know and understand this.
I want to clarify everything you said.
Now we have to solve this problem.
And not as Israel wants it.
I've been drawn to the Turkish role since the beginning of the crisis.
Do you express?
Arab vacuum
And it is indeed a wonderful position.
And it has an Arabic depth.
An Introduction to Arabic Deficiency
We know there is an Arab deficit.
Part of it was due to conflicts.
Partly because of perspective, everyone thinks their perspective is the best.
And another person thinks his viewpoint is better.
And what about conscience? How do we allow people to respect and know that there is an Arab decision?
Or they will come after us one by one.
Others will say no, it's good, we'll give them two or three more days until we call them and bring in colleagues to even things out and solve the problem.
We must rise above this and not accept it.
Hamas may be wrong, but we will engage with them.
At the Arab level
But now
At least we tell them no.
Within the framework of the required stance from Qatar, positions such as, we will return to this point later, but
Also in the field at the same time I heard.
Yesterday, Khaled Mashal, the head of the Political Bureau of the Hamas movement.
First, not everything said by Brother Khaled Meshaal, with all due respect and appreciation, is necessary.
Why don't you sit with Khalid Mash'al and talk to him as Arabs?
We'll go to him at the Arab League and tell him.
This is an important conversation.
I am from Hamas.
Imposing conditions Israel imposes conditions
Let them impose conditions, aren't they allowed to impose conditions while Israel cannot?
First, what do you think of this Arabic gift?
We don't listen to these masses. Once they told me De Gaulle didn't listen.
Completely different, first of all for the liberation of his country, de Gaulle
With or without allies, he liberated his country from the fiery occupation.
Now, what are we talking about?
Is this an Arab gift as assumed?
Presidents must represent the views of their people.
The Arab people in all those demonstrations we have witnessed.
Who can fulfill these demands from these rows.
Similarly, many who criticize Qatar in this situation
What happens when the actor and the office are still open.
They don't speak the same language.
To cut ties, we will go with all Arab countries.
To cut ties, all ties, even if someone says they have a treaty.
They just want Qatar to sacrifice itself.
That we
This is more important than the relationship.
Not only in this decision, and in this decision, and in harder decisions.
More than this decision.
We must have a unified Arab stance.
For others
No one sells one for the other for moral, material, or similar gains.
Yes, before we close this file on this subject, there are also countries that have taken individual steps.
The good subject is a different subject that has disagreements with the United States.
Our people do not need us to remind them.
Five permanent member ambassadors, arguing that these are films.
We are finished and the street now knows better.
With the high ceiling, Happiness of Sheikh
Or demanding Lebanese forces to confront the Israeli aggression and so on.
Do you think it might succeed if placed within an Arab framework?
But we call for an Arab stance that makes people respect us.
I don't think the Arab countries are ready for war.
"Nor that we provoke"
How will you unite Syria, Lebanon, and other countries when there are Arab countries that don't even talk to each other?
Must be
A shift in Arab relations.
This is the current policy among Arab states.
It's still there, but I think it's expired.
In goals
The important issue
And we know how the Lebanese structure is.
There is no doubt that Lebanon
He gave an example if his lands were returned.
Things will be different in Gaza, they are still
Surrounded on all sides
This siege
Give a different nature.
Yes, I mean here the goals of Israel, that is, the goals of the operation for Israel.
A day when someone is struck, a day when someone is punished, and a day when someone is pleased.
An example of that is what happened in Lebanon for them, not a good example.
The sample solution that became available in Lebanon.
I consider it good.
For Gaza
The problem in Gaza or Palestine is easier to solve than the problem in Lebanon.
If we disagree with each other, will we reclaim our land today or tomorrow?
Their differences over power
On the distribution of power.
This differs because they are closer to each other intellectually.
Greater than the Lebanese intellectual.
Therefore, the solution is much easier.
And herein lies the problem
His Highness Sheikh
That means we only have a few minutes if we're going to wrap this up where we left off.
And the embassy.
How can this process end?
I am a Palestinian from Gaza.
Let me tell you.
Or rejection.
And help.
It wasn't with us.
It will be an Arab failure.
In strategic terms
But on the Palestinian side
Some efforts were made, but we didn't see a full initiative.
Before, now, why
The problem is not one of initiative as much as we feel.
We help those who solve the problem without mentioning Qatar's name, as some people have issues with its mention.
Neither to hold a summit, as there is a summit in March next.
If we take the initiative, we will be better than our brothers. I don't think so.
Do not put pressure on them.
For history will not forgive us if we falter.
Through this initiative, we saw all parties where there was a meeting on the fourth day and it was postponed due to the Security Council.
We hope to make progress, God willing, and we wish that our Arab brothers would assist us as much as they can in this matter.
And we hope to push her out of the competition.
Arab Competition
They were heating it up due to their dispute with the Sudanese government at some point.
And these are our problems, yes, we fight among ourselves and disagree.
What I want is to get past this stage.
In Kuwait on the nineteenth of next month, I believe, of course, the Arab position.
As you know, as you have mentioned, and as you have explained, Your Excellency the Minister.
Are all Arab atmospheres supportive? Is it the first economic summit?
His Highness
Of course, any summit held in a brotherly country, we attend.
We don't mind attending any summit.
But without fear of becoming a political summit.
Certainly, taking into account that time imposes itself.
Too late even if it's in ten days.
Are you talking about the Palestinians after they have been defeated for twenty-five days?
Will be
What Arabs say: They couldn't agree.
We said that.
We said that.
With all due respect, this conference has been scheduled and we are committed to it.
I mean, I think that we
The Arab street is against us.
In our own way that we are taken.
Therefore
Enter in peace.
And say that all of this is guaranteed.
For this session
Thank you, audience, for watching.
Continuing coverage of the ongoing war on Gaza, goodbye.
A few days ago, we celebrated the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani
In Doha and contributed to the preparation of a draft law in particular.
She was also a member of numerous local and Arab councils in the field of childhood.
He also delivered more than seventy lectures, workshop papers, and presentations, and articles published in Arab and international journals.
Initially, let's agree on the term currently in use.
When referring to people with disabilities, we can say either "people with special needs" or "people with disabilities."
Good evening first.
Derived from human rights or the culture of human rights because people with disabilities
Because she treated people with disabilities as people first.
Human
Then his attempt to adapt to society led to his disability.
The medical concept was prevalent at that time.
Move towards the concept.
Special education and teaching appeared.
This category has become
That's why we started calling them people with disabilities.
What are the normative rules that were derived from it?
The role of the Special Rapporteur in monitoring the implementation of this document.
The pace of work accelerated until the issuance of the international convention, which was legally binding and distinguished from the rules in this regard.
This term sets a basic condition or fundamental rule.
To treat these people as humans, as individuals.
With the change in terminology as mentioned, is there a shift in the perception of this group within society?
Yes, and it is measured in some way.
This varies from region to region.
But the distinctive thing about this is...
That the Arab world is distinctive or different.
But legal trends include human rights and exist, for example, in Africa.
In Latin America, but perhaps for reasons of lack of financial resources, isn't it?
Certainly, that's what I wanted to say: culture exists, but sometimes there is a lack of resources and even a lack of political will.
Sometimes regulations, but
But unfortunately, consciousness is also a bit low, and there is no culture of human rights.
Ten percent of the world's population are disabled.
Eighty to ninety percent of people with disabilities in developed countries are of working age.
And suffers from unemployment
I mean during my visit to Darfur.
Or with mines and weapons
Males are one degree better.
Add disabilities, they will be in remote and far-flung areas.
Therefore, there are many directions of organizations working in this field and trying to raise.
Awareness and Realizing the Right to Education
Instead of establishing many religious centers.
To establish centers, rehabilitation facilities, hospitals, and schools
This is one of the things we thank God for through our work in the office.
I tried with the current organization in Qatar.
Set an agenda
Or include the agendas of these humanitarian organizations to encompass those centers.
In light of the deteriorating conditions of persons with disabilities in the world
I can't call and agree with you that there's a decline.
If there is a setback in the Arab region due to the state of disability.
When we place it in its social context within the political and economic context, we cannot expect it to be.
While they are from marginalized groups
In a country like the one I told you about, like Gaza and Darfur.
On the contrary, I cannot assert that there is no improvement in the situation.
And it has actually been implemented on Earth, and if I can give an example, I would say...
Qatar Red Crescent
We agreed that projects include
Within this strategy are people with disabilities who suffer from health problems, and there are other programs.
That we tried to include her as well.
On the ground with organizations
Kamal Kiraw is with us now from Syria. Hello.
Good evening, I am Seliman Kiraw.
Solomon Kirwa apologetically moved forward.
My best regards to you and Miss Hafsa.
First, is there an intellectual disability within the laws of the United Nations?
Intellectual blockage means that a healthy person, as a result of what has become a stressful factor, has led to an intellectual blockage.
I caused my son's disability as a result of torture and imprisonment. He suffered from mental retardation and is still receiving treatment to this day, six years later.
I know that there are around four hundred people, including children and disabled individuals, in the prison.
Is there a law in the United Nations?
In fact, I
Because they know as they know their children.
And the full meaning without making for themselves
There are values in the West.
It was agreed upon, but people...
Some of them are apostates or do not follow the wisdom of Islam, so they are not taken from them.
Many thanks, Naif Saeed from Kuwait.
We go back to our guest for comment.
On the calls, Suleiman wondered if there was any intellectual disability.
Yes, it's among the global rankings.
Regarding disabilities, of course, intellectual disability, also known as mental retardation.
Are there sensory disabilities among these, in terms of visual or hearing impairments?
Certainly, as mentioned, disability is...
Action and reaction occurring within a social context.
In the Arab world or any other region
Certainly, addressing disability has taken a long time.
Even at the United Nations level
For example, during my experience and work as a special rapporteur, one of the things I tried to address and work on
In other words, it's everyone's right.
Until they meet them.
And different aspects of rehabilitation to ensure their ability to enter schools and the workforce.
Working on vocational rehabilitation, which includes people with disabilities.
There were some improvements.
Especially after the reform
This international committee generally exists.
I also mean as a special rapporteur.
The reality of my work was positive for me even if it wasn't directly related.
Who supported this position.
I've seen that in many meetings, for example, the international convention.
For the rights of people with disabilities
Hindered by these constraints or these flaws
For example, with regard to legal capacity.
This is one of the most important points in the world of disability.
The United Nations unfortunately lagged a bit during preparation and drafting.
Regarding organizations and agencies
For example, and I'll end with this.
World governments, non-governmental organizations, member states of the United States
We sent another survey.
In United Nations organizations and agencies in various regions
Knowing the extent to which disability programs are on their agendas
If budgets are allocated with the participation of people with disabilities.
Human rights
And not just development issues
We're taking more calls. With us now is Naji Machri from Algeria. Hello, Naji.
You too
I wanted to ask my sister who exactly should be blamed.
I wanted to ask, I am physically disabled already.
Okay, we'll direct this question to Naji Machri from Algeria. Thank you very much, Ahmed.
Hello, I am Al-Halabi from Greece.
Good evening, madam. Good evening, your guest.
Healthcare, accommodation, seasonal clothing, even taking them on seasonal tourism, and this is what happens in Europe.
Is a mental patient considered disabled?
Especially those who can harm themselves or others.
All we're talking about is within the realm of unproductive discussion, thank you.
Hessa's sister mentioned the financial deficit.
In poor countries, especially in Africa, Latin America, and Asia, I demand...
Establishing an international fund to support disability and allocating one percent of the profits of every organization in the world.
This should be mandatory and without exception for any institution or company.
It will compensate for the inability of many disabled people, war victims, and so on.
Many thanks, Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
Naji Mashri was wondering and mentioned his problem that he is disabled.
At the local or national level, meaning across Algeria.
Community needs must be met from within the community.
The same rights that anyone else should get.
In other words, the right to live first, then the right to housing, the right to health, and the right to education.
That's why I'm really appealing from here, from this platform, to governments, and Arab governments in particular.
In the interest of the citizen and the individual
To ensure
Those needs and rights are within the existing agendas.
No, there is no need to create any new devices.
To meet the needs of the disabled or not, if the state.
They can and must already commit to performing.
I advise him first to return and review with the competent authorities at the government level, if possible.
Because it falls within my national scope and should remain within this scope.
The International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was mentioned, but there are many countries that have signed it but have not complied with it.
And here we have a caller's question: Why are there no laws?
It is an undeniable truth that we are in a human society, which means there are many mistakes and much that is correct.
Certainly, many agreements, and certainly many treaties, do not contain an express obligation.
Or ideal commitment by many countries that joined many such as CEDAW and others.
But there are violations and breaches, and we know.
But the question of adopting an agreement and organizing it
First, we will ensure at least the existence of awareness.
This awareness starts at the top of this pyramid with the decision-makers.
Officials, then gradually grows until it reaches the society as a whole.
Also the issue of our commitment to prepare reports and deliver them to the United Nations.
The issue of knowledge, understanding, and a high degree of consciousness.
To the reports I served as rapporteur at the United Nations
Yes, from what I've seen and pointed out, there is interest.
Therefore, there is a relative advantage to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
Therefore, I advise, encourage, and invite.
It is also important that there be
And we will listen to what Ali Obeid Al-Sanaani, the president of the Qatar Association for the Deaf and Mute, will say.
Mr. Naji Saghrna will speak about that. Welcome, Mr. Naji, and welcome, Mr. Ali, as well.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
With me is Mr. Ali Obeid Al-Sanara, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Qatari Cultural and Social Center for the Blind.
Led by H.H. Sheikhaha Hessa
Former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
As a deaf person from Qatar
And the president, in fact Sheikh Hassa, has a long history.
The international agreement you are referring to now is indeed
Very useful for all people with special needs around the world
and the Arab world in particular
And I wish as a deaf person
These countries should implement this international agreement.
That would be beneficial for people with disabilities and it is essential that
To have someone who can activate this agreement in all states.
Obaid Al-Snaney, President of the Qatar Association for the Deaf and Mute
We stop.
Here we continue our discussion after a short break. Stay with us.
Send and share your opinions on important issues related to the economy, politics, sports, and a variety of other things.
Al Jazeera Mubasher Text Messaging Service
Welcome back, and our guest today is Sheikhah Hessa Khalifa Al Thani.
International Fund to Support People with Disabilities
Disability and obliging all countries to provide funds. What do you think about this proposal?
The United Nations has a fund called the Disability Fund.
And, unfortunately, those contributions are very weak.
Mission to monitor the implementation of normative rules
When I worked there for six years, there was no real support.
Only from China and Austria
And I thank this country for its support.
The main supporter of the country is my own, Qatar.
That established the office, through which we were able to implement many activities and projects, praise be to God.
Yes, this lack of support indicates
I mean like what was raised initially and this point is always raised.
Terms of Ordinary People
So, how is taking care of people with disabilities or caring for the disabled called?
This means, if there was a realistic, genuine, and serious commitment.
Under all circumstances and in all categories
People with disabilities, refugees, displaced children, and women.
All this we may indeed carry to what is called a degree.
Equality of opportunity, participation, and equality.
There are voices that demand constantly and never feel bored or tired.
In the Islamic and Arab region, why not allocate a part, sorry.
In favor of these programs and projects
Just as he provided it to me, and I thank him for it from this platform.
Islamic Development Bank
Within the allocated budget
Non-compliance with what you told me about paying financial dues.
Does the funding allocated to assist people with disabilities include only developing countries and Arab states?
Even developed countries do not provide.
I mean the person who was before me, the Swede, yes.
Also some EU countries
And certainly, there are many countries, especially in the Arab region, that perhaps have not
Until you know about this special course.
In my case, I mean what happened.
In Sweden and China
The Arab region, unfortunately, had many promises, but unfortunately, there was only one state.
We will talk about the Arab region, but
We have more calls with us, Hamad Al-Marri from Qatar. Hamad, welcome.
Peace be upon you
And upon you too.
Hello, Dr. Sheikhah Hessa.
It was almost ten.
We noticed that this girl suffers from a psychological disability.
What is your role towards a girl who suffers like her?
With her colleagues
I mean sometimes even when we keep
Your turn with the Qatari girls' children.
Thank you very much, Hamad Al-Marri from Qatar, Karwan Behjat from Kuwait. Hello.
As they say, Sheikhah Hessa.
Why don't we leave our oil in the darkness?
We can count the disabled.
And we can help them.
We have massive financial components.
We can break down the psychological barrier between us and them.
Boosting individual morale
Spend it on this noble cause.
If we are truly believers
Thank you and appreciation to Sheikhah Hessa for all her efforts and everything she has done during her tenure as a Special Rapporteur.
With our gratitude and appreciation to her, and thanks to the State of Qatar for all it has provided to people with special needs.
Many thanks, Aisha Mohammed from Qatar.
Hello Professor Waseela.
Peace be upon you too.
And to your noble guest
Her Highness Sheikhah Hessa
My question is about prevention.
As they say, prevention is better than cure.
There is another level of disability, apart from wars and traffic accidents.
At the genetic level, it may be due to inbreeding in families.
I think it's a large percentage.
Leading to disability
Thank you very much, the honorable flag bearer from Tunisia. Now I return to our guest.
The first caller was Hamad Al-Marri, he was wondering.
Where does a girl with a mental disability go?
And to whom should he go?
In every country
Ensure the availability of services catering to all types of disabilities in the State of Qatar.
For these disabilities, whether intellectual disabilities such as we mentioned or any psychological disabilities
Schools
There was someone before.
Or I don't mean Special Education in the Ministry of Education, which is now the Supreme Council.
The respected scholar from Tunisia pointed to something very important.
Scientific papers and so on.
From programs of organizations that work on disability only, but even within campaigns.
Programs for women
All of this led to numerous campaigns and programs for reproductive health.
I talked about this aspect.
Adopts healthy strategies
Based on awareness.
Showing the danger of marrying relatives
and genetic factors
I believe it was implemented in the State of Qatar.
Habits and traditions, but it certainly takes some time.
Especially in tribal societies
But over time, they will be answered, but it is essential to have a legal commitment, in other words,
Yes, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was questioned and suggested allocating one percent of the budget of Arab states.
To help assist those with disabilities, let me first
Yes, there is a statistical estimate carried out by the World Health Organization for the whole world.
There are forty or approximately forty million disabled people.
Half of them are women.
But these numbers double.
Like studying in South Africa where they observed and proved.
Certainly, the statistics that emerged from the war in Iraq and the war in Gaza.
For every person killed, three are disabled.
And since the Arab region has become an undisputed conflict zone
Even the suggestion that Karwan Behjat offered.
One percent will not be enough.
Assisting people with disabilities in the Arab region
The issue of percentages of people with disabilities or other marginalized groups.
Honestly and sincerely, I don't think it fits.
That requires addressing their problems and needs.
Confirmation that people with disabilities are the most neglected.
Disabilities that are carried out by governments are not generally considered as such.
True, and this is linked to the culture and societal constraints at times.
When the census is taken
Concerned agencies
There is a disabled person in the house.
The only question is whether there is a disabled person or not.
The part related to this subject and through the concerned people there.
We cooperated in preparing the model.
We recommend obtaining more details.
First, specify the gender of the disabled person, male or female.
Did anyone help him or not?
In fact, even if the numbers are correct, we didn't get an accurate result.
Similarly, there must be continuous attention and care. Fatima Al-Dosari is with us from Qatar. Hello, Fatima.
"And peace be upon you,
I am a Qatari citizen and I have a disabled child.
And I thank His Highness the Ruler of our country, Sheikh Hamad.
And his wife, Sheikh Moza, on the adoption of this category
I am very proud to receive all this attention and care.
For her important role
Latifa Al-Mosaferi hello
Because they represent major disruptions in society without education, without treatment.
Thank you very much, we now have with us Naseem Al-Messaferi from Qatar.
Abdulkareem is from Jordan. Hello, Naseem.
Continue, Karim. We're listening to you.
Peace be upon you too.
God bless you, frankly, I have an intervention.
First, I am a sound engineer, and I worked in the State of Qatar for almost four years.
And we had a month of awareness of speech and hearing problems.
We held conferences, lectures, and seminars to raise awareness about hearing loss.
Now I want to talk about Jordan, I've lived there for almost three years now.
Frankly, you provide new and good services.
Frankly, you provide new services, whether they are material, non-material, or moral.
Even the Jordanian Ministry of Education, resources
Ministry of Education in public schools
And our private institutions as well.
They get good support.
Okay, Kareem, do you have a direct question? This is only due to time constraints. I apologize.
Do you have a direct question?
In Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan, they are excellent services, and I think they are outstanding.
Can you comment on viewers' questions?
A person working in this field.
Relevant to the topic.
I will also return to the issue of agreement.
Which are binding once they are ratified and acceded to.
As a duty of the state or these organizations
Because it is based on the issue of the rights of these people, regardless of
Frankly, what?
What should be done during that period for people with disabilities and why?
And you wish now if that had happened.
Of course, I wish.
I hope that this research or study will be measured and that more good research will be provided in this field.
As it turned out to me from this experience.
Six years of experience
And coordination between Arab countries as well.
They also have a role, it's not just a matter of rights, but they receive rights.
Sheikha Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani, former UN Special Rapporteur on Disability, thank you.
Now, the presenter of the program from Al-Duwair and Al-Qas channel, Lana Online, good morning Lana.
I am also pleased to welcome the bright pioneer in Umm Salal, Pioneer Ali Qasim.
Hello, Ali!
Hello %pw
Good morning
I want to open the floor for congratulations. Anyone can congratulate Lana publicly, please.
I had a five-hour open studio and a two-hour one the day before.
Congratulations to Qatar, the land, the government, and the citizens, they deserve this international achievement.
I may have the opportunity to congratulate Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.
And his heir apparent, Sheikh Tamim
Yes, of course, Lana. You are in the field of sports and one of the experts in this area, and a good follower of these lines and this field.
Because even our file
We are competitive, which means we deserve the margin of votes between us and the United States, fourteen votes for Qatar and eight for the United States.
That was because our file was rich and comprehensive and supported by many ambassadors, very well supported, for example the stadiums.
Perhaps some people were afraid, perhaps there were some %pw, like the United States.
And perhaps some countries are ready and do not need to provide venues and prepare some projects specifically for this event.
Because they are already ready.
But they were concerned about this point.
Captain Ali, as athletes, I think this is a very significant achievement for sports people.
It will have an impact on the economic, political, and health sectors, I believe.
But, as athletes
What does this achievement mean to you?
Certainly it's a great achievement especially for us, you even saw how happy the non-athletes were.
Insha'Allah, Ali, tell me about the moment the winner was announced.
I was leaving the training and we were listening to the radio station.
We were waiting for the announcement, my friend and I.
While driving and listening to the radio
The moment they announced that Qatar and...
We both screamed, and of course our skylight was open.
So my friend pulled his body off the car roof.
We were screaming, everyone was looking at us, we put on the flashlights and started celebrating on our own.
We started the celebration from the beginning.
Alhamdulillah, it was a very special day. I think all the channels focused on this event to a large extent.
Lana, of course you were involved in this event.
Especially sports channels
How did they celebrate this event and what were their reactions?
There were many media outlets and channels from all around the world.
He became a major teacher, very clear on the map, and Qatar became famous.
Sure, Ali, the presence of the player in the team is very important.
And I suppose it's a responsibility that should be taken seriously.
What's your opinion on this particular point?
Alright Ali, do they mention the required attributes to join the association?
Now there are more upcoming sports events.
We need to prepare a strong generation.
The team with fundamental principles and well-planned tactical strategies in football.
So, what are the rules and basics that a player should excel at?
I believe professionalism encompasses everything from
Harsh, continuous training and discipline
All these are basic things that help him focus all his efforts on games or training.
I believe every stage has a unique advantage.
It has a unique sensation and taste.
Talk shows and sports programs, which do you prefer, where do you find yourself?
It's amazing.
It keeps you fit and teaches you how to maintain your health through exercise, which is the important part.
Similarly, everyone watches football matches, you'll automatically love them when you enter the stadium.
Does it limit people working in the media to one side?
It does not confine you to one part.
Open field, not just football
They're all sports, but sports are great.
Ali, there are also some other important issues we would like to discuss.
You wouldn't hope to give ten years of your life to reach twenty-two thousand and two.
"Yes, haven't you wished for that?"
Certainly, now one dreams of such a thing especially as it's the World Cup, now any player
Anyone watching a World Cup match is happy, what if they were playing in the World Cup?
I hope they meet the expectations and that it's their chance.
What do you want to say as a professional player, Captain Ali? What do you want to tell them from the bottom of your heart?
We love having you with us.
As you said, I'm on vacation now, but
Her return to the leagues after a 12-year absence from the Gulf Cup championship
I received a beautiful comment from Qatar Channel and beautiful memories.
Insha'Allah, Qatar TV will transform into a university that graduates a large batch of media professionals.
Our Douri is brave, and we hope he wins many different awards.
Let's talk about an important point regarding Umm Salal Club.
How are things there? How are you? I hope you're doing well.
Sure, Alhamdulillah, frankly
Certainly yesterday, in the studio, we talked about many players.
So, I think some of the young people watching us think that you...
is needed
It is very common in the Qatari league for players to move to other clubs.
I think I have a good chance in Umm Salal, *as an exhibition*.
I was able to secure a spot in the Asian Cup with the team, praise be to God.
I'm in a very good position with the team.
How can we make sports a social issue?
And unlike Qatar, how can we make women, children, and youth interested in sports?
Connects everything, everything is a mathematical complement.
Women play a role in all fields of sports.
And expanding them, every individual, whether young or adult in this society, realizes the importance of sport.
About eleven or twelve years, until we reach this event, is enough.
We have newer generations.
The generation is growing, but we need to raise a generation aware of sports from an early age.
We get Aspire, Aspire is an active building.
Essential for the new generation of sports.
We just need to be decisive and move forward.
And football in particular.
How can we engage the audience to interact in all the different team matches?
Frankly, the lack of audience is a problem we suffer from in the Qatari league.
But the problem is attendance; the Qatar Football Association has not yet found a way to attract the public.
What method should we use to attract them to attend those football matches?
It depends on the person themselves; some people don't like to attend classes.
The media plays a crucial role, by the way, in the public's abstention.
And now they use a ticket or points system here.
No, no, the Football Federation has a plan and many steps to attract the audience.
Some clubs have ways to attract the audience, like Al-Rayyan. Al-Rayyan is a popular club and doesn't need to attract the audience.
Some clubs have %pw, and some club administrations organize some activities and events.
For the public, to motivate them, I think these are the only ways.
Players, I mean the new generation.
To love what they do and believe in their abilities, and as I said, they need not only financial support, but also moral support more than anything.
Many thanks for this wonderful meeting, God willing.
So, we'd like to hear your final thoughts on Qatar's win to host 2022, Lana, please.
I would like to reiterate that Qatar is always supportive, and
We hope that Captain Ali will say his final word that he wishes to say in this meeting.
Congratulations and I wish you further success.
Thank you, Captain and knowledgeable player. I wish you success in your sporting progress and in your life, and may God bless you.
And I love sports more.
The episode will be about young talents.
Some young people argue that these songs are popular these days; even though they have a very deep and beautiful history.
A group of young people are singing an Arabic word or English words.
We'll be discussing this today with a group of rap enthusiasts.
We will get to know them better through the interview that will bring us together directly.
Welcome to our program, dear viewers, wherever you are.
Years ago, a new style of singing dominated the Arab and Gulf scene.
I'm from the West, specifically America, which is the birthplace of rap.
Before we start talking about rap music,
There is boldness in using any word without reservation.
Anyone can rap.
Regarding writing words,
Most rappers write their own lyrics.
So, we will know all these many and crucial details from two who have deeply entered this field.
They dug a good hole.
Yousef Al-Naemi and Salman Abdullah, good morning Yousef.
Hello with us, good morning Salman.
Good morning, welcome.
I am very happy to have you with us through this program.
And of course, through the topic of rap singing.
Yusuf, how did you get into this?
We discover that rap did not exist in Qatar.
In a better way.
Speaking of the citizen.
Including fun, sadness, and political topics.
Yes, I can say that rap,
And these words, I believe, are the melodies of the artist painting a picture and the poet writing a poem.
The singer sings and the musician plays any instrument.
Do you think there is acceptance in Qatari society, in Gulf society, for this type of language?
Two thousand and ten.
Do you feel that people like buying rap music CDs?
A variety of ages.
In families, and among many people, there are those who listen more than before.
There was something like a website.
How many of you are in this band so far?
This means you can all say words, write poetry, and perform rap-style.
You could also say that the singer, the rapper
It is He who sometimes plays, writes the words,
Oh, okay!
I ask to listen and tell him that I recorded this song.
Okay, all these songs that Salman, Yusuf, anyone from the same band produced for you.
I didn't think it existed on a CD and was available in the market.
But you know, if it's just one person, it means I'll have to make the album and put it on the market myself, which is difficult from a commercial and procedural standpoint.
Well, why didn't you think? You're 25, and one hand can't clap.
It must be two, if God wills, you have twenty-five hands, God preserve you, all as young men and brothers.
You can make a CD and market this CD through more than one website on the Internet.
You have Facebook, YouTube, and local newspapers as well.
I think it contains thirteen songs.
Photography wasn't like it is today.
It's a bit old, but it was clear.
It has poor quality, not like now, but it's clear.
He has made about fifty CDs.
There's rap, I can't say there wasn't, maybe some young people know this art from ten years ago,
What is not as strong as the record and I think the distribution during this time, now is different.
Especially since there is diversity in music, a wide range of techno music genres now.
These young people and these artists who produce a collection of wonderful songs.
We would also like to talk about the concerts you participated in.
Look, the party we attended in Doha was one and the same.
It was organized by Al Sadd Club and they were very cooperative.
We sneaked in to see the audience.
We were amazed; we didn't expect such a large number.
We were also surprised that there were more families attending.
More than the youth
The organization was wonderful.
We were a bit nervous because it was the first time it happened in Doha.
We didn't expect this large attendance.
The audience reaction was fantastic.
It took a long time, so there were many songs.
Alright, let's listen to something, or words that you've composed, and the audience, especially the youth, love them.
Let's hear a few words to show the audience.
Can we listen to it directly?
Take your time.
Walk, Salim.
The problem is that it's random.
Let's listen.
I don't know.
We are here in the Doha Morning Program.
One fun thing about coming to the show in the morning.
Salman is an expert, this is his fifth year practicing rap.
Even if people don't like it.
They don't know about this.
The words are random.
Alright, for the songs you've submitted, give me some lyrics from your previous songs.
See, not all songs are random, or as they call it in English, "freestyle."
They are in sync.
But when we sing, some words are carefully chosen.
Thank you, let's see.
We say, good morning my country, good morning Dawah program.
We are live, for the audience.
To know what one two one will offer
Together from Doha's morning
The beautiful song I heard
I insisted that the boys distribute it everywhere and online.
I really appreciate that, when will you release it?
Teamwork
Everyone writes for themselves.
He won't find it easy to perform the task.
Everyone writes.
Of course, I think that every artist, whether a painter or a poet, always...
He can also write out of love for sports.
Or love of the homeland
And I'm sure you participated in the National Day.
Through beautiful songs, Qatar's youth are represented.
Doha awaits to shine in welcoming the Asian Cup, and there will be a celebration on the Corniche.
To celebrate that event
We're broadcasting these clips live.
"Welcome to the Asian Cup, Doha"
From Doha Airport until now
Let's watch this live footage together.
Reception, audience, our children, students
The Asian Cup arrived at Doha airport this morning to continue.
Preparations for hosting the massive continental event
Let's return to our guests Youssef and Salman, whom we are delighted to have with us.
They are an Arab Gulf rap group, aren't they?
Can we call it by this name?
Currently, frankly, we
They are preparing a party, but it's not confirmed.
But, you are working on a party that will be announced, God willing, by Youssef.
Insha'Allah, but this is not confirmed, we are still beginners.
You are still at the beginning of your journey. I wish you good luck, and be assured that our program will support you wholeheartedly.
Sultan, why do you gather, each one, twenty-five?
Where do you meet, and how do you put all the ideas together?
Make sure there are some shared songs.
What is needed is for someone like Salman or Yusuf or any of you to sing a complete song.
There must be cooperation among you all.
Frankly, it's difficult to get the twenty-five together in one place.
Start contacting Youssef and the others, and ask them to gather in one place.
Consider the song and the lyrics.
There's another way.
I record my share.
And continue.
So he recorded it and sent it to me.
And witness other experiments.
Collect some CDs by famous artists.
Do you benefit from their experiences and techniques?
Of course, always.
Artists who have been doing this for years and have experience in the field.
We listen to them, learn the techniques, and try to come up with a unique style.
Because if we do the same thing, with the same tone, and the same phrasing,
We're not producing anything new, we want to do something.
So we benefit a little from that.
Yes, there is also a large group of Gulf youth, in the Gulf.
In a primitive way, let's watch the report together for benefit and enjoyment, let's watch it together.
This talent that some people have is mysterious.
Using very primitive tools
Abu Ibrahim Abdullah al-Dayaal
This is one hundred and fifty km.
I am from the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
He has good experience and ability.
Identifying shallow groundwater sites
Depth exceeding one hundred meters
You know that drilling wells is very expensive.
Finding the right place to dig the well, but with the expert, can
Discover, or locate
Groundwater sites
Since ancient times
Our fathers and grandfathers
He would seek the help of experts to locate the wells.
To dig
Abu Ibrahim's techniques in searching for groundwater
These are not modern techniques.
Or analyze them in the soil in laboratories
He relies on God's grace in his work.
Underground rivers
Pomegranate seeds
Grape vines or fig branches
Now, the process of watercourse detection is applied scientifically.
To close, this is the end of the broadcast.
Come back again.
Go back
So, from here, we start marking.
And here the current ends
He needs a lot of experience and patience.
To be able to know the sensitivity of the "To" movement
I went to many places.
95% of success.
Of course, in this way and using copper bars.
There is no precise scientific explanation.
This method
What is truly surprising is the success rate of those who practice this primitive profession.
Over ninety-five percent
In the search for shallow groundwater reservoirs
Praise be to Allah, Who taught mankind that which they knew not. This report is from Saudi Arabia.
Those who have a special band and more than one album.
Whether online or by phone
Sometimes there are competitions between Gulf countries such as Qatar vs Bahrain and Qatar vs Kuwait.
They're producing a stronger song about a stronger subject.
When dealing with a problem, etc., there are many issues.
Look at me as a role model.
God wants.
At the same time, we want
Broadcast a wide range of songs
As much as possible
Let's sometimes communicate with you.
So we can keep up with the band's latest news.
But let's emphasize the band's name.
It's rap.
Let's go back to our guests at the corniche and the beautiful weather.
We are live with you through this direct link.
Wherever you are in Konrich, you receive the Asian Cup.
We are proud of them and their wonderful arts.
Deals with various social and psychological issues of youth.
But he only has two with us in the studio.
I'm sure they represent the rest.
Yusuf and Salman, welcome back.
Subscriptions sometimes end.
We tried to reach the company, but no one answered.
As a group, you need to develop yourselves, people.
Facebook and YouTube
and other similar sites
Band name
You'll find us among the top search results.
Organize and work together on this wonderful production.
You pair and match images with songs, are these personal photos?
Or you can download it from YouTube and video-hosting websites, and you can follow along.
There are some, we've done before.
It has a lot of songs.
The obstacles you face, such as the lack of a company that certifies you, no website.
You really need a place where you can all meet as a band.
What are your wishes, which you want to fulfill and repeat?
Whoever protects us.
And prepare an album for us.
I hope it becomes official.
Because we spent five years.
As a lover, no more.
Yes, we participated in some things, in some series.
We hope it improves.
And to have someone who supports us and stays with us.
Yes, Salman too, we want to know what are your wishes?
My only wish is to produce a music video.
We wish you good luck.
We hope all your songs become famous in the Middle East.
This is a very beautiful and popular art.
And bear a message, as you just said
Good luck, I wish you all the success.
Hello to the group, and we wish you success.
We'll finish with the song they produced especially for the show.
This is a CD and MP3 program.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This is KG, Mrs. Bobo with one hot track for the body.
We say, good morning my country, good morning Dawah program.
We are live, for the audience.
Remember, the show airs at 9:30. Everyone must watch.
To know what one two one will offer
Together from Doha's morning
Produced by Hasan Naama, Presented by Shima Al-Hamadi
Director Nasser Al-Mulki, and the guests are Qatar's rappers of course.
It can be repeated again and used at home.
Like a shopping cart or a trolley.
While shopping at the supermarket
When you put any item, or anything you want to buy.
A large street will appear with the contents of this item.
That was a great and feasible idea.
Just a barcode, a scanner in the cart detects the goods.
Make the purchasing process easy for the buyer.
He can get all the details on the screen.
I suppose it raises health awareness.
When the device is with you or in the cart.
Ingredients
Any warnings, side effects
Full details
Or ambition, for example, there are a number of projects, about four or five.
Dealing with traffic issues.
It addresses traffic congestion and other issues such as the parking problem, and it is very creative and beautiful.
Insha'Allah, the Children's Cultural Center
Mr. Abdullah, let's talk about the various activities that will take place in the coming days.
Yes, there are also surprises, but we'll discuss them briefly.
Ideas, I don't know if you want me to mention some of the submitted projects or
For example, for underground transport, the genius idea is
If a man leaves his house, he finds an elevator.
And unite in one point.
I assume that all viewers are enjoying the images displayed now.
Children's Creations
Yes, these are like money machines, for example.
For women, for example I have a card
Enter it, and I say I need a T-shirt.
This is, for example, some shops, or if you lose things at home, like the key.
This is what was lost, for example, the office key.
We have a fundamental goal set by Her Highness Sheikh Moza.
Her Highness
At an early age, this is of great importance in project design.
Three hundred selected children
Let us also be speakers and orators.
Yes, it was she who hosted the closing ceremony.
To showcase their programs, we really need to open the doors to interested children.
And then they can start.
We need them to be there and support us, that's our priority.
These programs and activities serve that central idea.
Various diverse skills for children
Self-improvement
Okay, do you have any collaboration with youth clubs in Qatar?
There are also scientific clubs in Qatar.
Of course, all our programs are built on the exchange of ideas.
All of this is a professional partnership.
With other specialized community service institutions in enhancing such talents
Involvement of all concerned institutions
Group photo
The Innovation Center for Girls, and the Secretariat of the Council of Ministers also played a very important role.
Yes, they played a crucial role in explaining Qatar's vision.
And training children on them.
Engaging and encouraging children, as each program is based on institutional partnerships.
According to the type of projects and institutions
And what will change it?
Our presence here in Katara gives us a strong boost and support.
And faster.
We are now, in partnership with Katara, preparing for some projects that will be ready for launch in the next two months.
Certainly, there is collaboration in many programs.
Especially when it comes to reading.
Chairman of the Supreme Council for Family Affairs
We are implementing it, especially since we are in the preparation phase.
For a promising future for all children, future generations and youth
What is your final message to the parents and children watching us now and interested in joining the center?
More than we provide them with now.
Sometimes our children come up with ideas that we shouldn't underestimate.
We must take their ideas into consideration, no matter what.
Because when we take it seriously, it will develop, at least we will encourage the child to think.
Therefore, it is important to give care and attention to children.
And the same spiritually, our problem is that most parents
Support him.
And we encourage him, we encourage the parents.
Pay more attention to a child's imagination, for the children of today are the roots of the future.
We toured the exhibition, watching their projects.
We lived the dream.
Dreams and thoughts were from a vivid imagination.
And dreams become reality. Many of them have been achieved and have become a reality.
Praise be to God, we wish our children over there success.
Our hearts are with you.
God wants.
From various ages and nationalities
Up to seventy projects
He is considered a pioneer and deserves to be implemented.
Let's talk more about this national exhibition.
And the culture center for children as well.
Mr. Abdullah, briefly tell us about the exhibition.
There was definitely a lot of activity, what do you think about it?
Children offer a new style of expressing love and loyalty to the homeland.
Was under the auspices of the Minister of Education
On the tour of the exhibition
He will grow up to be twenty or thirty.
We started training children to envision Qatar National Vision 2030 across all its three pillars.
Human development, economic development, sustainable development, environmental development
First, to know the situation of Qatar in the twenties and thirties.
Then, to start thinking about
Creative ideas and how to be creative.
I suppose they have a broad mind.
But when we help him
I suppose their minds will grow and grow.
Sir, I launched the exhibition under the slogan "Dreams of a Generation, Facts or the Nation of Tomorrow."
The slogan says "Dreams of a Generation"
It will be part of Qatar's future, Qatar's tomorrow.
We felt when we were strolling with the children, when the child says to the minister,
I want you to open my project, I invite you to visit my project for twenty and thirty.
A child thinking about the next twenty years.
They express their love for their countries in the field they are interested in.
There must be some activities, events, and competitions.
One of them won the Stars of Science award.
There were also first-prize winners from the Arab League University.
Of course, all children.
On the sidelines, there were various performances on a set schedule.
To display the projects they have done
There is a large attendance, a very unique presence.
Stars of Science
Some of the winners in the projects that participated in the exhibition.
Who won a lottery prize?
The innovative or creative forest or reserve
We also want to talk about the colored ball.
The colorful ball is also part of children's dreams and their vision for Qatar's future.
An idea for the twenty-thirties.
How can a child contribute a creative idea for twenty and thirty?
The main idea is, there's a chip in the ball.
The referee gives a colored warning.
For example, the referee can monitor the ball's movements.
Or the playing field is changed by this electronic chip.
What's in the ball?
There are creative ideas, of course, the main idea, some people might ask.
And projects
We always say, "We've reached this stage."
Developing skills and broadening horizons
Giving them an idea of how to express nationalism through these projects.
Give them confidence in how to present the project, engage with the audience, and articulate its idea.
In a field he loves, being attached to something he loves, all of this is an achievement.
Offer support, we thank him for it.
Which is now in the development stage
Also, the project was supported by the public, the committee, and some responsible individuals.
The first time, no, it was the second time, because this girl...
Pipes, channels for the audience to attend underground, and the way viewers enter need to be arranged.
A huge reserve forest
Where visitors can wander and observe the animals and mammals.
There are also sensors attached to some animals to examine their condition.
There is also the marine environment, the entry method is creative as well.
And also one of the reasons for her success is her vast and detailed imagination.
All this made her win.
Someone else talked about an underwater tourism city.
Butterfly City
A forest on Earth.
Many tourist ideas
Wow, interesting.
Perhaps this is what their minds need, at this time, perhaps in twenty or thirty years.
And it will be achieved in the future.
Three projects.
They say these are the projects we need to work on if adopted by the Science Club.
Unnecessary air-conditioning water project
Inshallah, we will see Al-Uruba newspaper.
The article states, Qatar University celebrates its graduates.
The presence of His Excellency Mr. Saad bin Ibrahim Al Mahmoud
Minister of Education and Higher Education, Secretary General of the Supreme Education Council
And Dr. Sheikhah bint Abdullah Al-Misnad, President
A new record for the university indeed.
Qatar University and the University of Calgary
There are also great news about our students.
An educational achievement. We wish them success in all fields, God willing.
He is considered one of the young actors who are making a strong entry into the Qatari drama scene.
Even, also threads and colored yarns.
The actor Abdelhamid Charshani is considered one of the actors who made themselves.
If it's not convincing,
He doesn't choose a job within Qatar.
Actor Abdelhamid Charshani is currently participating in the series "Killer Feelings" and "Tsanif" Part Two.
We're happy to have him as our guest this morning.
So that we can talk to him about his participation in these two works and about his experience in general.
Hello and good morning.
We are delighted to have you on the Doha Morning program. This is the first time I meet you, and this is your first time on Doha Morning.
with people who work hard for the program
And you, Lady Lisa.
Welcome. Before we start the conversation,
Alright, let's see.
I am a responsible and executive man.
And I enforce the laws.
The only thing I can tell you is,
Give me the best.
Listen, why are you asking me?
Go and ask them if anyone agrees that you don't have to bring the bisht.
Of course I have other questions to start with, but since we've seen this part of the series, it's a continuation of the first part.
He pointed to Khalid ibn al-Walid.
Some historians link the well-known poet Antarah ibn Shaddad to the city of Marrat.
A lot of things and information related to that city in Saudi Arabia.
For more information, we'll watch this excellent report from our colleague Abdurrahman Marshud.
Let's watch it together.
So it is certainly the testimony of people who know something about rewards or nepotism.
And as evidence of the history of this city or another.
As far as we can see from her effects, and hear from the tellers of tales and the poets.
Classic and modern, so this comes as an important record added to the city's record.
Makkah al-Mukarramah is one of the cities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Historically, it is an ancient city established in the pre-Islamic era.
There was a debate among historians about how to name it?
Some believed it was named after the renowned poet Antarah ibn Shaddad.
And the river which is named after him.
The date of its foundation is unknown.
In the Age of Ignorance.
The most famous thing in the city of Marrat is Mount Komat, which has been the subject of many proverbs.
Because it's in the city and close by.
The ruins. These are historical sites.
This view is considered one of the tourist attractions in Saudi Arabia.
The Marat Municipality has made a huge effort in
A garden on this mountain
And seats for the locals and for all in the kingdom.
It was named after the Prophet's companion Khalid ibn al-Walid (may Allah be pleased with him).
To eliminate apostates and lying Muslims.
One of its effects is the Wadi Kamit.
It's a place where water from streams gathers and is retained for a long time.
It was one of the most important sources of water in the past.
Among her works is also the Doha House of Heritage.
Marat is a city that dates back to pre-Islamic times.
It is renowned for its poets who were influenced.
With its beauty, its ruins, and its famous mountain, Comete.
Abdul Rahman longs for the Doha Morning program.
Mart City, north of Riyadh.
We return once again to our dear guests.
I hope you'll let us know and tell the viewers about those means and methods.
Initially, you stated that our infrastructure is very unique.
We opened a page for him and he registered through having a private record in our system.
The guardian's mail is under his custody.
This report contains a range of increased attention, typing speed, reading speed, and overall deviation.
The guard gets a full report.
Alright, this report will be added to the student's record.
Logs into his son's online account.
He sees his son's progress.
He can see his grades and communicate with teachers.
Let's truly enjoy the intelligence of this beautiful girl.
So we can bring most of the children in the center and send our greetings to them.
Who enrolled at this center with a teacher there?
To know her intelligence and the level she has reached, we can assess her performance at the center.
Certainly, this year.
Focus on one task and after Ramadan.
But of course this is always at the expense of other works.
In Ramadan, some people just watch TV.
He kept watching TV, while people turned their worship months into TV time.
Lessons, lessons, a series of lessons, lessons, let them do one task every two years, is that better?
Certainly.
I hope they like me in Ramadan.
But I would like to send you all my greetings.
And God willing.
And so with plays.
From drama to fashion.
A fashion show was organized in Katara Cultural Village.
Certainly, we continue with you in great love and loyalty.
And developing children's potential and skills further.
Unlike the various schools in this blessed country.
We have a model and we're talking to our guest whom we've spoken to before.
We now have Mr. Ibrahim Hussein Abdulsalam with us, and good morning.
How are you, Omania!
I'm fine.
Which grade are you in now?
Professor Ibrahim, to start, could you please introduce us to the course offered by the center?
And Omnia is an example of that.
We will also try with her the technique or method that Ms. Nesima talked about.
Do you feel there's a difference in his mind?
Do you feel that these skills and methods,
Things regarding his mental skills, or even his educational level, will change.
Scientific methods
Including initially testing the child with an international test called the TONI test before starting anything in the program.
I also start the second part of Tony's test.
We can measure the student's level or the change in the student's level through it.
Now a test or something like that will be conducted.
Omniah will work on the count and answer live on air.
Of course, Omnia doesn't know anything about the questions.
We surprised them with this thing.
Certainly, I have another question to start with.
We would like to ask you about your participation in the second part this year.
What is your contribution, can you tell us about it?
Of course, after we presented the series, we classified the first part.
Alhamdulillah, I've been lucky in many roles.
Mr. Ghanem,
Distributed roles with CEO Ashraf Shohata as well as Mr.
Tara's opportunity to produce artworks
Youth
Mr. Ghaniem nominated me this year.
Of course, each episode is different from the other.
I've played different roles in multiple episodes.
On the contrary, this is a wonderful experience. In this job, I have...
One of Kuwait's pyramids, Mr. Saad Al-Faraj.
We have representatives from Bahrain, Abdullah Malik, Ali Al-Ghrair.
Like Ali Mirza, we have
You also have a group of young actors like Abdullah Adham.
Yes, among the young actors, we have Abdullah Al-Asam.
This happened a year ago, and last year we did two works a year.
This might be why I asked you before we went on air. You've been acting since 1997.
But you've achieved nothing, or your ambition to act.
Praise be to God for everything.
Did you study acting, or was it just a hobby?
No, I consider it a hobby.
I took acting as a talent. The actor Abdulaziz Jassim adopted me at the beginning.
He is one of the actors who consider me as a son.
If you need anything, call me.
We were in every episode.
We worked hard and thank God.
Now, without Tara, a very special thanks to Mr. Abdulrahman Al-Sulaiti, a very, very special thanks to Mr. Abdulrahman.
If we compare ourselves to Kuwait. In Kuwait, there are twelve to sixteen new actors coming every year. Why?
They did it.
Certainly, thank him very much for giving so many opportunities.
But, let's say,
Let's talk about the other series, we had an idea about classifications.
We need to know about the killer feeling.
And the foot as well.
We have a sample, with us is the processor Mr. Abdulaziz Al-Muyouf Al-Tameemi.
Until these procedures are aired.
And we see how we deal with the person. Let me first say good morning to Mr. Sabhi bin Hamza, welcome.
Welcome, and peace be upon you.
So let's start with you, sir, please.
Inshallah
In the name of God.
We hold hands.
We see the nerves.
Like a painting or a message from God Almighty, glorified and sanctified be He, all the organs in your body are displayed.
From the inside and its problems
Sometimes you feel dizzy.
I have a headache and feel dizzy.
Loosen your hand, loosen it. Let your nerves relax, yes.
With this, Mr. Abdulaziz, you will discover something special about his hand, that he suffers from a particular illness.
On his left side. He has a mild inflammation in his middle ear.
Oh, the pain! What does this mean, Mr. Abdulaziz?
Ear. Do you have an ear problem?
Since I was born and since I was a child.
Do you feel pain here as well?
It's sinusitis!
Are you experiencing nasal pain and a headache here?
I have a headache here.
He has a sinus problem.
It gave him a headache between the eyes.
Weight increases without food.
His thyroid gland doesn't work properly, he always feels lazy and sluggish, and his body feels heavy.
I sleep a lot.
Either you sleep too much or you're lazy, you always feel sluggish.
You always have tonsillitis.
It exists. Look at the vibration, you notice the vibration.
He's stressed and you're not walking barefoot, this might be the last time.
Are you from Tunisia?
Wow, you mentioned things about him.
Is this message also useful for children?
The mother's finger, praise be to God, is about the size of the child's palm.
Most children are not sleeping, why?
If you carry him, he doesn't like to be carried, but people think he likes to be carried. He has gas in his belly, please.
When the mother puts her finger, by extending the finger.
In the palm of the child's hand.
The hands are parallel and the girl is parallel to them.
Let's watch her, so that every mother learns this move.
The pressure starts like this. Right and left, right and left.
This is about the child, about, about, about the child and he is cute.
Alright, in terms of discoveries, you have discoveries specific to women.
As we said, in every house, ninety percent are women. May God protect them.
First, the first warning of pottery and even the foundation.
Walking barefoot on ceramic is fine, but walking on uneven ground is dangerous.
Walk barefoot! Evidence shows that using ceramics in homes increases health problems.
Because it's cool and even.
When there was a carpet, there were problems, they suffered from asthma.
It has increased.
A woman should focus on walking barefoot on her ankles.
This is the ankle and the bone at the back, the bone.
From here, this is the foot and now down the ladder.
This is the first discovery, and the second discovery is a way to facilitate delivery.
Focus a bit with me.
In her seventh or ninth month.
Generally, just by being in the delivery month.
I mean, they don't come on the eighth, the eighth is dangerous, and the most dangerous thing is walking barefoot.
A pregnant woman should be cautious when walking barefoot.
If it had been on time.
I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan. "And strike with your foot the stone (of water), and there will gush forth from it twelve springs, and each tribe shall know its drinking place. And shade shall cover you, and the fruit you desire shall come down for you. And there is upon you a responsibility to the poor and the needy."
We know that Mary, peace be upon her, we know that her provision comes to her.
I even discussed it with scholars, and they told me: Why has the interpretation of Ibn Kathir changed?
I told them, "I give you the idea that God has placed in these sciences, and He inspires me."
The palm tree trunk is swaying towards you, when you shake the tree, what does it look like?
It's sharp as pins or claws.
When the palm tree shivers, it gives orders to the wombs, which is the area of the wombs, here in the middle.
It's the intestines. They give orders to facilitate birth and help the fetus get into position.
Elevate the fetal head or reposition it until it comes out naturally.
Praise be to God, this is one of the benefits of this fruit.
And he took the hand and began to loosen it.
Some take it as a practice, and some know it as a science.
Therefore, they are afraid to tell you, and you won't believe them.
Yes, Mr. Abdulaziz, your discoveries are important.
But I'd like to ask you one last question because time has flown by so quickly.
If someone wants to get in touch with you, anyone wants to get in touch with you, a specific email address or you.
Okay, the mobile phone number in the control room. If anyone wants to reach Mr. Abdulaziz, they can call us after the program.
Certainly, emphasize the numbers for Qatar TV so they can contact us and take this number.
I was created solely to serve people.
If we believe this faith, God will bless your work and lead people.
I have sins like everyone else, and I do everything you can imagine. I'm a normal person.
But we look for the good more than.
We always think of good.
Viewers, I hope you enjoyed this segment on reflexology and hand massage.
And also by foot.
Let's see a live demonstration on air, how this person's diseases were discovered.
And what he suffers from. I hope we can benefit from him, and if anyone wants to communicate with him, they can read through the internet.
How it will be implemented, whether in the coming days or years, or if it will include more schools.
Good morning
How do you rate this experience?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Obesity in Gulf countries has become a big problem.
So, we feared that Qatar would become the fifth country alongside them.
This program, frankly, happened to be the first lady in New York.
She visited Doha and they had a program for this.
They present it to us, we adopt it and say it's good.
Our students with students from New York, Spain, and England,
Therefore, we can observe the level of our students in Qatar among the countries of the world, and this is something we want to achieve in the future.
Because we encourage students to eat fruit.
And he stops exercising.
Of course, the fifth week is family meal with your family.
We kill two birds with one stone (a popular proverb).
In the sixth week, he tells us what he has gained from this experience. Thank God, we are at the end of the day.
We are happy with the students.
You know they are three independent schools, for boys Abu Obeida.
"Independent for girls, protective"
And with high spirits.
The family was more aware, and their siblings were enthusiastic at home and started eating this food like them.
I became a mediator of culture between the student and transmitting this culture to the home and to the family.
He will tell them, "Give me this or teach me this."
Training staff or the person who provided this information to the students,
How did you select him and how was the communication with the student established? Who initiated the communication?
Yes, there were many authorities who helped us, and God bless them.
We have brothers at the diet center who teach them about food, healthy food of course.
And learn the etiquette of eating with Lady A'isha Al-Tamimi.
How they organize, how they prioritize!
To learn about cooking, sports, or educating about the value of healthy food.
It was in the form of separate lessons, or curricula, or
How are these ideas conveyed to the students?
In various ways, some within the school,
We organized a day at the beginning of the program in the Aspire zone, where we met with all the male and female students.
This thing has nothing to do with any specific person, but we are all responsible, responsible, because these are our children.
How these students behave at first!
I initially said that the results were satisfactory.
Is the presence of three or specific grades in those schools sufficient?
Now, when you start an experiment in the world, don't start on a large scale.
It starts within a reasonable range that includes all properties; boys, girls, independents, and private.
Because it is not suitable in our culture, environment, and family circumstances, such as their acceptance of things for their children and their non-acceptance of other things.
They basically want to participate in it, and believe me, it's very important.
The student who is twelve or thirteen years old, this is the right time for him to learn about his health.
This is a struggle for many people who want to be tall, but they imagine it to be impossible.
He says: Some actresses we see in the cinema with slim body images, this is impossible, no!
We talked in detail, but there were many weeks we couldn't cover.
And we can remind them of it through the mornings of Doha.
And the fruits that contain vitamin B that you can get from fruits and vegetables.
Therefore, a person should know the benefits of fruits, and should know that if they eat them, their health will improve, and thus they will be in a good mood.
For fruits, they went to the supermarket and picked their fruits.
So, that's a point.
It is diversity, and of course they compete, each school was creative with the different ideas of its teachers.
Spirit of competition.
We give them the guidelines and everyone must innovate.
Did the teachers train the students, or do you have special staff?
I built them, I built them.
But teachers added, for example, that some schools like Abu Obeida said they would hold activities for students on Saturday.
This is a day outside school hours, they decide and approve it, Qareeh said they will hold the march.
They said they would have a healthy cooking day for the girls, but we didn't force the boys to cook healthily for themselves; girls are more skilled at this.
Also, I would like to thank Reyan Water for providing all the water free of charge to schools, Reyan Water for this.
Of course, water is healthier because it needs to cleanse its body of all these toxic substances that enter its system daily through water.
We said the third week.
That means his body is moving.
He might be playing soccer or basketball and doesn't know that this is the game I love.
True, true, exactly, and some might want another game, maybe they don't like the game set.
Welcome to our live broadcast.
Mr. Abdulaziz Al-Jaber, founder and director of the Qatar Multiple Sclerosis Association, welcome.
In it, we try as much as possible to focus on the important topics of course.
We would like to introduce and explain to our dear viewers what multiple sclerosis is.
Because this name could be embarrassing for us too.
The number of women was greater than the number of men in this.
All available treatments are now preventive.
The white blood cells that are supposed to protect us start
You kill us by striking the nerve cell.
Let me make it easy for the audience, it's like a wire.
Covered with a layer called a liner, let's say it's a nylon layer.
Of course, it generally leads to dizziness and double vision, double vision.
It also leads to problems in the digestive and respiratory systems.
In the worst cases, it leads to tetraplegia or paraplegia.
Of course, treatments.
Severe damage will occur to the body's most important functions.
Or among these diseases is one called multiple sclerosis.
Some theories say it was transmitted by a virus.
The disease is not epidemic.
What is transmitted to children.
Some consider it a disease depending on the region.
The equator, for example, was excluded from this disease.
Currently, we have some cases of this disease on the equator.
This disease still has no cure because its cause is unknown.
So far, scientists cannot find the cause of the disease, so they cannot find a cure for it.
Now the process is reversed.
They try to avoid the impact of the disease itself on the human body.
In other words, they start working from the back.
We might be a little afraid of this subject, where we can say that this disease comes suddenly.
Is there a specific group, a group you feel this illness has spread among?
Globally, it was ranked between twenty and forty.
Now, the international community for the same disease has reduced the number from twenty to fifteen.
Because he started to get young until he was forty.
But man does not recover from it.
Of course, as a society, we are open to alternative medicine and Prophetic medicine.
Yes, through the community, Multiple Sclerosis Society Qatar.
Why are we this society?
There was a large group, so I thought about forming an association for this subject.
Certainly, I'll give you some random numbers.
In Kuwait, you say there are sixteen thousand cases.
A thousand cases.
The rest of the Gulf countries range between one hundred and three hundred.
When my condition was diagnosed five to six years ago,
My number was sixty-four.
Are there any symptoms indicating that the patient is suffering from this disease?
We are certain it's a virus, so we don't want to subscribe to any one theory, that's the point.
The other point is how do I know that I own it or not.
This is very difficult.
I'm confused, oh! Mr. Abdulaziz is trying to find a specific point.
