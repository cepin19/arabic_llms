Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat was the father of Joram. Joram was the father of Uzziah.
Uzziah was the father of Jotham. Jotham was the father of Ahaz. Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh. Manasseh was the father of Amon. Amon was the father of Josiah.
And Josiah was the father of Johanan and his brethren. In those days the Jews were carried away captive to Babylon.
Then the family line continued through Jeconiah, the father of Shealtiel, who was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud. Abiud was the father of Eliakim. Eliakim was the father of Azor.
Azor was the father of Zadok. Zadok was the father of Achimaas. Achimaas was the father of Azareel.
Eliud was the father of Eleazar. Eleazar was the father of Matthan. Matthan was the father of Jacob.
Jacob was the father of Joseph. Joseph was the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Christ.
So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen generations from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen generations from the exile to Babylon to the Christ. The birth of Jesus Christ
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband, Youssef, was a pious man. He didn't want to humiliate her in public. So he planned to divorce her quietly.
But while Joseph was considering this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
You will give birth to a son. You must name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.
All this was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet,
"Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel;" (Isaiah 7:14) The name Immanuel means "God with us."
Joseph woke up and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him. He took Mary as his wife.
But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And he gave the name Jesus to the child.
Two wise women visit Jesus.
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This happened during the reign of King Herod. After the birth of Jesus, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem.
They asked, "Where is the king of the Jews born? For we saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was greatly disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
So Herod summoned the chief priests and teachers of the law and asked them where the Messiah was to be born.
"In Bethlehem in Judah," they answered. "This is what the prophet wrote:
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, yet out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times." (Micah 5:2)
Then Herod secretly called the wise men and learned from them the exact time the star had appeared.
Send them to Bethlehem. He said, "Go! Search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, bring me a report. Then I too can go and worship him."
After the wise men had listened to the king, they set out on their way. And the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, joy filled them.
The wise men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They knelt down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures. They gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their country by another road. The flight of Jesus' family into Egypt.
When the wise men had departed, Joseph had a dream. In the dream an angel of the Lord appeared to him. "Get up!" the angel said. "Take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you to return, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."
Joseph woke up. That night, he took the child and his mother Mary and left for Egypt.
So they remained there until Herod died. And this was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, saying, “Out of Egypt have I called My Son” (Jeremiah 11:1).
Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him. He became furious. He issued orders regarding Bethlehem and the surrounding area. All male children two years old and under were killed. This was in accordance with the time that the wise men had seen the star.
In this way the words of the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled, who said,
"A voice is heard in Ramah, a voice of weeping and great mourning. Rachel is weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted, because they are no more." (Jeremiah 31:15) The return of Jesus' family to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead."
So Joseph rose and took the child and his mother, Mary, to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee.
There he lived in a town called Nazareth. Thus what was spoken by the prophets about Jesus was fulfilled. They said, "He will be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Cease your sins, for the Angel of Death is near."
John is the one of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke. He said, "A voice cries out: 'In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes were made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the entire region of the Jordan.
When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John saw many Pharisees and Samaritans coming to where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Bear fruit in keeping with repentance.
Do not think that you can say to yourselves, "We have Abraham as our father." I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.
The shovel is already at the roots of the trees. All trees that do not produce good fruit will be cut down. They will be thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water for repentance, but after me comes one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
"His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire." - Jesus
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. He wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to prevent him, saying to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you. Why do you come to me?"
Jesus answered, "Let it be so now; it is right for us to do this, to fulfill all righteousness." Then John consented.
As soon as Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment the sky opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to him.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Jesus tempts
The Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness, where he was tempted by the devil.
After 40 days and 40 nights of fasting, Jesus was hungry.
The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'" (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Then Satan took Jesus to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple.
"If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down, for it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'" (Psalm 91:11-12)
Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test'" (Deuteronomy 6:16).
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain. He showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
"If you bow down and worship me," he said, "I will give you all this."
Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
Then the devil left Jesus, and angels came and attended to him. Jesus began to preach in the synagogues.
John was put in prison. And when Jesus heard of it, he withdrew into Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and made his home in Capernaum by the lake, in the region of Zebulun and Naphali.
In this way, what the prophet Isaiah said was fulfilled. He said,
"Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where the Gentiles live! Land along the Mediterranean Sea! Region east of the Jordan River!"
"For those who live in darkness will see a great light. They live in the land of deep darkness, but a light will shine on them." (Isaiah 9:1,2)
From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, "Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus chooses the first disciples.
One day Jesus was walking along the shore of Lake Galilee. There he saw two brothers. They were fishermen. One was called Simon Peter, and the other Andrew. They were casting their net into the lake.
"Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will make you fishers of men."
So they left their nets at once and followed him.
From there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. Jesus called out to them.
When they heard about him, they went out to meet him, and left their boats and their father, following Jesus. Jesus healed the sick people.
Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.
The news about him spread all over Syria. People came to him from everywhere, bringing all kinds of sick people. Some were suffering from severe pains. Others were possessed by demons. Some were trembling violently. Others were completely paralyzed. Jesus healed them all.
Large crowds followed him. Some people came from Galilee, and from the Decapolis, and from Jerusalem and Judea, and others from beyond the Jordan.
Jesus gives blessings.
Jesus saw the crowds and went up a mountain and sat down. His disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them. He said,
"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled with the kingdom of heaven."
Blessed are those who are sad, for they shall be comforted by God.
Blessed are the dreamers. They will be cast into the earth.
Blessed are those with pure hearts and minds that strive for what is right, for they shall find their true home in Him.
Blessed is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy. Mercy is for those who show mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
"Blessed are you when people ridicule you and persecute you because of me. Blessed are you when they say all kinds of evil against you because of me."
Rejoice and be glad. Your reward in heaven is great. Likewise, people harmed the prophets who lived long ago. Salt and light.
"You are the salt of the earth. But if salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot."
You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden.
Also, people do not light a lamp and put it under a bushel basket. Instead, they put it on its stand. Then it shines for everyone in the house.
"In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven. Jesus gives full meaning to the law."
Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
What I am telling you is true. Heaven and earth will pass away before the smallest letter or stroke of the Law disappears. Not the smallest letter or stroke of the Law will disappear until everything is accomplished.
Do not neglect one of the least of these commandments. And do not teach others to violate them. For if you do, you will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But practice and teach these commandments. Then you will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
This is what I tell you: You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you are not, you will surely not enter the kingdom of heaven. Murder.
"You have heard what was said to the people in times past: 'Do not murder' (Exodus 20:13). Every murderer will be subject to murder."
But this is what I say: Do not be angry with your brother. Whoever is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Again, whoever says to his brother, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell.
"Suppose you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you."
Leave your gift there before the altar. Go first and be reconciled with your brother. Then come and present your gift.
"Suppose someone has a claim against you and takes you to court. Settle the matter quickly. Do it while you are still with him on the way. If you don't, he may hand you over to the judge. The judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison."
What I'm telling you is true. You're not leaving until you pay the last penny! Bastard.
"You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit adultery.' (Exodus 20:14)
But I say to you, whoever looks at a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
"If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell.
"If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. Mark 9:43"
They said, "O Moses, indeed some of the people take their wives as mothers, and others treat their wives cruelly. And if they divorce them, they will find no harm in them, and if they keep them, they will find no benefit. So teach us what is right in this matter."
But that is what I say: Whoever divorces his wife causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. A man must not divorce his wife except for marital unfaithfulness. I tell you this under oath.
"And again, you have heard what was said to his people long ago: 'Do not break the covenant you made with the Lord. Keep the promises you swore to him.'"
But that's what I'm telling you. Don't make any such promise at all. Don't make it in the name of heaven. It's God's throne.
Do not make it in the name of the Earth, for it is the footstool of God's feet. Nor make it in the name of Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
Do not swear by your heads, you cannot make a single hair white or black.
Just let "yes" mean "yes." And let "no" mean "no." Anything more than this is from the devil. Be kind to others.
"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth' (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)"
But this is what I say: Do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.
If anyone takes you to court and wants your shirt, let him have your coat as well.
Suppose someone forces you to walk one mile. Go two miles with him.
"Give to those who ask you. Do not hate those who use you. Love your enemies."
"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'"
But that is what I say: Love your enemies. Pray for those who mistreat you.
"Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect. "He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.
"If you only love those who love you, what reward do you get? Even tax collectors do that."
If you only greet your own people, what more are you doing than others? Even unbelievers do that.
Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Giving to the poor
"Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them; otherwise you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven. Thus, when you give to the needy, do not publicize it as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, so that they may be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you."
"When you give, do not announce it with words or be ostentatious with your wealth. Do not be like those who take disbelievers as allies instead of believers. If anyone does that, he is not of you, and he is a wrongdoer. A believer should not take a disbeliever as a close friend, even if the disbeliever is related to him in the religion. Say, 'The right guidance is from Allah.' If they come to you persistently, do not be persistent with them. Have you known that they are disbelievers and that Allah will replace them with others? Do not think that Allah is unaware of the actions of the wrongdoers. He is only giving them respite until the Day when eyes will stare in horror. You cannot escape in the land or distance yourself from the disobedient."
"When you give to the poor, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing."
Then your charity will be in secret. Your Father who sees in secret will reward you. He sees what you do in secret. Prayer
"When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites who love to be seen by people, making their prayers a spectacle. They stand up from a sitting position just to be noticed. They are told to stand, but they only sit for
"When you pray, enter the mosques of God, for God delights in the righteous. God is near, responsive. He knows what the hearts conceal."
"When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites who say to their brothers, who were turning away from them in secret, 'I am with you.' They only say this to be seen by people. And do not be like those who say, 'We are praying.' Tell them, 'Fear God. Indeed, God is severe in punishment.'"
Do not be like them. Your father knows what you need even before you ask him.
"This is how you should pray: 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who have wronged us.
"Save us from falling into sin when we are tempted. And protect us from the accursed Satan."
Forgive people their sins, and your Heavenly Father will forgive you.
But if you do not forgive people their offenses, neither will your Father forgive your offenses. - Fasting
"When you fast, do not be like the hypocrites, who are false to themselves. They proclaim their fasting loudly, so do not be like them. But say, 'We intend to fast,' and when you are forbidden, 'We refrain.' That is better for you. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful."
"But if you keep silent, anoint your heads with oil and wash your faces."
Then none will know that you are fasting except your Lord, Who is in the heavens. Your Lord is not unaware of what you do. As for the first group, they do not know that you have become among them in the morning.
"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
Your heart will be where your treasure is.
"The eye is like a lamp for the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light."
But suppose your eyes are weak. Then your whole body will be dark. And if the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. He will hate one and love the other. Or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not be anxious.
I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you shall eat or what you shall drink, nor about your body, what you shall put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
"Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?"
Can you add an hour to your life by worrying?
"Why do you worry about your clothes? Look at how the wild flowers grow. They do not work or spin clothes.
But that is what I tell you. Not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these.
"If God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?"
So do not worry, saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?’
People who don't believe in God chase after all those things. Your Father in heaven knows you need them.
"But seek first the kingdom of God, and all these things will be added to you."
"Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."
Be fair in your judgments of others.
Do not judge people, lest you be judged.
You will be judged by the same standard by which you judge others. You will be measured by the same measure with which you measure others.
You see a splinter of feather in your friend's eye, but you don't care about the beam in your own eye.
How do you tell your friend: "Let me take this piece of wood out of your eye," while there's a piece of wood in your own eye?
You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye. Then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your friend's eye.
"Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Ask, seek, knock."
Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.
To everyone who asks, it will be given. To everyone who searches, it will be found. To everyone who knocks, it will be opened.
"If your son asks for bread, which one of you would give him a stone?"
Or were you to ask them to give you a fish, who among you would stand up to him with a miracle?
Even if you are evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!
"In everything, do to others what you would want them to do to you; this is the Law and the Prophets."
Enter the kingdom of God through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction and hell. Many enter through that gate.
But the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life. Few find it. A tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
You can tell what they really are by what they do. "Do people gather grapes from thorns? Do they pluck figs from thistles?"
In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
A tree is known by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name? Did we not cast out demons in your name? Did we not do many miracles in your name?'
Then I will inform them, "I did not know you." Say, "Indeed, I am to you a messenger from Allah, and [even] if you disbelieve, [O Muhammad], it is to Allah that what is in the heavens and earth belongs, and Allah is All-Knowing over what you do."
"Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock."
The sky rains. The waters rise. The winds blow and strike that house. But it does not fall. It is built on the rock.
But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.
The sky rains. The water rises. The wind blows and hits that house. And it falls with a loud noise.
Jesus finished saying all these things. The crowds were amazed at his teaching.
He taught as one having authority, not as the scribes.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain. Large crowds followed him.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus, knelt down, and said, "Lord, if you choose, you can make me clean."
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man, saying, "I want to do this. Be 'clean'!" Immediately the man was cleansed of his leprosy.
Then Jesus said to him, "Do not tell anyone. Go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." The faith of a Roman centurion.
When Jesus came to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached him and pleaded for his help.
"Oh Lord," he said, "my servant is bedridden and cannot move. He is in great distress."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
Then the centurion said, "Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof. But only speak a word, and my servant will be healed.
I myself am a man under authority, and I have soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, "Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with faith like this."
"I tell you, many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven."
But whoever says, 'I am in his kingdom,' will be cast out into the darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Then Jesus said to the Roman soldiers, "Go, and it will be as you have believed." And his servant was healed at that very moment. Jesus healed many.
When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's wife's mother lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to serve him.
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
He did it to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah said: "He bore our sins on his shoulders—sicknesses that should have been ours." (Isaiah 53:4) Following Jesus is costly.
Seeing the crowd, Jesus gave orders to cross to the other side of Lake Galilee.
Then one of the scribes came forward and said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
Another of his followers said to him, "Lord, first let me go and bury my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me. Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus silences the storm.
Jesus got into a boat. His disciples followed him.
Suddenly a fierce storm swept over the lake. The waves crashed against the boat. But Jesus was asleep.
So the disciples woke him up, saying, "Master, save us! We are perishing!"
And he said to him, "O you of little faith! Why do doubts rise in your heart?" Then Jesus got up and commanded the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
So the disciples were amazed and asked, "Who is this man? Even the winds and the sea obey him!" Jesus heals two men who were possessed by demons.
Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake in the region of the Gerasenes. Two men possessed by demons met him. They had come out of the tombs. The men were so violent that no one could pass by.
"Son of God, what do you want with us?" they cried. "Have you come to punish us before our time of judgment?"
Not far away, there was a large herd of pigs eating.
The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us to the pigs in the field."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" And the unclean spirits came out of the men and entered into the swine, and the herd ran violently down the steep place into the sea, about two thousand of them, and were drowned in the sea.
Those who were tending the pigs fled and told it in the city and in the country. The people went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus and found the men from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at his feet, clothed and in their right mind; and they were afraid.
Then he went out from the city to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they begged him to leave the mountain where they were, because their city was near.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk.
Jesus got into a boat and crossed the water to the other side of the wilderness, arriving at his hometown.
Some men came, carrying a paralyzed man on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
Then some of the religious scholars said, "He is saying something very corrupting!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking and said, "Why are you thinking these evil thoughts?"
Is it easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven," or to say, "Get up and walk"?
I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he spoke to the man who couldn't walk. "Get up," he said. "Take your mat and go to your home."
The man stood up and went home.
When the crowd saw this, they were amazed. They praised God for giving such authority to men. Jesus chooses when.
Jesus went on from there and saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he told him. And Matthew got up and followed him.
Then Jesus entered the house of Matthew and sat down to eat with him. And many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples to eat.
When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this and said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but those who are sick."
Go and learn what this means: "I desire mercy, not sacrifice" (Hosea 6:6). "I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance." They asked Jesus about fasting.
One day the disciples of John came and asked Jesus, "We and the Pharisees fast, why don't your disciples fast?"
Jesus answered, "Can the wedding guests mourn while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them and then they will fast."
People do not patch an old garment with new cloth. The new patch would pull away from the old cloth, making the tear worse.
"New wine is not poured into old wineskins, otherwise the skins will burst, the wine will spill, and the skins will be ruined. No, new wine is poured into new wineskins, and both are preserved." A dead girl and a suffering woman.
As Jesus was saying these things, a synagogue leader came and bowed down before him, saying, "My daughter has just died. But come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
Jesus rose and went with him. His disciples also went with him.
Suddenly, a woman came up behind Jesus. She had been suffering from a discharge of blood for twelve years. She touched the hem of his garment.
I thought: "All I have to do is touch his clothes. Then I will be healed."
Jesus turned and saw her, and said, "Daughter, your faith has made you well." And the woman was made whole from that hour.
When Jesus entered the house of the ruler, He saw the flute players and the mourners there. He saw the crowd in an uproar.
He said, "Go. The girl did not die. She is sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After the crowd had been sent away, Jesus went in and took the girl by the hand, and she got up.
The news about what Jesus had done spread all over that region. Jesus heals two blind men.
And Jesus went from there, and two blind men followed him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus entered, the blind men came to him, saying, "Do you believe that you can do this?" They said, "Yes, Teacher."
Then he touched their eyes and said, "Your faith will be as you have believed."
They could see again. Jesus sternly warned them, "Make sure that no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They talked about it everywhere in that area.
As they were going out, another man who was possessed by a demon was brought to Jesus. He was blind and mute.
When the demon was cast out, the man spoke. The crowd was amazed and said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel before."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the power of the prince of the demons." There were only a few workers.
Jesus went about all the cities and villages. He taught in their synagogues. He preached the gospel of the kingdom. And he healed every sickness and every weakness.
When he saw the crowd, a deep pity seized him for them. They were beaten and scattered, helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few."
"So ask the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest."
Jesus sends out the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to join him. He gave them authority to cast out evil spirits and heal every disease.
Here are the names of the twelve disciples. The first is Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then James the son of Zebedee and his brother John.
Then Philip, Bartholomew, John the Baptist, Thomas, Matthew the tax collector, and two others, James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus.
The last two are Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas is the one who will later betray Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent out the twelve and instructed them, "Do not go to Gentile regions," he said. "Do not enter any Samaritan town."
But go to the Children of Israel, for they are like a lost flock.
Go and tell people that the kingdom of heaven is near.
Heal the sick. Raise the dead. Cleanse the lepers. Cast out demons. For free you received, give for free.
Do not carry gold, or silver, or copper in your belts.
Don't take a suitcase for the trip. Don't take extra clothes or sandals or walking sticks. The worker should be given what he needs.
When you enter a town or village, look for someone willing to welcome you. Stay in that person's home until you leave.
When you enter the house, greet those who live there.
If that house welcomes you, give it your blessing of peace. Otherwise, do not bless it.
"Some people may not welcome you or listen to your words. If they don't, shake the dust off your feet as you leave that house or town."
What I am about to tell you is true. On the Day of Judgment, it will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town.
I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as prudent as serpents and as innocent as doves.
Beware! The men will bring you before the local courts. They will whip you in their temples.
They will hand you over to the governors and kings because of me. You will bear witness against them and the Gentiles.
But when they arrest you, do not worry about what you are to say or how you are to say it. For what you are to say will be given to you in that hour.
It is not you who will be speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.
"Brothers will betray brothers to death. Fathers will betray sons, and children will rise against parents and cause their death.
Everyone will hate you because of me. But whoever stands firm to the end will be saved.
"When people attack you in one place, flee to another. What I am about to tell you is true. You will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
A student is not better than his teacher. A slave is not better than his master.
It is enough for the student to be like his teacher. And it is enough for the slave to be like his master. If the head of the house has been called Uzziah, what can others who live there expect?
"So do not be afraid of your enemies. For there is nothing hidden that will not be made manifest, and nothing secret that will not be known.
What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light. What is whispered in your ear, shout from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Aren't two doves sold for just one dinar? Yet not one of them falls to the ground without your father knowing.
He even counts every hair on your head!
So do not fear. You are worth more than many sparrows.
"What about the person who says in front of others that he knows me? I will also say in front of my Father in heaven that I know him."
But what about someone who says in front of others that he doesn't know me? I will say in front of my Father in heaven that I don't know him.
Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
I have come to turn "sons against their fathers, and daughters against their mothers, and daughters-in-law against their mothers-in-law."
"A man's enemies are the members of his own household." (Micah 7:6)
"Whoever loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. Whoever loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me."
"And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me."
If anyone finds his life, he will lose it. And if anyone loses his life because of me, he will find it.
"Whoever welcomes you welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me."
If someone receives a prophet as a prophet, they will receive the reward of a prophet. And if someone receives a righteous person as a righteous person, they will receive the reward of a righteous person.
"If anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little children who follow me, truly I tell you, they will certainly be rewarded."
Jesus and John
Jesus had finished teaching his twelve disciples. Then he began to teach and preach in the villages of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Jesus was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked Jesus, "Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect another?"
Jesus answered, "Go to John and tell him what you hear and see.
The blind receive sight. The lame walk. The lepers are cleansed. The deaf hear. The dead are raised. And the poor have good news preached to them.
"Blessed are those who do not forbid what I have revealed to you."
As John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John. He said, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
So what did you go out to see? A man wearing fine clothes? No. People who wear fine clothes are in the palaces of kings.
So what did you go to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
He who was written about in the book says: "I will send my messenger before you, who will prepare your way before you, and lead you to the believers" (Malachi 3:1).
What I am about to tell you is true. No one greater than John the Baptist has ever been born, but the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with power, and forceful people lay hold of it.
All the prophets and scriptures foretold until John came.
If you are willing to accept him, John is Elijah who was supposed to come.
"He who has ears, let him hear."
"What shall I say of our people today? They are like children sitting in the markets and calling out to people. They say,
"We played the flute for you. But you did not dance. We sang a funeral song. But you did not mourn."
When John came, he neither ate nor drank as you do. And people say, "He is mad."
But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank, and they say, 'Look at this man! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' Yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds." Cities full of sin.
Jesus began to reproach the cities where most of his miracles had been done, because they did not repent of their sins. He said,
"How terrible it will be for you, Chorazin! How terrible it will be for you, Bethsaida! If the miracles that were performed in your midst had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes."
But I tell you this: On the Day of Judgment, it will be easier for the land and sea creatures than for you.
"And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to hell. For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until today."
But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.
At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children."
Yes, Father. This is what I wanted.
"My Father has given me all things. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Be My servants and learn about Me; I am gentle and do not transgress. You will find comfort for your hearts.
My service is easy, and my burden is light.
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and his disciples began to pick some heads of grain, and eat them.
The Pharisees saw this and said to Jesus, "Look, your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath."
Jesus said, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and his men?"
So he entered the house of God. He and his men ate the sacred bread, which was not permitted to be eaten by anyone except the priests.
Haven't you read the law? It tells us how the priests in the temple are to work every Sabbath day. But they are not considered guilty.
I tell you, there is someone here who is greater than the temple.
The Bible says, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice" (Hosea 6:6). You do not know what these words mean. If you did, you would not bring charges against the innocent.
"The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
Then Jesus went out from there and entered the synagogue.
There was a man with a withered and paralyzed hand. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They said to him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
Man is of greater value than sheep! Therefore, the law allows us to do good on the Sabbath.
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and it was completely restored, just like the other one.
But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus, the chosen servant of God.
Jesus knew all about the Pharisees' plans. So he left that place. Many followed Jesus, and he healed all their sick.
But he warned them not to tell who he was.
To fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah. And he says,
"This is my servant. I have chosen him. He is the one I love. I am very pleased with him. I will put my spirit upon him. He will proclaim to the nations that everything will be alright."
He will not argue or shout. No one will hear his voice in the streets.
He won't break a bent branch. He won't extinguish a fiercely burning flame. He will fix everything.
"The nations will put their hope in him" (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebul
A man possessed by demons was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Then the man was able to speak and see.
So the people were amazed, and said, "Is this the Son of David?"
The Pharisees heard this and said, "This man drives out demons only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons."
Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand."
If a devil drives out a devil, he is fighting himself. How then can his kingdom stand?
She says I cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. But by whose power do they cast them out? Therefore, let them be your judges.
But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you.
Or think about this. How can you enter a strong man's house and steal what he has? You must first bind him. Then you can steal his house.
"He who is not with me is against me. And he who does not gather the sheep with me scatters them."
So this is what I say to you: Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come."
"A good tree bears good fruit, and a bad tree bears bad fruit. A tree is known by its fruit."
"O brood of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak any good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks."
A good person says good things, and these things come from the good in their heart. A bad person says bad things, and these things come from the evil in their heart.
But that is what I say. On the day of reckoning, people will be accountable for every idle word they have spoken.
"By your words you will be acquitted or condemned." The mark of a miracle, Yunus
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus and said, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
He said, "The disbelievers ask you to show them a sign! Say, 'I will show you a sign greater than Jonah's sign.'
Jonah was in the belly of a great fish for three days and three nights. So will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
"The men of Nineveh will stand in judgment with the people of this time. And the Ninevites will prove that these people are guilty. For the men of Nineveh repented at the preaching of Jonah. And now there is One here who is greater than Jonah.
"The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn them: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
What happens when a jinn leaves a human? It looks around on earth and finds nothing, so it returns to him.
Then he says, "I will return to the house I left." When he gets there, he finds the house empty. The house has been cleaned and tidied.
Then the devil goes away and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself. They come in and live there, and that man's condition becomes worse than before. That is how it will be with this wicked generation as well. Jesus' mother and brothers
While Jesus was still speaking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.
Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside and want to speak with you."
Then Jesus answered and said, "Who is My mother and who are My brothers?"
Jesus pointed to his disciples and said, "Here is my mother! Here are my brothers!"
"Whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother or sister or mother."
The Farmer's Tale
At that hour Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea of Galilee.
A large crowd gathered around him. He got into a boat. He sat in it. And all the people stood on the shore.
Then he told them many things using stories. He said, "A farmer went out to plant his seeds.
He scattered the seeds on the ground. Some fell on the path. Birds came and ate them.
Some seeds fell on rocky places, where there was little soil. The plants grew quickly, because the soil was not deep.
When the sun rose, it scorched the plants. They withered because they had no roots.
Other seeds fell among the thorns. The thorns grew up and choked the plants.
Other seeds fell on good soil. They produced a crop yielding 100, 60, or 30 times more than was sown.
"He who has ears, let him hear."
The students came to him. They asked, "Why do you use stories when you talk to people?"
He replied, "You have been given the key to the knowledge of the heavenly mysteries, and this has not been given to anyone in the world."
Everyone will be given more of that kind of knowledge. In fact, they will have plenty. And if anyone does not have that kind of knowledge, even what little they have will be taken away from them.
This is why I use stories when I talk to people. I say, "They look, but they don't really see. They listen, but they don't really hear or understand."
In it, the words of the prophet Isaiah are fulfilled. He said, "You will hear and not understand. You will look and not know."
"They have made their hearts callous, so that they cannot hear with their ears, and have closed their eyes; otherwise they would see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn, and I would heal them." (Isaiah 6:9-10)
"But blessed are your eyes, for they see. Blessed are your ears, for they hear."
What I am going to tell you is true. Many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you see, but they didn't see it. They wanted to hear what you hear, but they didn't hear it.
Listen! Here is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message about the kingdom but do not understand it. Then comes the devil. He steals what was sown in their hearts. These people are like the seed sown on the path.
Others received the seed that fell on rocky places. These are the ones who hear the message and accept it with joy immediately.
But they have no roots. Therefore they do not last long. They quickly fall away from the faith when problems or suffering come because of the message.
Others received the seed that fell among the thorns. These are the ones who hear the message, but then the worries of life and the deceitful riches choke the word, and it bears no fruit.
But others received the seed that fell on good soil. These are the ones who hear the message and understand it. They produce a harvest 100, 60, or 30 times more than what the farmer planted. The parable of the weeds.
Jesus told the crowd another parable: "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed seed in his field.
But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. The enemy planted weeds among the wheat and then left.
The wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
The servant of the lord came to him. They said, "My lord, did you not sow good seed in your field? Then where did the weeds come from?"
" 'An enemy did it,' he replied. The servants said, 'Shall we go and weed it?'"
" 'No,' the owner replied. 'While you're weeding, you might pull up the wheat with the weeds."
Let the two trees grow together until the harvest. Then I will tell the workers what to do. These are the words I will say to them: "First, gather the weeds. Bind them in bundles to be burned. Then gather the wheat. Bring it to my barn." "Parables of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast"
Jesus told another parable to the crowds, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. A man took the seed and sowed it in his field.
It is the smallest of your seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of all garden plants and becomes a tree. Birds come and nest in its branches.
Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour until it was all leavened."
Jesus spoke about all these things to the crowds using parables. He did not say anything to them without telling a story.
So the prophet's word was fulfilled: "I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter hidden things, things from of old" (Psalm 78:2). Jesus explains the story of the weeds.
Then Jesus left the crowd and went home. And his disciples came to him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the weed in the field."
He answered, "The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.
The field is the world. The good seed represents the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the devil.
An enemy sown by the devil. The harvest is Judgment Day. And the workers are the angels.
Weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire. That will be the case on Judgment Day.
The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will remove from his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.
They will be thrown into the blazing Paradise. Therein they will weep over each other, and they will lick their fingers.
Then the people of God will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears, let them hear. The parable of the hidden treasures and the pearl.
"The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid again; and in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field."
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of a precious pearl.
He found one of great value. So he went and sold all he had and bought the pearl. The parable of the pearl.
And again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net. It was cast into the lake. It caught all kinds of fish.
When the fishermen were full of it, they dragged it to the shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish in baskets. But they threw away the bad fish.
Thus will be the Day of Reckoning. The angels will come. They will separate those who did wrong from those who did right.
They will cast the criminals into Hell, layer upon layer, where they will pass by one another, full of anger. They will say, "If only we could be returned [to life] and not deny the signs of our Lord and be among the believers."
"Do you understand all these things?" asked Jesus. "Yes," they answered.
He said to them, "Every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old." A prophet without honor.
Jesus finished telling these stories. Then he left.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth. There he began to teach the people in their synagogue, and they were amazed. "Where did this man get this wisdom? And where does he get this power to do miracles?" they asked.
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother called Mary? Aren't his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
Aren't all his sisters with us? Where did this man get all these things?
They were not at all pleased with him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, and among his own relatives, and in his own house."
Few miracles were done there, because they had no faith.
John the Baptist's head is cut off.
In those days Herod the tetrarch heard the report about Jesus.
He said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles."
Herod arrested John. He bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.
John was telling Herod, "It is illegal for you to be with her."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he feared the people, for they believed John to be a prophet.
At Herod's birthday feast, Herodias' daughter danced before Herod and his guests. And Herod was greatly pleased.
He promised her that he would give her what she asked for.
Her mother told her what to say. So the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very angry. However, he remembered a promise he had made and some dinner guests. So he asked one of his men to give her what she had requested.
Herod cut off John's head in prison.
His head was brought on a large platter and given to the girl. She then carried it to her mother.
John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus feeds five thousand.
When Jesus heard what had happened to John, he wanted to be alone. So he went off in a boat to a solitary place. But when the crowds heard this, they followed him on foot from the villages.
When Jesus came to the shore, he saw a large crowd. He felt great compassion for them. He healed their sick.
As evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, "This is a remote place, and it's already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves."
Jesus answered, "They need not go away; you give them something to eat."
"We have only five loaves of bread and two fish," they answered.
"Bring them to me," he said.
Then Jesus directed the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples, and they distributed them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples picked up twelve baskets of broken pieces.
The number of men who ate was about 5000. The women and children ate also. Jesus walked on water.
When Jesus heard this, he told his disciples to get into the boat and go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee. Then he dismissed the crowd.
After sending them, he went up alone to a mountain to pray, and when evening came, he was there alone.
The boat was already far from land. It was being rocked by the waves because the wind was blowing against it.
Early in the morning, Jesus came to the disciples. He walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the water and were terrified. They said, "It's a ghost!" and cried out in fear.
Jesus immediately said to them, "Take heart! It is I. Do not be afraid."
"Lord, are you?" asked Peter. "If it is you, command me to come to you on the water."
"Come," Jesus said. So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he became afraid and began to sink. He cried out, "Lord, save me!"
And Jesus reached out his hand and grabbed him. He said to him, "O you of little faith! Why did you doubt?"
When they boarded the boat, the winds calmed.
Then those in the boat worshiped Jesus, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God."
They crossed the lake and reached Galilee.
The men who lived there recognized Jesus. So they sent messengers everywhere in the vicinity. And people brought all their sick to Jesus.
They begged him to allow the sick to touch the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.
What makes people "dirty"?
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came from Jerusalem to see Jesus. They asked,
"Why don't your students obey what the elders teach them? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!"
Jesus answered them, "Why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?"
God said: "Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land that the Lord your God is giving you" (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16). He also said: "Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death" (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9).
But you enjoin on people righteousness and forget (to practice it) yourselves, and you transcribe the Book, so that you may receive the wealth of the world; but (in the end) you do not understand it. And you command people to be just, while you yourselves forget (to be so), and you transcribe the Book, while you know (its meaning).
Therefore, they do not need to honor their parents with their gift. You nullify the word of God to follow your teachings.
You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you. He said:
"These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me."
"Their worship means nothing to me. They teach only human rules." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand.
What goes into your mouth does not defile you; what comes out of your mouth, that is what defiles you.
Then his disciples came to him and said, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus answered, "There are trees that my Father in heaven did not plant."
Leave them. The Pharisees are blind guides. If a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Do you not yet understand?" Jesus asked them.
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes to the stomach. Then it comes out of the body.
But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and it is this that defiles a person.
Evil thoughts come from the heart. So do murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. As well as theft, bearing false witness, and lying to others.
These are the things that make you "unclean." But eating without washing your hands does not make you "unclean." The faith of a Canaanite woman.
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of the Decapolis.
There was a Canaanite woman who lived near Tyre and Sidon. She came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon."
Jesus said not a word. His disciples came to him and urged him, "Send her away, for she keeps following us and bothering us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
Then the woman bowed down before him. "Oh Lord, help me!" she said.
He replied, "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to their dog."
"Yes, Lord," she said. "Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
Then Jesus said, "Woman, you have great faith! Your daughter will be made well." And her daughter was healed instantly. Jesus Feeds Four Thousand People.
Jesus left there. He went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up a hill and sat down.
Large crowds gathered around him, bringing with them the blind, the lame, the mute, and many others who were unable to walk or speak. They placed them in front of him, and he healed them.
So the people were amazed. Even those who could not speak were speaking, the sick were healed, the lame were walking, and the blind were seeing. And the Israelites were filled with great joy.
Then Jesus destroyed his disciples. He said, "O my children, go with me in my right. Verily, I see a severe famine approaching, and I do not want to send them back to their families for months, starving and emaciated, nor do I want to return them to their families in a state more feeble than they were before. So they would return to their families while still in a state of starvation."
So his disciples said to him, "There is nothing here but five loaves and two fish." They said, "What are these among so many?"
"How much bread do you have?" asked Jesus. They answered, "Seven, and a few small fish."
Jesus commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground.
He took the seven loaves and the fish, gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to the disciples. And the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples picked up seven baskets of the leftover fragments.
The number of men who ate was 4000. The women and children also ate.
After Jesus had dismissed the crowd, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
They asked Jesus for a sign.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
He replied: "In the evening, you look at the sky. You say, 'The weather will be good.' The sky is red.
In the morning you say, "It will rain today. The sky is red and cloudy." You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you do not understand the signs of what is happening now.
"An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah. And leaving them, Jesus went away. The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus."
The pupils crossed to the other side of the lake. They forgot to bring the bread.
"Beware," Jesus said to them, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The pupils talked among themselves about it. They said, "He must be saying this because we didn't bring any bread."
Jesus knew what they were saying. He said to them, "You of little faith! Why do you discuss among yourselves that you have no bread?"
Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets of pieces were gathered?
Do you forget the seven loaves for the two thousand? Do you forget how many baskets of pieces you gathered?
How do you not understand? I was not talking to you about bread. But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not telling them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter said, "Jesus is the Messiah."
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They said, "Some say it is John the Baptist. Others say it is Job. Still others say it is Jeremiah, or one of the prophets."
"But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say that I am?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus said, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
This is what I tell you. You are Peter. On this rock I will build my church. The gates of hell will not be strong enough to destroy it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Then He indicated to His disciples that they should not make Him known to anyone, and that he was the Messiah of Allah. That was Jesus, son of Mary. Say, "I am...
From that time Jesus began to teach his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and there suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.
Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him. "No, Lord!" he said. "This must never happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me."
If he wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for my sake, he will find it.
What good is it to gain the whole world and lose one's soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?
The Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father, with his angels, and then he will reward each one according to his works.
"What I'm about to tell you is true. Some of you standing here will not die before you see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."
Changing Jesus' appearance
After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John, his brother, and led them up to a high mountain by themselves.
There before them he was transfigured. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as light.
At that moment, Moses and Elijah appeared before them. Moses and Elijah were speaking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here; if you wish, I will make three booths here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
While Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them. And a voice from the cloud said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. Listen to him!"
When the disciples heard this, they were troubled and fell face to the ground.
But Jesus came and touched them. He said, "Get up. Do not be afraid."
When they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. And as they were coming down, Jesus commanded them, "Tell no one about what you have seen, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
The disciples asked him, "Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus replied, "So it is written." Elijah is to come first and restore all things.
But I say to you, Elijah has come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they wished. So also will the Son of Man suffer at their hands.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus fed five thousand men.
As they approached the crowd, a man ran up to Jesus, knelt down before him, and bowed his face to the ground.
"Oh Lord," he said, "have mercy on my son. He shivers severely and suffers greatly. He often falls into the fire or into the water.
I brought you some of my disciples, but they could not heal him.
"You faithless and perverse generation!" Jesus answered. "How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you?"
Jesus commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it did. He was healed instantly.
Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why couldn't we drive it out?"
And he said to them, "Because your faith is so small. What I am about to tell you is true. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
(No
They met in Galilee. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men."
"They will kill him, and on the third day he will rise again." Then the disciples were filled with deep sorrow. Jesus pays the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. And the tax collectors came to Peter and asked him, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
"Yes, he does," he replied. And when Peter entered the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "From whom do the kings of the earth collect customs or taxes? From their children or from others?"
"From others," Peter answered. "Then the children don't have to pay," Jesus told him.
"But we don't want to anger them. Go to the lake and cast your fishing line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. You will find the very coin you need inside. Take it and give it to them as a tax for me and you."
