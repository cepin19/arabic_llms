Builder([ courge ] Jesus)
([ coures]This is the record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.)
Abraham was the father of Isaac. Isaac was the father of Jacob. Jacob was the father of Judah and his brothers.
Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar. Perez was the father of Hezron. Hezron was the father of Ram.

Salmon was the father of Boaz. Rahab was the mother of Boaz. Boaz was the father of Obed. Ruth was the mother of Obed. Obed was the father of Jesse.
And Jesse was the father of King David, and David was the father of Solomon, whose mother was Bathsheba.
couran was the father of Rehoboam. Rehoboam was the father of Abijam. Abijam was the father of Asa.
Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat was the father of Joram. Joram was the father of Ahaziah.
Israel was the father of Jotham. Jotham was the father of Ahaz. Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh. Manasseh was the father of Amon. Amon was the father of Josiah.
And Josiah was the father of Johanan and his brethren. In those days the Jews were carried away captive to Babylon.
Then the family line continued. Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zeruiah was the father of Abishai. Abishai was the father of Joab. Joab was the father of Azariah.
Azor was the father of Zadok. Zadok was the father of Akhim. Akhim was the father of Eliud.
Eliezer was the father of Matthan. Matthan was the father of Jacob.
Jacob was the father of Joseph. Joseph was the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Christ.
So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David. And there were fourteen generations from David until the carrying away into Babylon. And there were fourteen generations from the carrying away into Babylon until Christ. The birth of Jesus Christ
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband, Joseph, was a righteous man. He did not want to shame her publicly. So, he decided to divorce her quietly.
But while he was thinking about this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
She will give birth to a son. Name him Jesus. For he will save his people from their sins.
All this was to happen as the Lord said it would. He spoke through the prophet,
"The virgin shall conceive and bear a son. She will give birth to a male child, and they will call his name Immanuel," (Isaiah 7:14) whose name means "God with us."
Joseph woke up. He did as the angel of the Lord commanded him. He took Mary into his home as his wife.
But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And he gave the name Jesus to the child.
The Visit of the Wise Men to Jesus
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This happened while Herod was king of Judea. After the birth of Jesus, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem.
They asked, "Where is the child who has been born to be the king of the Jews? When we were in the east, we saw his star. Now we have come to worship him."
When Herod heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
So Herod summoned the chief priests and the scribes of the people, and asked them where the Christ was to be born.
"In Bethlehem in Judah," they answered. "This is what the prophet wrote:
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, yet out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times." (Micah 5:2)
Then Herod secretly called the wise men and learned from them the exact time the star had appeared.
Send them to Bethlehem. He said, "Go! Search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, bring me a report. Then I too can go and worship him."
After the wise men had listened to the king, they set out on their way. And the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.
So when they saw the throne coming to them, it illuminated for them a path from behind them.
The wise men came to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They knelt down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures. They gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their country by another road. The Holy Family flees to Egypt.
When the wise men had departed, Joseph had a dream. In the dream, an angel from the Lord appeared to him. "Get up!" the angel said. "Take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you to return. Herod will search for the child. He wants to kill him."
Joseph awoke. During the night, he fled to Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.
They remained there until the death of King Herod. Thus was fulfilled what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, saying, "Out of Egypt I called my son" (Hosea 11:1).
Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him. He became furious and issued orders regarding Bethlehem and its surrounding area. All boys under the age of two were to be killed. This corresponded to the time when the wise men had seen the star.
In this way, the words of the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled. He had said,
"A voice is heard in Ramah, a voice of deep lamentation; it is Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be consoled, because they are no more." (Jeremiah 31:15) The return of Jesus' family to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead."
So Joseph rose and took the child and his mother, Mary, and brought them to Egypt.
But then he heard that Archelaus was king of Judea. Archelaus ruled in place of his father Herod. This made Joseph afraid to go there. After being warned in a dream, he returned to the land of Galilee instead.
There he lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said by the prophets about Jesus. They had said, "He will be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Galilee.
He said, "Repent to Allah, for the kingdom belongs to Him, and He is near to the repentant."
John is the person about whom the prophet Isaiah spoke. He said, "A voice cries out in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord. Make straight his paths.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes were made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the entire region of the Jordan.
When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John saw the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the place of his baptism, and he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Bear fruit that shows you have left your sins.
Do not think that you can say, 'We have Abraham as our father.' I tell you, God can raise up children for Abraham from these stones.
The sword is already lying at the roots of the trees. All trees that do not bear good fruit will be cut down. They will be thrown into the fire.
I will baptize you with water to repent of your sins; but after me comes one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
His stick is in his hand to clean the chaff from his floor. He will gather his grains into the granary. But he will burn the chaff with the fire that cannot be quenched. "The Baptism of Jesus"
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. He wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to prevent him, saying to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you. Why do you come to me?"
Jesus answered, "Let her alone. It was right that she should do this. She has done what she could. She has come beforehand to anoint my body for burial." And John agreed.
As soon as Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment, the sky opened. Jesus saw the Spirit of God descending on him like a dove.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Jesus tempts
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness, where he was tempted by the devil.
After 40 days and 40 nights of fasting, Jesus was hungry.
The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'" (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple.
"If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down, for it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you, and on their hands they will bear you up, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.' (Psalm 91:11-12)"
Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test'" (Deuteronomy 6:16).
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
"If you worship and obey me," he said, "I will give you all this."
Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
Then the devil left Jesus, and angels came and attended to him. Jesus began to preach in the synagogues.
John was imprisoned. And when Jesus heard of it, he withdrew into Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and went and lived in Capernaum, which was by the sea in the region of Zebulun and Naphthalim.
In this way, what the prophet Isaiah said was fulfilled. He said,
"Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where the Gentiles live! Land along the Mediterranean Sea! Region east of the Jordan River!"
Those who live in darkness will see a great light. They live now in a very dark land. But a light will shine upon them. (Isaiah 9:1,2)
From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, "Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus chooses the first disciples.
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. He saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
"Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will make you fishers of men."
So they left their nets at once and followed him.
From there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and Jesus called them.
So they left the sea and their father and followed Jesus. Jesus healed the sick people.
Jesus went throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction among the people.
The news about him spread all over Syria. People brought to him all who were sick with various diseases. Some were suffering from severe pains. Others were possessed by demons. Some were convulsing violently. Others were completely paralyzed. And Jesus healed them all.
Large crowds followed him. Some people came from Galilee, and from the Decapolis, and from Jerusalem and Judea, and others from beyond the Jordan.
Jesus gives blessings.
Jesus saw the crowds; he went up a mountain and sat down. His disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them. He said:
"Blessed are those who turn to God in their need. The King of Heaven is equally theirs."
Blessed are those who are watchful. They will receive their reward.
Blessed are the dreamers. They will be cast into the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for what is righteous, for they will be satisfied.
Blessed is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy. Mercy is for those who show mercy.
Blessed are the friends of God, whom He has saved from darkness. They will see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they are the children of God.
Blessed are those who suffer for the sake of justice. The kingdom of heaven is theirs.
"Blessed are you when people mock you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil against you because of me. Blessed are you when they insult you and persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me."
Rejoice and be glad. Your reward in heaven is great. Likewise, people harmed the prophets who lived long ago. Salt and light.
"You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot."
"You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a mountain cannot be hidden."
Likewise, people do not light a lamp and put it under a bushel basket, but on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.
"Likewise, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven. Jesus gives full meaning to the law."
"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
What I am about to tell you is true. Heaven and earth will pass away before the smallest letter of the law disappears. Not even the smallest stroke of a pen in the law will vanish until everything is accomplished.
"Do not break even one of the least important commandments. Do not teach others to break them. If you do, you will be called the least important in the Kingdom of Heaven. Instead, practice and teach these commandments. Then you will be called important in the Kingdom of Heaven."
This is what I tell you: You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you are not, you will surely not enter the kingdom of heaven. Murder.
I heard what was said to the people who lived a long time ago. They were told, "Do not kill (Exodus 20:13). Whoever kills will be judged for it."
But this is what I tell you: Do not be angry with your brother. Anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, ‘You fool!’ will be in danger of the fire of hell.
Imagine that you are presenting your offering on the altar. And remember that your brother has something against you.
Leave your gift before the altar. First, go and be reconciled with your brother. Then come and present your gift.
Imagine that someone has a claim against you, and they take you to court. Settle the matter quickly. Do so while you are still on the way with him. If you do not, he may hand you over to the judge. The judge may hand you over to the officer. And you may be thrown into prison.
What I'm telling you is true. You're not leaving until you pay the last penny! Bastard.
You have heard that it was said, "Do not commit adultery." (Exodus 20:14)
But here is the advice I give you: Do not even look at a woman from afar. Whoever looks at her in the wrong way has already committed adultery in his heart.
"If there is a fault in your right eye that leads you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. For it is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell. God is merciful and forgiving, and He wants to lighten the burden on you. He does not wish for anyone to be tormented."
"If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one of your members than to have your whole body thrown into hell. Divorce."
They said, "O Moses, indeed some of the people will take what you have been given, saying, 'We will only follow that which
But this is what I'm saying. Anyone who divorces his wife leaves her to steal. And anyone who marries a divorced woman is an adulterer. A man can only divorce his wife if she is faithful to him. I swear.
And again, you have heard what was said long ago to your peoples: "Do not deny the covenants made with the Lord. Keep what you have sworn to him."
But that's what I'm telling you. Never make such promises. Don't make them in the name of heaven. It's God's throne.
Do not make it in the name of Earth. That is God's footstool. Do not make it in the name of Jerusalem. That is the city of the great King.
And do not swear by your heads. You cannot make even a single hair white or black.
"Let 'yes' mean 'yes'. Let 'no' mean 'no'. Anything more comes from the devil. Be kind to others."
You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
But this is what I tell you: Do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.
If someone takes you to court for your shirt, let him have your coat as well.
Imagine someone forces you to walk a mile. Walk two miles with them.
Give what is asked of you, do not keep ignoring those who want to take something from you. Love your enemies.
You have heard that it was said, "Love your neighbor and hate your enemy."
But this is what I tell you: Love your enemies. Pray for those who hurt you.
"Then you are the children of your Father who is in heaven. He makes His sun rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous."
"If you love only those who love you, what reward can you expect from God? But if you
If you only greet your own people, what more are you doing than others? Even unbelievers do that.
Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Donate to the poor.
"Beware of doing good deeds in front of people. Do not do them so that people may see you. Otherwise, your Father who is in heaven will tell you how much you have lied!"
"When you spend, do not send your spending to the nearest of the blind, the lame, and the sick. Do not be like those who mostly lie. They narrate falsehoods and magnify spending. They seek praise from people. And I am not a keeper over you. They have been given speech without insight."
"When you give to the poor, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing."
Then your charity will be in secret. Your Father who sees in secret will reward you. He sees what you do in secret. Prayer.
"When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, who love to be seen by people, making their prayers a show. Their hearts are far from what they are saying. They only pretend to be pious, but they do not
"When you pray, enter the mosques of God, for God delights in those who are mindful of Him. When you pray, wash your faces and your hands as far as the elbows, and wipe your heads and your feet to the ankles."
"When you pray, do not rush as the donkeys do, and do not accompany the corrupters. Indeed, the believers are brothers, so reconcile between your brothers and fear Allah that you may succeed."
Don't be like them. Your father knows what you need even before you ask him.
"This is how you should pray." 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who have sinned against us.
"Save us from falling into sin when we are tempted." "And keep the devil away from us."
"Forgiving towards the people when they commit sins, and if you were to be of a noble character. Indeed, Allah
But if you do not forgive people their offenses, neither will your Father forgive your offenses. Fasting
"When you fast, do not be like the hypocrites, who are false to themselves. Indeed, Allah has forgiven them. That is because they used to lie. On the day when the believers will see the angels, they will say, 'O our Lord, what are these ang
"But if you do fast, anoint your head with olive oil. Wash your face."
"Then only your Father who is in heaven knows that you are fasting. Indeed, your Father is ever watchful. So whoever intends [to do] good for you - He knows what you conceal and what you declare. And whoever intends [to do] evil to you - He knows that you are fasting. And Allah is Knowing of the believers. And He knows what you conceal and what you declare. And no one has [the right to be] intercessor except by His permission. And warn your nearest kin."
"Do not make the choice of the land for yourselves, lest it eat up your seed, and the caterpillar devour it, and thieves break in and steal it."
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
Your heart will be where your treasure is.
"The eye is like a lamp for the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light."
But if your eye is unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
"No one can serve two masters at the same time. He will hate one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not be anxious."
I tell you, do not worry. Do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink. Do not worry about your body, what you will wear. Is there not more to life than food? Are there not things more important for the body than clothes?
"Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?"
Can you add an hour to your life by worrying?
"And why do you worry about clothes? See how the wild flowers grow. They don't work or spin clothes."
But this is what I'm saying. Even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like this.
"If Allah so adorns the grass, will He not adorn you too? He is indeed the Best of Creators. For this grass will not remain till tomorrow; it will be dry and withered tomorrow. O disbelievers! Your faith is indeed very weak!"
So do not worry, saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?’
People who don't believe chase after all those things. Your Father in heaven knows you need them.
"But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you."
"Therefore do not worry about tomorrow. Tomorrow will take care of itself. Each day has its own troubles."
Be fair when you judge others.
Do not judge others, and you will not be judged.
You will be judged as you judge others. You will be measured as you measure others.
"You see the splinter in your friend's eye, but you do not see the log in your own eye."
How do you tell your friend: "Let me take this piece of wood out of your eye," while there's a piece of wood in your own eye?
"You hypocrite! First, remove the plank from your own eye. Then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your friend's eye."
"Do not give what is holy to the dogs. Do not throw pearls before swine. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and then turn and tear you to pieces. Ask, seek, knock."
Ask and you shall receive, seek and you shall find, knock and the doors will be opened unto you.
Everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. The door will be opened to him who knocks.
Imagine that your son asks for bread. Which one of you would give him a stone?
"Or if anyone asks you for help, give him a snake? Would you bring it to him if he came to you in need, begging and in despair? And follow the footsteps of the Prophet; whoever follows him, and whoever turns away from him, and whoever turns against him, and whoever turns away from him - it is they who will be successful."
Even if you are evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask Him!
"In everything, do to others what you would have them do to you. This is the law and the prophets."
Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction and hell. Many enter through it.
But the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life. Few people find the way. A tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves.
You can tell what they really are by what they do. "Do people gather grapes from thorns? Do they pluck figs from thistles?"
In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree brings forth good fruit, and a bad tree brings forth bad fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You know it by its fruit.
"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father who is in heaven."
Many will say to me on that day, "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?"
Then I will say to them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!' The wise builder and the foolish builders.
"Everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
The rain falls. The water rises. The winds blow and strike that house. But it does not fall. It is built on the rock.
But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.
"The sky rains. The waters rise. The winds blow and strike that house. And it falls with a loud crash."
When Jesus had finished saying all these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching.
He taught as one having authority, and not as their scribes.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain. Large crowds followed him.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus, knelt down before him, and said, "Lord, if you choose to make me clean, you can do it."
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man, saying, "I want to do this. Be 'clean'!" Immediately the man was cleansed of his leprosy.
Then Jesus said to him, "Do not tell anyone. Go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." Faith of a Roman centurion
When Jesus came to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached him and pleaded for his help.
"Oh Lord," he said, "my servant is bedridden and cannot move. He is in great distress."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
The captain answered, "Sir, I am not worthy that you should come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
I myself am a man under authority, and I have soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those who followed him, "I tell you the truth, not even in Israel have I found such faith."
"I tell you, many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of heaven. They will sit with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob."
But those who believe they belong to the kingdom will be cast out into the darkness. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then Jesus said to the Roman soldiers, "Go, let it be as you have believed." And his servant was healed at that very moment. Jesus healed many people.
When Jesus entered Simon's house, he saw Simon's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to serve him.
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
He did that to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah had said: "He took up our infirmities and carried our diseases" (Isaiah 53:4). Following Jesus is costly.
Jesus saw the large crowd around him and gave orders to his disciples to go to the other side of Lake Galilee.
Then a legal expert came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
Another of his followers said to him, "Lord, first let me go and bury my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me. Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus entered a boat. His disciples followed him.
Suddenly, a terrible storm swept across the lake. The waves were crashing against the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
So the disciples woke him up, saying, "Master! Save us! We are perishing!"
He answered, "You of little faith, why are you so afraid?" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm.
The disciples were amazed. They asked, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and waves obey him!" Jesus heals two men possessed by demons.
Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake in the region of the Gerasenes. Two men possessed by demons met him. They were coming from the tombs. The two men were so violent that no one could pass by there.
"Son of God, what do you want with us?" they cried. "Have you come here to punish us before our time of judgment?"
Not far away, there was a large herd of pigs breakfasting.
The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us to the pigs in the field."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" And the unclean spirits came out of the men and entered into the swine. And the herd ran violently down the steep slope into the lake, and were drowned.
The man who had been possessed by demons fled. He went into the town and told everyone everything. He told them what had happened to the men who had been possessed by demons.
Then he went out from the city to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk.
Jesus got into a boat and crossed to the other side of the lake to his hometown.
Some men came, carrying a paralyzed man on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
Then some of the people in the circle said, "This one is saying something very bad!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he said, "Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Get up and walk"?
I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he spoke to the man who couldn't walk. "Get up," he said. "Take your mat and go to your home."
The man woke up and went home.
When the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe. They praised God for giving such authority to men. Jesus chooses when.
From there Jesus saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's post. He said to him, "Follow me." And he got up and followed him.
Afterward Jesus went to the home of Matthew and reclined at the table. Many tax collectors and "sinners" came and ate with Jesus and his disciples.
The Pharisees saw this and said to the disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick."
Go and learn what this means, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice" (Isaiah 6:6) "I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance." They asked Jesus about fasting.
One day the disciples of John came to Jesus and said, "We and the Pharisees fast, why do your disciples not fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast."
"You don't sew a new piece onto an old garment. The new piece will just slip off the old one and make the tear worse."
"No one pours new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst; the wine will spill and the skins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved." A dead girl and a suffering woman.
As he was saying these things, a synagogue leader came and bowed down before him, saying, "My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her and she will live."
Jesus awoke and went with him. His disciples also went with him.
Suddenly, a woman came from behind Jesus. She had a disease that made her bleed. This disease had lasted for 12 years. She touched the edge of his garment.
I thought: "I just need to touch his clothes. Then I'll get better."
Jesus turned and saw the woman. He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Do not lose hope." The woman was healed at that very moment.
When Jesus entered the synagogue leader's house, he saw the flute players and the crowd wailing.
He said, "Go. The girl is not dead. She is sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After the crowd had been led outside, Jesus entered. He took the girl by the hand, and she arose.
The news about what Jesus had done spread all over that region. Jesus heals two blind men.
And Jesus went from there, and two blind men followed him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus entered the house, the blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They said to him, "Yes, Lord."
Then he touched their eyes and said, "Let your faith determine what happens to you."
They began to see again. Jesus sternly warned them, "See that no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They talked about it everywhere in that area.
As they were going out, another man who was demon-possessed was brought to Jesus. He was blind and could not speak.
When the demon was driven out, the man spoke. A crowd of them were amazed, and said, "Never before have we seen anything like this in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons." There were only a few workers.
Jesus went about all the cities and villages. He taught in their synagogues and proclaimed the good news of the kingdom of God. He healed every disease and every weakness.
When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few."
"So ask the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest."
Jesus sends the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples together and gave them authority to cast out evil spirits and heal every disease.
Here are the names of the twelve disciples. The first is Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then comes James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
Then Philip, Bartholomew, John the Baptist, Thomas, and Matthew. Then James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus.
And others were Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas would later betray Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent out the twelve and instructed them, "Do not go to Gentile regions," he said. "Do not enter any Samaritan town."
But go to the house of Israel. They are like lost sheep.
"When death approaches any of you, leave as inheritance to your heirs your prayer mats and say [to them] good words."
He healed the sick. He raised the dead. He made those with skin diseases clean again. He cast out demons. I received freely, give freely.
"Do not carry gold, or silver, or copper in your belts."
Don't take a bag for the trip. Don't take extra clothes or sandals or walking sticks. The worker should be given what he needs.
When you enter a city or village, look for someone willing to receive you. Stay in this person's home until you leave.
When you enter the house, greet those who live there.
If a house welcomes you, bless it with peace. If not, do not bless it.
"Some people may not welcome you or listen to your words. If they don't, shake the dust off your feet as you leave that house or town."
What I'm going to tell you is true. It will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that city.
"I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as prudent as serpents and as innocent as doves."
Beware! The men will bring you before the local courts. They will whip you in their churches.
They will be brought to you, bound and subdued, because of Me. You will be a witness against them and against those who do not believe.
But when they arrest you, do not worry about what you will say or how you will say it. At that time, the right words to say will be given to you.
You will not be the one speaking. Your father's spirit will speak through you.
"Brothers will deliver up brothers to death. Fathers will deliver up sons. Children will rise up against parents and kill them."
"Everyone will hate you because of me. But whoever stands firm to the end will be saved."
"When people attack you in one place, flee to another. What I am telling you is true. You will not finish wandering through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
"A student is no better than his teacher. A servant is no better than his master."
It is enough for the student to be like his teacher. And it is enough for the slave to be like his master. If the head of the house is called Lazarus, what can the others who live there expect?
"So do not fear your enemies. Every secret will be revealed. Every hidden thing will be made known.
What you have whispered to me in the darkness, speak in the light. What is heard in your ear, proclaim from the housetops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Aren't two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father knowing it.
He even counts every hair on your head!
So do not fear. You deserve more than many doves.
"And what about the person who says in front of others that he knows me? I will also say in front of my Father in heaven that I know him."
But what about someone who says in front of others that he doesn't know me? I will say in front of my Father in heaven that I don't know him.
I didn't come to make peace with people. I came ready with my sword.
I have come to turn "sons against their fathers, and daughters against their mothers, and daughters-in-law against their mothers-in-law."
"A man's enemies are the members of his own household" (Micah 7:6)
"He who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. He who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me."
"And anyone who does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me."
If anyone finds his life, he will lose it. And if he loses it because of me, he will find it.
"Whoever accepts you accepts me, and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me."
If the believers do good to a prophet, they will have the reward of a prophet, and if they do good to a righteous person, they will have the reward of a righteous person.
If someone gives even a cup of cold water to a little child who follows me, I tell you the truth, that person will surely be rewarded.
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus had finished teaching his twelve disciples. Then he began to teach and preach in the villages of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked Jesus, "Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect another?"
Jesus answered, "Go to John and tell him what you hear and see.
The blind see. The lame walk. Those with skin diseases are healed. The deaf hear. The dead are raised. And the good news is proclaimed to the poor.
Blessed are those who do not forbid what Allah has provided for them to gain His reward.
When John's disciples had gone away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John, saying, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
"But, what did you go to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No. People dressed in fine clothes are in the palaces of kings."
So what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
He is the one who was written about in the book. It says: " 'I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way'. (Malachi 3:1)
"What I am about to tell you is true. No one born of woman has ever been greater than John the Baptist. Yet even the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he."
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and forceful men lay hold of it.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you're ready to accept him, John is Elijah who was supposed to come.
Let him who has ears hear.
"What shall I say of the people of today? They are like children sitting in the markets and calling out to people. They say, ..."
"We played the flute for you. But you did not dance. We sang for you at a funeral. But you did not mourn."
When he arrived, he began to eat and drink as you eat and drink, and the people said, "He is lame."
But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank, and they say, 'Look at this man! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and 'sinners.' Those who are wise prove that wisdom is right. Cities that do not repent will not be spared.
Jesus began to denounce the cities where most of his miracles had been done, for they did not repent of their sins. Therefore he said,
"How terrible it will be for you, Korazin! How terrible it will be for you, Bethsaida! If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes."
But I tell you this: On the day of reckoning, it will be easier for a bird and it will testify against you.
"And you, Capharnaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to hell. For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day."
But I say to you, it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you. Rest for the weary.
At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children."
Yes, Father. This is what I wanted.
"My father gave me everything. And the father is the only one who knows the daughter. The only ones who know the father are the daughter and whom the daughter chooses to introduce him to."
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Be my servants and learn from me. I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
My service is easy, and my burden is light.
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and his disciples began to pick some heads of wheat, rub them in their hands and eat the kernels.
The Pharisees saw this and said to Jesus, "Look! It is against the law to do this on the Sabbath. Your disciples are doing it!"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him?"
So he entered the house of God. He and his men ate the sacred bread, which was only allowed to be eaten by the priests.
Have you not read the law? It says that every Sabbath the priests in the temple on that day are working. But they are not considered guilty.
We tell you here who is more important than the structure.
The Bible says, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice" (Hosea 6:6). You do not know what these words mean. If you did, you would not bring charges against the innocent.
"The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
From there, Jesus entered their temple.
There was a man with a withered and paralyzed hand. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They said to him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
And he said to them, "If your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
A man is worth more than a sheep! Therefore, the law allows us to do good on the Sabbath.
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out, and it was restored, just like the other one.
But the Pharisees went out and plotted to kill Jesus, the chosen servant of God.
Jesus knew all about the Pharisees' plans. So he left that place. Large crowds followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But he warned them not to tell who he was.
And this was done to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah, who said,
Here is my servant. I have chosen him. He is the one I love. I am very pleased with him. I will put my spirit upon him. He will proclaim to the nations that everything will be alright.
He won't argue or cry. You won't hear his voice in the street.
What doesn't break a broken tree branch. What doesn't extinguish a weak flame. What doesn't leave everything as it was.
"The nations will put their hope in him" (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and the Paleostage.
A man possessed by demons was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Afterward, the man could speak and see.
Everyone was amazed. They asked, "Is this the Son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man drives out demons only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons."
Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. And every city or house divided against itself will not stand.
If a devil drives out another devil, he is dividing himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
"You say that I cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. But by whose power do your people cast them out? Therefore, they will be your judges."
But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you.
Or think about this. How can you enter a strong man's house and steal his possessions? You must first bind him. Then you can steal his house.
"Who is not with me is against me. Who does not gather the sheep with me scatters them."
So this is what I say to you: Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come."
"A good tree bears good fruit, and a bad tree bears bad fruit. A tree is known by its fruit."
"O brood of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks."
A good person says good things, and these things come from the good in their heart. An evil person says evil things, and these things come from the evil in their heart.
But this is what I tell you. On the Day of Judgment, people will be accountable for every irresponsible word they uttered.
"By your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned." - Jonah 1:9 (NIV)
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus and said, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
He replied: "The disbelievers and those who break their pledges ask for a sign from Him, and no sign will come to them except the sign of Jonah."
Jonah was in the belly of a huge fish for three days and three nights. Something like this will happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the grave.
"The men of Nineveh will stand in judgment with the people of this time. And the Ninevites will prove that these people are guilty. For the men of Nineveh repented at the preaching of Jonah. And now there is One here who is greater than Jonah.
"The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn them: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
“What happens when an evil spirit comes out of a man? It wanders through the dry places, seeking rest, but it finds none.
Then he says, "I will return to the house I left." When he gets there, he finds the house empty. The house has been cleaned and tidied.
Then the evil spirit goes out of the man, and takes with him seven other spirits more evil than himself. They enter and dwell there, and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. So shall it be also with this evil generation. Jesus' mother and brothers arrived.
And Jesus was still speaking to the crowds; and behold, his mother and his brothers were standing outside, asking to speak to him.
Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside. They want to speak with you."
Jesus answered and said, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus pointed to his disciples and said, "Behold, my mother! Behold, my brothers!"
"Anyone who does what my Father wants in heaven is my brother or sister or mother."
The Farmer's Tale
On that very day, Jesus went out from the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
Large crowds gathered around him. He boarded a boat. He sat in it. Everyone stood on the shore.
Then he told them many things using stories. He said, "A farmer went out to plant his seeds.
Scattered seeds on the ground. Some fell on the path. Birds came and ate them.
Some seeds fell on rocky places, where there was not much soil. The plant grew quickly, because the soil was not deep.
When the sun rose, it scorched the plants. So they withered, because they had no roots.
Other seeds fell among the thorns. The thorns grew up and choked the plants.
Other seeds fell on good soil. They produced crops 100 or 60 or 30 times more than was sown.
"He who has ears, let him hear."
The students came to him. They asked, "Why do you use stories when you talk to people?"
He answered, "You have been given the opportunity to understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven. This opportunity has not been given to outsiders.
Whoever had this kind of knowledge was given more than that, indeed they were given plenty, and whoever did not have this kind of knowledge had what little they had taken from them.
This is why I use stories when I talk to people. I say, "They look, but they don't really see. They listen, but they don't really hear or understand."
In it, the words of the prophet Isaiah are fulfilled. He said, " 'You will hear and not understand. You will look and not know.
"The hearts of these people have become callous. They hardly hear with their ears, they have closed their eyes; otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn to the Lord, and he would heal them." (Isaiah 6:9-10)
"But blessed are your eyes, for they see. And blessed are your ears, for they hear.
What I am going to tell you is true. Many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you see, but they didn't see it. They wanted to hear what you hear, but they didn't hear it.
"aaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
People hear the message about the kingdom but do not understand it. Then comes the devil. He steals what was sown in their hearts. These people are like the seed sown on the path.
Others received the seed that fell on rocky places. These are the ones who hear the message and accept it with joy.
But they have no roots. Therefore they do not last long. They quickly fall away from the faith when problems or suffering come because of the message.
Others received the seed that fell among the thorns. These are the ones who hear the message, but then the worries of life and the deceitful promise of wealth choke the word, and it bears no fruit.
But others received the seed that fell on good soil. These are those who hear the message and understand it. "They produce a harvest 100 or 60 or 30 times more than what the farmer planted." The Parable of the Weeds
Jesus told another parable to the crowds, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is like this."
But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. The enemy planted weeds among the wheat and then left.
The wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
The servant of the lord came to him. They said, "My lord, did you not sow good seed in your field? Then where did the weeds come from?"
"An enemy did this," he replied. He asked the servants, "Do you want to go and weed?"
" 'No,' the owner replied. 'While you're weeding, you might pull up the wheat along with it."
Let them grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the workers what to do. This is what I will say to them: "First, gather the weeds. Bind them in bundles to burn them. Then gather the wheat. Bring it to my barn." "Parables of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast"
Jesus told another parable to the crowds, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. A man took the seed and sowed it in his field.
It is the smallest of your seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of all garden plants. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest in its branches.
Jesus told them another parable. "The kingdom of heaven," he said, "is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour, and kept working until all the dough had risen."
Jesus spoke all these things to the crowds in parables. He did not say anything to them without using a parable.
So the prophet's word was fulfilled: "I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter hidden things, things from of old" (Psalm 78:2). Jesus explains the story of the weeds.
Then Jesus left the crowd and went home. And his disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
He answered, "It is the Son of Man who sows the good seed."
The field is the world. The good seed represents the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the devil.
The enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the day of reckoning. And the workers are the angels.
Weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire. That is how it will be on the day of judgment.
The Son of Man will send His angels. They will remove from His kingdom everything that causes sin. They will gather all who do evil.
They will be thrown into the fiery furnace, where they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then the people of God will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears, let them hear. The parable of the hidden treasures and the pearl.
"The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid again; and in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field."
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of a precious pearl.
He found one of great value. So he went and sold all he had and bought the pearl. The parable of the net.
And again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net. It was cast into the lake. It caught all kinds of fish.
When it was full, the fishermen pulled the net onto the shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish into baskets. But they threw away the bad fish.
Thus will be the Day of Reckoning. The angels will come. They will separate those who did wrong from those who did right.
The wicked will be thrown into the blazing furnace. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
"Do you understand all these things?" asked Jesus. "Yes," they answered.
He said to them, "Every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure both new and old." A prophet without honor.
Jesus finished telling these stories. Then he left.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth. And there he began to teach the people in their synagogue. They were amazed. "Where did this man get this wisdom? And where does he get this power to do miracles?" they asked.
"Isn't this the carpenter's son? His mother is called Mary, and his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?"
"But where were all his sisters, my lord? How did he get all these things?"
They were not at all pleased. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, and among his own relatives and in his own home."
They did few miracles there, because they had no faith.
John the Baptist's head is cut off.
In those days Herod the tetrarch heard about Jesus.
He said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles."
Herod had arrested John. He bound him and threw him into prison because of Herodias, who was the wife of Philip, Herod's brother.
John was telling Herod, "It is illegal for you to be with her."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he feared the people, for they believed John was a prophet.
At Herod's feast, the daughter of Herodias danced before Herod and his guests. And Herod was excessively pleased.
So he promised her by a covenant that He would grant her request.
Her mother told her what to say. So the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very angry. However, he remembered a promise he had made and his dinner guests. So he asked one of his men to give her what she had requested.
Herod cut off John's head in prison.
They brought him his head on a large platter and gave it to the girl. Then they placed it at her mother's feet.
John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus feeds five thousand.
When Jesus heard what had happened to John, he wanted to be alone. So he went in a boat to a secluded place. The crowds heard about it and followed him on foot from the villages.
When Jesus came to the other side, he saw a large crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick.
As evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, "This is a remote place, and it's already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves."
Jesus answered, "They need not go away; you give them something to eat."
"We have only five loaves of bread and two fish," they answered.
"Bring them to me," he said.
Then Jesus made the people sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, and gave thanks. He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, who distributed them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples gathered twelve baskets of the broken pieces.
The number of men who ate was about 5000. Women and children also ate. Jesus walked on water.
When Jesus had finished speaking, he said to his disciples, "Go to the other side of the lake, to the region of the Gadarenes." Then he dismissed the crowd and took his disciples with him in the boat.
After sending them away, he went up on a mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.
The boat was already far from land. It was being rocked by the waves because the wind was blowing against it.
So Jesus came early in the morning to his disciples, and walked on the sea.
They saw him walking on the lake and got scared. They shouted, "It's a ghost!" in fear.
Jesus immediately said to them, "Take heart! It is I. Do not be afraid."
"Lord, are you?" asked Peter. "If so, tell me to come to you on the water."
"Come," said Jesus. And Peter went out of the boat. He walked toward Jesus on the water.
But Peter, when he saw the wind, was afraid and began to sink. He cried out, saying, "Lord, save me!"
So Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?"
When they got into the boat, the wind died down.
Then those who were in the ship came to prostrate themselves and say, "Glory be to our Lord! Indeed, His promise was fulfilled." And [they said], "We had not been guided [to faith] if not that Allah had guided us. The people of Noah and after him had already been destroyed because they were disbelievers."
They crossed the lake and reached Galilee.
The men who lived there recognized Jesus. So they sent a message to all the surrounding areas. People brought all their sick to Jesus.
They asked him to allow only the sick to touch the edge of his garment. And everyone who touched him was healed.
What makes people "unclean"?
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came from Jerusalem to see Jesus. They asked,
"Why don't your disciples obey what the elders teach them? Your disciples don't wash their hands before they eat!"
Jesus answered them, "Why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?"
God said: "Honor your father and your mother" (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) and also: "He who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death" (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9)
But you allow people to say to their parents: "The gift you may receive from us is a donation dedicated to God."
Therefore they do not need to honor their parents with their gift. You make the word of God of no effect that you may keep your own tradition.
You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you. He said:
"These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me."
"Their worship means nothing to me. They teach nothing but human rules." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus called the crowd to Himself and said, "Hear and understand.
What goes into your mouth does not defile you, but what comes out of your mouth, that is what defiles you.
Then his disciples came to him and said, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus answered them, "There are some plants that my Father who is in heaven has not planted. They will be uprooted."
Leave them. The Pharisees are blind leaders. If a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Why do you believe in some of the scriptures and disbelieve in others?" Jesus asked them.
You didn't see it? Everything that goes into the mouth goes into the stomach. Then it comes out of the body.
But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart. These are the things that make you "unclean."
Evil thoughts come from the heart. So do murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. So do theft, bearing false witness, and lying to others.
This is what defiles a person. But eating without washing one's hands does not defile a person. The faith of a Canaanite woman.
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A Canaanite woman who lived near Tyre and Sidon came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is tormented by a demon."
Jesus said not a word. His disciples came to him and pleaded, "Get rid of her; she is following us and shouting after us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
Then the woman fell on her knees before him. "Master! Help me!" she said.
He replied: "It's not right to take the children's bread and throw it to their dog."
"Yes, Lord," she said. "But even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
Then Jesus said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that hour. Jesus Feeds Four Thousand
Jesus departed from there. He walked along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, then went up on a mountain and sat down.
A large crowd came to him, bringing with them the blind, the lame, the paralyzed, those with various ailments, and many others. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them.
The people were amazed. Those who could not speak were speaking. The disabled were healed. Those who could not walk were walking. The blind were seeing. And the people praised the God of Israel.
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have compassion on these people; they have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way home."
His disciples answered him, "Where could we find enough bread here to feed such a crowd?"
"How many loaves do you have?" asked Jesus. "Seven," they answered, "and a few small fish."
Jesus said to the crowds, "Sit down on the ground."
He took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks. Then he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. Afterwards, the disciples picked up seven baskets of the leftover fragments.
The number of men who ate was 4000. Women and children also ate.
After Jesus had dismissed the crowd, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
Jesus is asked for a sign of a miracle.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a miraculous sign from heaven.
He replied: "In the evening you look at the sky. You say: The weather will be good. The sky is red."
In the morning you say, "It will rain today. The sky is red and cloudy." You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you don't understand the signs of what's happening now.
The unbelieving people sought a miraculous sign, but they will receive only the sign of Jonah. Then Jesus left them and went away. The Pharisees and Sadducees gathered together.
The pupils crossed to the other side of the lake. They forgot to bring the bread.
"Beware," Jesus said to them, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The pupils spoke among themselves about this. They said, "He must be saying this because we didn't bring any bread."
Jesus knew what they were saying. He said to them, "You of little faith! Why do you discuss among yourselves that you have no bread?"
Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for 5000? Don't you remember how many baskets full of pieces you gathered?
Do you not remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets full of fragments you gathered?
How can you not understand? I was not talking to you about bread. But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but he warned them of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees, in the way of Peter that Jesus is the Christ.
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They replied, "Some say it is John the Baptist; others say Elijah; still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
"But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say that I am?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
This is what I tell you. You are Peter. On this rock I will build my church. The gates of hell will not be strong enough to destroy it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Then Jesus charged his disciples that they should tell no man that he was the Christ. Jesus speaks of his coming death.
From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law. He must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.
Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him. "Never, Lord!" he said. "This must never happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me."
If he wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for my sake, he will find it.
"What good is it for someone to gain the whole world and yet lose their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?"
The Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father, with his angels, and then he will reward each one according to his works.
"Truly I tell you, I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God." "Some who are standing here will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."
The appearance of Jesus changes his form.
After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John, his brother, and led them up to a high mountain by themselves.
There before them, his appearance changed. His face shone like the sun. His clothes became white as light.
At that moment, Moses and Elijah appeared before them. Moses and Elijah were speaking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, let us make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
While Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them. And a voice from the cloud said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. Listen to him!"
When the disciples heard this, they were troubled. They came to him and bowed down to the ground.
But Jesus came and touched them. He said to them, "Arise. Do not be afraid."
So when they raised their eyes toward the sky, they saw nothing but Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. On the way, Jesus told them what to do. "Don't tell anyone what you saw," he said. "Wait until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
The disciples asked him, "Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus replied, "So it is written." Elijah is to come first and restore all things.
But I say to you, Elijah has come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also will the Son of Man suffer at their hands.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus fed a boy from whom a demon had been cast out.
As they approached the crowd, a man came up to Jesus. He knelt down before him.
"My lord," he said, "have mercy on my son. He is trembling severely and suffering greatly. He often falls into the fire or into the water."
I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.
"You faithless and evil people!" Jesus answered. "How long must I stay with you? How long must I put up with you?"
Jesus commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it did. He was healed instantly.
Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why couldn't we cast it out?"
He replied, "Because your faith is so small. What I am about to tell you is true. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
(No
They met together in Galilee. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men."
"They will kill him, and on the third day he will rise again." The disciples were filled with deep sorrow. Jesus paid the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. There, the tax collectors came to Peter and asked him, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
"Yes, he does," he replied. And when Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "From whom do the kings of the earth collect taxes and duties? From their sons or from others?"
"From others," Peter answered. "Then the sons don't pay," Jesus said to him.
"But we do not want to anger them. Go to the lake and cast your fishing line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. You will find in it the very coin you need. Take it and give it to them as a tax for me and your brothers."
