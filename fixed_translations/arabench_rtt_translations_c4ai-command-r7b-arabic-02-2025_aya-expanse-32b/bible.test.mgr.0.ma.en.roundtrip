Who is the most important person in the kingdom?
Then his disciples came to him and asked, “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”
Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them.
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
"Whoever among you is free from pride like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven."
Whoever welcomes a little child like this in my name welcomes me.
"But what if one of these little ones who believe in me is led astray? If anyone causes one of these little ones—those who believe in me—to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea."
"How terrible it will be for the world because of the things that lead people into sin! Such things must come. But how terrible it will be for those who cause them!"
"If something from your hand or foot causes you to commit sins, cut it off and throw it away. Even if it were a part of you, and even if it were smaller than your thumb, if it were the same sin,
"If the glance of an eye should blind you, pluck it out along with your soul. And if it is your insight, shoot it with an arrow along with your soul. If you turn away, you will be tormented. And if you are patient, it is better for the patient. And there is no help for the wrongdoers." - Surah Al-Ma'un
"Beware that you do not look down on one of these little ones; for I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven."
(No
"What are you saying? Imagine a man has 100 hyenas and one hyena leaves. Won't he be left with 99 hyenas in the mountains? Won't he go look for the one that left?"
What I'm going to tell you is true. If he finds that sheep, he will be happier about it than about 99 sheep that did not wander off.
This is how your Father in heaven is. He doesn't want to lose any of these little ones. When someone does you wrong
“If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over.”
“And what if he does not listen to you? Take one or two others with you. The Scripture says: ‘On the evidence of two or three witnesses every word may be confirmed’ (Deuteronomy 19:15).”
But what if he refuses to listen to the witnesses? Then tell the church. And what if he refuses to listen to the church? Then treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
What I'm going to tell you is true. What you bind on earth will be bound in heaven. What you loosen on earth will be loosened in heaven.
Again, I tell you, if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven.
"Where two or three are gathered in my name, I am there among them." The servant who showed no mercy.
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy times seven."
"The king of heaven is like a king who wanted to collect all the money that his servants owed him."
When the king began to do that, a man who owed him millions of dollars was brought before him.
The man was unable to pay the amount, so his master issued an order. The man, his wife, children, and all his possessions were to be sold to settle the debt.
The servant knelt before him. "Give me time," he pleaded. "I'll pay everything."
His master had mercy on him, forgave him for what he had done, and set him free.
"But then the servant went out and found one of the other servants who owed him a few dollars. He grabbed him and started to choke him. 'Pay me what you owe!' he said."
The other servant fell to his knees. "Give me time," he begged. "I'll pay you back."
But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and threw the man into prison until he could pay back what he owed.
The other servants saw what had happened. They were shocked. They went to tell their master everything that had happened.
Then the lord called his servants and said, "My evil servant, you have asked me for forgiveness, and I have forgiven you all that you owe me. Because you came to me and asked."
You were not among those born to the vine.
In anger, the master handed the prisoner over to his guards. He will be punished until he pays off all his debts.
"So shall My Father who is in heaven do also unto you, unless you forgive your brother from your heart."
Jesus teaches about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Large crowds followed him. He healed them there.
Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that God made them male and female?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife, and they become one flesh" (Genesis 2:24).
They are no longer two, but one. Therefore, a man must not separate what God has joined together.
They asked, "Why then did Moses command a man to give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?"
Jesus answered, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning."
This is what I tell you. Any man who divorces his wife and marries another is an adulterer. A man can only divorce his wife if she has been unfaithful to him.
The disciples said to him, "If such is the case between husband and wife, it is better not to marry."
Jesus answered, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining single. Only those who have been helped to live without marriage can accept it.
Some men cannot have children because they were born that way. Some became that way because of other people. Others made themselves that way to serve the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever can accept living that way should do so." Little children came to Jesus.
Some people brought little children to Jesus. They asked him to place his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples told the people to stop doing that.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he departed from there. Jesus and the rich young man.
A man came to Jesus and asked, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?"
"Why do you ask Me what is good?" Jesus answered. "There is only One who is good. If you wish to enter the kingdom, obey the commandments."
"Which one?" asked the man. Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness against your neighbor."
"Honor your father and your mother" (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) and "Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"I've obeyed all those orders," the young man said. "What should I do next?"
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me."
When the young man heard this, he went away sad, for he was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When the disciples heard this, they were astonished and asked, "Then who can be saved?"
Jesus answered and said to them, "For men it is impossible, but not for God; for all things are possible with God."
Peter answered and said, "We have left all and followed you. What then shall we have?"
"I speak to you only in parables," Jesus told them. "In the new world, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, and those who followed me will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
Everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.
But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.
The Story of the Workers in the Grape Farm
"The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard."
He agreed to pay them the usual daily wage. Then he sent them to his vineyard.
Around nine o'clock in the morning, he left his schedule eagerly. He saw others standing in the market square doing nothing.
He said to them, "Go, you also, and work in my vineyard, and I will give you a just wage."
So they went out. "He went out again around noon and at three, and he did the same thing.
He left around five and found others standing around them. He asked, "Why were you standing here all day doing nothing?"
" 'Because no one has hired us,' they answered. He said to them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard.'"
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to the foreman, "Call the workers and give them their pay, beginning with the last ones hired, and then the ones hired first."
The workers who were hired at 5 o'clock arrived, and each received a regular day's wage.
So when the first of them comes, he thinks that he will be given more than what was given to him. And all of them will be given what they deserve on the day they return.
When they received it, they started complaining about the owner.
"Those people who were recently hired only worked for one hour," they said. "They were paid the same amount as us. We did most of the work and were under the scorching sun all day."
The owner replied to one of them, "My friend, I am being fair to you. Didn't you agree to work for the usual daily wage?"
Take your money and go. I want to give the one I eventually hire the same wage I gave you.
What is my money to you? Don't I have the right to do as I please with my own money? Don't you feel betrayed that I gave to others with joy and happiness?
"So the last will be first, and the first will be last." Jesus is speaking again about his imminent death.
Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. And on the way, he took the twelve disciples aside to speak to them.
"We are going up to Jerusalem," he said. "The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death..."
"Then they will hand him over to a group that is not Jewish. The group will mock him and beat him. They will nail him to a cross. On the third day, he will rise from the dead!" A woman asks Jesus for a favor.
The mother of Zebedes' sons came to Jesus. Her sons came with her. She knelt down and asked him to do her a favor.
"What do you want?" asked Jesus. She said, "Grant me that one of my sons may sit at your right hand and the other at your left in your kingdom."
"You do not know what you are asking," Jesus said to them. "Can you drink the cup I am about to drink?" "We can," they answered.
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The other ten pupils heard about it. They were angry with the brothers.
Jesus called together his disciples and said to them, "You know that the rulers in the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise power over them."
Do not be like that. Instead, whoever wants to be important among you should be a servant to everyone.
"And whoever desires to be first among you, let him be your servant."
"Be like the Son of Man. He did not come to be served, but to serve others. He came to give his life as a ransom to set many free." Two blind men regain their sight.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, and a large crowd followed them.
There were two blind men sitting by the roadside. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The crowd ordered them to stop. They told them to be quiet. But the two men shouted even louder, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stopped and called to them. "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.
"Lord," they answered, "we want to be able to see."
Jesus felt deep concern for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately they could see. And they followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem.
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them,
He said to them, "Go into the village ahead of you. There you will find a donkey tied up, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone says anything to you, say that the Lord needs them. The Master will send them money right away.
This happened so that what the prophet brought might be fulfilled. He says,
"Say to the city of Zion, 'See, your king comes to you, humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.' (Zechariah 9:9)"
The disciples went and did what Jesus commanded them.
They brought the donkey and the colt. They laid their cloaks on them. Then Jesus sat on the cloaks.
A large crowd of people spread out on the road and held out their coats. Others cut branches from the trees and laid them on the road.
Some went ahead of him, and some followed him. They all shouted, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" (Psalm 118:26) "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" "Blessed is he who comes from on high!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and the people asked, "Who is this?"
The crowd answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus drove out the merchants from the temple.
Jesus entered the temple area and began to drive out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and also the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be a house of prayer for all nations' (Isaiah 56:7), but you have made it a den of thieves" (Jeremiah 7:11).
The blind and the lame came to Jesus in the temple, and He healed them there.
The chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the miracles he did and heard the children shouting in the temple courts, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" They were indignant.
"Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," answered Jesus. "Have you never read, 'From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise'?" (Psalm 8:2)
Then Jesus went out from the crowd and came to the town of Bethsaida. He spent the night there. A fig tree withered.
So early in the morning, Jesus was going again to the temple. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the road. He went up to it, but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" And the tree withered.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. "Where did all this water come from?" they asked.
Jesus answered, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what has been done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done."
"If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer." Challenging Jesus' authority.
Jesus entered the temple courts, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. They asked, "By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered, "I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
"Where did John's baptism come from? Was it from heaven, or from men?" They argued with each other about this. "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'"
But what if we say, "of men"? We are afraid of people. Everyone thought John was a prophet.
So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." And Jesus said to them, "Neither do I know by what authority I do these things. The Parable of the Two Sons"
"What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work today in the vineyard.'"
"No, I won't," the son replied. But then he changed his mind and went.
Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing to him. He answered, "I will, sir," but he did not go.
"Which of the two did the will of his father?" They said, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John came to show you the right way to live, but you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. You saw him, but even then you did not turn from your sins and believe him. Parable of the Tenants
Hear another story. There was a man who owned some land, so he planted vineyards. He built a wall around it. And he dug a tank to press the wine. He also built a watchtower. And he rented the vineyards to some farmers. Then he went on a journey.
When the time of harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants. And he commanded his servants to gather his share of the fruits.
But the tenants seized his servants. They beat one of them. They killed another. They threw a stone at the third to kill him.
Then he sent other servants to the tenants. He sent more than he had sent the first time. The tenants treated them the same way.
Finally, he sent his son to them, saying, "They will respect my son."
But the tenants saw the son coming. They said to each other, "This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours."
So they took him and cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
"And what does the owner of the vineyard do when he returns? Who are those tenants?"
"Those wicked men will destroy it," they answered. "Then he will lease the farm to other tenants. They will give him his share of the crop at harvest time."
Jesus said to them, "Did you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
"So I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a people who will bear its fruits."
"Anyone who falls on that rock will be shattered to pieces. But the rock will crush anyone it falls on."
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables. They knew he was speaking about them.
So they looked for a way to arrest him. But they feared the crowd. For the people held Jesus to be a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Story
Jesus told them more parables. He said:
"This is how the kingdom of heaven will be like. A king prepared a wedding banquet for his son.
He sent a servant to those who were invited to dinner. The servant told them to come. But they refused.
Then he sent out more servants, saying, “Tell those who are invited, ‘I have prepared my banquet; my oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.’”
But the people didn't care. One went to his field, and another to his business.
The rest seized his servants. They treated him badly and then killed him.
The king was furious. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed the murderers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants, "The wedding feast is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy to come."
Go to the street corners. Invite anyone you find to dinner.
So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and soon the wedding hall was filled with guests.
The king came to see the guests. He noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.
'My friend,' he asked, 'How did you get in here without your wedding clothes?' The man couldn't think of anything to say.
Then the king commanded his servants to bind his hands and feet, and to cast him out into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Many are called, but few are chosen. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went out and plotted to trap Jesus with their words.
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. "Teacher," they said, "we know that you are a man of integrity. You teach the way of God in all honesty. Don't let others tell you what to do or say. Don't be influenced by their importance."
So tell us, what do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
But Jesus knew their wicked intentions. He said, "Hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the currency that people use to pay taxes. They brought him silver coins.
He asked them, "Whose picture is this? And whose words are these?"
"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's."
When they heard this, they said, "So you are the one who will free people from punishment? Who is it that prevents you? They showed affection towards him, but..."
On the same day, the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They do not believe that people rise from the dead.
"Teacher," they said, "Moses commanded us to do this. When a man dies without having any children, his brother must marry his widow and father children for him, so that his name will not be lost."
There were seven brothers among us. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened to the second, third, and even the seventh brother.
Finally, the woman died.
So, when the dead rise, whose wife will she be? All seven were married to her.
Jesus answered them, "You are wrong, because you do not know the Scriptures, nor the power of God."
For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.
"And whatever you spend, He will replace it, and He is the Best of Providers. And whatever Allah has created, He creates it for a purpose, and He will give it new life, and to Him will be their final return, and He will revive it, for He is Omnipotent."
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob" (Exodus 3:6). "He is not the God of the dead, but of the living."
When the people heard this, they paid close attention to what he taught. The most important commandment.
When the Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus, they gathered together.
One of them, an expert in the law, tested Jesus with a question.
"Teacher," he asked, "which commandment is the most important in the law?"
Jesus answered, "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be
This is the first and most important commandment.
"You shall love your neighbor as yourself." (Deuteronomy 19:18)
"All that is written in the book and by the prophets is based on these two things." Who is the Son of Man?
The Pharisees gathered together. Jesus asked them,
"What do you think about Christ? Who are his parents?" They answered, "He is the son of David."
He said to them, "Why then does David call him 'Lord'?" The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. David said,
"The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool' (Psalm 110:1)"
If David calls him "Sir," what is his son?
No one could answer him in a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him any questions.
Jesus condemns the Pharisees and the teachers of the law.
Jesus spoke to the crowd and to his disciples.
"The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat," he said.
"Therefore, you must obey them. Do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do. They do not practice what they preach."
They heap burdens on others' shoulders, but they themselves are unwilling to lift a single finger to move them.
“Everything they do is done for others to see. And on their foreheads and arms they wear small boxes containing verses from the Bible. They make the boxes very wide. And they make the tassels on their garments very long.”
They love to sit in the place of honor at banquets. They also love to be in the most important seats in the temples.
They love to be welcomed in the markets. They love it when people call them "Lord."
"But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers."
Do not call anyone on earth your father; for One is your Father, He who is in heaven.
You are not to be called 'teachers'; you have one teacher, the Christ.
The most important person among you is your servant.
He who raises his head will fall, and he who lowers his head will rise.
"How terrible it will be for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. You yourselves do not enter, and you hinder those who are trying to enter."
(No
"How terrible it is for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You travel everywhere to win one person to your faith. Then you make him twice as much a child of hell as you are.
"How terrible it is for you, blind guides! You say, 'Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is obligated to fulfill his oath.' "
You are blind and stupid! What is more important, gold? Or is it the temple that makes the gold sacred?
You also say, ‘Anyone who swears on the altar is not bound by that oath, but anyone who swears on the gift that is on it is bound by that oath.’
Oh my uncle! Which is more important? Is it the gift? Or the altar that makes the gift sacred?
"So everyone who swears on the altar swears on it and on everything on it.
And everyone who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it.
"And whoever fulfills their covenant with Allah, Allah will fulfill His covenant with them, and He is the All-Knowing, the All-Patient."
"How terrible it is for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices, such as mint, dill, and cumin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law, such as justice, mercy, and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former."
Oh, you guides of the blind! You remove the smallest insect from your food. But you swallow a whole camel!
"How terrible it is for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed. You only want to please yourselves.
A blind scholar! First, clean the inside of the cup and plate. Then the outside will also be clean.
"How terrible it will be for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You are like tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean.
This is the case with you. From the outside, you appear to be doing what is right. But on the inside, you are full of what is wrong. You pretend to be what you are not.
"How terrible it will be for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.
And you say, "If we had been with them, we would have done evil deeds and would not have been helpers of the messengers."
So you bear witness against yourselves. You admit that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
"So complete what the former ones among you have started in sins!"
"O den of venomous snakes! How will you escape the painful punishment?"
Therefore I send you prophets and wise men and teachers. You will kill some of them. You will crucify some of them. You will flog others in your synagogues. You will drive them from town to town.
"You will pay for all the blood of innocent people shed on earth, from the blood of Abraham to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar."
What I'm going to tell you is true. All this will happen to those who are alive now.
"Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I wanted to gather your children, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!"
Look, your house is empty.
I say to you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.' (Psalm 118:26)
Signs of the End Times
Jesus left the temple. As he was walking away, his disciples came to him and pointed out the temple buildings.
"Do you see all these things?" asked Jesus. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. There his disciples came to him in private and said, "Tell us, when will this happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end?"
Jesus answered, "Watch out! Beware of being deceived."
Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ!' and they will deceive many.
You will hear about wars. You will hear people talking about future wars. Don't be afraid. This is happening. But the end has not come yet.
There will be war between nation and nation. There will be war between kingdom and kingdom. People will go hungry. There will be earthquakes in many places.
All these are the beginning of the birth pangs.
"Then they will hand you over to be beaten and killed, and you will have to bear the expenses of every nation."
At that time, many will turn away from their faith. They will hate each other. They will hand each other over to their enemies.
Many false prophets will arise. They will deceive many people.
As evil increases, the love of most people will grow cold.
But those who endure to the end will be saved.
This good news of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the world. You will be a witness to all nations. Then the end will come.
"The prophet Daniel spoke of the 'abomination that desolates' (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11) which you will one day see standing in the holy place. The reader must understand this.
Then those in Judea will flee to the mountains.
No one on the roof goes down to his house to get something.
No one in the field should go back to get their coat.
Alas for the condition of pregnant women in those days! Alas for the condition of nursing mothers!
Claim that you won't have to flee in winter or on Saturday.
Others will say: "There will be a great distress in those days, greater than has been since the beginning of the world until now, and never will be again."
If time were not shortened, no one would survive. But for the sake of God's chosen people, it will be.
At that time someone will say to you, "Look! Here is the Christ!" or "There he is!" Do not believe it.
False Christs and prophets will appear. They will perform great signs and wonders. They will seek to deceive the chosen people of God, if possible.
See, I told you before.
If anyone tells you it's in the distant desert, don't go to it. Or if anyone tells you it's in the depths of the house, don't believe it.
"The lightning that flashes in the east is seen in the west. So will it be when the Son of Man comes."
Eagles gather wherever there is a corpse.
"In those bitter days, 'the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken' (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)"
"At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory.
He sends His angels with a loud blast of the trumpet, and they gather the elect from all directions, bringing them from one end of the heavens to the other.
Learn from the fig tree. Once its branches become tender and its leaves sprout, you know that summer is near.
In the same way, when you see all those things happening, you know that the end is near. It's at the door.
What I am telling you is the truth. People who are living at that time will certainly not die until all these things happen.
"If the heavens and the earth were to perish, your Lord would not abate from them in the least. He is the One who maintains the balance perfectly on the Day of Resurrection."
No one knows that day or hour. Not even the angels in heaven know. The Son doesn't know. Only the Father knows.
"Remember how it was in the days of Noah. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking. They were marrying. They were giving their daughters in marriage. They were doing all those things until the day Noah entered the ark.
They did not know what would happen until the flood came and took them all. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
There will be two men in the field. One will take and the other will leave.
You'll have a woman grinding with a hand mill, they'll take one and leave the other.
"So beware, for you do not know the day your Lord will come."
You have to understand something. Imagine that the homeowner knows the time the thief will arrive. Then he would keep an eye on his house. He wouldn't let anyone break into his house.
Therefore you also must be ready; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
Imagine that a master put one of his servants in charge of the other servants in his house. The servant's job is to give them their food at the right time. The master wants a faithful and wise servant for this.
It would be better for the servant if the master found him doing his work when he returns.
What I'm going to tell you is true. Mr. will put this servant in charge of everything he owns.
"But what if this slave is wicked? What if he says to himself, 'My master will be gone for a long time'?
If he starts beating other servants. And if he eats and drinks with those who drink a lot.
The master of that slave will come on a day when the slave does not expect him. He will return at an hour the slave does not know.
Then his master will cut him to pieces and send him to the place where sycophants go. There people will weep and gnash their teeth.
The Story of the Ten Virgins
"This is like the kingdom of heaven at that time. Ten virgins took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were fools. And five were wise.
The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take olive oil.
The wise men took the oil in their vessels with their lamps.
The groom didn't come for a long time. The people with him quickly got bored and fell asleep.
At midnight, someone shouted: "Here's the groom! Come and meet him!"
Then all the girls woke up and prepared their lamps.
The fools said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out."
" 'No,' they answered. 'There may not be enough for us all. Instead, go to those who sell oil. Buy some for yourselves."
So they went to buy oil. But while they were on their way, the bridegroom arrived. And the brides who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. Then the door was shut.
Then the other girls came too. "Sir! Sir!" they said. "Open the door for us!"
But he answered, "What I'm going to tell you is true. I don't know you."
"So guard yourselves, lest there be among you three, in a house where one is the killer of another."
And again, it is like a kingdom of heaven. A certain king called his servants, and delivered unto them his goods.
He gave $10,000 to one. He gave $4,000 to another. And he gave $2,000 to the third. The man gave each servant the amount he knew the servant could handle. Then he went on his journey.
The servant who received $10,000 immediately went and started investing his money. He made another $10,000.
He who earns 4000 dirhams earns another 4000 dirhams.
But the man who received $2000 went and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money in it.
After a long time, the master of these servants returned. He wanted to collect all the money they had earned.
The man who received $10,000 brought the other $10,000. He said, 'Sir, you trusted me with $10,000. Look, I have made another $10,000.
His lord answered, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your lord!"
The man who was trusted with about $4000 came. He said, 'Sir, you trusted me with $4000. Look, I have made another $4000.
His lord answered, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your lord!"
Then the man who had received the $2000 came. He said, "Sir, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not scatter seed."
So I was afraid. I went out and hid $2000 for you in the ground. Look, here's what's yours.
His Lord answered: "O wicked, lazy servant! Did you not know that I reap where I have not sown, and that I gather crops where I have not planted a seed?"
Alright, you should've deposited my money in the bank. When I returned, I would've collected it with interest.
Then his master said to the other servants, 'Take the 2000 dollars from him and give it to the one who has 20,000 dollars.
To those who have, more will be given. They will have more than enough. But what about those who have nothing? Even what they have will be taken from them.
Dismiss this worthless servant. Out there in the dark, people will weep and gnash their teeth.
"The Son of Man will come in all his glory. All the angels will be with him. Then he will sit on his glorious throne.
All the nations will be gathered before him. People will be separated into two groups, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
He places the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right, "Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world.
I was hungry. And you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty. And you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger. And you invited me in.
I needed clothes. You gave them to me. I was sick. You nursed me. I was in prison. You came to visit me.
"Then those of them who were believers will come and say, 'Our Lord, when did we thirst and You quenched us, or did we suffer pain and You relieved us?'"
When did we see you a stranger and invite you? When did we see you in need of clothes and give them to you?
When have we seen you sick or in prison and gone to visit you?
The man will say, 'The Lord will say to you, "What I am good at is not talking, but doing what is right for one of these little brothers or sisters of mine."'
Then He will say to those on His left, "Cursed are you! Enter the fire of hell, which is fueled by the blazing flames, as a reward from the Devil and his angels."
I was hungry. But you gave me nothing to eat. I was thirsty. But you gave me nothing to drink.
I was a stranger. But you did not invite me in. I was in need of clothes. But you did not give me any. I was sick and in prison. But you did not visit me.
And they will say, "Our Lord, when did we ever feed You the hungry, or give You drink when You were thirsty, or clothe You when You were naked, or shelter You when You were homeless, or tend You when You were sick, or visit You when You were in prison?"
He will answer: "What I will tell you is true. Anything you have not done for one of the least of these, you have not done for me.
"Then they will flee from it, but the fugitives will not succeed. And these are the ones who believed in Our verses and kept the covenant with Us; they are the believers."
Plan to kill Jesus
Jesus finished saying all these things. Then he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, Caiaphas.
They plotted to arrest Jesus cleverly. They wanted to kill him.
"But not during the feast," they said. "It might stir up trouble." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in the house of Simon the Leper at Bethany.
A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster flask of very precious ointment, and poured it on His head as He sat at the table.
When the pupils saw this, they got angry. "Why this waste?" they asked.
"The perfume could have been sold at a high price. The money could have been given to the poor."
Jesus knew this. He said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a good thing to me."
Tomorrow, by the Lord, you will have the poor with you; but you will not always have me.
She poured perfume over my body to prepare me for burial.
What I am about to tell you is true. What I have done will be proclaimed wherever this good news is preached throughout the world, in remembrance of her." Judas agrees to hand over Jesus.
One of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests.
They asked, "What will you give us if we hand Jesus over to you?" They paid them thirty pieces of silver.
Since then, Judas kept watching for the right opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. The Last Supper
That day was the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover meal?"
So he told him, "Go to a certain man in the city and say to him, 'The Teacher says, "My time is near. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples."'
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover.
When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve.
He said as he ate, "What I am about to tell you is true. One of you will hand me over to my enemies."
The disciples were very sorrowful. And each one began to say to him, "Is it I, Lord?"
Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand with me in the dish, he will betray me."
"The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. Woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born."
It was Judas who would betray him. He said, "It isn't me, Teacher, is it?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is you."
While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take, eat; this is my body."
Then he took the cup, gave thanks, and offered it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you."
This is the blood of the new covenant, poured out for the forgiveness of many.
This is what I tell you. From now on, I will not drink wine with you again until the day I drink it with you in my father's kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus says Peter will fail.
Jesus said to them, "This very night, you will all fall away on account of me. For it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)
"But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee."
Peter answered, "Everyone else may leave because of you. But I never will."
"What I am about to tell you is true," Jesus answered. "This night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times that you know me."
But Peter said, "I may die with you. But I will never say that I don't know you." All the other disciples said the same. Jesus' prayer in Gethsemane
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there to pray."
He took Peter and the sons of Zebedee along with him. And he began to be sorrowful and very troubled.
Then he said to them, "My heart is overwhelmed. I feel like dying. Stay here and keep watch with me."
He walked a little farther. Then he fell on his face to the ground. He prayed, "Father, if possible, take this cup of suffering away from me. Yet not what I want, but what you want."
Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Could you not watch with me for one hour?" asked Peter.
"Be vigilant and pray. Then you will not fall into sin when tempted. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
Jesus went away a second time and prayed, saying, "My Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, unless I drink it, your will be done."
Then he returned. He found them sleeping again. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
So he left them and went away again. A third time he prayed the same thing.
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you sleeping and resting? Look at the green field and the doves. Do you not speak to them?"
Rise! Let us go! Here is the one they deliver to me! Jesus is arrested.
Jesus was speaking until John, one of the twelve disciples, came. He was accompanied by a large crowd carrying swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Judas, who was to betray Jesus, had arranged a signal with them. "The man I kiss," he said, "is the one; arrest him."
So John went to Jesus at that time and said, "Teacher, greetings!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you have come to do." Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' companions seized his sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
"Put your sword in its place," Jesus said to him. "For all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you think I cannot ask my Father for help? He will send an army of over 70,000 angels at once.
But how, then, do prophecies come true? They say that this must happen.
At that time, Jesus spoke to the crowd. "Do I lead a band of armed men against you?" he asked. "Why do you come with swords and clubs to arrest me? I sat daily in the temple teaching the people, and you did not arrest me."
"But all this has taken place that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all his disciples left him and fled. Jesus before the Sanhedrin
Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
It is not far away; follow Peter. He went straight to the high priest's courtyard. He entered and sat with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.
But they found no evidence, although many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two other witnesses appeared.
They said, "This man claimed, 'I can destroy the temple of God, and I can rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up and asked Jesus, "Do you not answer the accusations these men are bringing against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."
"Yes," Jesus answered, "it is as you say. But I tell you all, in the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin, moving their hands, cried out, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we still need witnesses? You have heard the blasphemy yourselves!"
"What are you going to say?" they said, "He who must die, must die!"
Then they licked his face. One of them hit him with his fist. Others slapped him.
They said, "O Jesus, tell us, who hit you?" Peter said, "I do not know Jesus."
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A servant girl came to him. "I also was with Jesus of Galilee," she said.
But before all these, Peter said it wasn't so. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.
Then he went out to the gate that leads to the garden. Another woman saw him from another gate and said to the people, "This one was with Jesus of Nazareth."
And again he said it was not so. With an oath he said, "I do not know the man!"
A little later, he approached Peter, who was standing there. "You must be one of them," they said. "Your way of speaking gives you away."
Then he began to curse and swear by his own soul. He declared, "I do not know the man!" And immediately a rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him: "Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times." And he went out and wept bitterly.
Judas hangs himself.
It was early morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to crucify Jesus.
They bound his hands and led him away. Then they handed him over to Peter, who was the governor.
The one who had betrayed him, seeing that Jesus was condemned, felt remorse and deep sorrow for what he had done. So he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders.
"I made a mistake," he said. "I released an innocent man." "So what?" they replied. "That's your problem."
So John threw the manna in the temple and went away. Then he went away and committed suicide.
The temple priests collected the coins. They said, "Putting this money in the temple treasury is a crime. It is blood money. It was paid for the death of a man."
They decided to use the money to buy a cemetery plot. People coming from other countries will be buried there.
That is why it is still called the Field of Blood to this day.
Then the words of Jeremiah the prophet came to him, saying, "They have given the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him who was valued by the sons of Israel."
"They paid me thirty pieces of silver, as the Lord commanded me." (Zechariah 11:12,13; Mark 19:1-13; 32:6-9) Jesus is presented to Pilate.
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "Yes, as you say."
But when the high priest and the elders asked him, he did not answer.
Then Pilate asked him, "Don't you hear the testimony they are giving against you?"
But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge. The governor was quite amazed.
It was the governor's custom at Easter to release one prisoner. The people could choose whom they wanted.
In that case, they had a famous prisoner named Barba'a.
So when Pilate had Jesus brought out to them, he asked, "Who do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Messiah?"
Pilate knew that the chief priests were envious. He knew that this was the reason they had delivered Jesus to him.
While Pilate was sitting on the judge's bench, his wife sent him a message. She said, "Have nothing to do with that man. He is innocent. I have suffered much in a dream this night because of this man."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus put to death.
"Which of the two do you want me to release?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered.
"What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ?" asked Pilate. And they all answered, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What has he done?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
Pilate saw that it was getting him nowhere. In fact, the crowd was beginning to get restless. So he took a basin, washed his hands in front of them, and said, "I am innocent of this man's blood. You are responsible!"
Everyone answered: "We and our children will bear the responsibility for his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas. But he had Jesus flogged, and then handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
The governor's soldiers took Jesus to the palace, which was called the Praetorium. And all the other soldiers gathered around him.
They took off his clothes and put a shining robe on him.
Then they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!"
They cursed him. They struck him repeatedly on the head with a whip.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him and put his clothes back on him. Then they led him away to crucify him on a cross. Jesus was crucified.
As they led him out, they met a man from Cyrene named Simon, and they forced him to carry Jesus' cross.
They came to a place called Golgotha. Golgotha means "place of the skull."
There they mixed wine with various bitter spices and offered it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it.
When they crucified him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots.
They sat there guarding him.
They placed a sign above his head that read: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
Two thieves were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
They are the ones who passed by, shouting at Jesus and mocking him. And they shook their heads.
He said, "So you will destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days? Save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"
Likewise, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders mocked him.
"He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
He trusts in God. Let God save him now if He wants to. It is he who said, "I am the Son of God."
Even the robbers who were crucified with Jesus mocked him. The death of Jesus.
From noon until three, darkness covered the whole earth.
Around the third hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which means "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of those who stood there heard Jesus cry out. They said, "He is calling Elijah."
Immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, and put it on a reed. Then he offered it to Jesus to drink.
The others said, "Leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah will come to save him."
After Jesus cried out loudly again, he died.
Then, at that moment, the curtain of the mosque was torn from top to bottom. The earth shook, and the rocks split.
The graves were opened. Many of the saints who had died were brought back to life.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus had ascended into heaven, they entered the holy city. There they appeared to many people.
The Roman commander and Jesus' guards saw the earthquake and what had happened. They were terrified. They cried out: "Surely he was the Son of God!"
Not far away, there were many women watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs.
Mary Magdalene was among them. Mary the mother of James and Joseph was there as well. So was the mother of the sons of Zebedee. Jesus was buried.
As evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Take Joseph's body and wrap it in a clean cloth.
He placed her in his new tomb that he had hewn out of the rock. He rolled a large stone in front of the entrance to the tomb. Then he went away.
Mary Magdalene and the other woman were sitting there in front of the tomb. The guards at the tomb.
The next day was the day after the Preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
"My lord," they said, "we remember something the liar said while he was still alive. He claimed, 'In three days I will return.'"
So give orders for the tomb to be made secure until the third day, otherwise his disciples may go and steal him away, and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first."
"Take some guards with you," Pilate answered. "Go. Make the tomb as secure as you can."
So they went and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone and setting a guard.
Jesus ascends to heaven.
Saturday was over. Dawn had broken on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other woman went to check the tomb.
There was a strong earthquake. The angel of the Lord came down from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. The stone was rolled back and the angel sat on it.
His body shone like lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were trembling and almost falling down in fear of him.
The angel said to the woman, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.
No! He's right, they ascended! Go and see the place where they were hiding.
Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' That is my message for you."
The women fled from the tomb. They were afraid, but also filled with joy. They ran to tell the disciples.
Then Jesus, peace be upon him, came and said, "Peace be upon you." So they came to him, took hold of his feet, and asked for forgiveness for him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me." The guards went and reported to the chief priests.
As the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
When the chief priests met with the elders, they devised a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
They told the soldiers, "We want you to say, 'His disciples came at night. They stole his body while we were sleeping.'"
If the governor hears this report, we'll pay him off. That'll keep you out of trouble.
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus' last commands to his disciples.
Then the eleventh disciple went to Galilee. And they went to the mountain which Jesus had commanded them.
When they saw him, they bowed down to him. But some had their doubts.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
Teach them to obey everything you command them. And you can be sure that I will always be with you, to the end.
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Long ago, the prophet Isaiah wrote: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way" (Malachi 3:1).
"A voice cries out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.' (Isaiah 40:3)"
And so John came. He baptized people in the desert. He also preached that people should be baptized and repent of their sins, and then God would forgive them.
All the people from the countryside of Judea and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. And when they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John was wearing clothes made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
Here is what John was preaching: "After me comes one who is mightier than I, so strong that I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals."
I will wipe you clean with water. But he who is wiped clean with the Holy Spirit will endure Jesus' wiping and temptation.
In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
Jesus came up out of the water. And immediately he saw the heavens torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.
A voice from heaven spoke to him. It said, “You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.”
And the Holy Spirit descended upon Jesus and drove him into the wilderness.
He remained in the desert for 40 days. There, the devil tempted him. Wild animals did not harm him. Angels took care of him. Jesus chooses the first disciples.
After John was imprisoned, Jesus went to Galilee. He preached the gospel of God.
"The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God is near. Repent of your sins and believe in the good news!"
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting their nets into the lake, for they were fishermen.
"Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will make you fishers of men."
So they left their nets at once and followed him.
Then Jesus went a little further with his disciples, and saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who also were in a ship mending their nets.
So he rebuked them, and said, "Bring him to me." And they brought the boy to him. Then the spirit threw him down so that he foamed at the mouth, and he gn
Jesus and his companions came to Capernaum. And on the Sabbath day, he entered the synagogue and began to teach.
People were impressed by his instructions. He taught them as one with authority. He did not speak like the scribes.
Then a man who was possessed by a demon came from the synagogue and cried out.
"What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!"
"Be silent!" Jesus said sternly. "Come out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Then it came out of him with a scream.
So the people were amazed at him. They said that day, "This is but a man like us, who eats food and drinks beverages. Yet he claims, 'I am a messenger of God sent to you,
The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout all the region of Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left the temple and went at once with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed with a fever. They told Jesus about her.
So he went to her. He took her hand and helped her up. And the fever left her body. Then she began to serve them.
That evening after sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who were sick and those possessed by demons.
All the people in the city gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many of them. They were suffering from all kinds of diseases. He also cast out many demons. But he would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prayed in a solitary place.
It was still dark, dawn having just broken, when Jesus got up, left the house, and went away by himself to a solitary place. There he prayed.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they shouted, "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus answered, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages. I must preach there also. That is why I have come."
So he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons. And he healed every disease and every affliction among the people.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus. He knelt down and begged him, saying, "If you choose to make me clean, you can."
Jesus was very troubled. He reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing to do it," he said. "Be 'clean'!"
The disease left him immediately. He was cured.
Jesus sent the man away immediately. And he gave the man a stern warning.
"Don't say this to anyone," he said. "Go and show yourself to the priest. Offer the sacrifices commanded by Moses. This will be evidence to the priest and the people that you are 'clean'."
But the man went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer enter a town openly. He remained in secluded places, but people still came to him from everywhere.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk.
A few days later, Jesus again entered Capernaum, and the people heard that he had come home.
A great multitude gathered together, so that there was no room, not even outside the door. And Jesus preached the word to them.
Four of the arrivals were carrying a man who couldn't walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after digging out the tiles, they lowered the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying.
Jesus saw their faith, and he said to the man, "Child, your sins are forgiven."
Some law professors were sitting there. They were thinking.
"Who is this person talking like that? They're saying some really bad things! Only God can forgive sins!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he said to them, "Why are you thinking these things?"
Is it easier to say to this man, "Your sins are forgiven you"? Or to say, "Rise, take up your bed and walk"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus spoke to the man who couldn't walk.
"I tell you," he said, "get up. Take your Quran and go home."
The man rose and picked up his mat. Then he walked away while everyone watched. They were all amazed. They praised God and said, "We have never seen anything like this before!" Jesus chooses Levi.
Jesus went out again beside the Sea of Galilee. A large crowd came to him. He began to teach them.
As he walked, he saw Lazarus the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's post. Jesus said to him, "Follow me." And he rose and followed him.
Later Jesus was at a dinner party in Levi's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples. They were part of the large crowd that was following Jesus.
There were some teachers of the law who were Pharisees. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. So they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this and said to them, "It is not those who are healthy who need a doctor, but those who are sick. I did not come to call the righteous to repentance, but sinners." Jesus asks about fasting.
The disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came to Jesus and said to him, "The disciples of John fast, and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast. Why do they not fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them. On that day they will fast.
"No one sews a new patch on an old garment, for the new patch would pull away from the old cloth, making the tear even worse."
You can't pour new wine into old wineskins. If you do, the new wine will burst the old wineskins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, you pour new wine into new wineskins. Jesus is IN IN IN
On one of the sabbath days, Jesus was walking through wheatfields with his disciples. And the disciples began to pluck some of the heads of grain.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look, your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath."
He replied, "Have you never read what David did? He and his men were hungry. They needed food.
That was in the days of Abiathar the high priest. David went into the house of God, and ate the shewbread, which was lawful only for the priests to eat. And he gave also to his companions.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
"Therefore the Son of Man is a master even of the Sabbath day."
Healing on Saturday
Once Jesus entered the temple. There was a man with a withered and crooked hand.
Some Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They were watching him closely. They wanted to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus spoke to the man who had a withered and paralyzed hand. He said to him, "Stand up in front of everyone."
Then Jesus said to them, "What does the law say we should do on the Sabbath? Make it a day for good deeds or for evil? To save life or to destroy it?" But they remained silent.
Jesus saw the people and was indignant. He was displeased with them because their hearts were hardened. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he did, and his hand was restored as good as new.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians against Jesus, how they might kill Him. Multitudes were following Jesus.
Jesus went with his disciples to the Sea of Galilee. Large crowds from Galilee followed him.
The people heard all that Jesus was doing. And many came to him, from Judea, Jerusalem, and all the surrounding regions, including Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and around Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowd, Jesus asked His disciples to prepare a small boat for Him to sit in, so that the people would not crowd around Him.
Jesus healed many people. Therefore, the sick were pushing forward to touch him.
When the people saw the evil spirits, they fell on their faces. The spirits cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them not to tell who he was. Jesus appoints the twelve apostles.
Jesus went up a mountain. He called some people to come to him, and they came.
He appointed twelve of them and called them apostles. And they were with him. He also sent them out to preach.
They will have authority to cast out demons.
So Jesus said to the ten, "Go to the sea of Galilee, and there you will find me." And going, they found him in the boat, as he had said to them.
There were Jacob, son of Zebedee, and his brother John. Jesus gave them the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder.
And Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, and James, the son of Alphaeus. Also, Thaddaeus and Simon the Zealot.
John the Apostle was one of them. He was the one who would betray Jesus to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebub.
Jesus entered a house. Another crowd gathered. The crowd was so large that Jesus and his disciples could not eat.
His family heard about it. So they went to take care of him. They said, "He's gone off the deep end."
There were some scribes. They came down from Jerusalem. They said, "He is under the authority of Beelzebul! He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons!"
So Jesus said to them, "How can Satan drive out Satan?"
If a kingdom fights itself, it will not stand.
If the family is divided, it does not stand.
