Jesus called a little child to him. He put the child among them.
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven."

Whoever welcomes one such child in my name, welcomes me.
But what if someone leads one of these little ones who believe in me into sin? If he does, it would be better for him to have a large millstone tied around his neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea.

If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or one foot than to be thrown into hell with two hands and two feet. There, the fire never goes out.
If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. The parable of the lost sheep.
Make sure you don't underestimate any of these little ones. That's what I'm telling you. Their angels in heaven may go at any time to visit my Father in heaven.
No
What do you see? Imagine a man who has 100 sheep and loses one of them. Won't he leave the 99 in the mountains and go to look for the one that is lost?
What I'm about to tell you is true. If he were to find that sheep, he would be more delighted than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off.
Thus your Father in heaven is also perfect, and does not want to lose any of these little ones. When one of them sins against you
If your brother sins against you, go to him and tell him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won him over.
But what if they do not listen to you? Take one or two others along with you. The scripture says, "On the evidence of two or three witnesses every word may be established." (Deuteronomy 19:15)
But what if he refuses to listen even to the witnesses? Tell it to the church. And what if he refuses to listen even to the church? Treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
What I tell you is true. What you bind on earth will be bound in heaven. What you loosen on earth will be loosened in heaven.
Again, I tell you, if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask, my Father in heaven will do it for you.
"Where two or three are gathered in my name, I am with them." "A merciless servant"
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."
The Kingdom of Heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
When the king started doing that, a man who owed him millions of dollars was brought to him.
The man was unable to pay. So his master ordered him. The man, his wife, children, and all that he owned had to be sold to pay off his debt.
The servant fell to his knees before him. "Give me time," he pleaded. "I'll pay everything back."
The lady felt sorry for him, forgave him, and let him go.
But then the servant went out and found one of the other servants who had some dollars on him. He grabbed him and started choking him. "Pay me what you owe me!" he said.
The other slave fell to his knees. "Give me time," he begged. "I will pay you back."
But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and threw the man into prison until he could pay back what he owed.
The other servants saw what happened and were very disturbed by it. They went and told their master everything that had occurred.
Then the master called the first servant and said, "Wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me.
Why didn't you have mercy on the other servant as you had mercy on me?
In his anger, his master handed him over to the guards. He will be punished until he pays back everything he owes.
So will My heavenly Father also do to you all, if you do not forgive your brother from your hearts.
Jesus teaches about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Large crowds followed him. He healed them there.
Some Pharisees came to test Jesus, asking, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus replied, "Have you not read that the Creator made them male and female from the beginning? (Genesis 1:27)"
He said, "Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife, and they become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
They are no longer two, but one. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.
They asked, "Why then did Moses command to give a woman a bill of divorce and send her away?"
Jesus replied, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of heart, but it was not this way from the beginning.
Here's what I say: Any man who divorces his wife and marries another is an adulterer. A man has no right to divorce his wife unless she has been unfaithful to him.
The students said to him, "If this is the case between husband and wife, it's better not to get married."
Jesus answered, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining single. Only those whom God has helped to live without marriage can accept it.
"Some men cannot have children because they were born that way. Some were made that way by others. Others have made themselves that way for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever can accept this way of living should do so." They brought little children to Jesus.
Some people brought little children to Jesus, wanting him to place his hands on them and pray over them. But the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he departed from there. Jesus and the rich young man.
A man approached Jesus and asked him, "Teacher, what good deeds must I do to have eternal life?"
"Why do you ask Me what is good?" Jesus replied. "There is only one God who is good. If you wish to enter the kingdom, keep the commandments."
"Which?" asked the man. Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness."
Obey your father and your mother. (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) And "love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
The young man said, "I have obeyed all those commands. What should I do next?"
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell all you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me."
When the young man heard this, he went away sorrowful. For he was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When the disciples heard this, they were astonished. And they asked, "Then who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter answered and said, "We have left all and followed you! What then shall we have?"
"What I am about to tell you is true," Jesus said to them. "When all things are renewed, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. Then, those of you who have followed me will sit on twelve thrones. You will judge the twelve tribes of Israel."
Everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.
But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.
The Story of the Workers in the Vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
He agreed to give them their usual day's wage. Then he sent them to his vineyard.
Around nine o'clock in the morning he went out again. He saw others standing in the market square doing nothing.
He told them, "Go and work in my vineyard. I will pay you what is right."
So they set off. "He went out again around noon and at three o'clock and did the same thing.
Around five o'clock he went out and saw others still standing around him. He asked them, "Why do you keep standing here all day doing nothing?"
"Because no one hired us," they answered. "He said to them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard.'"
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to the man in charge of the workers, "Call the workers and give them their pay. Start with the last ones hired and then go to the first."
The hired workers came around five o'clock and each received their usual daily wage.
So when the first of those hired came, they expected to receive more. But each of them also received their usual daily wage.
When they received it, they began to suspect its owner.
They said, "Those people who were recently hired only worked for one hour." "You paid them the same amount as us. We did most of the work and stayed under the scorching sun all day."
The owner replied to one of them, "My friend, I am dealing with you fairly. Didn't you agree to work for the usual daily wage?"
Take your money and go. I want to give those I recently hired the same salary I gave you.
Don't I have the right to do as I please with my own money? Do you feel cheated because I gave others so generously?
"So the last will be first, and the first will be last." Jesus speaks again of his coming death.
Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. Along the way, he took the twelve disciples aside to speak to them.
He said, "We are going up to Jerusalem." "The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death."
"Then they will hand him over to the Gentiles. They will mock him, spit on him, and flog him. They will crucify him, and on the third day he will rise again!" A woman asks Jesus for a favor.
The mother of Zebedes sons came to Jesus with her sons. Falling at his feet, she asked him for a favor.
"What do you want?" asked Jesus. She said, "Grant that one of my two sons may sit at your right hand in your kingdom, and that the other may sit on your left."
Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking." "Can you drink the cup that I am about to drink?" They answered, "We can."
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The other ten pupils heard about it and were angry with the brothers.
Jesus called them together and said, "You know that the rulers in the Gentile world lord it over their people, and their high officials exercise power over them.
Do not be like that. Instead, whoever wants to be among you must be a servant to you.
And whoever wants to be first among you must be your servant.
Be like the Son of Man, who did not come to be served, but to serve others. He came to give his life as a ransom for many. (Two blind men received their sight)
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, and a large crowd followed them.
Two blind men sat by the roadside. They heard that Jesus was passing by. So they cried out, saying, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The crowd ordered them to stop. He asked them to be quiet. But the two men shouted even louder, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stood still and called out to them, saying, "What do you want me to do for you?"
"Sir," they answered, "we want to be able to see."
Jesus felt deep compassion for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately they could see. And they followed him.
Jesus' Entry into Jerusalem
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,
He said to them, "Go to the village ahead of you. When you enter it, you will find a donkey tied there, with a colt beside her. Untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone says something to you, tell them the Lord needs them. The Master will send the money right away.
This happened so that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled. He said,
Say to the daughter of Zion, "Behold, your King is coming to you. He is humble, and mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey." (Zechariah 9:9)
The disciples went and did what Jesus commanded them.
Bring the donkey and the colt. Place their cloaks on them. Then Jesus sat on the cloaks.
A very large crowd gathered and spread their coats on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
Some people went ahead of him, and some followed. They all shouted, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest heaven!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was moved. The people asked, "Who is this?"
The crowds answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus drove out the temple.
Jesus entered the temple area. He began to drive out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers. He also overturned the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer' (Isaiah 56:7), but you make it a den of robbers." (Jeremiah 7:11)
The blind and the lame came to Jesus in the temple, and he healed them there.
The chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David," in the temple courts. When they saw this, they were indignant.
"Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," answered Jesus. "Haven't you read this in the Scriptures? 'The lips of children and infants you have ordained to praise you'." (Psalm 8:2)
Then Jesus departed from the multitude, and went away into the mountain alone. And when he had spent the night there, he went out early in the morning to the olive grove.
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the roadside. He approached it and found only leaves on it. He said to it, "Never bear fruit!" Suddenly the tree withered.
When the pupils saw this, they were amazed. They asked, "How did the tree dry up so quickly?"
Jesus answered and said to them, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and thrown into the sea,' it will happen."
"If you believe, you will receive what you ask for when you pray." "Jesus' authority is questioned."
Jesus entered the temple courts. While he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and asked, "By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered, "I will ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
Where did John's baptism come from? Was it from heaven, or from men? They argued with each other about this. They said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Why then did you not believe him?'"
But what if we say "of men"? We are afraid of people. Everyone thought John was a prophet.
So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." And Jesus said to them, "Then I will also tell you by what authority I do these things. The parable of the two sons."
What do you see in this? A man had two sons; he went to the first and said, "Son, go and work in the vineyard today."
"I won't do it," the son replied. But then he changed his mind and went.
Then the father went to the other son. He said the same thing. The son answered, "I will, sir." But he did not go.
"Which of the two sons did what his father wanted?" "The first," they answered. Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes will enter the kingdom of God before you."
John came to teach you the right way to live, and you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and prostitutes believed him. I saw that. But even then you did not turn away from your sins and believe him. The parable of the tenants.
Hear another story. There was a man who owned some land, so he planted vineyards. He put a wall around them. He dug a trench for the winepress inside. And he also built a watchtower. He leased the vineyards to some farmers. Then he went on a journey.
When the time of the harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants, and commanded them to gather his share of the fruits.
But the tenants seized his slaves. They beat one of them. They killed another. They threw a stone at the third to kill him.
Then the man sent other servants to the tenants. He sent more than he had sent the first time. The tenants treated them the same way.
In the end, he sent his son to them. He said, "They will fear my son."
But the tenants saw the son coming. They said to each other, "This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours."
So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard. Then they killed him.
When the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do to these tenants?
"Those wicked men shall perish," they answered. "Then the vineyard will be let out to other husbandmen. They shall render the fruits in their seasons."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
So I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to those who bear its fruit.
Anyone who falls on that stone will be dashed to pieces. But the stone will crush whoever falls on it.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' stories. They knew he was speaking about them.
So they looked for a way to arrest him. But they feared the crowds. The people thought Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Story
Jesus told them more parables. He said:
Here is how the kingdom of heaven is like: A king prepared a wedding feast for his son.
He sent his servants to the dinner guests. He had told the servants to come beforehand, but they refused.
Then he sent some more servants, saying, "Tell the guests, 'I have prepared my wedding feast. My oxen and fattened cattle are all butchered and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.'"
But people paid no attention. One went to his field, and another to his work.
He kept the rest as servants. He treated them badly and killed them in the end.
The king was furious. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed the murderers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants, "The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy."
Go to the street corners. Invite to dinner anyone you find.
So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad. Soon the wedding hall was filled with guests.
King entered to see the guests. He noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.
'My friend,' he asked, 'How did you get in here without your wedding clothes?' The man couldn't think of anything to say.
Then the king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet. Cast him out into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
"Many are called, but few are chosen." "Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?"
The Pharisees went out. They made a plan to entrap Jesus in His words.
They sent their disciples to him, and with them some of the Herodians. They said, "Teacher, we know that you are sincere, and teach the way of God in accordance with truth. You do not care about anyone's opinion of you, and you do not regard a person's status.
So tell us, then, what do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
But Jesus knew their evil intentions. He said, "You hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the currency that people use to pay taxes. "Bring him a silver coin."
He asked them, "Whose picture is this? And who are its words?"
"Caesar," they replied. Then he said to them, "Give back to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and to God what belongs to God."
When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away. "Marriage is when the dead rise."
On the same day, the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They do not believe that people rise from the dead.
They said, "Master," this is what Moses told us. If a man dies and leaves no children, his brother must take his wife and father children for his brother.
There were seven brothers among us. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened to the second and third brothers. It continued until it reached the seventh brother.
Finally, the woman died.
Well, when the dead rise, who will be her husband? She's married to all seven of them.
Jesus answered, "You are wrong, because you do not know the Scriptures, nor the power of God.
When the dead rise, they will not marry. Nor will their fathers give them in marriage. They will be like the angels in heaven.
What about the resurrection of the dead? Didn't you read what God said to you?
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." (Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching. The most important commandment.
When the Pharisees heard that the Sadducees had been silenced by Jesus, they gathered together.
One of them, a lawyer, tested him with a question.
"Teacher," he asked, "which is the most important commandment in the law?"
Jesus replied, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Love him with all your mind." (Deuteronomy 6:5)
This is the first and most important thing.
"You shall love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"All that is written in the Law and the Prophets is based on these two commandments." "Who is the son of Christ?"
The Pharisees gathered together. Jesus asked them,
"What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?" They answered, "The son of David."
He said to them, "Why then does David call him 'my Lord'? The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. David said,
The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool." (Psalm 110:1)
So if David calls him "Sir," what is David's son?
No one could answer him in a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him another question.
Jesus condemns the Pharisees and the teachers of the law.
Jesus spoke to the crowds and his disciples.
"The scribes and Pharisees sit on Moses' seat," he said.
So you must obey them. Do everything they tell you. But don't do what they do. They don't practice what they preach.
They tie heavy baggage and place it on the shoulders of others. But they are not willing to lift a single finger to help carry it.
Everything they do is for others to see. On their foreheads and arms they wear small boxes containing verses from the Quran. They make the boxes very wide. And they make the ribbons on their coats very long.
They love to sit in the places of honor at feasts. They also love to get the most important seats in temples.
They love to be welcomed in the city's markets. They love to be called "Rebbi."
But no one should call you "Rabbi." You have only one Teacher, and you are all brothers.
Do not call anyone on earth 'father,' for you have one Father, and he is in heaven.
No one should call you 'Teacher.' You have only one Teacher, the Christ.
The greatest among you will be your servant.
He who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.
How terrible it will be for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. You do not enter yourselves, and you hinder those who are trying to enter.
No
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are.
How can you be blind guides, saying, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is obligated'?
You are blind and foolish! What is more important? Is it gold? Or is it the temple that makes gold sacred?
You also say, 'If anyone swears by the altar, it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift that is on it, he is bound by his oath.'
Oh my! What is more important? Is it giving? Or is it the altar that sanctifies giving?
So whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.
And he who swears by the temple, swears by his name and by him who dwells in it.
And whoever swears by the sky, swears by the throne of Allah and by Him who sits upon it.
How terrible you are, you lawyers and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You give a tenth of your mint, dill, and cumin to God, but you neglect the most important matters of the law: justice, mercy, and faithfulness. You should practice the latter without neglecting the former.
O blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed. You only want to please yourselves.
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside will also be clean.
How terrible it will be for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything else that is unclean.
This applies to you as well. From the outside, you appear to be doing the right thing. But on the inside, you're full of what's wrong. You pretend to be something you're not.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.
And they say, "If we had lived in the days of those who came before us, we would not have done as they did. We would not have assisted in the killing of the prophets."
For you are bearing witness against yourselves that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
So complete the sins that were started by those who lived before you!
O nest of venomous snakes! How will you escape being condemned to hell?
For I will send you prophets and wise men and teachers. You will kill some of them, and crucify others, and scourge them in your synagogues, and chase them from city to city.
You will pay the price for the blood of all the righteous people that has been shed on earth, from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
What I'm about to tell you is true. All of this will happen to those who are alive now.
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I have wanted to gather your children as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!
Look, your house is empty.
I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord." (Psalm 118:26)
Signs of the End of Time
Jesus left the temple. As he was walking away, his disciples came to him and pointed out the temple buildings.
"Do you see all these things?" asked Jesus. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. Then the disciples came to him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end of the world?"
Jesus answered, "Be on your guard! Beware of all false prophets.
Many will come in my name, saying, "I am the Christ!" and will deceive many.
You will hear of wars. You will also hear people talking about wars in the future. Do not be alarmed. These things must happen. But the end is not yet.
Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
All this is the beginning of the pains of childbirth.
Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations because of my name.
At that time, many will turn away from their faith. They will exchange hatred. They will betray one another.
Many false prophets will arise. They will lead many astray.
For the abundance of wickedness will cause the love of many to grow cold.
But whoever endures to the end will be saved.
This good news of the kingdom will be preached throughout the world, to all nations, and then the end will come.
The prophet Daniel spoke of the "abomination that desolates" (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11). One day you will see it standing in the holy place. The reader must understand this.
Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains.
No one on the roof should go down to their house to get anything.
No one in the field should go back to get their coat.
How terrible it would be in those days for pregnant women! How frightening it would be for nursing mothers!
They claim not to have to flee in winter or on Saturday.
There will be terrible suffering in those days, worse than at any time from the beginning of the world until now, and never to be matched again.
If time were not shortened, no one would survive. But thanks to God's chosen people, it will be.
At that time, someone may say to you, "Look! Here is the Christ!" or "There he is!" Do not believe it.
False Christs and prophets will appear. They will perform great signs and wonders. They will try to deceive the chosen people of God, if possible.
See, I told you before.
If someone tells you, "It's in the middle of the desert," don't go there. Or if someone says, "It's deep inside the house," don't believe them.
The lightning comes from the east and is seen in the west. So will it be when the Son of Man comes.
Ostriches will gather wherever they find a dead body.
"Immediately after the terrible suffering of those days, 'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will be shaken.' (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
At that time, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. All the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory.
He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet. He will gather His chosen people from the four directions. They will bring them from the ends of the heavens to the other ends.
Learn a lesson from the fig tree. Once its branches become tender and it puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near.
Similarly, when you see all those events happening, you know that the end is near. It's right at the door.
What I am telling you is the truth. People who are living at that time will certainly not die until all these things happen.
"Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. No one knows about that day or hour."
No one knows the day or the hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
Remember how it was in the days of Noah. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking. They were marrying. They were giving their daughters in marriage. They were doing all those things until the day Noah entered the ark.
They had no idea what was going to happen until the flood came and took them all. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
There will be two men in the field. One will be taken and the other left.
Two women will grind using a manual grinding stone. One will be taken and the other left.
So be on your guard: you do not know on what day your Lord will come.
You must understand something. Imagine if the homeowner had known what time of night the thief would come. He would have guarded the house. He wouldn't have allowed his home to be broken into.
Therefore you also must be ready; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
Imagine a master who puts one of his servants in charge of the other servants in his house. The servant's task is to distribute food to them at the right time. The master wants a faithful and wise servant to do this.
It will be good for the servant if his master finds him doing his work when the master returns.
What I am about to tell you is true. This master will give that slave authority over all that he possesses.
But what if the slave is wicked? What if he says in his heart, "My master is long gone"?
What if he starts beating other servants? And what if he eats and drinks with those who drink a lot?
The master of that slave will return on a day when the slave does not expect him. And he will return at an hour when the slave does not know.
Then Mr. will cut it into pieces. He will send it to the place where the competitors go. There they will express their sorrow and grind their teeth in anger.
"A Tale of Ten Brides"
Thus shall the kingdoms of heaven be at that time. Ten virgins took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were ignorant. Five were wise.
The fools took their lamps but they didn't bring any olive oil with them.
The wise men took oil in their flasks with their lamps.
The groom didn't come for a long time. So all the bride's friends got tired and fell asleep.
At midnight, someone shouted: "Here comes the bridegroom! Go out to meet him!"
Then all the virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.
The fools said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil. Our lamps are going out."
"No," they answered. "There may not be enough for us all. Instead, go to those who sell oil. Buy some for yourselves."
So they went to buy oil. But as they were going, the bridegroom arrived. The brides who were ready went in with the bridegroom to the wedding dinner. Then the door was shut.
Later, the rest of the bride's friends also came. They said, "Sir! Sir! Open the door for us!"
But he answered and said, "The things I tell you are true. I do not know you."
"Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect." - The Parable of the Three Workers.
Again, it will be like a kingdom of heaven. There was a man who went on a journey. He called his servants and entrusted his property to them.
He gave $10,000 to one. He gave $4,000 to another. He gave $2,000 to the third. The man gave each servant an amount of money he knew the servant could take care of. Then he set out on his journey.
The servant who received $10,000 went immediately and invested his money. He made another $10,000.
He who earned $4000 earned an additional $4000.
But the man who received $2000 went and dug a hole in the ground. He hid his master's money there.
After a long time, the master of these servants returned. He wanted to collect all the money they had earned.
The man who received $10,000 brought the other $10,000. He said, "Sir, you trusted me with $10,000. Look, I've made another $10,000."
His lord answered, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Come and share your master's joy!"
The man who had $4000 also came. He said, "Sir, I invested $4000 in your trust. Look, I've made another $4000."
His lord answered, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Come and share your master's joy!"
Then the man who received $2000 came. He said, "Sir, I knew you were a tough man. You reap where you did not sow. You gather crops where you did not plant seeds."
So I was afraid. I went out and buried your $2000 in the ground. Look, here's your money.
His master answered, "You wicked and lazy servant! Did you not know that I reap where I did not sow? Did you not know that I gather crops where I did not plant seeds?
Alright, you should have deposited my money in the bank. When I returned, I would have reclaimed it with interest.
Then his master said to the other servants, "Take away the one thousand dollars from him, and give it to the one who has ten thousand dollars."
To those who have more, more will be given, and they will have an abundance. But from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away.
Get that worthless slave out of here. Out there in the dark, people will wail and gnash their teeth. "The sheep and the camels"
The Son of Man will come in all his glory. All the angels will be with him. Then he will sit on his glorious throne.
All the nations will be gathered before Him. People will be separated into two groups. It will be like a shepherd separating the sheep from the goats.
He will put the sheep on his right hand and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right, “Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world.”
I was hungry. And you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty. And you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger. And you invited me in.
I needed clothes. And you gave them to me. I was sick. And you took care of me. I was in prison. And you came to visit me.
Then the righteous will answer him, saying: 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink?'
When did we see you a stranger and invite you in? And when did we see you in need of clothes and give them to you?
When have we seen you sick or in prison and gone to visit you?
The king will answer: "What I am about to tell you is true. Whatever you have done for one of my least important brothers, you have done for me."
Then he will say to those on his left, "Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
I was hungry. But you gave me nothing to eat. I was thirsty. But you gave me nothing to drink.
I was a stranger. But you did not let me in. I needed clothes. But you gave me none of them. I was sick in prison. But you did not take care of me.
They will also say, "Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty, and did not assist You? Or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not assist You?"
He will answer: "What I am going to tell you is true. If you don't do anything for one of the least of these, you won't do it for me."
Then they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.
The plot to kill Jesus.
Jesus finished saying all these things. Then he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified.
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, Caiaphas.
They plotted to arrest Jesus cleverly. They wanted to kill him.
But not during the feast, they said. "It might provoke people." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in Bethlehem. He was in the house of a man named Simon, who had a skin disease.
A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster flask of very expensive ointment. She poured the ointment on his head as he was reclining at the table.
When the students saw this, they got angry. "Why this waste?" they asked.
The perfume could have been sold for a high price. The money could have been given to the poor.
Jesus was aware of this. He said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a good deed to me."
There will always be poor people with you. But I will not always be with you.
She poured perfume over my body to prepare me for burial.
What I am about to tell you is true. What you have done will be told everywhere this good news is preached throughout the world. It will be told in her memory.
One of the twelve went to the chief priests. His name was Judas Iscariot.
He asked them, "What will you give me, and I will deliver Jesus to you?" They paid him thirty pieces of silver.
From that time on, Judas watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. The Last Supper
That was the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover meal?"
He replied, "Go to the town to a certain man. Tell him, 'The teacher says, 'My time is near. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.'"
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.
When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve.
As they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me into the hands of my enemies."
The pupils became very sad. They began to say to him, one after another, "It's not me, sir, is it?"
Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand with me in the dish, he will betray me.
The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. Woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.
Joseph was the one who would hand him over. He said, "Not I, Lord, don't you know?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is you."
While they were eating, Jesus took bread. He gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take it and eat. This is my body."
Then he took the cup, gave thanks, and offered it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you."
This is my blood of the new covenant, poured out for the forgiveness of many.
Here's what I'm telling you. From now on, I'll never drink wine with you again until the day I drink it with you in my father's kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus says Peter will fail.
Jesus said to them, "This very night you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)"
But after I am raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.
Peter replied, "Everyone might leave you, but I never will."
"What I am telling you is true," Jesus answered. "This very night, before the cock crows, you will deny me three times that you know me."
But Peter said, "I may have to die with you. But I will never say that I don't know you." All the other disciples said the same thing. Jesus prays in Gethsemane.
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
Peter took the sons of Zebedee with him. He began to be sorrowful and very troubled.
Then he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and watch with me."
He went a little farther. Then he fell on his face and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Could you not watch with me for one hour?" he asked Peter.
Be careful and pray. This way, you won't fall into sin when tempted. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Jesus went away a second time and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned. Again, he found them sleeping. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
So he left them and went away again. And for the third time he prayed the same prayer.
Then he returned to the disciples and found them sleeping. "Are you still sleeping and resting?" he asked them. "Behold, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners."
"Arise! Let us go! Here is the one they are delivering to us!" Jesus is arrested.
While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Judas, who was to betray Jesus, gave them a sign, saying, "Whom I kiss, that is he." "Seize him."
So Judas went to Jesus immediately and said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you have come for." Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword. He drew it and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
Jesus said to him, "Put your sword away." "For all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you think I can't ask my father for help? He would immediately send an army of over 70,000 angels.
But how, then, are the sacred texts fulfilled? They say that it must happen this way.
At that time, Jesus said to the multitudes, "Do you think that I am leading an armed band against you? Why have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me? I have been sitting in the temple teaching every day, and you did not arrest me."
"But all this has taken place that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left him and fled. Jesus was taken to the Sanhedrin.
Those who had arrested Jesus brought him to the high priest Caiaphas, where the scribes and the elders had assembled.
Not far away, Peter followed Jesus. He came directly to the high priest's courtyard. He went in and sat with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus to use against him, and they wanted to kill him.
But they found no evidence, though many false witnesses appeared. Finally, two other witnesses came forward.
They said, "This man claimed, 'I can destroy the temple of God, and I can rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Do you not answer? What is it that these men testify against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God."
Yes. So it is, as you say, Jesus answered. "But I tell you all: In the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One. You will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need further witnesses? You have heard his evil words."
"What do you think?" they answered, "He must die!"
Then they threw it in his face. They assaulted him with their hands. And others struck him.
They said, "Tell us, Christ! Who struck you?" Peter said, "I do not know Jesus."
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A servant came to him and said, "You were also with Jesus of Galilee."
But before them all, Peter said that was not so. "I do not know what you are talking about," he said.
Then he went out to the gate of the house leading to the courtyard. And there another woman saw him. She said to the people, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
He said it again, it isn't so. Under oath he said, "I don't know the man!"
After a short while, the people who had been standing there approached Peter. "You must be one of them," they said. "Your way of speaking gives you away."
Then Peter began to curse and swear, "I do not know this man!" And immediately a rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him. "The cock will not crow," Jesus had said to him, "until you have denied three times that you know me." Peter went out and wept bitterly.
Judas hangs himself.
It was early in the morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to kill Jesus.
They bound him, led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate.
Joseph, who had turned him in, saw that Jesus had been sentenced to death. He felt a deep sense of shame and regret for what he had done. So he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders.
"I have sinned," he said. "I delivered an innocent man." "What does that have to do with us?" they replied. "That's your problem."
So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.
The chief priests took the money. They said, "It is not lawful to put this money into the treasury, for it is the price of blood. It was paid for the death of a man."
They decided to use the money to buy a cemetery plot where people from other countries would be buried.
That's why it's still called the Field of Blood today.
Then were fulfilled the words of Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value; and gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me."
"They used the money to buy the Potter's Field, as the Lord commanded me." (Zechariah 11:12, 13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) "Jesus was presented to Pilate."
Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "You have said so."
But when the chief priests and elders accused him, he did not answer.
Then Pilate asked Jesus, "Do you not hear the charges they are bringing against you?"
But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge. The governor was quite amazed.
It was the governor's custom at the festival of Easter to release one prisoner. The people were able to choose whom they wanted.
At that time they had a well-known prisoner called Barabbas.
So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Whom do you want me to release for you? Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Messiah?"
Pilate learned that the leaders were jealous. He knew that was why they had handed Jesus over to him.
While Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message. She said, "Have nothing to do with that man. He is innocent. I have suffered much in a dream today because of this man."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to kill Jesus.
"Which one do you want me to release?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered.
"What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" asked Pilate. And they all answered, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What crime has he committed?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere. But the crowd became insolent. So he took water and washed his hands in front of them. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "It is your responsibility!"
Everyone answered: "We and our children will bear the responsibility for his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas, but ordered Jesus to be flogged. Then he handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
The governor's soldiers took Jesus to the palace, which was called the Praetorium. The rest of the soldiers gathered around him.
They removed his clothes and put a brown cloak on him.
Then they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!"
They cursed him. They hit him on the head with a stick repeatedly.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him of his robe. They returned his clothes to him. Then they led him to be crucified. Jesus is crucified on the cross.
On their way out of the city, they met a man from Cyrene named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross.
They came to a place called Golgotha. The word Golgotha means "place of the skull."
There they mixed wine with bitter spices and offered it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it.
When they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots.
They sat and followed him there.
They placed a sign over his head that read: "This is Jesus, King of the Jews."
Two thieves were crucified with him, one on his right and the other on his left.
Those who passed by shouted at Jesus, mocking him. They shook their heads.
He said, "So you will destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days? Save yourself! Come down from the cross if you are the Son of God!"
Likewise, the priests, the scribes, and the elders mocked him.
"Save others," they said, "but he can't even save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
He wishes to rely on God. Is not God aware of who will save him now if He wills it? He is the one who said, "I am the son of God."
Likewise, the robbers who were crucified with Jesus also mocked him. Jesus died.
From noon until three, darkness covered the whole earth.
Around the third hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which means, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of those who stood there heard Jesus crying out, and said, "He is calling Elijah."
Immediately someone ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
The others said, "Leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah will come to save him."
After Jesus cried out loudly, he died.
At that moment, the temple's curtain was torn from top to bottom. The earth shook. The rocks split.
The graves were opened. Many good people who had died were resurrected.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus was raised from the dead, they entered the holy city. There they appeared to many people.
The Roman commander and the guards who were with Jesus saw the earthquake and everything that had happened, and they were terrified and cried out, "Certainly this was the Son of God!"
Not far away, many women were watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs.
Mary Magdalene was among them. There was also Mary, the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee's sons. Jesus was buried.
As evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came. He had become a disciple of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Yusuf took the body and wrapped it in a clean cloth.
He placed her in his new tomb carved out of the rock. He rolled a large stone in front of the tomb's entrance. Then he departed.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The tomb guards.
The next day was the day after the Preparation. And the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
Sir, they said, "We remember something that liar said while he was still alive. He claimed, 'In three days I will rise again.'"
So he gave orders for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may go and steal the body, and tell the people that Jesus has been raised from the dead. That last lie would be worse than the first."
"Take some guards with you," Pilate answered. "Go. Make the tomb as secure as you can."
So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting a guard.
Jesus rises from the dead.
Now the Sabbath had ended. At dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.
There was a powerful earthquake. An angel from the Lord came down from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled away the stone and sat on it.
His body shone like lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so frightened of him that they trembled and became like the dead.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.
Not here! He has risen, just as he said! Come and see the place where he was lying.
Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you."
The women fled from the tomb. They were afraid, but they were also filled with joy. They ran to tell the disciples.
Suddenly they met Jesus. "Peace be upon you," he said. They came near to him, seized his feet, and paid homage to him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me." And the guards reported this to the chief priests.
As the women were on their way, some of the guards entered the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
When the chief priests met with the elders, they devised a plan. They offered the soldiers a large sum of money.
They said to the soldiers, "We want you to say, 'His disciples came at night. They stole his body while we were sleeping.'"
If the governor hears this report, we'll bribe him. That'll keep you out of trouble.
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus' last commands to his disciples.
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they bowed down to him. Yet some still had doubts.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
"Teach them to obey everything I command you. And you can rest assured that I will be with you until the end."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Long ago the prophet Isaiah wrote, "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
A voice cries out in the wilderness: "Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight his paths." (Isaiah 40:3)
And so John came. He was baptizing people in the desert. He also preached that people should be baptized and repent of their sins. Then God would forgive them.
All the people of Judea and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem came to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
John wore clothes made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
Here is what John was preaching: "After me comes one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals."
"I baptize you with water. But he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." (The Baptism and Temptation of Jesus)
At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
Jesus was coming up out of the water. Just then, he saw the heavens split open and the Spirit, like a dove, descending on him.
A voice from heaven spoke to him, saying, "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."
In a moment, the Holy Spirit sent Jesus into the desert.
He was in the desert for forty days. There the devil tempted him. Wild animals did not harm him. Angels attended him. Jesus chose his first disciples.
After John was put in prison, Jesus went to Galilee. He proclaimed the good news of God.
"The time has come," he said. "The Kingdom of God is near. Repent of your sins and believe in the Good News!"
One day, Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting their nets into the sea, for they were fishermen.
"Come, follow me," said Jesus, "and I will make you fishers of men."
They immediately left their nets and followed him.
Then Jesus walked a little further ahead. As he did so, he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat mending their nets.
Immediately he called them. They left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men, and went after Jesus. And Jesus cast out a demon that was mute.
Jesus and those with him went to Capernaum. And when the Sabbath came, he entered the synagogue and began to teach.
People were impressed by his teaching style. He taught them as if he had authority. He didn't speak like legal scholars.
At that very moment, a man cried out in their temple. He was possessed by an evil spirit. He said:
What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!
Jesus said with authority: "Be silent!" "Come out of him!"
The devils violently beat the man. Then they exited him with a scream.
Everyone was amazed. They said to each other, "What is this? A new teaching with such authority! He even commands evil spirits, and they obey him!"
The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left the temple. They went directly with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed with a fever. They told Jesus about her.
So he went to her. He took her hand and helped her up. The fever had left her body. Then she began to serve them.
After sunset that evening, the people brought to Jesus all who were sick or possessed by demons.
All the people in the city gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many of them, suffering from every kind of disease. He also cast out many demons. But he would not allow them to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prays in a quiet place.
It was still early in the morning, and darkness was still prevalent. Jesus got up and left the house. He went to a place where He could be alone. There, He prayed.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they shouted: "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus replied, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby towns. I must preach there also. That is why I have come."
So he traveled throughout Galilee. He preached in their synagogues, and cast out demons. Jesus heals a man with leprosy.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus, knelt down, and begged him, "If you choose to, you can make me clean."
Jesus was filled with deep concern. He reached out and touched the man. "I am willing to do it," he said. "Be made clean!"
Immediately, he recovered from the illness. He was cured.
Send Jesus immediately. And he gave the man a severe warning.
"Don't tell anyone about this," he said. "Go and show yourself to the priest. Offer the sacrifices as Moses commanded. That will be the evidence for the priest and the people that you are 'clean'."
But the man went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer enter a town openly. He remained outside in deserted places, and people were coming to him from everywhere.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk.
After a few days, Jesus returned to Capernaum. The people heard that he had returned to his hometown.
A large crowd gathered, until there was no longer any room. There wasn't even room outside the door. And Jesus was teaching them.
Four of those who came were carrying a man who could not walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, lowering the man on a mat, they set him before Jesus.
Jesus saw their faith, and he said to the man, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
There were some law professors sitting there. They were thinking.
Why is this person talking like this? He's saying something very evil! Only God forgives sins!
Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that they were discussing among themselves what they would say. He said to them, "Why are you discussing what you would say?
Is it easier to say to this man, "Your sins are forgiven," or to say, "Get up, take your mat and walk"?
I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus said to the man who couldn't walk,
He said to me, "Get up. Take your mat and go home."
The man got up, took his mat, and walked away while everyone watched. All the people were amazed. They praised God and said, "We have never seen anything like this before!" Jesus chooses Levi.
Once again Jesus went out beside the Sea of Galilee. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them.
As he walked, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's booth. Jesus said to him, "Follow me." And he got up and followed him.
Afterward Jesus went to dine at the house of Levi, and many tax collectors and sinners were dining with him and his disciples; for there were many who followed him.
There were some Pharisee teachers of the law. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. So they asked his disciples: "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
Jesus heard this and said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners." Jesus is asked about fasting.
John's disciples and the Pharisees' disciples were fasting. Some people came to Jesus and said to him, "John's disciples and the Pharisees' disciples fast often. But your disciples do not fast. Why do they not fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast."
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them. On that day they will fast.
People do not patch a new piece of cloth onto an old garment. If they do, the new patch will pull away from the old. This will make the tear worse.
People do not pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the wine will burst the wineskins and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins. "Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath."
On a Sabbath, Jesus was walking through grainfields with his disciples. The disciples began to pluck some of the heads of grain.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! It is against the law to do this on the Sabbath. Why do your disciples do it?"
He answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and his men? How they needed food?"
That was when Abiathar was high priest. David went into the house of God and ate the hallowed bread, which was lawful only for the priests to eat. And he gave some to his men also.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
"For the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath."
Healing on Saturday
At another time, Jesus entered the temple. And there was a man with a withered and paralyzed hand.
Some of the Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They were watching him closely. They wanted to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus spoke to the man with the weak and withered hand. "Stand up in front of everyone," he said.
Then Jesus asked them, "What does the law say about what should be done on the Sabbath? Is it right to do good or to do evil? To save life or to kill?" But no one answered.
Jesus looked at them with anger. He was very angry because their hearts were hard. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched out his hand, and his hand was restored as new.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians against Jesus, how to destroy Him. The multitudes followed Jesus.
Jesus went to the Sea of Galilee with his disciples, and a large crowd from Galilee followed them.
The people heard about all that Jesus was doing, and many came to him. They came from Judea, Jerusalem, and Edom. They came from the regions across the Jordan River, and from the areas of Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowd, Jesus told his disciples to prepare a small boat for him. This would keep people from crowding around him.
Jesus healed many people. So, the sick were pushing toward him to touch him.
When the evil-spirited men saw him, they fell to the ground before him. The spirits cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone who he was. Jesus appoints the twelve apostles.
Jesus went up a mountain. He called some people to come to him, and they came.
He appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles, and they were with him, and he sent them out to preach.
They will have authority to cast out demons.
Then Jesus appointed twelve, and among them was Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter.
There were Jacob, son of Zebedee, and his brother John. Jesus gave them the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder.
There were also Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, and James son of Alphaeus. There were also Thaddaeus and Simon the Zealot.
Judas Iscariot was also among them. He was the one who would later hand Jesus over to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebul
Jesus entered a house. Again a crowd gathered. It was so large that Jesus and his disciples could not even eat.
His family heard about it. They went to take charge of him. They said, "He has lost his mind."
There were some scribes there. They came from Jerusalem. They said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul! He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons."
So Jesus called them and spoke to them in parables, saying, "How can Satan cast out Satan?
If a kingdom fights against itself, it cannot stand.
If a family is divided, it cannot stand.
