Salmon was the father of Boaz, and Rahab was the mother of Boaz. Boaz was the father of Obed, and Ruth was the mother of Obed. Obed was the father of Jesse.
And Jesse was the father of David the king. And David was the father of Solomon, whose mother was the wife of Uriah.
conoc conoc conoc conoc conoc conoc conoc conoc conoc conoc conoc conoc conoc conoc conoc conoc conocrrsرrقhعtly Solomon was the father of Rehoboam. Rehoboam was the father of Abijah. Abijah was the father of Asa.
Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat was the father of Joram. Joram was the father of Ahaziah.
Uzziah was the father of Jotham. Jotham was the father of Ahaz. Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh, and Manasseh was the father of Amon, and Amon was the father of Josiah.
And Josiah was the father of Jehoahaz and his brothers. At that time, the Jewish people were forced to migrate to Babylon.
Then the family line continued. Konaniah was the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zeruiah was the father of Abishai. Abishai was the father of Eliab. Eliab was the father of Bezalel.
Azor was the father of Zadok. Zadok was the father of Akim. Akim was the father of Eliud.
Elieud was the father of Elizar. Elizar was the father of Matan. Matan was the father of Yaakov.
Jacob was the father of Joseph, who was married to Mary, and Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Messiah.
So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen generations from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen generations from the exile to the Messiah. And so was born Jesus Christ.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband, Youssef, was a pious man. He didn't want to humiliate her publicly. So he planned to divorce her quietly.
But while he was thinking about this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
You will give birth to a son. You must name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.
All this happened to fulfill what the Lord had said would happen. He had said it through the prophet,
The virgin will bear a child. She will give birth to a son, and he will be called Immanuel. (Isaiah 7:14) And the name Immanuel means "God with us."
Joseph woke up. He did as the angel of the Lord commanded him. He took Mary into his home as his wife.
But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And Joseph named him Jesus.
The Visit of the Wise Men to Jesus
Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, during the reign of King Herod. After Jesus' birth, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
They asked, "Where is the child who has been born to be the king of the Jews? When we were in the east, we saw his star. Now we have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was greatly troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
So Herod summoned the chief priests and scribes of the people, and asked them where the Messiah was to be born.
"In Bethlehem in Judah," they answered. "This is what the prophet wrote. He said,
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, yet out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times." (Micah 5:2)
Then Herod called the wise men secretly, and learned from them exactly when the star had appeared.
Send them to Bethlehem, and said, "Go and search carefully for the child. When you have found him, bring me word. Then I too will go and worship him."
After the wise men had listened to the king, they continued on their way. The star they had seen in the east went before them. At last, it stopped over the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, they were filled with joy.
The wise men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They knelt down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures. They gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their home country by another route. The Holy Family flees to Egypt.
When the wise men had departed, Joseph had a dream. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him. The angel said, "Arise!" "Take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt." "Remain there until I tell you to return." "Herod will search for the child. He wants to kill him."
Joseph arose during the night, and departed into Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.
They remained there until the death of King Herod, fulfilling the word of the Lord spoken through the prophet: "Out of Egypt I called my son." (Hosea 11:1)
Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him. He was furious and issued orders regarding Bethlehem and its surroundings. All boys under the age of two were to be killed. This corresponded to the time when the wise men had seen the star.
In this way the words of the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled, who said:
A voice is heard in Ramah, a voice of deep weeping. Rachel is weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted, because they are no more. (Jeremiah 31:15) The family of Jesus returns to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel. Those who sought to kill the child are dead."
So Joseph got up, took the child and his mother Mary, and returned to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in the place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he went to the regions of Galilee instead.
There he lived in a city called Nazareth. So he fulfilled what was spoken by the prophets about Jesus, "He shall be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Turn away from your sins! The kingdom of heaven is near."
John is the person about whom the prophet Isaiah spoke. He said, "A voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes were made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
People came to him from Jerusalem and all Judea, and from the region along the Jordan River.
When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees approaching the place where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Bear fruits that demonstrate your repentance from your sins.
Do not think that you can say to yourselves, "We have Abraham as our father." I tell you, God can raise up children for Abraham from these stones.
The axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water, calling you to repent of your sins. But after me will come one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
He held his scythe to thresh the chaff from his harvested field. He will gather his wheat into the barn, but he will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire." Jesus is baptized.
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. He wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to stop him. He said to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you. Why have you come to me?"
Jesus replied, "Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this, for it is the fulfillment of God's holy plan." And John agreed.
As soon as Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment, the sky opened. Jesus saw the Spirit of God descending on him like a dove.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Jesus is tempted.
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert. There, the devil tempted him.
After 40 days and 40 nights of fasting, Jesus was hungry.
The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.' " (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple.
"If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down. For it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you.' And: 'They will lift you up in their hands, so that you do not strike your foot against a stone.'" (Psalm 91:11-12)
Jesus answered him, "It is also written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'" (Exodus 16:6)
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain. He showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
"If you worship me and serve me," he said, "I will give you all this."
Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
Then the devil left Jesus. Angels came and attended to him. Jesus began to preach.
John was put in prison. When Jesus heard it, he departed into Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and went to live in the town of Capernaum, which was on the lake shore in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
In this way, the prophecy of the prophet Isaiah was fulfilled. He said:
Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee of the Gentiles! Land by the Mediterranean Sea! Region beyond the Jordan River!
"The people who walk in darkness will see a great light. They live in a land of deep darkness, but a light will shine on them." (Isaiah 9:1,2)
From that time Jesus began to preach, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus chooses the first disciples.
One day, Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
"Come, follow me," Jesus said. "I will make you fishers of men."
They immediately left their nets and followed him.
From there, he saw two other brothers, James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and Jesus called them.
Immediately they left their boat and their father and followed Jesus. Jesus heals the sick.
Jesus traveled throughout Galilee. There he taught in their synagogues, proclaimed the good news of the kingdom, and healed every disease and sickness among the people.
His fame spread throughout Syria. People brought to him all who were sick, those suffering from various diseases. Some were in great pain. Others were possessed by demons. Some were convulsing. Still others were paralyzed. Jesus healed them all.
A large crowd followed him, including people from Galilee, the Ten Towns, Jerusalem, Judea, and the region across the Jordan.
Jesus gives blessings.
Jesus saw the crowds, went up a mountain, and sat down. His disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them. He said:
"Blessed are those who need spiritually, for the kingdom of heaven is theirs."
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessings are for those free from arrogance; they will be given the earth.
Grace to those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, will be satisfied.
"Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy."
Blessings are for those with pure hearts. They will attain God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. The kingdom of heaven is theirs.
"Blessed are you when people mock you and persecute you because of me. And blessed are you when they say all kinds of evil against you because of me."
Be happy and joyful. Your reward in Heaven is great. Similarly, people harmed the prophets who lived long ago. Salt and light.
You are the salt of the earth. But what if the salt loses its saltiness? How can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by people.
You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.
Likewise, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven. Jesus gives the law its full meaning.
Do not think that I have come to abolish what is written in the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish these things but to fulfill them.
What I am telling you is the truth. Heaven and earth will pass away before even the smallest letter of the law passes away. Not even the smallest stroke of a pen will pass from the law until all things are accomplished.
Do not break even the least of these commandments. And do not teach others to break them. If you do, you will be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. Instead, practice and teach these commandments. Then you will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
Here is what I tell you. You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you are not, you will surely not enter the kingdom of heaven. Murder.
I have heard what was said to people long ago. They were told, "You shall not kill" (Exodus 20:13). Anyone who kills will be held accountable for their deed.
But this is what I tell you. Do not be angry with your brother. Whoever is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment. Again, whoever says to his brother, 'Raka,' will be liable to the Sanhedrin. But whoever says, 'You fool,' will be in danger of hellfire.
Imagine that you are presenting your gift at the altar and you remember that your brother has something against you.
Leave your gift before the altar and go first to be reconciled with your brother; then come and present your gift.
Suppose someone has a claim against you and takes you to court. Settle the matter quickly. Do it while you are still with him on the way. If you don't, he may hand you over to the judge. The judge may hand you over to the officer. And you may be thrown into prison.
What I'm about to tell you is the truth. You're not leaving until you pay the last penny!
I heard it said, "Do not commit adultery." (Exodus 20:14)
But I tell you, anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. Your eyes are one part of your body. It is better to lose one part than to have your whole body thrown into hell.
If your right hand leads you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. Your hand is only a part of your body. It is better to lose it than to have your whole body go to hell. Divorce.
It is written: "When a man divorces his wife, he must give her a written notice of divorce." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
But this is what I say to you: Whoever divorces his wife makes her an adulteress, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. A man is not to divorce his wife except for marital unfaithfulness. Oath.
Once again, you have heard what was said to your ancestors long ago. It was said to them, "Do not break the covenants you have made with God. Keep the oaths you have sworn to him."
But this is what I say to you. Never give such a promise at all. Don't give it in the name of heaven. It is God's throne.
Do not make them in the name of Earth. It is God's footstool. Do not make them in the name of Jerusalem. It is the city of the great King.
And do not swear by the name of your head. You cannot make even one hair white or black.
Let "yes" mean "yes." Let "no" mean "no." Anything else is from the devil. Be kind to others.
You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
But this is what I tell you: Do not resist the evil one. "If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek to him as well.
Imagine someone suing you for your shirt. Let them have your coat as well.
Imagine someone forces you to walk one mile. Walk two miles with them.
Give to those who ask of you. Do not turn away from those who want to lend you something. Love your enemies.
I heard it said, "Love your neighbor" (Leviticus 19:18) and hate your enemy.
But this is what I say to you: Love your enemies. Pray for those who persecute you.
"Then you will be sons of your Father in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust."
If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Even tax collectors do that.
If you only greet your own people, what more are you doing than others? Even unbelievers do that.
Be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Assisting the needy
Beware of doing good deeds in front of others. Do not do them to be seen by others. If you do, your Father in heaven will not reward you.
When you give to the poor, do not blow a trumpet before you. Do not be like those who play the role of holiness. They declare their deeds in the temples and on the street corners. They want to be honored by others. What I am telling you is the truth. They have received their reward in full.
When you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
Then your giving will be in secret. Your Father who sees in secret will reward you. He sees what you do in secret. Prayer
When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, who love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
When you pray, go into your room. Close the door and pray to your Father who is unseen. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret.
When you pray, do not babble as the Gentiles do, for they think that by their many words they will be heard.
Don't be like them. Your father knows what you need even before you ask him.
"This is how you should pray: 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
O King of the universe, enjoy Your kingdom. O One who wills that it should be, let it be as it is in heaven so also on earth.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we also forgive those who sin against us.
Protect us from falling into sin when we are tempted. Save us from the devil.
Forgive people when they wrong you. If you do, your Father in heaven will forgive you as well.
But if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive you your trespasses. —Matthew 6:15 (ESV)
When you go without eating, don't look gloomy like those who fast only to appear holy. They make their faces very sad. They want to show people that they are fasting. What I'm telling you is the truth. They have received their full reward.
But when you go without eating, put olive oil on your head. Wash your face.
Then others will not know that you are fasting. Only your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret. Store up for yourselves treasures in heaven.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
Instead, store up your treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
Your heart will be where your treasure is.
The eye is like a lamp for the body. If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be full of light.
But what if your eyes are bad? Darkness will overwhelm your whole body. If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. He will hate one and love the other, or obey one and disobey the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not worry.
I tell you, do not worry. Do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink. Do not worry about your body, what you will wear. Is there not more to life than food? Are there not more important things for the body than clothes?
Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
Can you add an hour to your life by worrying?
And why do you worry about clothes? See how the wild flowers grow. They don't work or spin clothes.
But that is what I tell you. Not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of these.
If God so clothes the grass of the field, will He not much more clothe you, O men of little faith? For the grass is here today, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven.
So do not worry, saying, "What shall we eat?" or "What shall we drink?" or "What shall we wear?"
People who do not believe are chasing after all those things. Your Father in heaven knows that you need them.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Be fair when you judge others.
Do not judge others. Then no one will judge you.
You will be judged by the same standards by which you judge others. You will be measured by the same measure with which you measure others.
You look at the splinter in your friend's eye, but you don't notice the log in your own.
How do you tell your friend, "Let me remove the splinter from your eye," while there's a piece of wood in your own eye?
You hypocrite! First, remove the log from your own eye. Then you will be able to see clearly to remove the speck from your friend's eye.
Do not give what is holy to the dogs. Do not throw your pearls before swine. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces. Ask, seek, knock.
Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.
To all who ask, it shall be given; to him who seeks, it shall be found; and to him who knocks, the door shall be opened.
What if your son asks for bread? Who among you would give him a stone?
Or what if he asks for a fish? Who among you would give him a snake?
Although you are evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will your Father who is in heaven give good gifts to those who ask Him!
In all things, treat others as you would want to be treated. This is what is written in the law and the prophets. The great gate and the small gate.
Enter the Kingdom of God through the narrow gate. The gate is wide and the road is broad that leads to death and hell. Many people walk this road.
But the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life. Only a few people find it. Its tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
You can tell them by their fruits. "Do people pick grapes from thorn bushes? Do they gather figs from thistles?"
Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree does not bear bad fruit, and a bad tree does not bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You can distinguish every tree by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven.
Many will say to me on that day, "Lord! Lord! Did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?"
Then I will say to them plainly, "I never knew you. Depart from me, you evildoers!" The wise and foolish builders
Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
It rains. The water rises. The wind blows and shakes that house. But it doesn't fall. It's built on the rock.
But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.
It rains. The water rises. The wind blows and lashes that house. And it falls with a loud noise like thunder.
Jesus finished saying all these things. The crowds were amazed at his teaching.
Teach as one who has authority. He did not speak as their scribes.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain. Large crowds followed him.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus, knelt down, and said, "Lord, if you choose to, you can make me clean."
Jesus reached out and touched the man. "I am willing to do it," he said. "Be clean!" Immediately the man was cured of his disease.
Then Jesus said to him, "Tell no one. Go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." A Roman officer believed.
When Jesus came to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached him and pleaded for his help.
"Sir," he said, "my servant is lying at home, unable to move. He is in great distress."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
The captain answered, "Sir, I am not worthy that you should come under my roof. But only speak, and my servant will be healed."
I myself am a man under authority, and I have soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, "Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith."
I tell you, many will come from east and west and take their places at the feast in the kingdom of heaven. They will sit with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
But those who believe they are of the kingdom will be cast outside into the darkness. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then Jesus said to the Roman officer, "Go! It will be done just as you believed." And at that very moment his servant was healed. Jesus healed many people.
When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to serve him.
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to Jesus, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
He did it to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah said: "He bore the sins that we should have borne. He carried the sorrows that should have been ours" (Isaiah 53:4). The cost of following Jesus.
Seeing the crowds around him, Jesus instructed his disciples to go to the other side of Lake Galilee.
Then a teacher of the law came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
Another follower said to him, "Sir, let me first go and bury my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow Me. Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus entered the boat. His disciples followed him.
Suddenly a fierce storm swept across the lake. The waves crashed over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
The pupils went and woke him up. They said, "Lord! Save us! We are drowning!"
He answered, "You of little faith! Why are you so afraid?" Then Jesus got up and commanded the winds and the waves, "Quiet! Be still!" Suddenly the wind stopped, and there was a great calm.
The disciples were amazed and asked, "Who is this man? Even the winds and waves obey him!" Jesus heals two men possessed by demons.
Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake in the region of the Gadarenes. Two men possessed by demons, coming out of the tombs, met him. They were so violent that no one could pass by.
"Son of God, what do you want from us?" they cried. "Have you come here to punish us before our time of reckoning?"
Not far away, a large herd of pigs was feeding.
The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go." The unclean spirits came out of the men and entered into the swine. And the herd ran violently down the steep place into the lake, and were drowned in the water.
Those who had been tending the pigs fled. They went into the town and told everyone everything, and what had happened to the men who had been possessed by the demons.
Then the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk.
Jesus entered a boat, crossed to the other side of the lake, and arrived at his city.
Some men brought to him a paralytic, lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
Then some of the religious scholars said to themselves, "This man is saying something very evil!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he said, "Why do you have evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven," or to say, "Get up and walk"?
I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. Then he spoke to the man who could not walk. He said to him, "Rise, take up your bed, and go to your house."
The man stood up and went to his house.
When the crowds saw this, they were amazed. They praised God for giving such authority to men. Jesus chooses when.
As Jesus was leaving, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," Jesus said to him. And Matthew got up and followed him.
Then Jesus sat down to dinner at Matthew's house with many tax collectors and sinners. They ate with Jesus and his disciples.
The Pharisees saw this and asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this and said, "Those who are well do not need a doctor, but those who are sick do."
Go and learn what it means to say, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice' (Hosea 6:6). I did not come to follow those who think they are right with God, but I came to follow sinners. "Jesus asks about fasting"
One day, the disciples of John came and said to Jesus, "We and the Pharisees fast and do not eat. Why do your disciples not fast?"
Jesus said, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
People don't sew a new patch on an old garment. The new piece will separate from the old one. This will make the tear worse.
People do not pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the wineskins will burst, the wine will spill, and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins. In this way, both are preserved. (A Dead Girl and a Suffering Woman)
While Jesus was still speaking, a synagogue leader came and bowed down before him. "My daughter has just died," he said. "But come and place your hand on her, and she will live."
Jesus rose and went with him. So did his disciples.
At that moment, a woman approached Jesus from behind. She had been suffering from a condition that caused her to bleed, and it had lasted for 12 years. She touched the edge of his clothes.
I thought: "All I need is to touch his clothes. Then I'll be healed."
Jesus turned and saw her. "Daughter," he said, "your faith has healed you. Go in peace." And the woman was healed at that very moment.
When Jesus entered the ruler's house, he saw the flute players there. And he saw the noisy crowds.
He said, "Go away. The girl is not dead. She is sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After the crowd had left, Jesus entered. He took the girl by the hand, and she arose.
The news about what Jesus had done spread all over the region. Jesus heals two blind men.
And Jesus went from there, and two blind men followed him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus entered the house, the blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They answered, "Yes, Lord."
Then he touched their eyes and said, "Your faith has healed you."
They could see again. Jesus warned them sternly, "Make sure that no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They talked about it everywhere in that area.
As they were leaving, another man who was demon-possessed was brought to Jesus. He was unable to speak.
When the demon was cast out, the man spoke. The crowd was amazed. They said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel before."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons." Only a few workers are there.
Jesus went through all the cities and villages. He taught in their synagogues. He preached the gospel of the kingdom. And healed every sickness and every disease.
When he saw the crowds, he felt deep concern for them. They were defeated and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
Ask the Lord of the harvest to send workers into his field to harvest it.
Jesus sends the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
Here are the names of the twelve apostles. First, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then, James the son of Zebedee and his brother John.
And today Philip and Peter, also Thomas and Matthew the tax collector. Two others are James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus.
The last two are Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas was the one who later betrayed Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent out the twelve with these instructions: "Do not go among the Gentiles," he said. "Do not enter any town of the Samaritans."
Instead, go to the people of Israel. They are like sheep that have gone astray.
As you go, proclaim this message: "The kingdom of heaven is near."
Healed the sick. Raised the dead. Cleansed those with skin diseases. Cast out demons. Freely you received, freely give.
Do not carry any gold, silver, or copper in your belts.
Don't take a bag for the trip. Don't take extra clothes or sandals or walking sticks. The worker must be provided with what he needs.
Upon entering a city or village, seek out someone willing to host you. Stay in their home until you depart.
When entering a house, greet its inhabitants.
If that house welcomes you, bless it with peace. If not, do not bless it.
Some people may not welcome you or listen to your words. If they don't, shake the dust off your feet as you leave that house or town.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. On the Day of Judgment, it will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah than for that city.
I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as wise as serpents and as innocent as doves.
Beware! The men will hand you over to the local courts. They will whip you in their synagogue.
You will be brought before governors and kings because of me. You will be witnesses to them and to the Gentiles.
But when they arrest you, don't worry about what you'll say or how you'll say it. At that time, the right words to say will be given to you.
It is not you who will be speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.
Brothers will hand over their brothers to be killed. Fathers will hand over their children. Children will rise up against their parents and kill them.
Everyone will hate you because of me. But whoever endures to the end will be saved.
When people attack you in one place, flee to another. What I am telling you is true. You will not finish going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
A student is not better than his teacher. A servant is not better than his master.
It is enough for the student to be like his teacher. And it is enough for the slave to be like his master. If the head of the house is called Beelzebul, what do the others who live there expect?
So do not fear your enemies. Everything hidden will be revealed. Everything concealed will be disclosed.
What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, shout from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Aren't two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father knowing it.
To count every hair on your head!
So do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.
What about someone who says in front of others that he knows me? I will also say in front of my Father in heaven that I know him.
But what about someone who says in front of others that he doesn't know me? I will say in front of my Father in heaven that I don't know him.
Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
I have come to set sons against their fathers, and daughters against their mothers, and daughters-in-law against their mothers-in-law.
A man's foes shall be they of his own household. (Micah 7:6)
Whoever loves a father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. And whoever loves a son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
If anyone finds his life, he will lose it. If anyone loses his life because of me, he will find it.
Whoever welcomes you welcomes me. And whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.
If we assume that someone receives a prophet as a prophet, they will obtain the reward of a prophet. And if we assume that someone receives a righteous person as a righteous person, they will obtain the reward of a righteous person.
Imagine if someone gave a glass of cold water to a little child following me. What I'm about to tell you is the truth. He will surely be rewarded.
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus finished teaching his twelve disciples. Then he moved on to teach and preach in the cities of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked Jesus, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?"
Jesus answered, "Go back and tell John what you hear and see."
Sight is given to the blind. The lame walk. The lepers are cleansed. The deaf hear. The dead are raised. And the poor have good news preached to them.
"Grace to him who does not abandon his faith because of me."
As John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John. He said, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
If not, why did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No. People who wear fine clothes are in the palaces of kings.
So what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
It is He of whom the Bible speaks. It says: "I will send my messenger before you, who will prepare your way before you." (Malachi 3:1)
What I am telling you is true. No one greater than John the Baptist has ever been born, but the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
Since the days of John the Baptist, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and violent people are seizing it.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you're ready to accept it, John is Elijah who was supposed to come.
He who has ears, let him hear.
Who do people today resemble most? They resemble children sitting in the marketplaces, calling out to one another, saying:
We played the flute for you, but you did not dance. We sang a funeral song, but you did not become sad.
When John came, he neither ate nor drank as you do. And people say, "He has a demon."
But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank, and they say, "Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and 'sinners'!" Wisdom is vindicated by her deeds. Cities full of sin do not go unpunished.
Jesus began to denounce the cities where most of his miracles had been done, for they did not repent of their sins. He said:
How terrible it will be for you, Chorazin! How terrible it will be for you, Bethsaida! If the miracles that were performed in your midst had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
But I tell you this: The day of judgment will be easier for Tyre and Sidon than for you.
And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades. For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
But I tell you this: The day of judgment will be easier for Sodom than for you. "Rest for all the weary"
At that time Jesus said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants."
Yes, Father. This is what I wanted.
My father gave me everything. The father is the only one who knows the son, and the only ones who know the father are the son and those the son chooses to reveal him to.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Become my servants and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
"My service is easy and my burden is light."
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On a Sabbath, Jesus was going through grainfields, and his disciples plucked and ate some heads of grain.
The Pharisees saw this. They said to Jesus, "Look! This is unlawful on the Sabbath. But your disciples are doing it anyway!"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him?"
So he entered the house of God, and he and his men ate the sacred bread, which was only allowed to be eaten by the priests.
Haven't you read the law? It tells us that the priests in the temple are to do their work every Sabbath day. Yet they are not considered guilty.
I tell you that someone more important than the temple is here.
The writing says, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice" (Hosea 6:6). You do not know what these words mean. If you knew, you would not accuse the innocent.
The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.
From there, Jesus entered their synagogue.
There was a man with a weak and twisted hand. The Pharisees tried to find fault with Jesus. They asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
The man is more valuable than the sheep! Therefore, the law allows us to do good on Saturday.
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out, and his hand was restored whole, just like the other one.
But the Pharisees went out and plotted to kill Jesus, the chosen servant of God.
Jesus knew all about the Pharisees' plans, so he left that place. Many people followed him, and he healed every sick person among them.
But he advised them not to tell anyone who he was.
This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:
Here is my servant. I have chosen him. He is the one I love. I am fully satisfied with him. I will pour my Spirit on him. He will proclaim to the nations that everything will be alright.
He will not argue or shout. No one will hear his voice in the streets.
He will not break a bent branch. He will not quench a flickering flame. He will restore everything to its rightful place.
"The nations will put their hope in him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Bezelbob
A man possessed by demons was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Afterward, the man was able to speak and see.
Everyone was amazed, and they asked, "Could this be the Son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man casts out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the prince of demons."
Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand."
If the devil drives out the devil, he is fighting against himself. How then can his kingdom stand?
You say that you cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. But by whose power do your people cast them out? So then, they will be your judges.
But what if the demons are cast out by the Spirit of God? Then the kingdom of God has come to you.
Consider this. How can you enter a strong man's house and simply take what he has? You must first tie him up. Then you can rob his house.
He who is not with me is against me. He who does not gather the sheep with me scatters them.
Here is what I tell you: Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven, but the evil spoken against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. Such a person will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come."
A good tree bears good fruit, and a bad tree bears bad fruit. You can tell a tree by its fruit.
O brood of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak any good? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
A good man speaks good things, which spring from the goodness within him. An evil man speaks evil things, which spring from the evil within him.
But this is what I tell you: On the Day of Judgment, people will be asked about every careless word they have spoken.
"By your words you will be condemned or justified." "The sign of Jonah the prophet"
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus and said, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
He answered, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign! But no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
Jonah was in the belly of a great fish for three days and three nights. Something similar will happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the tomb.
The men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And behold, one greater than Solomon is here.
What happens when an evil spirit comes out of a human? It roams the dry lands in search of a place to rest. But it finds none.
Then he says, "I will return to the house I left." When he arrives, he finds the house empty. It has been cleaned and tidied perfectly.
Then the devil goes out of the man and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself. They go in and live there, and the man ends up in a worse state than before. So it will be with evil people in our time." Jesus' mother and brothers
While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.
She told him personally, "Your mother and brothers are outside. They want to speak with you."
Jesus answered him, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus pointed to his disciples and said, "Here is my mother! Here are my brothers!
"Everyone who does what my Father wants in heaven is my brother or sister or mother."
The Farmer's Tale
On the same day, Jesus left the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
A large crowd gathered around him. He got into a boat, sat down in it, and all the people stood on the shore.
Then he told them many stories. He said, "A farmer went out to sow his seeds.
He scattered the seeds on the ground. Some fell on the path. Birds came and ate them.
Some seeds fell on rocky places, where there was little soil. The plants grew quickly, because the soil was not deep.
When dawn broke, the sun scorched the plants. They withered because they had no roots.
Other seeds fell among the thorns. The thorns grew up and choked the plants.
Other seeds fell on good soil. They produced a crop a hundred, sixty, or thirty times more than what was sown.
"He who has ears, let him hear."
The pupils came to him and asked, "Why do you use stories when you speak to people?"
He replied, "You have been given the opportunity to understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven. It has not been given to those outside."
Those who have this kind of knowledge will be given more. In fact, they will receive a great deal. As for those who do not have this kind of knowledge, even what little they have will be taken from them.
That's why I use stories when I talk to people. I say, "They look, but they don't really see. They listen, but they don't really hear or understand."
In it, the words of the prophet Isaiah are fulfilled. He said, "You will hear, but not understand, and you will see, but not know what you are seeing."
"Their hearts have become callous. They barely hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise, they might see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn to the Lord, and he would heal them." (Isaiah 6:9-10)
But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and blessed are your ears, for they hear.
What I am about to tell you is true. Many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you see, but they did not see it. They wanted to hear what you hear, but they did not hear it.
Listen! Here is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message about the kingdom but do not understand it. Then comes the devil. He steals what was sown in their hearts. These people are like the seed sown on the path.
Others took the seed that fell on rocky places. These are the ones who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy.
But they have no roots. They do not last long. They quickly turn away from the faith when harm or suffering comes because of the message.
Others received the seed that fell among the thorns. They are the ones who hear the message. But then, the worries of this life and the deceitful promises of wealth choke it. They prevent it from bearing fruit.
But others received the seed that fell on good soil. They are the ones who hear the message and understand it. They produce a harvest that is 100, 60, or 30 times more than what the farmer planted. - The Parable of the Weeds
Jesus told the crowd another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field."
But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. The enemy planted weeds among the wheat and then left.
The wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
The landowner's workers came to him and said, "Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Then where did the weeds come from?"
"An enemy did this," he replied. "The servants asked: 'Do you want us to go and weed?'"
"No," answered the owner. "While you're weeding, you might pull up the wheat along with the weeds.
Let them grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the workers what to do. This is what I will say to them: First, gather the weeds. Bind them in bundles to burn them. Then gather the wheat. Bring it to my barn." "Parables of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast"
Jesus said to the crowds another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field."
It is the smallest of your seeds, but when it grows, it is the largest of all the plants in the garden. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest in its branches.
Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast," he said. "A woman mixed it into a large amount of flour. The yeast worked its way through all the dough."
Jesus spoke of all these things to the crowds in parables; he said nothing to them without using a parable.
The words of the prophet have come to pass. He said, "I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter hidden things, things from the creation of the world." (Psalm 78:2) Jesus explains the parable of the weeds.
Then Jesus left the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
He answered, "It is the Son of Man who sows the good seed.
The field is the world. The good seed represents the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the devil.
The enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the world. And the workers are the angels.
Weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire. That is how it will be on the Day of Judgment.
The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will remove from his kingdom everything that causes people to sin and all those who do evil.
They will be thrown into the blazing furnace. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then the people of God will shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom. He who has ears, let him hear. Parables of the hidden treasure and the pearl.
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again. He was very happy. So he went and sold all he had. And he bought that field.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of rare pearls.
He found one of great value. So he went and sold all he had. And he bought that pearl. The parable of the net.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered every kind of fish.
When it was full, the fishermen pulled the net onto the shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish into baskets. But they threw away the bad fish.
Thus will be the Day of Resurrection. The angels will come. They will separate those who did wrong from those who did right.
The wicked will be thrown into the blazing furnace. There they will wail and gnash their teeth.
"Do you understand all these things?" asked Jesus. "Yes," they answered.
He said to them, "Every teacher of the law who has become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old." A prophet without honor.
Jesus finished telling these stories, and then he left.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth. There he began to teach the people in their synagogue. They were amazed. "Where did this man get this wisdom? Where did he get this power to do miracles?" they asked.
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother Mary? Aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
Aren't all his sisters with us? So where did this man get all these things?
They were not at all pleased with him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, and among his own relatives and in his own house."
He performed some miracles there only because they were unbelievers.
John the Baptist's head was cut off.
At that time, Herod the tetrarch of Galilee and Perea heard about Jesus.
He said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do these miracles."
Herod arrested John. He bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, who had been the wife of Philip, Herod's brother.
John said to Herod, "It is against the law for you to have her."
Herod wanted to kill John, but he feared the people, for they regarded John as a prophet.
At Herod's birthday feast, Herodias' daughter danced for Herod and his guests. Herod was delighted.
He promised her by oath to give her what she asked for.
Her mother told her what to say. So the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very angry. However, he remembered his promise and his dinner guests. So he told one of his men to give her what she asked for.
Herod cut off John's head in prison.
His head was brought on a large platter and delivered to the girl. She then carried it to her mother.
John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed the five thousand.
Jesus heard what had happened to John. He wanted to be alone. So he went in a boat to a quiet place. The crowds heard about it. They followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus reached the shore, he saw a large crowd. He felt deep compassion for them. He healed their sick.
As evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, "This is a remote place, and it's already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves."
Jesus answered, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat."
"We have only five loaves of bread and two fish," they answered.
"Bring them to me here," he said.
Then Jesus directed the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, and gave thanks. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, who distributed them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples took up twelve basketfuls of the broken pieces.
The number of men who ate was about 5000. Women and children also ate. Jesus walked on water.
Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat. He said to them, "Go on ahead to the other side of the Sea of Galilee." Then he dismissed the crowds.
After sending them away, he climbed a mountain alone to worship. When evening came, he was still there by himself.
The ship was already far from the shore. The waves were beating against it violently because the wind was blowing against it.
Early in the morning, Jesus came to his disciples. He walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and were afraid. "It's a ghost!" they said, and cried out in fear.
Immediately Jesus called out to them, "Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid."
"Lord," Peter asked, "if it is you, tell me to come to you on the water."
Jesus said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat, walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid. He began to sink. He cried out, saying, "Lord, save me!"
Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?"
When they boarded the boat, the wind died down.
Then those who were in the boat worshiped Jesus, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God."
They crossed the lake and arrived at Gennesaret.
The men who lived there recognized Jesus. So they sent a message throughout the surrounding countryside. And people brought all their sick to Jesus.
They asked him to allow the sick to touch only the hem of his garment, and everyone who touched him was healed.
What makes people "unclean"?
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came from Jerusalem to see Jesus, and they asked him,
Why don't your students obey what the elders teach? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!
Jesus replied, "Why then do you disobey God's commandment? You prefer to follow your own teachings!"
God said: "Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) He also said: "Whoever curses his father or mother shall be put to death." (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:whenwhenwhenwhenw
But you allow people to say to their families: "Every bit of help you have received from us is a gift dedicated to God."
They do not need to honor their parents with such a gift. You make the word of God of no effect in order to follow your own teachings.
O hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you. He said:
"These people honor me with their words, but their hearts are far from me."
"Their worship means nothing to me. They teach only human laws." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand.
What goes into your mouth does not make you 'unclean'; what comes out of your mouth is what makes you 'unclean'.
Then his disciples came to him and asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus answered, "There are plants that my Father did not plant in heaven. They will be uprooted.
Leave them. The Pharisees are blind guides. If a blind man leads another blind man, they will both fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Do you still not understand?" Jesus asked them.
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes into the stomach. Then it comes out of the body.
But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart. These are the things that make you "unclean."
Evil thoughts come from the heart. So do murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. Also theft, bearing false witness, and lying to others.
These are the things that make you "unclean." But eating without washing your hands does not make you "unclean." "The faith of a Canaanite woman"
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A Canaanite woman, who lived near Tyre and Sidon, came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is severely tormented by a demon."
Jesus remained silent. His disciples came to him and asked, "Send her away, for she is crying out after us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
Then the woman knelt before him. "Oh Lord! Help me!" she said.
He replied, "It's not right to take the children's bread and throw it to their dogs."
"Yes, sir," she said. "But even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' tables."
Then Jesus answered and said, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour. Jesus feeds the four thousand.
Jesus departed from there. He walked along the Sea of Galilee, then went up on a mountain and sat down.
A large crowd came to him, bringing with them the blind, the lame, the paralyzed, those unable to speak, and many others. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them.
The people were amazed. Those who could not speak began to speak. The lame were healed. Those who could not walk began to walk. The blind could see. So the people praised the God of Israel.
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have great compassion on this crowd, for they have been with me three days now and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."
His disciples answered him, "There is nothing here," they said, "but five loaves and two fish." "Where shall we get enough bread to feed this great crowd?"
How many loaves do you have? asked Jesus. "Seven, and a few small fish," they answered.
Jesus told the crowds to sit down on the ground.
The lion took the seven loaves and the fish, and gave thanks. Then he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples distributed them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. Afterward, the disciples gathered seven baskets of leftovers.
The number of men who ate was 4000. Women and children also ate.
After Jesus had sent the crowds away, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
Jesus is asked for a sign from heaven.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
He replied: "In the evening you look at the sky. You say: 'The weather will be nice. The sky is red.'"
And in the morning you say, "Today will be stormy. The sky is red and cloudy." You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you cannot understand the signs of what is happening now.
"An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." And he left them and went away. The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
The pupils crossed to the other side of the lake. They forgot to bring bread.
"Beware," Jesus said to them, "of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The pupils talked about it among themselves. They said, "He must be saying that because we didn't bring any bread."
Jesus knew what they were saying. He said to them, "Your faith is very small. Why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread?"
Still don't understand? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets were collected with the pieces?
Don't you remember the seven loaves for the four thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets you gathered the pieces in?
How can you not understand? I was not talking to you about bread. But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not warning them about the yeast used in bread, but was warning them about the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter says that Jesus is the Messiah.
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "What do people say about the Son of Man?"
They answered, "Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah, and still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
But what about you? he asked. "Who do you say that I am?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my heavenly Father."
Here is what I say to you. You are Peter. On this rock I will build my church. The gates of hell will not be strong enough to destroy it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Then Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. Jesus speaks about his upcoming death.
From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised up on the third day.
Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him. "Never, Lord!" he said. "This must never happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Whoever wants to follow me must deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow me."
If he wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he sacrifices his life for me, he will find a better one.
What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?
The Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father, and his angels with him, and then he will reward each person according to their deeds.
What I tell you is true. Some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
The appearance of Jesus changed.
Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
There before them, his appearance changed. His face shone like the sun. His clothes became white as the light of day.
At that very moment, Moses and Elijah appeared before them. Moses and Elijah were speaking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three booths: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
While Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them. A voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!"
When the disciples heard this, they were greatly afraid. They fell on their faces to the ground.
But Jesus came and touched them. "Get up," he said. "Don't be afraid."
When they looked up, they saw no one but Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. As they were coming down, Jesus instructed them, saying, "Do not tell anyone what you have seen. Wait until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
The students asked, "Why do Islamic scholars say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus replied, "That is true. Elijah is to come and restore all things.
But I say to you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also will they do to the Son of Man.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus healed a boy who had a demon.
As they approached the crowd, a man came up to Jesus. He knelt before him.
"Sir," he said, "have mercy on my son. He is violently shaken and suffers greatly. He often falls into the fire or into the water.
I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.
"You brood of vipers and evil doers!" answered Jesus. "How long shall I stay with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring the boy to me."
Jesus commanded the demon to leave the boy, and it did. He was healed instantly.
Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why couldn't we cast out the demon?"
He replied, "Because your faith is so small. What I'm about to tell you is true. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死死cıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcıcı

They gathered in Galilee. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men."
"They will kill him. On the third day he will rise from the dead." The disciples were deeply distressed. Jesus pays the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. There, the tax collector came to Peter and asked him, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
"Yes, he does," he replied. When Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "Who collects taxes from the kings of the earth? Do they collect them from their sons or from others?" Git Git Git
"From others," Peter answered. "Sons ought not to pay," Jesus told him.
But we don't want to anger them. So go to the lake and cast your fishing line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. You will find there the small coin you need. Take it and give it to them for our tax.
