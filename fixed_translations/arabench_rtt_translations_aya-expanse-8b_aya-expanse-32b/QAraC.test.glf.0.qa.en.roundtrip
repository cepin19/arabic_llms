Alas! It's an opportunity we won't let slip away.
Also, I don't interfere. It's my right to take, and I already have your right to take before me.

Salih, don't be ..., God forgive me!

And you found a great feast.
The meeting has no owner.
Say that to yourself.
We won't have this holiday again.
Don't act strange, oh! Saleh.
And keep the opportunity away from us.
No, no, no, no, don't try to convince me, it's impossible, impossible, I won't do it.
The problem is that he's afraid.
Afraid of what?
This is a government project! Everyone is taking.
This is the law!
Even people who don't participate benefit from it.
He is the head of a huge project.
This means he is dominant.
Third Millennium International Beaches, specifically the first phase of infrastructure.
Such a fool
This is the place where we can loot!
If he refuses to take
Who gave you the right?
What you have the right to exploit.
When his car wouldn't start.
Who was uploading it to the project site? Wasn't it me?
No, if that's the case, you're right.
Who gives you money to run your car four and five times!
Leave it to me.
Don't be foolish, be stubborn.
Take advantage of some benefits.
Look at Uncle Thursday.
And now, as you say, they claim he is a millionaire.
A third of the project,
The other third is commission.
He plays in a folk band.
They say there was a national celebration.
And he bought a hundred lamps.
You know what they did.
Add the zero.
No use, auntie!
No, God will guide him, if He wills.
Let's eat with him.
I spent last night trying to convince him.
It's an opportunity.
Let there be good.
And if God wills, good will prevail.
This is common.
Let's keep it between us.
Don't talk to anyone about that.
Should we be worried?
But my friends
Neck pain.
The man began to change his mind.
I spoke with him today.
Two-hour morning.
He began to be convinced.
We have a meeting with him soon.
And we must convince him.
He's cutting off our benefits.
They really pushed him to change his mind at the meeting.
Brother Ali, Brother Osman.
I don't know.
Because today is my first day at work.
Rely on me.
However you get there!
Certainly. But are you sure I'll get some?
I want to ask you
If you are hungry and walking down the street
Do you eat or not?
I am a person who eats a lot.
Don't worry.
The dish is large.
We're still working on the draft for the meeting.
If you're not well.
If you have any concerns
What do I really want to know?
It's legitimate.
Oh God, calm him down! Saleh.
This is reasonable because you're a boss for the first time in your life.
It's very simple.
We will add our share.
In the project budget?!
What do you think?
So no one doubts what we're doing.
Publish our contribution as a separate article!
This amount of money has been looted.
By the people responsible for the project.
Cannot
No, no, no! Oh! Alright!
You know how these things happen.
But it seems you have some concerns.
It's their right.
First and foremost,
Everything is in our hands.
I told you he was lying.
What's wrong with you?
He says the new car belongs to his friend, and you believe him.
He said that!
Let's say it's his friend's car.
At a very special location, too!
Except for a very rich man.
I heard that from people.
He told me that he bought the land and registered it in his name.
"Please say" o
He has the money now.
Now he will start lying.
Aren't we his family?
Is that all?
We don't get anything?
We'll end up getting something!
He wants to eat it alone, bite by bite.
Don't bow your head!
Not your brother either.
Sit down and everything will be alright.
I talked to him all night.
I told him that no matter what, they are your relatives.
Finally, he agreed.
This is how things should be.
And hoping that you don't get it just once.
This is the international beaches of the third millennium.
Specifically, infrastructure.
Later, they will start the second phase.
And you will continue with him.
"O Allah, grant him a better reward."
It's good that you pressured him into agreeing.
You're no different from them.
But it doesn't matter.
I hope you made it clear to him.
We want a percentage.
They all take a percentage.
Until he said, "After I convinced you."
They encourage their friends to attend the meeting to set the project budget.
They have to follow through, it's their money.
We place it and we're sure of it.
Submit it for approval as soon as possible.
Take your time.
Who is this? Do you know him?
He is my wife's brother who shares with me.
Do you mean that?
They are responsible for doors, windows, and everything related to finishing.
Sweet, sweet
How much do you want to finish?
How much will you get?
Is that because we're taking the money?
Let's give ourselves a week to think.
And specify the amount of money we'll get.
It contains people waiting and wanting some.
Abdulaziz is right.
If someone decides to take half a million.
This week, everyone will think carefully.
And specify the amount they want.
By next week, they will have made their decisions and determined how much they want.
It's none of your business.
Then, is it in your hand?
Ignore him.
Hello, my friend. What's up? What's wrong?
I don't know what he's doing here.
Ha! Who invited you to this project?
It's a government project.
Salih, is your brother's name Sultan?
This is our neighbor's driver.
He sometimes drives us when our car isn't working.
Write.
Sanad Abdullah
No, no, there are three other people.
What else can I do? I'm tired of it.
I told him, "Enough, man. Let's propose the budget and get it over with."
No, no, this requires a sum of money.
How much should I give him?
According to him, does he have children?
Yes, for him, let it be twenty-five thousand four hundred.
Four hundred
They add it forcibly.
How much you will give them!
This is too much.
This is my mother, as we were just talking about.
Yes, Mother.
Yes, no, no, no, the latter, my child! Oh!
No, my son, you want to go to Thailand for treatment.
Wait, wait, what's wrong?
Why are you angry?
Only from the first phase, the infrastructure in particular.
Not in use
Add three thousand.
Buy me some watches from Thailand with bright straps.
Did you add her?
Yes, Mother.
No, I didn't add her, I just wanted to check the name.
Dear, Mother
Let's expand the holiday feast.
Yes, but the budget needs to be defined; it can't be open-ended like this.
Tomorrow is the final meeting and everyone must decide how much money they want.
I got it.
Is one million enough?
Too much, my love.
Oh! Guys, wait, it's noisy, give us a chance.
The committee is in session now to approve the project budget. Financial matters are not discussed now, that's all.
I want more
We told you not to embarrass us, we are in the ministry's courtyard.
Oh my God, we're screaming, don't draw attention to us.
If someone comes and asks what's bothering all of you here
We'll tell him that the power is out or that you got a shock.
Don't make noise in the ministry's square.
Be quiet %pw Be quiet %pw
Sew it! Do you hear me!
How much are you with them, how does the scale stand now?
Excluding my brother.
Total, 50 million.
Fifty million is just for the first phase.
What time is it now?
What, Saleh?
Participation is caring, man!
In any case, bon appétit.
Hurry, let's work, all the beneficiaries are waiting for us.
No problem.. and most importantly, we don't want any discussions, let them agree on the budget and that's it.
And start implementing tomorrow.
And it serves a very large segment of the community.
God bless you, this is the International Millennium Beaches Project.
This is the first stage.
More specifically, the infrastructure.
It's for future generations.
Certainly, on behalf of our program's staff, we would like to welcome and congratulate you on the launch of the project, which will take place tomorrow, God willing, to the best of my knowledge.
What took us a year and a half.
Two and a half years
Once again, on behalf of the Future Achievements Program,
This project
And future generations
May the blessing of the oil remain upon us from God.
Second, third, and tenth stages.
actor
Welcome aboard.
Why have we been gathered here? When will the cars come to pick us up?
What? Where should they take us?
Praise be to God, I have grown up and become aware of Alzheimer's.
Let's sit down, the sun is hot.
Yes, a nice girl.
But I don't see anything.
Everything except the sea.
Why were you fired?
Aman told me that my sister Manira is here.
My father's land in the desert
I wondered who lied to her and gave her incorrect information.
Not that land.
I saw a farm in the desert and thought it was your father's.
Moreover, why do you ask about these things?
They have brothers.
Those who work hard, invest in land, real estate, and businesses, and make an effort.
Free from headaches.
I am disappointed in you, oh! Iman
And also, my sister.
How don't you know?
They must give it to me.
They are your brothers.
And nothing is better than the truth.
Because money
Now we help her and drive her to the hospital.
I don't know how many years she spent fighting with her brothers in the courts.
Nine years, or more.
No, but
Are the brothers of Umm Salim thieves?
Poor thing, she was telling me yesterday that
She wants to build a mosque before she dies.
You don't know.
I'm not saying your brothers are like her, God willing they aren't.
How many years have passed since my father's death?
Why are you asking now?
And she saw the farm.
What else do you want?
Are checks not paid to her every three months?
Calm down, let's understand the story first.
It's none of her business.
If it were someone else, his sisters wouldn't get even a single riyaL.
I understood.
Where from?
As if it's not my money.
Look what, Monira
Please look at him.
Becomes fifty thousand
Because I was brave and asked about my father's land, the one in the desert.
I'm sure my share is more than that.
Everyone lives in such a villa.
Their children are in the best schools.
What to say, oh! Munira
I won't stop fighting for my rights.
I will get my revenge.
I'd rather invest your money in the company! No thanks.
Everyone is fighting each other.
People have lost their compassion.
Don't think your brothers will be any better than mine.
Look at me.
Twenty years
I used to go to the court frequently.
And in the end
I didn't get anything from her.
Why are they doing that?
That's the reason I'm telling you, dear, be nice to them!
Be kind to them.
And you will rise above them.
And why do courts take so long?
We are four hundred thousand in total.
If we reach a million like other countries.
I really doubt that an order will be issued, my dear.
Look at my brothers.
I swear I don't want all that.
What to say, oh! My dear.
I can only say that God alone is sufficient for us, and He is the best to determine matters for us.
God is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs for us.
Didn't you have a court session last week?
As usual, oh! My dear!
The judge asked us to file a brief.
We've been through this many times.
My dear, they will invest millions, and you will just be a spectator.
As I told you, you'll get tired of the courts.
And no one will take your right.
This is the reason I would tell you if I were in your position.
I'll be satisfied with what they give me.
Because the woman
We owe you nothing.
Men ask you!
She has some.
Just some questions regarding her share and
She just wants to know something and leave.
If you don't find him
I'll drag you and show you.
He will find his way.
I signed the waiver.
Two hundred and fifty, which is even more than enough for her, and her husband works.
Take it or leave it.
Why are you asking now?
But he is greedy.
As if it's not real.
It's my father's inheritance, and he wants to decide how much I should take, take it or leave it.
It's not my right or his right to make the decision.
This is God's command.
Why are they tormenting my father in his grave?
I didn't expect that from them.
This is because of the money.
It opened thirty years ago.
I don't know what to do, oh! Nasser
Land, buildings, and real estate are easy to understand.
I don't know how much they get.
Even the company,
It's your right to go and ask about everything.
And I will not leave them alone.
How will you get back to them?
It's none of your business.
And this is none of your business either, I have the right to know everything.
It seems that
Your sister gave him a mandate.
That enables him to examine almost everything in the company.
"Saghyr, Sa'ad"
He's shouting at us.
"Sakar, enough."
Brother Nasser
Excuse me, I'll take it.
Yes, sir.
Go, now.
Sorry, go.
Don't give him a reason to attack us.
Now, if he goes and sues us,
He said he hit you.
So, shall we let him do what he wants?
He has an official document.
Official! We can't stop him.
His legal right lost everything.
If he looks at the budget and accounts
We give her forty thousand every three months.
If you check the budget.
Double twelve by eight
Divide it into three parts.
Twenty-three
Do you know how much?
Thus we are indebted to her.
Except for lands and projects
We are free to do what we want.
We fear nothing, we are not afraid.
If he differs, this is what we got, and if he agrees, then welcome.
Let them go and deal with it.
They only give their sisters enough money to live on.
She is married.
She has a husband she can rely on.
What do you want to do with the money?
This is what was supposed to be from the beginning.
Yes, sir.
As he likes.
Even my desk.
My brother Rashid, this was supposed to happen before.
As you wish, my lord.
File after file
When I knew her true legacy.
Villas and lands about which you knew nothing.
They turned into seven.
They turned sixteen.
You didn't know.
Poor thing, she was shocked.
It's not fair.
Don't leave them alone.
Oh my son! I don't want to hear anything about courts.
The more you care.
The less the judge's role
For half a minute
Then he will say his usual sentence,
To the seventh, the fourth, the thousandth, I don't know how many.
They will be very happy with my son.
You're not supposed to get out of bed at all, Mom!
Get well soon.
No, no, please come.
Nasser and my sister Manar
After we became the gatekeepers and expelled him from the company.
He's sending one of my classmates.
Abdullah is called.
And now
I won't allow him.
I mean, can he influence them?
Please do.
Yes yes yes
Do not rely on fate.
Courts do nothing but prepare reports.
Delays and conflicts, useless lawyers.
The years pass by.
And the years pass by.
And you won't get a single penny.
May God have mercy on Umm Salim.
You advised me the day before she died.
Never go to court.
He said that our courts
She died without taking any of her inheritance.
She passed away while the judge had not yet resolved her case.
What if we were like other countries?
Hello Abdullah
Brother Abdullah
The years passed.
This is my brother, Saad.
May you be blessed with abundance.
The most important thing
Fraternity
Brother Rashid
You are a brother to me.
Don't leave money matters.
Do you have anything else to talk about besides my sister?
Sorry.
Why should I ask him to stop talking?
He is right.
They don't even want me to get my share of my father's inheritance.
My mother told me yesterday that my brother Saad's wife.
Her father is a messenger at the ministry.
It's all my father's money.
We've been waiting for a long time.
We'll try one last time.
Your friend Abdullah sent them.
They not only disrespected him but also expelled him.
Let's see what Sheikh Abdul Rahman will do.
He is a very kind man.
He said yes, Nasser.
Don't be afraid.
Scare them with the law.
Did you forget what poor Umm Salim said about the courts?
Perhaps the brothers of Umm Salim do not fear the courts.
But my brothers
He may be afraid of rumors.
They might feel ashamed to go to court.
We'll wait and see what happens after Sheikh Abdurrahman visits them.
May God bless you.
Is this a Friday sermon?
If you don't have it, leave.
What are you saying, son?
He is telling the truth.
Go, %pw go
I will go to the court tomorrow morning.
And why should I postpone until after tomorrow?
I'm the one who decides, not you.
What will happen if I wait until the day after tomorrow?
Hello, brother Rashid
This is a promise.
I've told you before.
Let's intimidate them with the law.
Now, I am humbly asked to postpone going to court.
Because they knew you were serious about it, dear.
It's important that we visit your sister Manira.
What is this?
You told me what this is, this.
May God bless you all.
A small model of the courthouse building.
God bless you.
And all of you
May God bless you.
Why didn't you say?
I told you not to go today.
Postpone it until the day after tomorrow.
To get that sample, this is %pw of the courthouse.
Ready to show you the way.
Enter through that door, this one.
When you enter through the door.
You put all your things there.
Keep mobile phones and any metal objects so they do not make beep beep beep beep beep sounds.
The case is registered, you will be asked to go to the eighth floor, eighth elevator, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Wander around the offices.
Look at the judge, if you really need a specific judge, for example.
Also, these.
They want to sue us.
We're here to show her the way.
We'll see when you get your rights.
Either you take the six thousand.
As he said.
Goodbye
We will have dinner today at my sister's house.
Ah, did the ministry approve his project?
My sister told me he was very happy, and he didn't believe it.
He said, "If they approve the project, I'll invite you to dinner at my house."
Thank God, luck comes in pairs.
How happy you are, Abu Waleed!
Good luck.
My sister told me that he was so happy he couldn't sleep last night.
Alhamdulillah! Oh! Manal
He had no experience in business, but some kind men helped him.
Alright, tell your father.
I hope you enjoyed the food.
"Thank you, oh! Boy, Waleed"
Thank you! Oh! May God bless you.
May God fill your life with blessing and abundance.
Delicious food like this, Um Walid.
Hire an accountant and a secretary to organize your business.
They told me to just rent an office, and they would take care of everything.
Please, Uncle.
Oh my darling, my son.
I want a BlackBerry.
We want a bigger house.
Look, it looks better now.
Father, didn't we agree that you would give a speech after lunch?
And now, ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming the owner of the project, my father, Bou Walid.
Sorry to us
Congratulations, Abu Waleed!
You deserve
But, frankly, you're not an expert in business and trade.
Oh my God! There's a story behind this project.
I'll tell you how!
Thank God, %pw
Last year,
When the Japanese team played against our national team.
I was at Souk Waqif.
I don't know about him now.
This is a catalog for a multipurpose hall factory. Our ministry is looking for such halls, please apply for them.
Any contractor can build it for you.
Does not understand
Which contractor?
Japanese people are wonderful.
When you open it, the "computer" says.
Cinema, if you want.
If you want a kitchen, click on "Kitchen".
When I presented the catalog to the ministry committee.
And what about your contract with the factory?
I paid some.
Deposit
Most importantly, your contract with the factory.
I signed it, praise be to God.
And give me some time until I place the first order.
What are you waiting for?
It's true that they agreed to it.
But we're still waiting for Bu Fahd's signature.
What did the secretary say?
He said that he hadn't seen Fahd.
Would you like to drink some tea?
My son, Walid, told me, "What have you done!"
You don't know Bu Fahd, he might come and he might not.
He will appear one day.
He doesn't have time.
Oh my God, come on!
You are the boss here.
Do you want to kill me?
No, he has to sign it.
Look at all these files on my desk, they all need Bo Fahd's signature.
So, what should I do?
May God bless you.
"Fifteen minutes until two o'clock. Oh! Bou Walid"
It's time to go back home.
I don't think Bou Fahad will come.
God willing, He will help you, come tomorrow.
I said that you've known the manager for a long time and he's a friend of yours.
What's wrong with you?
He is a useless manager.
A manager that stupid doesn't do anything.
It is a shame for them to pretend to be wise when they are not.
They don't do anything useful.
Do they do anything at all?
They don't move a chair without Bou Fahd's permission.
The manager didn't ask about you yesterday.
People's issues are pending.
It seems you're going to them today as well.
I'm in trouble.
I face problems every day.
Because the factory gave me limited time.
No, God willing.
What if he asks about you?
You're not the only one waiting for Bu Fahed.
Look at these files.
They all need Bu Fahd's signature.
I think he will come today.
Please sit down.
Or go for a walk.
I'll call you when he comes.
If anything happens, I'll call, don't scare them.
Goodbye
Sorry, I scared you. She's my wife.
Oh my God! They've agreed to my appointment two months ago.
I just need him to sign, what's this?
Oh my child! It's the registration period, my daughter will miss the university scholarship, her papers need to be processed.
My problem with the factory, the deadline, the deadline.
Just wait.
All your papers will be signed.
He's drinking his coffee. Once he's finished, you can come and see him.
Please, I ask you all to be quiet.
Yes, sir.
Goodbye
Wait, wait, people!
Wait, where are you going, wait.
Know what happened first.
What happened?
He has an urgent trip.
He has a private exit.
I'm tired of this.
Our interests stopped, brother.
We wait for Bu Fahd every day.
What can we do, wait for Bu Fahd.
Peace be upon you, my father.
He should not be blamed.
Everything is deteriorating.
The factory is in Japan.
I informed him that the deadline had passed.
And your aunt is another story.
Poor thing, she lent him money.
He is facing problems from all directions.
Oh mother, I am very worried about father.
Don't leave him alone.
Who are you calling?
Yes, who is this?
Bu Waleed
To talk about the factory and your sister-in-law's money.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Father, how long do you want me to wait?
They always say,
And we are waiting for Bu Fahad.
Oh my God! Father, you did your best.
But all my friends will be joining university next week.
What are you looking for?
The phone, dear.
Don't worry, just give me some time.
Alright, who will you talk to?
Wait, Abu Fahd.
I don't know what to say, sister.
You've been very patient with us.
May God bless you.
Bu Waleed is in a pitiful state.
He shivers like a leaf due to the fever.
This is because the allotted time is about to end.
Five days remaining.
He will lose all his money.
God is sufficient for us.
How wonderful! Pull me, pull me, pull me.
I wish I could improve. I feel...
I have an unusual fever.
The top is shaking.
The other part is completely immovable.
Fifty percent of my body isn't working due to the fever.
It's a discount.
Don't worry.
Everything will be alright.
My sister helps.
You will wait until we return her money.
Oh Lord, grant her a speedy recovery.
No, we are not worried about your sister now.
My manager as well, God is with me.
It seems he heard.
Only God knows what he is planning.
I'm annoyed with him and Bu Fahd.
He attracts me, it's a problem.
Tomorrow is the last day.
My wealth will go away.
Don't drag us.
Right in the brain, in the brain.
How will you be able to speak?
Give it to me, let's see who's calling.
Mr. Bou Bled
I'm calling you because I feel sorry for you.
Be on standby.
Goodbye
You were a committed person throughout your life.
You were a role model.
Don't think I'm unaware of you leaving work early every day.
I can deduct from your salary.
What do you have on your phone?
Instead of your enemy
I'll put you on the stock committee.
You will go to the market with them today.
You never leave work during working hours.
If you do
Don't blame me afterwards.
Today is his last chance.
Don't you see him anxious, holding his phone, waiting for their call?
I'm afraid he'll be fired.
My phone! Oh! Bou Walid
He is poor.
Let him go, poor thing.
Ah! Bou Walid
Yes, hello
What's wrong with you, Abu Walid? I'm talking to you, not the phone!
Go finish your paper.
Don't worry.
Many thanks
It seems that Bu Fahd is here.
What can I do for you?
He is a very important officer.
Where is he going?
Let's go to Uzbekistan.
Brother, where is Uzbekistan?
This office is the third one on your left.
Don't cough.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't sit.
Don't look at me.
Do you want to or not?
House by house
Move forward
Oh people! This man is crazy.
Do you know how much I spent?
For all these years, you have been...
He took the papers and brought them back.
My knees are weakening now.
Navigating between all these ministries
But we were young.
I was carrying bags of rice on my back just like kids' potato chip packs.
After that, God willing, I learned to ride a bicycle.
Especially the bicycle that I learned to ride and bought.
Olive green
They were cutting me off when I rode this bike, oh my god.
It is our daily bread, raising our children.
The manager arrived.
We celebrate after you finish.
Thank God, thank God.
So, will you quit your job?
I testify that you are truly a good citizen.
Now I want to rest, brother, %pw goodbye.
We are all for you.
Don't you want us to give you a year's extension?
Enough, enough
May Allah reward you with good.
You've already given me a four-year extension.
I should have retired a long time ago.
All my sons have jobs now.
Lastly, yesterday was his first day at work.
And now, oh! Abdul Aziz,
I want to rest.
And you're just a delivery person.
I translate the following text into Qatari Arabic using Khanfoush.
Do you think that?
I haven't eaten khanafresh for four years.
How delicious!
I can smell it now.
We will do whatever you want.
Take me to the HR department.
Have you finished all the paperwork?
Yes, since yesterday.
Your papers will be delayed.
I'm boring.
Alright, done.
Stay in touch.
My son, Khalid
From this moment
I hope to rest, yes.
Great, great
I'm at work and I can't leave.
Can you stop by the Human Resources Department?
I have some papers over there.
I want you to take them to the Civil Service Department.
Thank you, thank you, Father.
Where are you going?
I have to go to the bank.
She invites us all.
Yes, now.
I have to go to the bank.
Send it with someone else.
No, sister, I can't get out of work.
Alright, alright, goodbye.
It seems he didn't agree, did he?
He said he couldn't quit his job.
What do you intend to do?
I will go to the bank tomorrow morning.
He is used to going to work every day.
I'm sure he'll get bored.
This is good for him.
Will you let him rest?
He's sad about it, but happy that he'll be going home early.
He called and said that Khalid...
I sent him to complete his papers.
Fear God.
Everyone must rely on themselves.
My mother regrets the divorce.
Oh Mother, don't spoil her.
I don't regret it, my daughter!
But I say since he left the job and walked away.
Khaled gave him tasks to do.
He is sleeping in his room.
Those who remained in the seas of their singing
Good morning, Father.
Hello, my daughter
Father, please.
But they called me and said the manager was angry.
Give me your papers.
Yes, Saeed's mother.
I told you to let the children be independent, why don't you listen to me?
As if you hadn't quit.
My pitiful condition
I wait for you, and the confetti was in front of me.
We will eat it today.
Goodbye
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.
Sorry, my dear father.
May God bless you.
Yes, it's next to the market.
Get out of here quickly.
I'm gone, my daughter, I'm gone.
O God, the Most Merciful of the merciful.
God willed it.
Good that you found the house.
Sit, sit, sit
I told you to stay home.
Let your children learn to be independent.
What can I do, O Mother of Saeed?
They are having a tough time, I should help them.
Enough, enough, relax.
And I'll bring you a glass of water.
And sell them to eat them.
His sadness, he is very tired.
And taxis
He is naive.
He went to the market branch.
They want her ID card.
She didn't even take her car.
And she gave him the papers.
I feel better, praise God.
Rely on yourselves.
I told you.
I want you to rest.
Take a chair and sit with us.
Lunch is very delicious.
I was moving from one ministry to another.
I ran from one ministry to another.
Completing my children's papers
You indulged them when they were young, and you still indulge them now.
My sons are in good positions at work.
They're always busy, what can I do?
There are meetings every day, whether with the manager, the director, or the minister.
They have good jobs, when they are needed, they have to be there, it's a %pw job.
* * Even to be able to leave and finish your work, others stop you and force you to sit all the time, what were you thinking about?
I'm coming now. God speed you.
See you later, goodbye.
Excuse me now, oh! oh! Bo Shaheen
They called me and said it's ready.
If you send your father tomorrow to finish your work,
So, I'll be late for work.
Fear God.
Impossible, especially tomorrow, I can't.
Because he loves you.
Although he is angry and exhausted from your mistreatment of him.
He never respects his age.
He was tired and exhausted, so he slept in his room for two days.
Due to wandering the streets under the hot sun.
Let him give you the papers.
And go immediately to finish it.
A committee that starts from early morning until after noon.
Did you hear that, Mom?
Do you want to delay the construction of my building?
Since you have a deadline and a committee tomorrow,
Your papers must be completed tomorrow.
Some of them at night.
He has a committee meeting tomorrow; he must be there.
What's the matter, sir?
He holds back his tears.
In fact, I didn't lie to my father.
The committee changed its mind.
They said they would come by the end of the week.
Well, why didn't you tell him?
Ah! Father, don't go.
I will go because the committee hasn't come.
Instead of sitting in the cafeteria with those girls
You tricked him.
Alright, enough.
I will apologize.
I will do it.
Thank you.
Ah! Father, Kholood is...
He is wrong.
And I'm also selfish.
When he learned that the committee wouldn't come.
We are blessed by you.
And from now on, Father!
We'll do our personal work ourselves.
Stay at home.
Let me kiss your head.
Hello, hello my son!
Good morning
Oh my God! My dear father
The whole world is worth it to me.
I don't want you to be sad.
No bother.
As I told you,
After completing this paper
I really wanted to do it myself.
He asked me to come at once.
Because I have a meeting.
In his high office, the minister.
My happiness
He introduces you to VIPs.
I feel happy when they say my children are with so-and-so.
Don't worry and go to your work, (singing)
Where is Bou Saada?
Please, Father.
The envelope is with me, I'll send it with the tea boy.
He passed by my place, I'll send him with the tea boy.
My dear father
Do you mean he didn't sign?
He may have forgotten.
Because the committee will meet in an hour.
No, God bless you.
My son has a meeting with the minister today.
Give me the papers.
This is my daily routine, work, home, work.
I don't see anyone.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, hello.
Yes, no, I didn't tell him anything.
He takes a week's holiday and goes to the sea.
They said he enjoys himself on the farm.
He goes early in the morning.
He enjoys himself there.
And guess what?
They say he's a good cook.
And we will go to him.
Goodbye
What's wrong?
What's the matter, sir?
"Oh God, guide him."
No, no, I'm fine, nothing's wrong.
Your papers are scattered.
He is at the farm.
And she
Her friend's paper.
I am thirsty, I want water.
Give me water, water.
My dear children
No, no, take this, I don't want it.
Don't write that.
I want to leave them puzzled.
Thank you, sister.
You are right.
No, no, no, I told him.
You are right, sister.
I'm sorry, sister.
They call it "Dori wa Kass."
Talk about the game and the referee.
He started talking nonsense.
And they gave him a title, "Stop Corruption."
People started inciting him.
And bring him some phrases to say on television and radio.
And also
They put him in prison.
Believe it or not, my sister.
These days, everyone is only concerned about themselves.
Why is he looking for trouble?
Now, I will never do that.
Let him speak, and utter his famous phrase: "Stop corruption."
Thank God he's okay.
We are blessed by your arrival.
Goodbye
I'm late for work, Mom.
Listen, my son.
I was warning you.
Last night
Now I just want to remind you.
Alright, Mom.
I will never call.
No radio or TV, and I won't call Q-tell.
Your sister, Aisha, has
And your fiancée has been crying all day.
Have mercy on us, O Lord, and you will be merciful to you.
As I said.
I'll stop talking nonsense.
Because I don't want you to be sad.
Your uncle, Monira's father.
I came here two days after you entered prison.
He said it was over.
It will be cancelled.
After many attempts, he finally calmed down.
But next time you'll be brought to court to give her daughter away.
Alright, Mom.
I promised you.
You won't see any good if you invite a TV or radio show again.
I told you I wouldn't do it.
Sorry, I must go now.
I'll tell you, but keep it a secret.
The manager told me that
He doesn't want you to work here.
Because you might be talking about management.
And you start getting us into trouble.
How will the manager generalize that decision?
He has a million excuses to make.
Where am I going!
Are you serious, Independent?
What did I tell you before?
Hello, yes.
Goodbye
I told you.
You know, because of public interest.
We need to reduce the number of senders in the ministry.
You're right, but
Please tell us "Stop corruption" only once.
Sweet
Stop corruption.
Correct, yes.
You're still here!
We have work to do.
This is a disaster.
Until this issue is resolved.
What did I tell you?
I told you they were going to fire him.
And Munira was standing here and heard me say that.
Yes, Father, you did.
I heard them say it myself.
Please go, let me talk to your father alone.
Let me talk to your father.
He went to prison, we considered it a slip and forgave him.
We can't forgive him after he was fired.
Just because we're relatives,
You hear that.
Calm down.
God willing, everything will be alright.
O Allah, guide us to the straight path.
I didn't come to drink coffee.
I know you.
I feel bored.
Your uncle gave you two weeks.
I swear he will take you by force to court to divorce his daughter.
Even if you leave,
Why do you want to get into trouble?
But beware.
Even if someone asks you,
Ignore him.
Isn't he the anti-corruption man?
Yes, he.
He seems to have been out of sorts lately.
We want to hear it, at least once, please let us hear it.
No, this is perfect.
Are you police officers?
No, no, Mother, you didn't understand.
I asked him to speak on a radio show about a problem my relative faced.
He was hesitant.
We felt he was hesitant because we spoke to him in public.
So I suggested to my cousin that we go to his house and talk to him alone.
Did you feel that he agreed?
He was hesitant.
And go.
Enough, enough, enough
I'll be sad and never talk to you again, you hear that.
Are you Saleh Saad?
No, God bless you, no more, I've gotten rid of that habit, praise be to God.
I have a very good sense of responsibility.
The ideal employee
But unfortunately,
Although I tried
Peace be upon you
We did what you came for, you didn't have to do that.
I was about to call the secretary to inform you of my absence.
Shihab, what's the matter?
You didn't know him.
Is there anyone living in Qatar who doesn't know about Saleh fighting corruption?
You are Salih, known for fighting corruption.
Stop corruption.
Yes, the job.
There are no job openings, you know that.
Good thing you didn't hire him.
Am I crazy to take this job?
I went everywhere, Manira.
Not even one of them told me there was a vacancy five minutes before I came, but they rented it out, I mean, they gave it to someone else.
My sister, Aisha, got divorced yesterday.
I'm responsible for them now.
I have a big responsibility now.
I don't know what to do.
He seeks the minister's favor.
But I didn't feel it was the right thing to do.
I'm afraid this man will take my place.
Enough, stop.
Who said I would be silent?
But I want it done in a way that doesn't affect me.
I'm thinking of a way to get rid of it.
I'll finish it with him.
But how?
I know him.
Is he the one who talks nonsense on the radio?
I'll bring him to your house.
And give him only the information.
You are loyal, patriotic, and...
A very enthusiastic citizen.
Thank you.
I really got rid of it.
I hear your voice as the voice of justice.
I spoke to him, Bu Fahd.
Believe or don't believe, O Salih.
He says, "It's been a long time since we heard him say 'Stop the corruption.'"
He wanted to meet you.
This is natural, Saleh.
I am a servant in the tent.
Forward, forward, forward
You are one of a kind.
Your kind words
Your words on the radio are even better.
Let's hear "Enough corruption" once.
Yes, please, just one, Bo Fahd will say, listen, listen, listen to him.
Stop corruption.
This is the original, sir, this is.
Continue, I don't want you to stop.
I can't
And then he withdrew.
Despite my desire for you to continue solving people's problems and issues.
Listen, Saleh.
I'll give you one problem.
You are the voice of justice.
I want to talk to you alone.
He is a very important person.
You can't say no to him, you have to say yes.
Yes, correct.
This is your chance.
Opportunities don't come twice.
No, it's %pw.
Don't you understand?
Please wait for my brother.
From these issues and problems
Your Excellency, the Minister
The ministry ordered eight thousand tubes in its latest project.
This contains a quantity of twenty grams of poison = centimeter of pressure.
But this employee
To approve the pipes that
Because he wants to take the balance.
Stop corruption.
Thank you, thank you very much, brother Saleh, stop the corruption.
No, God bless you.
This call is a special request.
I hope you hear him.
The latest anti-corruption station.. Stop corruption
Know
Necessity compelled him to do it.
This is the last one.
The sultan was deposed.
Did the minister fire him immediately?
He provided accurate information.
Now, Bou Fahd can do what he wants.
I'll do all the tasks.
Yes, sir.
Certainly, Your Excellency.
Goodbye
Stop corruption.
"I certainly wouldn't do that again."
And here's my job application, sorry, I was joking.
They got what they wanted.
Listen to me.
Because he fears the day will come.
And the bearing of the fruit of his evil deeds.
To criticize and expose corruption.
They fear you.
They deceived me, my sister, Aisha.
You're nice.
Your uncle, Monira's father.
I assure you that I will find a job.
People who criticize are foolish.
They are jealous, they hate our country.
Do we have any problems?
We have no family favoritism.
I have never heard this word before.
In our government departments,
We do not accept bribes.
We don't know him.
Employee
Does a foreigner get more than a citizen? No, never.
We produce everything locally.
The problem is that you belong to a family; we don't have those problems to begin with.
If a manager or supervisor gets angry at you,
We are the best people.
Our country is the best country.
Free of any problems
And thank you.
What did you say on the radio yesterday?
Mom, I want candy.
No candy until dinner.
So no candy.
Why are you tearing your shirt?
My mother, Adoul and I were playing.
I know you were playing.
But what tore your shirt?
God is sufficient for you, Adol.
Come and see what your evil uncle has done.
I told you it was expensive, we don't need to buy it. You said it doesn't matter, it will be nice for Waleed.
Look what he did.
The shirt is now unusable.
This is the reason he is not afraid, no one stops him.
Mom, where's the candy?
Look how he intended to tear it, it's clear that it was a deliberate intention.
Poor Walid
He was happy to wear this shirt for the first time.
He will see.
Where is Adol?
In the garden
Why, what happened?
Something between me and him.
Don't tear it.
They have some shame.
Don't argue with a child.
A child should not be allowed to do as he pleases.
Unrevised
Don't ask me to watch my words.
Are you a repairman?
We will teach them a lesson.
Act respectfully.
Don't argue with him.
Why are you fighting like children?
Stay away from this mother.
Don't interfere.
Tell him to raise his children well.
It's a child.
You can't tell the difference between a grown child, because you're angry.
Know
It's not your fault.
Let's go upstairs.
They don't deserve it.
Wasting our time responding to them.
Should not
Where people loved each other.
Alright, alright, I'm coming. Goodbye, bye.
But sir, you have to sign some documents, the minister wants to see them.
Alright, alright, I'll talk to the minister, don't trouble yourself.
Did you see the disaster, the tragedy?
New, no oh! Aisha
This is not a child's action.
You are right.
Destroy the clothes.
Look, look
This is unwearable.
Look at Adol's pants, he can wear one leg, and the other leg will be exposed.
It's clear that this wasn't torn by hands.
It appears to have been torn using a power saw.
I can only say that God is sufficient for us.
I'll tell you.
Who wants candy? Come here.
I also know.
If you know, take a tour around the villa.
I love you, not just because you know how to ride a bike.
Also, because of something else.
She tells the truth straightforwardly.
Alright, do you want candy?
Yes, I want two.
I'll give you four pieces.
Who tore our clothes in the closet?
How did their father cut it?
He has a big pair of scissors so he can cut the car.
Under the bed, take all the sweets.
Not that much.
No one else can do that.
Why should we be silent?
The most important thing
This is that we insist on what we say.
It was the child, Walid, who tore the clothes.
Which computer?
What is he talking about?
Those cracks are impossible for a child to have made.
Why don't you believe me?
Go and find your friends.
Give me a second.
You're always like this.
We fight daily, my son!
The past days
I ask God for forgiveness and good health.
May God guide you.
Who can carry such a large pair of scissors?
Go and find friends.
A liar like this, Mother.
He went and fetched those big scissors.
Act politely, Sultan, tsk!
Come and find a solution to this, come my son!
How will I start?
Each one of you
You are fathers.
A child is born.
When a child is born,
You are my brothers.
Hear me and make peace among yourselves.
Alright, tell me, what will you do now?
So what, I tore their clothes.
It's nothing compared to the disaster he caused. I lost all my documents and information. Everything was destroyed.
I won't leave him.
He speaks in a very formal Arabic, just like in museums.
Ignore him.
The knocking will continue until it tires him out and he leaves.
He's crazy, my brother and I know him well.
And you're shaking hands.
He is full of hatred and envy.
He's angry because I broke the computer.
Oh, Fahad
Sulan, hit him, hit, hit.
Fear God, O children.
Hit him, hit him, [shut up] be careful, [shut up]
Take your cousins near you, and serve them abroad.
May God guide you.
Oh God, reduce you.
Elderly men.
What did you leave for the children?
Alright, Mom.
Your brother, Abdurrahman
Maybe it was the last time, oh! My son.
You know he's the older brother, oh! Girls
He knows how to talk to people.
And discusses
Don't bother me.
You are supposed to
Playing a role
May God guide you.
Even you, you've become like them, my son!
Mother, they hit my son, it's a conspiracy against us, and you say, %pw, stay away.
Stay away.
Blood is coming out of my son.
You're embarrassing us, boys!
It was the children who were throwing them.
He doesn't want to believe.
I saw them.
We told him it was the children, but he didn't believe us.
He said from his window.
He saw children throwing stones, and because of the distance, he thought they were adults.
I'm not crazy.
You can go.
Perhaps you are tired or feel dizzy.
Do you know who they are?
And they tell me they're stoning me.
They work.
Oh my God! Dearie
I'm telling you to go back home and rest, they've signed a promise, what more do you want?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
What is this, oh my God, my God?
There is no abundance except from Allah.
Mother, Mother
All this is because of you.
Because of you
Your men, but they act like children, very sick minds.
He took me to the hospital, I'm going to faint, I'm going to die.
Yes, but this isn't the first time I've seen him.
And I noticed that he never took his eyes off you.
I'm enrolled in business classes.
But he has been attending class with us for a week.
It's clear he yearns to know you.
Don't be because he loves you so much, don't be too proud.
No, my sister.
I don't want him to think I'm easy.
I ran after him.
Let's keep it simple.
Now he's running after you, thirsty for your knowledge.
It's true that I love him too.
But, I don't feel it's the right time.
One hundred percent
She looks at you and *
Are you waiting for her to come and say, "Excuse me, may I introduce myself"?
Take the initiative.
You are right.
But wait for the right opportunity.
The right opportunity
What are you waiting for? You're enrolled in the same class as her.
What did the teacher say?
Please ask her, madam.
Oh, what's her name?
We've been exchanging glances for three months.
But they never get to know each other.
You are too big.
That means you have to go and say, "Excuse me,
Can I get to know you?
Not that much.
I need to wait for the right opportunity.
A quiet and polite girl.
I don't know what you're looking for.
We finished filming all the episodes yesterday.
Yes, certainly.
Never forget us.
As long as I am free.
He is buying the villa that is located behind our villa for his parents.
For tomorrow, when he gets married, he won't live separately from us.
It's of no use now.
You're late.
You didn't know.
I saw it empty a few days ago, who bought it?
And they bought it through a housing loan from the Development Bank.
Oh Lord, bless their home.
Hello, hello, my son, good morning.
Start the engine, run the engine.
Thank you, my son. May Allah reward you with good.
Hello Nora, come outside, the car is running now, come on, I'll take you.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
What do you want?
Neighbors talk to each other, what do you want?
I'd rather you left us alone.
The neighbors are talking to each other, and you're an outsider.
A man parked his car behind mine, and I can't move it.
So, if you don't mind, give me your car keys.
Even the car key
I'll leave you in this Titanic atmosphere.
We meet again.
Goodbye
Now you know a lot about me.
I only know that you are Waleed.
Walid Rashid Abdullah
Certainly, upon hearing your father's name, many people will assume you are the son of the famous actor.
Same name, God willing.
In fact, my father is Rashid Abdullah, the actor.
Is Rashid Abdullah, the famous actor, your father?
You're eating cookies! Why didn't you eat dinner with them?
Tell me.
How did you know that the famous actor, Rashid Abdullah, is our neighbor?
Yes, exactly.
My friend at university, you know them, as she told me.
He loves acting and watching his own work.
He finally said, "We live next to a famous and valued person in the community."
My heart, oh such happiness
Very nice, he has a sense of humor.
And his son is a kind man, he helped me, may God reward him with good.
It was said that
Do you know what?
Do you know why I want to take pictures with him?
Oh mother, speak to my uncle Abuud.
I read an interview with him in the newspaper.
He said that a TV series about diving will be filmed.
Good luck, bring you a sheep, a gift for your new villa.
He proved to be a good neighbor.
Hello Saleh, anything new?
In fact, we have many names.
They told me, O Abu Sa'd, "May Allah bless you, I am on (the list)."
It will be determined according to the needs and experiences of the employees.
We don't know.
We may not transport you.
You must excuse me, I won't be able to do anything for you.
Thank you.
We wanted to move and settle first, then when God blesses us with money, we'll buy furniture.
I did the right thing.
Oh! Bouali
Don't consider me a stranger.
You need anything.
I'm ready to help.
Neighbors help each other (metaphor).
But now I've heard and seen it.
This is good, God willing, you are an expert in furniture.
So I'll go with you.
Don't worry, oh! My sister.
Whenever you want to choose the furniture, let me know.
Dear, your father has applied for a loan, and if approved, we will change all the furniture.
And I repeat that again.
Feel free to ask me anything.
We're like a family now.
Your sister can't study without your help.
But I want her to be independent.
I'm sure you were talking to her!
Do you want me to lie and say he was my friend?
Ah! my son, Ah! Ali
I don't object to that.
As long as she loves me and I love her, I'll solve the issue.
You are dreaming.
Let me suggest my cousin to you.
Let me handle her.
As you wish.
They will reject you.
We are seen.
Good night.
Good night.
What's up, Abu Ali?
Oh no! My brother's car broke down.
At all times, it haunts me.
My daughter, God bless her, has a lecture.
This car is always breaking down.
Your daughter is our daughter.
It doesn't matter.
No need to worry yourself, my brother Rashid!
No, God bless you.
The car is parked in the yard, and the driver is sitting idle.
It seems the development bank bought you a house and a car.
It's not our car.
Our neighbor Rashid Abdullah's car.
I see that relations are evolving.
We will discuss matters of mutual interest that serve the benefit of both parties.
Oh my God, this is a huge development.
Let's go.
Oh Mother, this is embarrassing.
Did not agree
She said, "Nora is like my daughter, and the driver will take her to university every day."
Did you tell her that Dad's car will be in the shop for a week?
I swear, no.
She said the driver would take her every morning.
God is a witness, oh! Mother of Ali.
They are good people.
No, no, no! Oh, a man!
No initiative nor power except from God.
What a nuisance, what a nuisance, what am I going to do now?
What can I do, I have responsibilities.
Who will drive my daughter to college?
Oh! Bouali, since Mr. Rachid Abdallah recommended me to you.
We cannot refuse your request.
Bu Saad, Bu Saad
I'm sorry, Abu Saad.
Bu Ali knows how much we love him.
Thank you, may Allah reward you with good, O Abu Saad!
They love you, God willing.
This is sweet.
Oh people! Mr. Rashid is busy, let him go.
Sorry, sorry Mr. Rashid, if we wasted your time.
No problem
Good luck, you have good connections.
We are your friends and brothers, take care of us when we need something.
Just tell me where you want me to bring it, and I'll do it for you.
What happened? What's going on? Why are you dragging me?
You will suggest to Manal
Agree, mother, agree.
Manal talked to her mother about me.
Why don't you believe?
Umm Waleed
Dresses too, do you have a party?
I don't understand.
Perhaps Walid will get married soon, too, apple of my eye.
She called me, poor thing.
She takes some accessories.
No accessories! Jewelry.
Is this my mother?
You will also go in a fancy vehicle.
Insha'Allah, Insha'Allah
God willing, I cannot look at you.
This is very kind of Umm Waleed.
In addition to all that, the car gave you
With the driver.
If I go with you looking like this, they won't believe that this tired man is the husband of that queen.
Oh my God
Will you go in this outfit?
What! No, no, no, no, don't worry.
I'll change my appearance, you won't be able to recognize me.
They will be surprised when they think I am a sheikh.
Bring him coffee, may he live long.
Bu Ali, I didn't think you were you. I thought you were someone important, not Bu Ali. You're not Bu Ali.
What do you think?
He even has a different way of walking.
God bless you, the people we suggest Ali to.
They are VIPs.
I've arranged everything from the igal (headwear) to the car.
I'm sure I'll find him with you.
In the last series I participated in
There was an action, as I recall, a marriage.
You were wearing a shiny black bisht.
And I also want you to teach me how to wear a bisht.
Because, God bless you, I've never worn a bisht in my life.
God willing, you look great.
Like this, even when you enter the guest room.
This is not correct.
My brother, Rashid,
Do you have cufflinks?
Good evening
Always with me and Khulood.
This is the reason.
You are my child.
We are a family now.
And we don't want our daughter Nora to be far from us.
Nora suits Waleed.
He told me he sees her at university and that he won't find a better wife than her.
We are blessed with this.
I will tell her father, and God will help us to do what is best.
Why did they reject him, and for what reason?
Because his father is an actor.
Ask your father to come.
Quickly, tell him Rashid wants to see you.
Where are you, my God!
I'm crying from sadness.
Because his father is an actor.
You have no shame.
I am an actor.
Nevertheless, I am acting honestly.
I act on stage for a few hours and my role is over.
When the acting is over.
You play roles.
I act.
Provide a helpful insight
But you
I wear costumes to perform roles.
On the stage
But you
You wore it in the guest rooms.
The Role of the Rich and Affluent Woman
Who is the actor?
Who is the real actor?
Don't be sad, Oh! Waleed
Lift your head up.
This is a shame.
You missed the scene.
I heard her shout at him, "Don't turn your head, don't turn your head," poor thing, it broke my heart.
Walking in a straight line
Just like a horse.
It's Thursday, oh man, Thursday.
It's Thursday.
His wife is crazy.
She's jealous of other women.
That's why he walks like that.
So that he may not see women, and no woman may see him.
You see how his wife drives him crazy.
Straight, do not turn your face.
I'll show it to him in the office tomorrow.
James, please, please, show them the downtown area.
James, show me the look of the city center.
Don't you call your wife "downtown"?
Ya La Khamis
I'll go see what Salem wants.
Poor him.
When will you change?
If you only hear what they say about you.
Even in front of me, they say more than that.
Why are you doing that?
She's jealous of the women around me.
Why would you be so jealous?
When I sometimes sit in front of the TV
It's her, she is.
I swear by God.
No, no, I'm fine.
Hello, peace be upon you, my sister.
You see that.
I just spoke to her, right in front of you, I heard a man's voice.
I swear, sometimes she throws my clothes in the street.
Show some respect and let her go.
I find it difficult to divorce her.
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Don't come near me, stay there.
What's on your mind!
Nothing bad.
Who are you talking to?
You're wasting your time with these incapable people.
Especially this fat man, he is the person I hate the most among your friends.
The one with a full face and hair like a child's plants.
That whale has no shame.
You want to torment me in my grave.
Let me talk to her.
Tell me, what do you have?
Who are you talking to!
I can't see anyone here.
Hello, how are you! What's up!
Our friend Khamis is crazy.
After a while, he faced the wall and started talking to himself.
Burst out laughing
Jameis is a poor man.
He always pictures his mother in his mind and imagines he is talking to her.
God provides for his wife.
They say Thursday is with you.
He's busy now, he's on an international call, very far away, even the call is breaking up.
What does the message say?
God help you, Khamis.
Why are you awake!
I don't sleep, I can't sleep.
Regarding tomorrow's meeting
With the women's delegation at the ministry
Is it possible that they were
Oh my God, calm down, James.
These names are chosen by the Office of the Minister.
But, come on.
Why are you afraid of her?
If you were talking to Salem, why are you backing out now?
Tell the truth.
Why are you hiding behind the water tank, then?
Bare like this
I saw the last number that was called, read it, it's with you.
Last number!
I dialed the last number after deleting the woman's number you were talking to.
Tell me, what's her name!
I told you, I told you, I told you.
I told her that I was talking to Salem.
My friend at work, Salem
You didn't believe me.
What are you wearing?
Are you going on a diving trip?
I swear to God, brother, you didn't let me change my clothes.
Who do you want me to call!
Call my wife.
Call my wife.
Tell her, my brother, give me the password, a pen, call, I will give you the number.
You help each other.
You men are always like this.
You're just like him, a liar, I'll show you.
If you interfere again, I'll go to the minister's office.
You cursed me.
And she threatened me that she would complain about me to the minister's office.
She is really brave.
She plans to destroy my career.
My mistake was that I heard you and called her.
Listen, Jaime!
If you complain about me at the minister's office.
You will come with me and tell the whole truth, stay away from this subject.
This has nothing to do with me.
You are a coward.
Sisters and brothers
Good morning, everyone.
I'm glad you attended the meeting.
Where's the rest?
Fled
Where is James?
He is coming.
Turn off your mobile phone.
Alright, don't turn it off, leave it in the office.
The meeting is only for one hour.
This is not my phone.
The war began.
Oh my God, since that day, he has been living with you.
Where can he go?
He can't go.
And since that day, his situation has not changed.
Jealous, jealous of the women around him
This is not jealousy.
He sits alone here in the living room at night.
He says she is my mother.
Mother! Her mother is dead.
This is the reason I called you, to find a solution for me.
I asked you to move from the section with women.
Is it a military decision?
Look at the signature very clearly at the bottom.
Brother, sorry, I've been transferred to the Social Welfare Department.
Welfare office! Are you sure they transferred you there?
Why is he strange?
Thank you, may God bless you.
Are you Mrs., sorry, Mr. Khams?
The minister's office called and informed us.
Have you been to your new department?
Who's in the office with you?
Article, Saleem, Jasim,
Oh! James, the minister decided to transfer you only yesterday.
And you moved to the new department today.
I explained to you my problem with my family.
The minister decided to transfer you.
So I must go to the minister.
He started his annual vacation today.
He will return after a month and a half.
Such a nuisance
If you want my opinion,
The minister will teach you the same thing.
Work there until we find you another place, this time you were transferred because of the many who told him about your problem with your wife.
I'm telling you the truth.
What should I do!
Don't talk when your wife is on the phone.
You never know, they might comply with you, urge them.
I asked them to put the abayas in the car, I put them in a box for you.
How much?
You put ten as if five were in the office, which means two for each.
It seems he is very afraid of his wife.
Imagine he gave all of us male names.
He calls me Abdelkader.
What is his name?
He is kind and handsome, so she is afraid other women will love him.
In the name of God, what's wrong with her?
Who called me?
Yes, Abdelkader, who is sitting next to Hassan, is there behind Khalil.
Here are the abayas, each one can choose what she likes.
Look at this
How much is this?
What's the matter, what happened?
Sorry.
Where is the social welfare office?
There are supposed to be five employees.
What's your name?
I am handsome.
I'm crazy, my wife drove me crazy.
I am crazy.
She opened the project to us.
And he met them.
What did they say?
They said.
Muna, prepare some tea.
I can't
Do you want me to go back to the kitchen and ruin my clothes?
Go now, go make us some tea.
Go, go, it makes no sense.
Go, listen to what the men say.
Don't forget that we are the children of scorpions.
Go, get me tea without sugar. Go, go, go, go, go.
The bank said the project was good.
I've called him repeatedly, and his phone is busy.
According to them, they've been waiting for a while for you.
They are my brothers as usual.
Someone took a month off, traveled three months ago and hasn't shown up.
God is Generous, Goodbye.
And all changes are in our favor.
Pour us
Yes, but if you build a garden
It will require space equivalent to at least two or three villas.
The park is a place for the residents of the complex to relax.
The man doesn't need the woman's opinion.
Keep it to yourself.
Put the tea and go.
No garden.
Just a moment.
Sister, you know I love football.
Your uncle and brothers will kill you if they find out you're playing it at school.
What are you planning, to kill yourself?
See, I told you.
I suggest you forget about it.
Don't hurt yourself.
No, no, no, no, I'm upset with you.
I was busy.
Forgive me, you are our blessings.
Oh my God, Uncle Shahin is here.
Inshallah
Is this Thursday?
Grew up
"She" has become an adult.
I'm tired of looking for a woman for him, I couldn't find one.
I come from a family with deep roots.
You know,
Leave the matter of his marriage to me.
Is this from the HR department?
Yes, God prolongs your life.
Set it aside.
I have some remarks on his suggestions.
Alright, God willing, may you live long.
Anything else
No, God may grant you a long life.
Take care of them and I'll meet them when I find the time.
What did you do about the employees I sent you yesterday?
What's wrong?
I'm leaving now, I'll call you later.
What happened?
Are you crazy?
We are your older sisters.
And I am exposed to them.
Did you know they asked me what you play at school?
I told them you play ping-pong.
It's good they didn't kill you.
That was just an appetizer.
Do you know who we are?
What are our roots?
Do you know what that means?
This time, we broke your face.
Lizard Leader
Small scorpion
Uncle, let me hit his face with my hands.
That was enough.
Save it for next time.
You've changed your mind! Didn't you say you wanted to study architecture?
Are you crazy?
A Scorpio's daughter cannot work in the streets with men.
Engineering and Construction
You will embarrass us.
Let me break her head.
No, no power, no
Certainly, Chief Scorpion.
I just defeated Fatima.
Let your brother try it.
This is a shame.
Alright, shading, at least you have a slap in the face.
Look at my face.
Why do they want you to go with them tomorrow morning?
What do they want?
Come here.
Walk in front of me.
Where are we going?
Don't say a word.
Where are we going?
I told you to shut up, don't say a word.
And write "education" instead.
Or even nursing, it doesn't matter.
What else do you want?
I have two options.
So you know we open minds.
You never said you pushed me to change.
Nursing, or education
Go away.
Bring us a copy of the order.
Go, get away.
Scorpion Leader: Oh! My son.
The big scorpion suggested itself to you.
Thank you, Uncle, but when is the wedding engagement?
Lady Manira
What you ask is difficult.
I can't travel, oh! Khalid.
I have personal circumstances.
Recommended by the minister
Difficult
Think about it again.
Don't make a decision now, think about it until tomorrow.
How do they allow you to work then!
That's why they don't say anything.
I have a suggestion.
Ask someone to travel with you.
Girls shouldn't travel.
This is not meaningful talk.
No shame!
You should be thankful that we allowed you to go to work.
Go tomorrow and tell them you can't travel.
Be quiet, don't argue.
Listen and be silent.
Jarad's fifth son.
He is connected to us.
It's true that he's stupid and has no qualifications.
But it's a scorpion.
What will you do, sister?
What can I do, Fatima!
I am weak and bankrupt.
What can I do?
There's nothing I can do.
What can she do?
Engagement next Monday.
I'll call you to come according to the time the sheikh arrives.
How beautiful your laugh is.
Go and get some new clothes.
Go and get some new clothes, my son!
I love this laugh.
Brother, I ask you by God.
I don't want to hear a word.
Prepare us tea, coffee, and cake.
"How lucky! Oh! Aisha, you're the minister's friend now."
I'm afraid it's a rumor. Oh! Bou Khaled.
Muna is a candidate to be a minister in a new ministry within the new ministerial structure.
Munaira deserves all the best.
I hope this isn't a rumor.
Will you work tomorrow?
And we must all cooperate to serve this country.
With the efforts of each one in their place, thank you.
I wish you all success.
Thank you, Your Highness
Thank you = Your Highness
Thank you.
Hello, please come in.
Peace be upon you
Yes, with soap as you requested.
He is the general supervisor of the women's football league.
Ask him about Fatima's playing.
Inshallah
Player Fatima led the team by scoring two goals like a professional.
Captain Fatima is talented! Oh, brothers!
Leader, what do you think of Fatima's play?
She is a good forward player.
You will travel to China.
Captain, isn't China a bit far?
God bless you.
Your sister will play an important match.
She was studying education, but I went today and submitted a transfer request for her.
You will study architecture.
There is no difference between man and woman.
Really? Go make coffee.
Where are you going?
I'm tired of waiting.
Stupid, isn't it?
Go and say hello to your mother and tell her you've been fired.
Go, *
Poor thing!
The coffee in the pot you have has gone cold.
They don't call all year, but as soon as they know you have a chain, they call.
Hello, how are you? How are the kids?
What did you tell her?
I told her, "You'll be with us in the series."
Certainly, she will be the main character.
Look, Ali, Shaula will play the role of Nouf.
There's something called makeup, which can make her look younger.
Mary's role was only for 26 or 27 episodes.
Let Shula benefit.
He will give us endless lectures.
I'm afraid he'll be a nuisance to us.
The most important thing is that he must not know that the production company belongs to you and Hamed.
I wish I hadn't been late.
And Rashid is here too.
The manager and the actors are ready.
For the sake of time, folks! Let's start the meeting.
Please tell us what you think.
Hamad, do you want to say something?
Frankly, I think she's the best.
You see when the maid committed suicide.
You know the most impactful part for me.
When the maid committed suicide.
When she hanged herself from a fan, she spun around and bled to death.
They found him and his mother wept for her son, it's touching.
And he kept kicking him until he reached the yard of the house.
Excitement
The police come, search the house, and arrest the mother.
This is really a great series.
I was about to perform the chain here on this table.
This is indeed blackmail of the artistic conscience.
My community
It's all about unusual events.
Unbelievable
Murder cases reached 72.
And what's with the screaming?
You are known for obstructing people.
Alright, Mr. Hamad, let's open our minds.
Let's take a majority vote.
Mr. Nasser does not claim openness and uses the majority as an excuse, this does not apply to a critical assessment of artistic production.
You're involved in this because of your government job.
Goodbye
I heard the doorbell ring.
He was an Indian carrying a bag in his hand.
He asked me, "Are you Ms. Hseh?" I replied, "Yes."
I opened the suitcase.
It was a ring valued at seventy to eighty thousand.
I'm afraid the Indian man brought these things by mistake.
No, it's not a mistake.
It's Samira.
Hamad's wife, the supervisor at the company.
This is a gift from her to you, God bless you.
Yes, it's yours.
The ring is a very luxurious ring.
I never dreamed of owning a ring like this.
God bless you, my dear!
Yes, that's it, I call it the chain of blessings.
Ali and Hamad own the production, but they are employees there, they cannot provide it in their names.
What more shall we have than a ring?
Don't share that with anyone, keep it between you and me.
Am I crazy to do that?
Your amazing husband
He who is nicknamed the Magician.
Only five percent, it's a small amount.
No, it's good if they agree to four million for them.
Your husband will get two hundred thousand riyals, that's good.
I think we'll give the college girl role to Nada.
A great role, I fell in love with a man and ran away on a bicycle.
The series we will produce is called "Blackmail of Conscience."
They talked to me about the role in the series.
I really want to know.
Gulf series are always like this, the trend of extortion this year.
Well, tell my brave brother, what's my role?
You too, my dear, your turn is next.
Don't embarrass me.
Come, come now
I made all that breakfast, don't you go and leave me.
This is Omar, the manager's secretary.
May God protect us.
He never asked me to see him at this time of day.
She told him it would be a weak and silly chain.
Don't waste your money on it.
Okay, so what happened next?
Oh God, protect me. I can only say that I'm scared. Rashid told them something bad about the series.
Don't be afraid.
Leave it to me.
A mentally ill person.
It's a social drama series.
I just saw him on TV.
May God not prolong your life.
The series on TV now is called "Blackmailing a Young Flower."
But, I think the budget they're asking for is too high.
Requires a high budget
But don't forget that the producing institution is local.
We need to support her.
It doesn't matter.
Have you read the arts page?
We heard they'll start filming the series "Blackmail of Conscience."
And a huge budget is allocated to it.
However, it was said that the series was weak.
Another said the series consisted of a school that taught immorality.
It's possible they'll stop shooting.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon him
Hello, please have a seat.
Good morning
Good morning, hello.
I'm Eli Mounir, a journalist, and I have an appointment with Mr. Hamad, if you don't mind.
Yes, no problem, please sit for a while, as he is in a meeting.
Mercury, this will allow us to use the design of the universe.
By the way, we will reach out to all the world's correspondents to get in touch with us.
This is your task.
Venus Media Production Company
It discusses the film's issues in a way that makes it the best in the history of global cinematic production.
Can you believe who wrote this?
He has no shame.
Do we have such a journalist?
Do we have such a journalist?
A journalist must have a moral sense.
We work
Do you think they're here for *?
I met with Amtyaz, the minister. Do you know what he told me?
This is very tragic and its events are unusual.
The first episode will be tomorrow, I'll watch it with people.
What do you think, Mother?
Alright, Mom, it's just the first episode.
Have you seen people talking to themselves, except in Gulf series?
Have you seen a mother who wants to kill her children, except in your soap operas?
Oh my son! Art is a skill, it's not strange to generalize it to people and society.
Mother, you can do that in plastic arts, but theater is completely different.
Don't give me a headache.
It seems they are imitating the Turks.
Don't judge now, at least watch the first five episodes.
This series is a failure.
We cannot allow our children to watch it.
Not to that extent, brother.
There are worse shows on TV.
In fact, not anyone.
Your mistake.
For everyone, in every home.
Go and gather the people who understand these dimensions and hidden lines.
And I look at them for her.
What we have to do
Tell me, what happened?
The minister passed by some guests.
I stood up to greet him.
We agreed to produce the series.
How will the minister like this?
Alright, let's hear Nasser's opinion.
My colleague wrote that.
I only publish messages that say something good about the series.
No, no, don't worry.
Read the newspaper tomorrow and you will see my thank-you notes, and I will mention that the viewers sent them.
Inshallah
You will be happy.
For this year
Alright, if they have an agreement with him.
This is the best series in the history of Gulf drama.
They all agree with them.
Alright, let's say they reached an agreement with them.
I will only read the subtitled version.
I hope they bring back the series "Blackmail of Conscience."
Thank you, Minister of Arts, for that series.
I wish they would do that again.
When the minister's office first called me
We can come to collect the final installment of funds in the series.
They were right to call you the wizard.
That wasn't everything.
The profits were rewarding, and we took our money.
Also the failure in the chain.
The author himself told me that he regrets writing it.
I'm here to propose a second part to the series.
The minister believed in the journalistic ruse I had invented.
Believe in the imaginary success we achieved.
He is not satisfied with the series.
That means it's impossible for him to agree to a second term.
I assure you that the minister himself will request a second part.
I can only
Thank you.
To all people
Who worked on this series?
And congratulate them on their success.
They all deserve it.
In fact, winning those awards at distinguished festivals
That proves it.
This is what you believe.
You are a genius.
They will surely win the gold prize.
What was he saying?
He said that readers and the press lie to me.
Yes, why not have a second part?
As long as Arab and Gulf TV festivals are used to launder money in the art field.
Money laundering!
I've heard about money laundering.
It is not art.
Illegal funds
The same series.
What can we do with "one two"?
What do you mean?
Haven't we signed a contract with them? They should comply.
Write them.
Our products are exported worldwide, bread of all kinds and shapes, flat, large, small, triangular and diverse.
What did we agree on in the contract?
Two million dollars
What did you do with the Australian baker?
He is the inventor of bread.
Has anyone told you about his product?
Not really, they just told me it was bread, but I don't know what's in it.
This is Zibib bread.
You call it a "susta."
Instead of cutting bread, (smoun) as you call it = (samen bread)
The inventor tried to make it easy.
Jean's bread
This is the secret.
You eat bread with a zipper.
Those people do very strange things.
This zipper is amazing, it's produced in a way that it melts in your mouth as soon as you put it in.
Can be in different flavors, strawberry, ketchup, coffee.
Do you know how much money I've invested in this project?
Three million dollars, with patents.
Come on, Sami!
Yes, Abu Nasser.
Yes, sir, I am at your service.
We delivered it today, sir.
Tell him "Oh! Sameeh."
I was with your son, Nasser, yesterday, playing football in his team.
I agreed with him.
To form his team of drivers and security men,
It's also an incomplete team, we only have one goalkeeper, if he gets injured we'll be in trouble.
I'm supposed to have fans too.
When I took seventeen players
I didn't say anything.
The important people in the company.
Indispensable ones
The hospital's pastry shop.
Why are you bothering this person?
You said he couldn't, that he's from a well-known family, he can't run after a ball and make a fool of himself.
He can do as he pleases.
But don't take the essentials.
What can I do, Mom? I have a team game and I need four players.
No excuses anymore.
Well, what happened, happened.
Hamdi didn't come to work today, sir.
I went with him.
He said: "Put on your clothes."
And they left me standing in the goal area.
The match started.
Then I didn't feel anything.
They told me the ball hit me while I wasn't paying attention.
Have you ever been a goalkeeper?
Because Nasser asked me to play, I played.
There is no power or might except through God.
We're tired of your love for football.
From now on, yes! Nasser
No football.
You must disband your team.
And all bakers must return to their bakeries.
What do you think?
Open, it is
I don't want to hear anything.
What a request! Oh! Bo Nasser
Listen to what he wants to say.
Alright, I'll do that just because you asked me to.
Speak, what did you want to say?
Tomorrow, we will play the last match of the tournament.
Don't upset him, Abu Nasser, please, I beg you.
Alright, oh! Guys
Congratulations, congratulations
Sweet, sweet, sweet, congratulations.
Oh, Mr. Nasser, I want to speak with you for a minute, please.
Thank you, my team was on time today.
Mr. Nasser, you must
You promised us a party.
Do you want me to call and book a room at the hotel?
Invite the press and journalists to come there.
No way! Rashid, we'll get it in our home.
Even when my father sees the players and their success, he doesn't cancel it out.
They won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup.
I hope so.
No, no, I saw him taking pictures with the players and he was talking to the press with them.
It seems that Sami, the sports page editor, is interviewing him.
Photographic image
Leave it close to me.
Make a good throw.
He is happy.
Your comment on your children's success, baking them...
High-spirited
And the effort
Loyalty to the bakery.
Sorry, Abu Nasser, we saw the team playing 4-4-2.
Loyalty to the bakery and the coach's plan.
Thank you, Uncle Bo Nasser.
May God bless you.
Hello, goalkeeper.
The journalists Dawri and Kassas will visit you for an interview.
No, it's not my place.
They sent their representative to conduct the interview.
Bring the cup, bring the cup, bring the cup, bring the cup
You know, we encourage the youth.
I expect a bright future for them.
Yes, goodbye.
Insha'Allah, your phone will always ring, and your pictures will be in the newspapers, you are blessed with this football.
Do you know who was talking to me on the phone?
He reduced the price of the engines, and he said okay.
Yes, I've become famous now. Under every picture of me in the newspapers, they write: "The first baker athlete."
Why wasn't I interested in soccer?
What are you saying?
Since I was in school
The person who sat next to me loved football.
You say I wasn't close to football.
Because the person next to me plays soccer, I am close to soccer.
Being close to sports means I'm an athlete.
We are no longer the international bakers, but the international football team.
I heard him say yesterday that he would make it a sports club.
And today we meet the first athlete from the International Bakeries, Bo Nasser.
Promoting football
Before the match, tell us your predictions before you head to the stands.
The game is difficult today.
The team that controls the midfield will be the winner today.
Yes, God willing, we will communicate with professional player agents to develop the International Bakeries team.
His name is Saud, listen, we want a commitment.
(Yes, he wants the previous deal for the players)
He was useless.
When I gave you the prices
I gave you the international price.
So, isn't the Gulf part of the world?
Certainly not.
This is none of your business.
You just have to let me know when a buyer from the Gulf comes.
Open your fax line.
Two of them are defenders, one is a midfielder, and the other is a center player.
Look, these four players
Three of them cost...
$200,000 per player
I'll take them all in one bundle.
That will be six hundred thousand, I'll give it to you for five hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Beautiful, that's about African players, now about the Brazilian player.
He's the player of the season, he costs two million two thousand dollars alone.
They quoted this price but then I received a fax, I'll show you, it's here. Wait, look, I received it from a club in the United Arab Emirates.
The decision is yours.
Thank you.
If God wills, check his lower leg.
How is he?
Knee, knee
The knee is fine.
We don't want to be fooled, I hope there's no cross-contamination.
Oh! Bu Nasser
What is this connecting muscle?
Butcher! Make me some kabsa (rice and meat, a traditional dish).
Frankly, you're lucky to have Brazilian and African players, congratulations, congratulations.
Thank you.
To the store, store
Insha'Allah, you have another profession.
No, no, no, only the players.
I see them unpacking a box.
Young players! Yes, we want them, from the forests of Africa.
Yes, why?
Karim, open one box for him.
He is a human being like any other human being.
A young man said, "Didn't you hear him?"
He said they were young.
As long as we
Why don't you give us this little boy as a free gift?
Listen, Abu Nasser, if you raise him well, he will benefit you later.
And then go and release him in the playground.
Come, come, come, come
Go easy on him, he's still young.
They put it in the annex and let him raise it.
Don't hesitate if you need anything, all the players are with me.
Your trainer must understand.
We won 2-0, and dominated the game.
Father, he is the coach of Spain.
I don't like him.
Successful coach
The game must be controlled.
And this, in the opposite direction, is the Al Wakrah road.
We shouldn't let your coach do as he pleases.
He spent less than two months with the team.
We need to finish this.
If he were an expert in football, he would have taken corners for the wingers instead of attacking from the center.
Yes, I rely on the offside trap.
Oh mother, don't trouble my head.
He must fire Kakuno Malawi.
And replace it with Shinam Habab Hitawala Hatawa Hawawa
No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to play.
Shululu forgot his coffee beans.
What line?
Implementing the plan
And "Holo Lolo" forgot.
This is not supposed to happen between the coach and the team manager.
Star of the game, star of the team
Do you mean we're not soccer experts?
Listen, Sultan!
Let him go home.
Don't take him in the bakery van, let him go by taxi.
What's your business?
Stay informed.
Do you see what my father did?
The coach was fired and sent back.
What is he doing?
He's ruining the team.
Say goodbye to our team.
Mother's mother
No, he's crazy. That means he said you're divorced. Tell me the truth, what happened between you two?
From the very first day I saw him, I told your mother, I don't like this person.
I feel he is incapable of taking responsibility.
Forget the nonsense and talking about the past.
You must go to his father and find out why he divorced your daughter.
I don't know what to say, oh! My brother Rashid.
Why did he divorce her then?
It's not fair! Oh! Abu Abdullah, we must know, we have the right to know the reason that made her divorce.
Please, don't interfere. This is none of your business.
How can I not interfere? The man is waiting in the lounge to find out why his daughter got divorced.
She doesn't know how to appreciate her husband and respect his feelings.
Who is Barcelona?
It's not your fault. You don't know La Liga.
Barcelona is not a lady.
This is Guardiola's team.
It means that I'm now going to the man who's waiting for me in the living room.
If I go, I'll go. Alright, stay here and leave it to me.
She must leave, and don't bow your head.
It was not enough for her to shame Barcelona.
Messi, the football wizard, who scores a hat-trick in every match.
Maradona himself said that Messi would be better than him.
And your wicked daughter mocks him. Listen,
Your daughter is not a Barcelona fan, she is not suitable for us (metaphorically).
What do you mean!
Listen, may God guide you.
Don't tell me you want my son.
Apologize and make her happy.
Alas.
Praise be to God, we have a lot of money.
What good is our money if we don't make our son happy?
Hey, stop.
Most importantly, I'll look for a Barcelona fan.
Oh mother, I'm not angry.
She's crazy! Oh, son, forget about her.
Drink your tea, my son!
Do you know, son, they are the losers.
Thousands of girls want to marry you.
Drink, my son.
I feel sad for her.
Sad is she, divorced two days ago.
After only one month of marriage.
What's up with you, do you want me to interfere with him?
I don't want to be in trouble with him.
Who told you these illogical stories!
Don't listen to her.
Doesn't she know who he is?
What more do you want!
Her wealth only.
Do you remember the building I want to buy and convert into an apartment hotel?
Those in Mansoura.
It belongs to his father, and when his son marries our daughter, I will ask him for this building.
If you are able.
Talk to her brother.
Listen well.
I suggest a millionaire's son to you.
Do you know what a millionaire is?
Opportunity knocks but once.
They are so rich that they bought a palace in Spain, so they can spend every summer there.
Fine, and what about the Barcelona story?
Perhaps the girl's family spread this rumor to prove their daughter's innocence.
Let's say the story is true and the man loves Barcelona and is loyal to Catalonia.
His wife is supposed to respect that.
And do not mock the team.
Assuming this story is true.
God bless you, they called his father Abu Borgain because he owns two towers on the corniche.
Design them in an odd way, like intertwined ropes.
When people see them from far away, they think it's one tower.
What do you think? All the luck is with you.
Welcome
May God bless you. Okay, take something and eat everything.
Thank you, my love.
The light of my eye, my son Abdullah, awaits your reply.
No, don't worry, Noor of my eye, Umm Abdullah.
If I searched all the GCC countries, I wouldn't find anyone better than you.
Tell them to provide us with their estimates for constructing the building.
I'm done, sir. Is there anything else?
Yes, the family will call you.
Look at their wedding needs, prepare the bill and I'll sign it.
In the name of God, God willed it, in the name of God, God willed it, with your permission, Your Excellency the Ambassador.
Abdullah is also divorced again!
I wish you had children and he had wealth (figuratively)
"May God bless you, auntie!"
She wears it because of the cold.
Yes, but I don't know where my mom booked us?
Where did you book us, mother?
My mother says she booked us to Malaysia.
What's the problem with Malaysia, okay?
Happy travels.
What's wrong with you? Have you ever heard of anyone coming back from their honeymoon crying?
What's wrong with you, my daughter? Tell me!
Tell me what happened, my daughter!
Oh mother, she is so arrogant.
Why?
She is haughty; ignore her.
You did the right thing when you fired her.
I feel sad for her.
It's her mother.
Why is she sad?
What happened to her?
God bless you. Don't forget to bring us olive oil from Spain.
Yes, Spain. Where are we going?
Alright.
My mother says she booked us for the Maldives.
Alright, alright! Oh! [My daughter] The Maldives are beautiful too.
And it also pleases you.
I thought you would come back happy from your trip.
What really bothers me is why did he take the children?
Come! Take the bag.
What's wrong with them?
Why are you angry, light of my eye?
Be quiet! God willing, you'll be cured, you're telling me about my son's face.
Oh my God! Son, why are you angry?
When I see the shells, I'll be sad.
Oh, you who annoy me, may the one who annoys you die! (Expressive) Oh! My son.
Forget her, divorce her, divorce her. Your father has plenty of money and there are many other girls.
Be quiet, and I know my son, anything small bothers him, why should he live unhappy?
Oh my God! You're calling her and divorcing her.
May God be with her.
Say it to her three times.
You are divorced. Wait, wait, don't hang up, there are two more hours.
Divorced, divorced.
Very tense.
Oh! My son, calm down and don't worry, there are plenty of fish in the sea, as they say, oh my son.
Oh problem.
Just because they saw you at the disco.
Call him, call him, let me talk to him.
I say, what did my mother say? She told me that you divorced, divorced, divorced.
Why did he divorce you, he's shameless.
Now if someone goes to a disco, what will you do?
And one if necessary %pw.
What's wrong with it! What happened to the world!
You'll see, I'll go to his house and confront him, and he won't know who you are.
Me, me, my daughter divorced Abu Abdullah!
My daughter is divorced!
Your daughter is different.
You buy and sell them at Toys "R" Us stores.
Just as you feel the bad taste in your mouth now for the sake of your daughter and you are discouraged.
And they did nothing.
"Do not judge it by its length, but by its taste, so take it."
Well, you can release them as you wish.
She is still married to a man.
Is this good for you, let him go to hell!
And I felt the same as I did to others.
Why don't you accept for yourselves?
Don't accept it from people.
Do you know who owned the land this mall is on?
And in a strategic location?
Leave it to God alone.
And also at a low price.
Out of service.
I need to get Abu Sakr's approval.
Yes, I went to his office and didn't find him.
I went to his office the week before, and they told me he had traveled.
He has a meeting, come tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, I'm out of service and the problem that I need to get Abu Sakr's approval for, I have to do that.
Go to his office.
No, no, no, no, this is official business.
The right place for that, please, is the office, not the home.
Do you eat as well?
What will make Abu Saqr full?
Everyone has a key.
Tell me oh! Abu Fahd
Do you know him?
I don't know him, I only see him on TV, and you told me you meet him during Umrah.
But we don't know each other well.
Stop joking.
Oh, I hope you understand. I came right away. At least ask about the reason for this occasion.
There is no occasion for that, God guides you.
The month is thirty days long, and he holds fifty feasts.
I suggest, sir, that they include your name in the Guinness Book of World Records.
As the world's largest dinner party organizer.
By the way, who is this brother you're with?
Welcome, this is a blessed time.
It's an honor for you.
So, oh! Abu Flah.
You say Abu Sakr holds a party every day.
This is what we see.
But oh! Abu Faleha, the dinner party tonight is for a special occasion.
Today, O Lord, protect You and Your son, Sujah.
God willing, Your Highness deserves it with blessings.
He's here, hello my son!
Peace be upon you.
Why?
For this occasion, my son Sagar has to go to the agency tomorrow and choose the car he wants.
I waited for approval for a year and a half.
I was out of work.
But when I got to him
And I gave him money.
"May God guide you, Abu Saad."
Things won't go that way.
I said to him, "Alright."
He should visit the exhibition and choose the car he likes.
We will buy three for him.
Take him with you!
They took me to him.
You told me that you met him during the pilgrimage of the previous year.
Today, his youngest son, Shihin.
His game is banquets.
This is your chance.
He passed by and congratulated him.
"He deserves to be well, oh! Your Excellency."
Oh, Shayyen, oh Abu Saqr!
May God bless you, thank you, people.
Thank God that they are fine, sir.
May God bless you.
By the way, who are you?
Happiness of the judge
You didn't recognize me.
I can't lie to you (figuratively).
My lord, I went on the lesser pilgrimage with you last year.
And I remember you bought a prayer bracelet in red.
May God bless you.
I was in the hospital.
Visiting a relative
It is our pleasure to meet you.
So, you're still undecided about entering the business field or you've made up your mind.
I'm tired of him.
Why, good heavens! Son of Seeker's trade is good.
You must start, open an office and then see.
Abu Sakr
Happiness of the judge, please
Why?
I have a gift, a falcon.
Full floor
And if trade loves you and comes to you, you will say no.
Who has everything at their disposal like you do today? Since you got the license, everything comes easily to you, a free car and the best office in the corner.
Yesterday, Abu Abdul Aziz was telling your father that if Sakr wanted to enter into business, I would allow him to be my partner with a 50% share.
Oh mother, how can I balance trade and university?
Oh mother, don't force me to do something I don't like.
And you're lucky because agencies, offices, and cars are thrown at you for free.
It's an opportunity, son of Adam! Who can start a business at this time without capital?
Your only capital is people's love for your father.
Be smart and invest it.
Believe in me, son! This is your chance in life.
Rose prepared lunch quickly.
He also reached the pickles and pepper.
He didn't leave anything, he didn't leave anything, I'm afraid he'll take over the samosa agency.
Your son has a good appetite for work.
This is what I was looking forward to seeing. Do you know what he told me today?
My mother told me that I want to expand the investment.
He wants to enter the Caribbean Sea and invest in the islands there.
And Allah protects him from the eyes of the envious.
Abu Sultan was telling me yesterday, your son has just started work.
He has twenty agencies, six restaurants, and shares in two banks.
It seems that
I believe, and God knows best, that they haven't opened it yet.
Yes, what's wrong with the one in the northern area of our office?
No, but I love her.
Thank you, may God bless you, congratulations Abbas!
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
May God bless you all.
There's no need to regret now.
What do you say, man! A whole year of misery and toil to prepare the supermarket.
What's the matter! I think he passes by the store every day.
He saw him and sent me his secretary, whose name is Samer.
He told me that this Saqr, son of Abu Saqr, wants to be your partner instead of taking the store from you.
Does he also want to be your partner?
There is no power or strength except by Allah.
You started talking to him, didn't you?
He asked me, "Who are you, brother?"
I said: Actions!
Why did you tell him you have an Iranian bakery?
As we walked past this bakery, there was a small sign. What was written on that sign? What was the name written on the sign?
The neighborhood bread was written.
No, I want another name.
Peace be upon you.
So, how are things going for you at work?
Well, sir, we hope to finish the drawings for the Future Company's worker housing by tomorrow or the day after.
No, no Mr. Sagar, she is my wife Elisa, let me introduce you to Mr. Sagar, the owner of the company.
Hello, how are you?
Let her take one of the company cars.
Thank you very much, you're very kind.
Even cooking now relies on science and study.
Today, someone said I want to work in business, he has some money and wants to invest it.
But he doesn't have enough knowledge, understanding, or study in economics, or even business.
A person like this.
Do you think he will succeed? I don't think so, he will waste his time and lose.
Welcome, Abu Nasser!
Did you hear what these two birds are saying?
What is this?
I have a son named Falcon.
Look at him.
Look at him today.
Your Honor, we are not talking about your son, Saghyr.
We're talking about the rule.
Your son is soaring, God willing, and I don't want to envy him (metaphorically). He is an exception.
Thank you, he's talking about the law.
You scared me, my son Sager is building himself.
He once gave a car as a gift.
He sold it and invested the money on his advice.
"And as for what God wills, just look at it now."
Oh! We're talking about ordinary people.
He burned one of them, and that's what Abu Nasser did with him; he took him and put him on the road.
Sagar has business talents.
Strong economic preferences.
We must ask, who is his father?
I swear I'm amazed.
Machine Allah. (Note:
Gulf Magazine is not included in the economic referendum.
Enter.
Peace be upon you, hello hello Salim.
What's wrong with him?
I swear I don't know what to say, oh! Salem.
Yes, I remember.
The story was true.
They say the company sent a fax to my father.
And they said to him
According to him, he couldn't bear it.
As you see.
They say that when he heard the news,
He fell in the office with the fax in his hand.
And he has rendered many services to him.
As they say, I taught him archery, and when he became strong, he shot me (metaphorically).
What did the doctor say?
"Pray for him, O my God! Salim"
I am shocked.
I can't believe there are people like that in this world.
A man who gives to the poor without showing his left hand what his right hand is doing.
The donations of this organization are offered to all Muslims in Asia and Africa.
But I also want you to explain to us your goals and future steps, God willing.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, our goal at Saqr Charity Association is to achieve solidarity in this nation.
In addition to sixty blankets for our brothers affected by the Pakistan earthquake.
In conclusion, and not least, we are now supporting seven poor families.
With a monthly salary not exceeding one hundred and thirty riyals.
We won't be late.
Then we'll come to you right away.
Who is this dear one?
This is Khalid and his wife; they are inviting us to the hotel tonight.
Yes, wherever and wherever we are together, I am happy.
Dearest (may God keep you safe for me) is a metaphorical expression.
Oh, my beloved!
This is unfair. It's my source of income.
This bakery
And take money for your attention.
Five rials for boiled beans, three rials for hot bread.
Then a bean.
Five beans, okay, okay.
Cook six wide beans!
Let's go! Divers!
The captain is here and he has brought breakfast.
You need men.
Oh sir, please!
So what's important?
No, what I'm asking you is that I want to hear a resounding yes in my ear.
Hello, Nora.
Anwood is upset with you.
Can I bear your anger?
So what's the problem?
Why are you angry?
Nora chose a simple and plain dress.
Don't say Anood will be angry.
Good heavens, Lebanese people speak very good language.
You shouldn't talk to him too much.
Me too, I'm jealous of her.
The best dress for the most beautiful rose.
He flirts with her by calling her "Noor".
Let your blood boil, how long will it take?
I paid twenty thousand and twenty thousand riyals remain.
May you be rewarded (metaphorically), congratulations!
God be with you.
Hello, Mrs. Saleh.
Hello Fadi, it seems you're busy, I don't want to keep you.
I'm at your service.
Hello, hello.
Did you receive the text message yesterday?
I receive it, oh! Fool.
Did you like the joke?
So, did you bring the design with you?
I didn't have time to do it, show me your designs and I'll choose from among them.
Frankly, you have better taste.
They will leave us, jealousy starts to work.
When he realizes that my project is good and starts generating income,
They say he will carry out a project like mine.
Design and tailoring shop
Women's clothing.
This is Abu Nasser, who has nothing to do with trade.
There are banks.
He will hurt his relative.
That's the way it is these days.
Yes, yes, my cousin.
Do you know that I was sleeping and they woke me up saying your cousin wants you.
Everything is fine! Ask me anything.
Everything is alright, everything is alright.
I hope so.
You have no intention of a project like, like...
Are you coming to look for a partner or something?
I heard you were a designer, so I thought I should drop by maybe.
Welcome.
If you need more, we have it.
Thank God, the work is going very well.
What should I do, O Abu Saleh!
But we were too late, someone rented it last week.
Yes, they did.
Alright, God willing, it's good, goodbye.
So this is it.
Sure?
And with haute couture, do you know the great disaster!
What is this?
He rented a shop next to yours.
(Ad) You are the envier! (Ad) You are the hater!
Before you know that the market is open to everyone,
You must know.
Open your heart to your relatives.
I didn't come to ask you.
You denied, lied, and mocked me, and said, "I."
I wanted to do my work in secret.
To get that, you'd have to go to the store next door, which would disrupt my work.
But they didn't say come and be like a pain in the neck next to wisdom teeth, you're driving me crazy.
This is envy and hatred. I swear, I swear to slap you. This is hatred. Leave me with him.
Oh, my goodness! You're relatives! Oh! People?
Shame on you, Abu Saleh!
Leave him alone, I swear I'll hit you. Oh! You with your soft voice, you.
I will defeat you just as you defeated me by stealing my share.
Oh people!
Just say peace be upon him, people! Oh!
I swear, I swear, I didn't do anything.
He advised me to hire a designer from the Philippines.
Don't let anyone lie to you.
Why, why Lebanese specifically?
They talk to him about trivial things, they joke and laugh and feel very comfortable.
This is the reason why Abu Saleh brings a Lebanese person.
He started telling me some nice words and trying to convince me.
He captivated me, he captivated me with his words.
He convinced me and persuaded me to pay twelve thousand riyals.
Two days later, I went to the auction market and found the same cabinet, its twin sister, for nine hundred riyals.
Make money.
Bring a Lebanese designer.
Can I see the gentleman? You told me yesterday that it was difficult, is it still difficult today?
Yes, today is also very difficult.
I feel that Abu Saleh has changed lately.
What's wrong with him?
No, don't I know? What's the matter?
Abu Saleh is very psychologically exhausted after his relative opened a store and hired a Lebanese designer who looks exactly like him.
Sales at the store have been declining for two weeks.
This is the problem here in Qatar; no Qatari will open a shop unless another Qatari comes along and does the same project, opening a shop next to his. Can I go in?
No, no, no, no, he is with Fadi the designer now thinking about a solution.
What do we do now?
We're sitting as if we've eaten poison.
If we keep going like this, I think he won't even make enough to cover the rent for the shop.
A place far from them.
That means we'll clear the field for them.
Okay, thank you. And what is the discount?
It's not possible. Why don't they offer an evening gown free with every wedding dress?
No way, let's go.
What's the matter? What happened? We're going to the store next door to you; today they put up an ad that with every wedding dress, they offer two evening dresses for free, plus a 25% discount.
Alright, let's go, let's go.
And now wait for two weeks, the same ad will be displayed, buy a wedding dress and get two evening dresses free with a 25% discount.
They are fighting us.
I'm thinking the same thing. If we leave them, they'll destroy us.
Don't bother.
What else did he do?
It's definitely a challenge.
Certainly it's a challenge.
Bravo, this troublemaker deserves it; he doesn't want anyone to earn a living.
If that happens, you'll hear the news within two or three days, I'll close his shop.
Good job.
Wait, wait, hang up, hang up, I'm coming to you now, goodbye.
What's the problem?
Saud says the store is unbearable and no one can sit in it, and he says he doesn't know where the bad smell comes from.
The smell of this conditioner has nothing to do with this conditioner, never.
Its smell won't fade from the store for at least six days.
100% sure.
He came at night.
He cuts the electrical wires from the shop.
Is this fair?
Now will you sign an undertaking, or shall we start a case and open a file?
Don't do anything for him.
I will end his life.
Oh! Abu Nasser, a strange thing has happened, no one is coming to our shop.
Abu Nasser, call, call, there's a customer coming, I'll talk to you later. This is strange.
He lies in his bed groaning.
He says it's a psychological condition, and I was afraid to tell him that the bank called and they need the installments.
Debts piled up on him because of his mean relative.
What happened to him this time?
Alas, if they enter by mistake and see Saad the designer, they will shout at him and run away from him.
Asleep! Poor thing, he never feels sleep, his eyes are open and he stares at the ceiling.
I don't know what he did to me.
Saud is at the shop.
He cast a spell on him, I don't know what he did to him.
When women see him, they are afraid of him.
I don't know, what turned him into that!
Losing me, losing me.
I have a lot of debts.
I'm afraid they'll imprison me.
And I have no evidence against him, so I can't sue him.
I don't know what he did, I don't know what he did.
Forget about him, he deserves it.
Please, tell me what kind of magic you've done to him. You've turned his designer into a monster, and women are afraid when they see him.
We spread a rumor.
Not good Oh! People, tell him that the shooting crew needs you urgently.
Oh my God! People, God bless you, God protect you, tell them they need you desperately, desperately.
I swear they'll raise my blood pressure, they'll kill me, they'll paralyze me. This isn't fair, Mr. Abdullah.
Alright, dear Ahmed, don't get angry. You have heart problems; this is not good for you, man!
I swear I've called him several times, my ear hurts, but he's useless. These add-ons are going to drive me crazy, they're going to make me crazy.
You're not doing anything, I'm responsible for everything!
Listen to me, I'll give you a lesson in listening.
Episode 25, Scene 16, Ahmed wants to finish.
Therefore, I'll stop filming because an extra didn't show up.
What is this production?
I have nothing to do with this! Mr. Abdullah, why are you shouting at me?
Dear, if you don't want someone to shout in your face,
What happened, Abdullah?
Overdue and facing problems.
Oh! Ahmed, I don't need anyone, darling.
Look for someone who has fame and respect, who can convince people that he can really become a millionaire and a billionaire, not just anyone.
Please, sir, come in and shoot, and your requests will be ready in half an hour.
Not anyone, oh! Ala'a, not anyone, I was just explaining to him.
Alright, I'll manage with two scenes instead of one.
You are responsible and you are the production manager, so you are responsible.
What will they do now?
They'll do everything, look at the manager's tension and the mess of things, but they'll manage.
He needs someone with special qualities. Where can I find him now?
Are you serious?
Did you hear what the manager said?
I know someone, God willing, who can help you with that. I hope it's suitable.
%PW Saudi Sidr Tree!
Saud is a treasure! I remember him as Saud Shouk Al-Sader.
Yes, when he was young, they called him Saud Shajarat Al-Afrat, and when he grew up, they named him "Kans."
Why cans?
I'll tell you why. Poor thing, he was wandering the streets collecting cans to sell by the kilo.
Ah! My brother is rich and famous, not depressed.
His appearance is suitable, as I recall he is fat and chubby, not tall or thin.
Are you sure it's appropriate?
Insha'Allah, but you have to do a good makeup for him and I guarantee he will be suitable and also fun.
Alright, what are you waiting for? Call him!
I don't have his number.
I'll take Amir with me and go to him.
Where is Saud's house?
What is he saying?
Shut up, shut up.
Saud was cleaning.
We don't have anyone in our neighborhood named Saud Qanp.
Yes, I'm sure he's from this neighborhood, but I forgot which house.
This house belongs to a person named Saud and he lives with his mother.
Yes, that's correct.
But this is not Saud Qan.
This is Saud's computer.
Certainly it is, but it evolves over time because laptops are like boxes.
He is tall, fat, and a bit tanned.
He canceled the subscriptions and started collecting old laptops. Come on, come on, come on, man! Oh!
He went to the vegetable market to buy them for me. Am I a camel? Where's the other one?
I don't know, son.
This is what you always wear.
I have another one, where is the other string, where is it?
For the holiday.
This is what I'm looking for.
Vicks Vaporub and AXE brand.
Iron it a bit before you go out, it's wrinkled.
But these days I feel worse.
Oh Mother, may God guide you, since yesterday I have been insisting that you go to the emergency room, but you refused.
Yes, Mom, they said they would pay me.
Thank God, you are working now instead of being unemployed.
Okay, Mom, goodbye.
You'll fight her, get angry, and go up.
You sit and move slowly, and slowly the camera with you, it will move beside you.
Yes. Javer! Yes.
Whose laptop is it?
Oh, this is a very well-known actor, Abdullah Al-Lama.
This is for you. To me, he is your son. Abood, how are you?
How are you, O slave?
Act with respect, you should act with a little respect in front of people.
Yes, we're from the same neighborhood.
Hadi, Hadi, Hadi, Hadi, Sukut, Sukut.
I love acting, I hope they give me a role where I can slap you.
Not as you know, my brother!
She is very sick, do you know she didn't sleep last night Oh! My brother!
Asma Oh! My brother, Lord heal him.
May God be in her healing.
Your life is just a bowl of strawberries (metaphor).
Ah! Sir, ah! Sir.
Does he have asthma medication for my mother?
He is a manager, not a doctor.
Look at yourself, listen to what he's saying, he has no point.
What is her mother's name?
Curse you, what do you think?
Did you hear what she said about you?
You say you're acting superficially, you should be more serious.
Give me, give him, give him, give them, give him half a million to fix the tires of my broken-down car.
And give him three million to get me dinner.
I was about to ask you why you're talking like that.
Because I'm sober at the request of some people.
Look at our neighborhood's production, Mr. Ghafel, high-level actors.
Now excellent, he is suitable for the role.
Excellent, I'll help you, I have no senses I don't possess, do I?
Did your family buy this?
Your life is just a bowl of strawberries (metaphor).
Take Mr. to the makeup room, do his makeup, and I'll tell Salem to bring you the costume and come to you.
Go, go, go, this is great.
Alright, alright.
Listen, brother, keep the car with us when we finish shooting, I'll call you to pick it up.
It doesn't matter, but is there anyone who can give me a ride?
Pick you up! Okay, I'll have our driver pick you up. Alright, thank you, brother, thank you, thank you, wait.
Alright, call your friend, the extra person, call him.
Oh! People call Saud laptop from the makeup room.
Let him clean my teeth then.
It's already written in front of me.
Alright, shall we review?
That means I!
I didn't expect that from you.
We'll fight, for what?
We will fight for our rights.
Yes, wait.
And you must know who you are talking to, Abu Abdulaziz.
Why did you divorce her, brother?
Divorce her and that's it.
We don't marry the daughter of a thief.
"What do you need, what do you think?"
He will clean it, but later. The most important thing is to be ready as you will enter the fitting room to change your clothes and we are ready to shoot.
My teeth, toothpaste is expensive.
Oh people! The shooting of this scene is postponed.
Why?
I don't need tea. Oh! Brother, I'm bored and my stomach is bloated from tea. What's happening? I've been waiting for an hour, how much longer do I have to wait?
You didn't see anything, it's very common.
Oh God, grant you well-being.
They are fast.
Thank you, sir. May God preserve you.
Send my regards to your people.
Tell them Abu Abdelaziz greets you.
Okay, sir %PW.
It was fun, wasn't it?
He who is like you, greets you and also kisses your nose.
The first time someone patted my nose.
How do they kiss them on their noses?
This is a problem.
His nose is like an ice cream stick, it hurts your lips. That was funny, it was entertaining.
I didn't laugh!
No need to thank me.
Can I be an actor?
Is something wrong? What's the matter with your voice?
My son, my son, I am very sick, I am waiting for you.
Come quickly.
Welcome, Sheikh, welcome.
Look at her or there alone, man!
Listen to me!
Alright, go now.
I see a lot of reverence.
Oh my God! What happened, my son?
And peace be upon you, what's the matter with you, sir?
Let, let, let, let
And don't worry, God willing, it will be, Oh! Dr. Hassan, come here, come here.
Yes, oh! Dr. Hani, what happened?
Let comfort be honored in the office.
Don't worry.
She is the mother of all, may she be well, God willing.
Hello, hello sir, welcome.
Shut up or I'll slap your face.
Here my name is Abu Abdelaziz.
Call me, sir!
How are you, sir?
May God curse you (metaphorically).
Yes, Your Honor.
Hello, sir, please sit down.
May God bless you.
With this ugly face.
Go with him! Oh, Mr. Rashid.
I swear, if I didn't do anything for you, tell me and you'll see what I'll do for him.
Oh! My friend, can I quickly find a doctor, please?
Doctor, my mother is sick!
Wait in line, your turn will come.
Listen to me!
Can I ask you, friend?
Oh! Hurry, my son, I am sick.
You go to the hospital a lot, and you take your mother every week. You haven't found either of them to be difficult; they're both nice and accepting of anything.
Unlike citizens.
Don't forget the citizens.
Alright, then look for a wife in the hospital.
He liked her.
But oh! My brother is ignoring me.
Alright, so try to be close to her, smile at her, look at her, give her your number with good intentions.
Nothing is wrong.
Act politely.
Either you leave, or you leave. If you don't leave, I'll call security to teach you a lesson.
No, I don't need anything.
Why, sir, you must drink.
For me, please.
No, thank you.
You can take her and leave the hospital.
The person speaking to you is Fahad Al-Muzairai.
"You will marry him" means "You will give him in marriage."
No, no, I need the car, clothes, and the laptop, I will rent them from you.
So that I can give you your money.
No, no, no, wait.
Let's go.
What is this %PW Fahad Al-Marzouk?
Hello, hello, welcome.
My apple of the eye signed his marriage contract yesterday.
I wish you had come.
They were surprised by what I did for them; it was a very elegant and unique party.
One regular and one diet.
You have no excuse now.
What is this?
Mom, I promised my friends I'd be at work tomorrow.
Will you take this to them!
Yes, what's wrong with it?
Nora, come here!
What is this?
He will take this matter to his friends, for the sake of scandal.
Don't even think about taking it, you'll make everyone talk about you.
Give me money, tomorrow I'll buy you something nice.
Yes, but I've already promised them.
And I have to take it tomorrow.
Don't worry, they're still open. Go and change your clothes so we can bring something that pleases people.
What's wrong with you! Let's go.
It has a reasonable price and excellent quality.
Above average, not the best!
Certainly there's top-tier chocolate, but sorry, I thought you were looking for something reasonably priced.
This is too expensive. Why are you looking for the most expensive thing?
This is unbelievable, check out this touch of art.
This is called royal chocolate.
The same chocolate that is always requested in the Spanish court.
Give me this.
Congratulations, and by the way, there's a warranty certificate.
Hello, hello, joy!
Come here, brother, give us some of this chocolate, brother!
What's the occasion for this, man?
No, Saleh Abdel Ghader, the one in accounting.
Insha'Allah, it's worth it, give me another one.
Bring the coffee quickly.
Aunt, did you go to their wedding?
Yes, dear, I attended their wedding, it was embarrassing and disgusting. Do you believe that, sister!
Did you listen to your aunts' words?
That's why I want to throw you an unforgettable wedding.
No time, you only have one and a half months.
I'll arrange everything.
But he won't let me do anything.
You don't live in the community, you don't see how people put everything they have into their weddings.
And you saw for yourself,
When you buy something beautiful, you see how people praise you and compliment your taste.
Didn't they tell you it's wonderful and amazing?
That's true, but how much did we pay?
The money we paid for the chocolate could buy four sheep for the wedding.
Please don't interfere, your mother knows how to do everything, just give her the money and that's it.
That means they will accept anything we choose.
Oh my God, you have really bad taste.
What do you see in this phase?
But excellence costs a lot of money.
Why, why, the previous one was sweet!
What do you see in this?
This is the first time someone has thought of creating a stage like a computer mouse in Qatar.
Sorry, one minute.
Look, they talked about everything except the stage and the arrangements. This is where the women who have nothing will stay, except for rumors. Just be quiet.
The man is waiting for us.
We'll move on to the mouse phase.
It's a very strange phase.
The latest model in twenty eleven.
We've already chosen the mouse.
You can sit this one out, it's all for your own good.
So if it's Noah's Ark, you'll pay an extra twenty thousand, and if it's the mouse, you'll pay one hundred and twenty-two thousand.
We're ready when you are.
You're not the first one to get married.
What do you think of yourself, you're going to get married in the Comoros? That's how things work in our country.
And we, too, are only at the beginning.
If you don't need a platform, where will the bride be placed? In a box?
Iron, paint, and some wood.
And the people are happy.
They exploit us and lie to us; in reality, they are thieves.
So what's bothering you now?
Are you angry and upset?
If you don't want to get married, that's fine.
I will call the bride's mother and tell her that Saleh has very difficult circumstances.
Doesn't he want to get married? Can't he afford the wedding? That's fine with me. Do you want me to call her? I'm serious, I'll call her.
We received a bouquet of flowers from the Netherlands.
In my opinion, if you place them on the tables at the wedding,
Are you sure this is your first time in Doha?
Also the Middle East!
Put it on the bill.
How much will it increase?
One hundred and seventy-two, alright then.
But Samir, I don't want to see this group at any wedding.
You know how to curse and swear at people.
Alright, they're reserved.
Your salary is higher than mine.
A problem we can't handle will start.
Oh my God, help you, Saleh.
But if God has guided you, you should have tried to make things right.
For me, praise be to God, I've decided to look for a wife in any Arab country.
They say your marriage will cost you only two thousand dollars and you'll be happy.
Dear Lord, bless you, my dear.
God willing, his wedding will take place next month.
You just need to specify how many cards you want and tell me.
If the invitations are sufficient, that's good. The important thing is that people know they are invited, where and when, and that's it.
You only care about him, you don't care what people will say.
People know the wedding standard from the invitations.
Tomorrow when they see these invitations, I know what the ladies will say.
Look at their wedding; if those were their invitations, they didn't see the invitations of so-and-so and so-and-so.
We didn't say such a thing, we'll order it online.
It has a cloth cover, is made of panda skin, and has a silver sparkle.
No one can blame you, you can't stop me.
I'll be a hot topic for women, we'll ask for invitations, meaning we'll ask for invitations!
I feel sorry for him, oh! Man.
He was sad about it, of course his family put a lot of pressure on him.
Goodness! This man begs for money from everyone.
What do you say, he even sold his car.
He looks twenty years older, this morning I saw him talking to himself.
Don't blame him Oh! My poor brother, I don't know when we'll progress.
Please close the door.
Sorry, oh! My brother.
Why didn't you try to convince them to have a wedding based on your budget?
What do you mean by "within my budget"?
Why, I live alone?
The problem our societies suffer from is showing off, boasting, and glorifying illnesses.
It forces you to catch the same disease.
If you want to live there.
Once, I gave the signal to the bride's mother.
Her words attacked me (metaphorically).
Put your trust in God.
By the way, tell me,
How did you get married?
And I don't want to get married, I'm not crazy.
Even if you decide, my brother, to get married,
I will consider marrying a foreigner or even an Arab.
He says, "Your country!"
We decided to bring a DJ for the music.
But because Umm Nasser brought a famous singer to her son's wedding.
He's a very famous singer, but I've forgotten his name.
Why are you so angry?
It seems you don't like what I'm doing!
It's enough that he sold his car and that one of his friends gives him a ride every day.
Earlier, I entered the room and found him talking to himself.
I see, now you've changed your mind.
Since my brother Saleh is tired, my mom just stopped.
I don't care about you and him.
I am no less than people.
Do not make us a laughingstock.
Oh Mother, please! Enough, my brother has spent everything he had and took money from everyone.
Please be quiet.
My mother has new demands for the wedding, and my brother said I don't have the money, so I screamed at him and said I'll cancel the wedding, I don't want to get married.
Where is she now?
She's inside, and they're giving her first aid.
He said she was better now and they would find her a room in the hospital.
What a scandal!
Relax, sister!
The doctor told you to stay calm and gave you an injection to help you sleep.
How can I relax when he wants to make a joke at our expense, for better or for worse.
I was telling him to bring Abdullah Roaished, and he said to me, "I don't have money."
I feel sad for your mother.
Take care of her.
Go to her and kiss her head.
And tell her I'll do what you want.
I'll get you Abdullah Roaished.
Abu Yusuf is kind; I don't think he won't help me.
It's not fair, she couldn't find anyone but Abu Youssef.
What's wrong with him!
Are you crazy, Saleh?
But the minister kept him because he was an old man, and moreover, he was disciplined and honest.
In my opinion, if you tell him what you told me, there's a good chance his heart will stop.
Yes, I did.
This is because of the financial crisis you're going through and you want to ask Abu Youssef for some money, of course, from the ministry's funds.
And only Allah knows when He will restore him to Himself.
And when the regulatory authorities came and asked him about the money,
Certainly, he might be in trouble.
No one will know and he will know how to deal with it.
It's up to you, the man is in his office and you have to be responsible if anything happens to him.
I'm stealing in my last days!
Uncle, this isn't called stealing.
In the first draw.
Over there, there's a white box wrapped in blue ribbon with a circle drawn like a dove's wing, bring it, bring it.
Well, Uncle Abu Youssef, I, if I don't have difficulties,
I'll pay everything back.
They call me Abu Yusuf.
And you came in my last days
Tempt me, O Thursday!
Salih, Salih.
Alright, listen to what I say, if someone else were to be slapped or something bad were to happen to them, oh! oh! oh! Khalid.
Salih, Salih.
All the methods I've tried are useless, Uncle Abu Youssef, I'm drowning.
I cannot undo the marriage.
And you don't know them, they are all bald.
What's wrong with you?
No, no, the other device, the panicked device, the panicked device.
In the drawer, in the drawer.
Uncle Abu Yusuf, the box is full of pills, which one do you need?
The box that contains a picture of a man in a state of panic.
We've already booked two rooms for hair and makeup, just for us.
And we'll be there from tomorrow.
We brought Abdullah Roaished and his band.
You will see, my dear.
No, I won't tell you.
This song will be the highlight of the season.
We were the first in the world to use it.
Mom, mom,
Goodbye.
There is no god but God.
My son, don't forget to read the ablution when you enter the dance hall.
They have evil eyes here.
I already told you it's amazing.
The best generation ever, God protect you, I don't want to envy you.
Mum mum, the police are knocking at the door.
I erred in obeying You, O my God.
It's not fair, today is my wedding day.
The people involved in the test came.
And now solve it, oh my God, I'll be imprisoned.
Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf!
It's still early.
But that wouldn't be fair if that happened!
The company offered a three-million-dollar contract, with only two million allocated for materials.
Wrote a memo to the minister.
We know there is corruption, but the corruption does not go this far.
It seems you're not living in this world.
Tell me, what did the minister say to Uthman?
And why didn't our president object? They say he was in on it!
I don't know about him, I swear I don't know.
Where is morality?
The true became false, and the false became true!
Ah! Saad, are you sure the minister has dismissed him? Oh! People, what has happened to the world?
Just fire him!
What's next?
It's owned by the minister's sister.
This girl is in a relationship with the minister.
What a strange world.
What's wrong with you, didn't you know who she is?
This is the new employee whom the minister appointed in place of the lucky Osman.
Go, go, go.
What do you want me to do, Saleh? Object to the minister!
You're crazy!
Listen to me, man.
We have children, and we want to live.
We want to live.
What happened?
There he stands by the elevator.
This is the reward of honesty and integrity, my brother Saleh.
I wish we could do anything for you, brother!
Thank God, thank God for everything.
What's wrong with you, Saleh?
These are among the strange things we see before us in this world.
We see incredible things.
I'm at your service.
I want you to stop by the supermarket after work to get some vegetables for the salad.
I'll try, okay, goodbye.
Who's driving my sister home?
She was sitting in the front, laughing and talking. Who was she?
This is my university colleague, what's the problem with him driving me home? It's fine.
Oh my god, I can't believe it, why do you look so outdated!
What are you saying?
Don't you hear what we're saying?
You're old-fashioned.
This is an old and new thing on the right and left!
Right is right and wrong is wrong.
Life has evolved, and we live in the age of technology.
The era of international variables that align with the world and no one can keep up with.
The more I live, the more I see!
Don't blame me, oh! Mona, it's against my interest to be tense and angry.
This is what he sees in his day.
Tell her he's sorry.
Life isn't made the right way.
Don't be affected, come and eat lunch.
Let me sleep to relax.
The manager is not angry with you.
Is the manager annoyed?
No, he's not angry, go wash your face and eat your lunch.
Alright, dear.
I'm very excited to meet you on my first day of work.
It's an honor for you.
Certainly, certainly.
Certainly I know you don't need anyone to remind you of the principles of the job.
However, at the same time, it is very important.
Remember some of the values and principles that you operate by.
In the public interest.
This is what your honor should be.
We all must
Division is absolutely necessary, sir.
To be thieves
Thank you, thank you all.
What I also wanted to say
And to warn you of my first day at work,
There is one employee among you.
Who is the truthful and trustworthy one, dedicated and far from those bad things?
Just doubt.
The presence of an honest employee.
So that we can take the necessary legal action against him in our ministry.
No, it won't be as you wish, sir.
Thank God we're all thieves.
As you wish, I'll say it in front of my colleagues and behind them.
Where is Khalid?
Yes, Your Honor.
Khaled, I was very proud of you, God bless you.
Alright, sir.
Ah! My lord judge, you know how to choose.
God willing, He will guide you.
Why did you let the devil manipulate you?
You should thank God it was only a matter of truth.
Oh mother, why is father in prison?
Be quiet, my daughter!
No, no, I'll never do it again.
Oh mother, why was my father imprisoned?
Stop him.
That means he became trustworthy.
It's really shameful to say that your father is honest.
This is a costume!
It covers your whole body.
What will people see?
And I hope you're looking for a job, because no one will hire you when you're like this.
Is there a respectable lady who covers her body and hides her beauty?
She covers her chest, she wears it even here, she's choking herself.
I'm tired of it, my son.
And I bought her a blouse and pants that revealed her midriff above her navel.
But it's a hopeless case; she doesn't want to be on the right track.
Here I tell you!
You'll only blame yourself.
I ask for the hand of your daughter Sarah for my son Rashid.
One of us is now only looking for the right man for his daughter.
Let me tell you, my son Rashid.
He is a very good person.
He doesn't stop drinking (figuratively).
He's drunk 24/7.
Crazy, drunk, and heavy all day.
Don't ask about the mess.
He has been well brought up.
And let me say also that he is among the hypocrites.
And how is theft?
This is what I expect from you, and how are the drugs?
Obviously, it's over. I'll give you five riyals if you can find his pupils. I'll hold a contest over it.
By the way, Abu Sara, we only came to ask for her hand.
Know the nights and wander.
We know she came from a good family.
By the blessing of the Son, blessing, thus life works, blessing.
I'm drunk.
I can't walk.
Alright, come.
Okay, goodbye.
Okay, call your father to come and pick you up.
Why should I call him?
Let him be able to come and get you.
Where is he?
Look, he's over there, waving his handkerchief with a blonde girl.
Really, your father walks straight, he's happy.
Hello my dear daughter Mona!
Majid! His name was Abdulaziz.
Yes, that's correct.
You've confused me, my daughter.
And you know since the establishment of the State of Palestine with its capital in Jenin in the year two thousand and nine hundred ninety-nine, after the signing of the comprehensive peace agreement with the State of Israel.
And Israel continues to practice terrorism, pressure, and siege against it.
The latest were the accusations raised by the Israelis and their Arab friends against the Palestinians.
They smuggle plastic knives through the tunnels.
Especially Article Two, paragraph A, which states that the Palestinian people must cut their nails every day.
Let's move on to the crucial meeting.
Cheap lord,
When Israel agrees to the establishment of a Palestinian state,
Oh! Man, what are you saying? Oh! Man? You're ruining our reputation and leaving me alone!
Please!
Sorry, Sir Tiger, sorry, Mr. President.
Can you give me a chance to speak?
I have fully adhered to the comprehensive international agreement.
What does the Israeli actor say?
To find anything steady, like a rock or plastic, to commit to.
Oh! Man, even our homes.
What do people in the Gulf call it?
In Palestine, everything is made of wood.
American companies are making wooden cars for us according to the agreement.
And all the doors of our houses are made of thermally treated wood.
We don't need speeches.
Don't change the subject.
Mr. President,
This is a crucial point, and I would like to vote on this matter because nail growth is a violation of the agreement.
If you agree, raise your hand.
But I had a very strange dream.
So that you can control the students.
I'm tired of telling him.
This is the fourth school you will start working at tomorrow.
Because I established my strong personality as a teacher from the beginning.
The boys follow him and tear his clothes, and he does nothing.
How many times has he come to me without a headscarf.
The principal of my school told me.
Rashid is kind and we don't want to expel him.
The children throw rulers at him.
They are dragging his cloak into the gap in front of everyone.
They said that this teacher is very indecisive and will ruin everything.
Shall I tell them the ketchup story?
Come on, Mary.
What's the story with ketchup? This is new, no one told me!
They poured an entire bottle of ketchup on the chair.
He came and sat down.
He didn't know anything.
Only when he saw the children laughing at him in the schoolyard.
Stop him.
By the way, your manager whom you'll start working with tomorrow contacted me.
However, it's okay, we'll give him a chance.
Because I'm waiting to tell you.
The time for kindness and weakness is over.
Oh! Close Oh! Abdullah
You will see a different Rashid.
And there is no need to remind you of the important educational quote,
You are a graduate of education, and so am I.
And we all know the quote,
The teacher is the son of the first class.
You will see Mr. Rashid the strong.
And if anyone does a wrong,
He'll be in trouble.
When you start talking, he just said shut up.
You will see what I will tell him.
Who among you mocked me and told me to just shut up? Who?
It was you who told me to just shut up!
No, not me.
Stay away from me!
Get up, go to the school principal.
And tell him that Mr. Rashid fired me.
I don't want to see your face here, do you hear me!
What do you think about my anxiety?
You shouldn't just be like this on your first day, but throughout the whole year.
Be aware of the consequences.
If you hear someone's voice
While I am explaining or speaking.
Do you know what?
Do you know what "nervous" means?
Means tense.
Did you hear what I said or not?
I heard him, too.
Get out of the class.
Go to the school principal.
Take your things and leave now!
Take your stuff.
I don't care.
It's clear that he's still looking for it.
No, sir, we didn't see him.
By the way, strawberry milk ice cream is very sweet.
Dear Abdurrahman.
Everyone makes mistakes, and so does man.
Just a joke, son.
But more importantly, your father doesn't know the story!
I don't want that, I want the chocolate in my bag.
Well, where's your bag? Where's your bag? Where's your bag?
In the classroom.
I'm at your service.
You say he's happy with you.
You don't know how to distinguish between a rich boy and an ordinary boy.
Oh no, how can a disaster look green or red?
Come here, where are you going?
In the bathroom.
Are you still in the bathroom?
Knock on the door quickly and tell him the first class started half an hour ago quickly.
I was before them all, one juice and one chip.
I took it before them all, tore them apart. My friend Abdulrahman, and by the way, this is very healthy.
Alright, now go to Saud and get a PlayStation disc from him.
So, what do we learn from this story?
That man
He must have morals.
This is a PlayStation device, also tell me to bring a PlayStation device at the same time.
Well, do you want anything else, my friend Abdulrahman, my friend?
Nothing now.
We learn for the story.
You all know I'm leaving this week because I got accepted into grad school.
So, I thought I should hand in the party file before my trip.
How can I pick you up in the afternoon? Abdurrahman told me that, and I don't know where he wants to go, but he didn't tell me what time!
As long as his father has returned and hasn't told him anything, thank God I'm safe and sound.
Let me say that I didn't take him this evening and became sad and told his father, no, no, no, a disaster, no, no.
Hello, my friend Abdul Rahman.
God help you.
What should I do, it's an order.
Do you love him, do you love him like this?
Today, children, we will have a new lesson in science.
And peace be upon you.
Thank you.
I need water.
I didn't ask, and you didn't ask anything, I'm at your service.
Teacher, teacher. How can you ask the teacher for water?
Is there a professor who brings water to a student, are you his tea servant? This incident will not pass like this, I will write it in the report.
And you too are mocking, mocking me.
Don't raise your voice or shout at me, do you hear me or not?
This is enough for whom?
Okay, this is for cars, how many in number?
Four to five cars.
Excellent, this is excellent, wonderful, excellent.
What is he doing?
As you can see, he will park his car in front of our houses at the expense of our comfort.
Don't tell me about Abu Nasser's days.
Abu Nasser is finished.
He studies abroad.
Okay, I broke the table.
Don't worry, oh! Brother.
Why?
Are you different?
Change your behavior towards me.
Me or you?
We didn't say anything. Oh, brother!
What is this?
Listen, leave everything as it is, it's better for you.
I'm not a threat to you! Oh! My brother?
What do you mean by "no need" and "I want to ease your burden"?
What are you saying?
Instead of, what do they call it?
It seems you want.
You want this your way.
Faster, faster.
Is this good?
Not as he likes, that's unfair!
He doesn't own the neighborhood (figuratively).
We are coming to my uncle Abu Naif to discuss not shouting.
Who is this Rashid to do as he pleases in the neighborhood?
Did you give me a chance to speak?
Alright, oh! People, be quiet and let's listen to what Uncle Abu Naif has to say.
Now, this good-for-nothing loser is playing with your nerves!
Leave it to me.
If I don't slap his face, he won't admit to what he did.
The game is played by its players (metaphorically).
Is this good?
Goodbye.
You haven't seen anything yet.
Did you know that he now owns a jewelry store!
That's why I see you wearing all these rings and necklaces here.
"O Allah, grant us refuge."
Just walking, will you stay in the heat?
I can't believe that Rashid, who was so naive and poor, has become like this.
He became the vice president of the Global Education Center.
Let him tell you, let him teach you. You are a teacher and he is a teacher, but look at his place now and yours now.
"What's wrong with him?"
Don't mention it, oh! Abdullah.
I'll tell you what the secret is.
The professor came, the professor came.
Teacher, I didn't do anything!
Teacher, don't you know who he is?
Yes, dear, I know who he is.
Here I tell you, we won't have a chance as good as this.
I'm looking for a job! It's funny, I swear it's funny.
No, brother, the job is in my pocket.
Thank you for everything you've done, thank you, thank you.
Send him my regards.
Your mother sends you her greetings from here. May God protect you, I will tell her, he sends his greetings.
Well, goodbye dear, in God's care (a metaphorical phrase).
What more do you want, your brother will be a minister, but do you believe it, my son!
Oh, Mother! We will work, we will work at a high level.
But, my son, if you work with him, won't they say anything?
He's just giving it to you like that.
That's nice, isn't it?
Alright! This is automatic, without a doubt.
So, my beloved, please fulfill my dream.
Before your dream, my dream.
Building a tower between the Corniche towers.
Let's go, what are you waiting for!
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You can do it, Abu Saleh!
It seems your friend is angry.
That's what it looks like! Brother.
You can do it, Abu Saleh!
Do you believe that he stood up, took the mobile phone, and gave it to Abu Saleh?
Look, there's something behind this, and I'm one hundred percent sure that Abu Sultan holds a grudge against him.
His relationship with Abu Saleh was not good.
No, Abu Sultan won't do that unless it's intended to do something else.
Really, to this extent?
Open the car door for him!
Finally, he works on opening the minister's car doors.
Oh! My son, don't break my heart, don't break my heart.
For your information, all the stories we hear in cafes happen in the countryside.
But what I hear, I don't believe!
I stopped my heart, I stopped my heart.
I'm afraid, my daughter, that women will start talking about her and you won't mention the kind-hearted dish collector. She spreads rumors about me among the women, my daughter.
Say something, Abu Sultan, speak. I am shocked, I will collapse.
Please, I know what to do.
It's none of your business.
Manira, I'm playing it cool.
By opening the door for him, that's the start of the plan in my head.
I deserve to become a minister, not him.
Let me work, I have a flight.
To allow them to dismiss him.
Yes, plan.
He must trust me in the beginning.
They told me we appointed him minister because he was appointed two months before my appointment.
Because I'm quite sure he'll be fired from his job.
You might break the spell.
What is this?
What's this either?
And at every event he attends, the photographer will take lots of pictures of him so that his face becomes very familiar in the newspaper.
It stinks until it floats to the surface.
Sure?
Just wait. Let me work against him and you'll see.
On the contrary, Your Honor,
Certainly, sir.
So tell me,
Did you thank him for the lamb? By the way, the meat was very delicious.
The man is outside, go see him.
Don't be a fool, people want to make you glorious and you want to humiliate yourself.
Only the minister, please, please.
No, no, no, don't take pictures of me. Just the Minister, one picture with the Minister.
Take one more.
Oh! Brother, I really love your plan.
I want you to take it to her.
Picture, picture, picture.
Yes, he is a minister too.
Alright, I'll tell you, wait!
Go to the second-to-last page.
Look how big his wedding picture is.
Say: "There is no god but Allah."
Yes, every day has one or two pictures.
As you say, he is a social activist, alright, alright, goodbye.
Everyone loves you, but I don't know what's wrong with you.
He is everywhere (figuratively).
They are jealous, they envy you. The tree that bears fruit is the one that gets stones thrown at it (proverb).
Take me to the market!
Is it still not ready?
Peace be upon you.
Hello, peace be upon you, hello.
You are very famous.
Yes, your name is Abdulaziz Abdullah, right?
This is my husband.
How many times have I told you?
Three hundred and fifty
For this famous person,
You're home today, is something wrong?
Leave me alone, I have a headache today, my head hurts, I feel pain all over my body and it's worst in my gut.
I'm really tired, I'm so tired. It's been a month of going around with him.
Let me rest today.
Hello, Mother of Sultan.
Can I say something?
Oh! A woman, all I want is to be taken.
You've started to love him.
You saw for yourself what fame does!
I know. Alhamdulillah, you're convinced.
Frankly,
Your minister is anxious, it seems he loves this story.
I will send you my brother Saad.
No, I didn't follow any activity and didn't read the newspaper, I don't know.
We are at your service, goodbye.
If God wants an ant to disappear, He gives it wings.
Peace be upon you, do you have a conference here at the hotel tonight, man?
Wedding?
Don't remember, don't you have any events like a party, birthday, or wedding?
I don't know, but you can see the hotel behind us.
Ah, there's a hotel behind you, isn't there?
Can I leave you in the car and go into the hotel to ask?
Go, go, go and take your time. Go and ask, go.
Oh God, help everyone.
Does this minister allow us to sleep or rest?
That means he couldn't find a party, wedding, or any problem to blame it on.
He took him to a sixteen-thousand-star hotel and couldn't find anything for him. He has bad luck just like his face.
Just shut up, hello.
You didn't find his birthday, or did you?
Go, you might catch the second half!
In every issue, he has a hundred pictures.
Doesn't sleep! Doesn't get tired Oh! My brother.
Oh! Man, the editor of the newspaper says the priority is to set up his picture, and then I'll set up the newspaper.
She said, "I am your daughter. They held a contest based on your husband's, the minister's, picture."
One asks the other: "How many pictures of the minister are there in the newspaper?"
And the winner gets a prize.
The story isn't like that. You have to come to the cafe and listen to the daily comments about his pictures in the newspaper. It's endless gossip.
Oh my God, his death is so near.
As they say, when God wills a butterfly's demise, it draws near to the light.
People will leave you and greet him.
He became one of the most famous people in the country.
Don't mention him. Who is he?
You've destroyed my dignity.
O Allah, bless her and bestow blessings upon her.
She said, "We all got married except for poor Amal; she's the only one of us who didn't."
This is my fate.
My marriage is not my destiny.
And I forget my marriage.
God alone is sufficient for whoever is behind this.
Do you see those spoiled kids sitting over there?
Yes, what's wrong with them?
Do you see who is playing with their hair?
Is this a boy or a girl?
After my father died, I mean was killed.
I saw him, he grew, didn't he?
It's not right to leave him tied to the maid.
Go and make some tea.
I'm tired of talking to my mom. But she doesn't have just one maid, she has two.
I've told you a hundred times not to interfere. Khalid is my son, not yours.
You don't have any other problem besides Kholood, services, and Kholood.
Mom, this is not good, Khalid is with the maid 24/7 and doesn't want anyone else.
Get out. I want to rest, I want to sleep. How?
Oh my God, Saud, your brother Khalid has become a girl.
Wait for a while, if I don't tell my parents about you.
Let me tell you something, what's up with Khalid?
Saud says Khalid wears makeup and acts like a girl. What's the problem? What's the problem?
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God! Saud.
Khaled is putting makeup on his face! It's just a little makeup. A child saw a makeup box and played with it.
I saw a very small spot, and even that was unclear.
He is kind, friendly, and gentle.
I will scold Saud.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
The last time I asked you, Saad, what you wanted to be when you grow up, you didn't tell me. Now tell me, when you grow up, what do you want to be?
And you, my dear Khaldi, my dear Saadi, will be a desk, and is that not what you want to become?
We will go to London this year as we did last year.
Yes, contact the vibrator in Bahrain.
Tell him to bring Susn, Khalida, and Fahda.
And say hello to Samora.
I ask for forgiveness from God.
Today, my father told me to choose.
Do you want me to build on the land overlooking the sea or the adjacent land?
I said I don't want to choose.
I can live with you, dear, anywhere.
Thank you, my love.
And you taught me how to fish?
Oh my God! Amoul, I want to open my eyes and tell you that you've graduated from university.
It doesn't seem to be a men's perfume.
I don't know, but it smells very strange.
Oh my God, what's wrong with me?
The way you speak has become feminine.
I forgot you were a man.
I hope you don't talk to people this way outside?
I can't believe it! Oh! Khalid.
Please leave my room!
Alas, Khalid!
You've disappointed me.
Oh my son, don't hurt my feelings, I swear I'll tell my mother.
This is my son, and I know him well.
Oh poor thing! Oh Khulood, light of my eye, I ask God that all children be like him in kindness and feelings.
And when you only see a gentle and quiet person, you say he's like me.
Shame on you, shame on you to say such a thing about your brother.
Stop, you're making a big fuss about nothing.
Poor thing, he's wearing a very nice perfume. Now, what's the difference between men's perfume and women's perfume?
Here I tell you, don't say that in front of your father.
He has.
I'll show you, but be quiet so Mohammed doesn't notice anything.
How do these two girls meet?
It's bad for a pretty girl like her to do that!
Don't look at him, don't look at him!
I'm afraid he sensed something related to him.
Give yourself some rest.
I know you're monitoring the spread of Bluetooth at the moment.
I'm waiting for Saad, let him come.
How are you, Saad?
Oh God, protect him.
We were waiting for you, we didn't play cards.
Yes, why?
Do you want to drink anything?
I see him sleeping here in your apartment for two days!
Because of the Bluetooth story.
Yes, his older brother threatened him.
He is afraid of him.
Don't try, I've told you not to try.
Escape from the devil, O my God! O my son, help me!
I have already booked.
I'm leaving. How can I face people? I can't!
And what should I say to your father?
Tell him anything.
Oh boys, these people only bring trouble.
This is the end, mother.
I remember when Khalid was young.
Certainly this will be the result.
Stop it, please get out.
The right thing always hurts.
I broke the vase.
It's impossible for me to live in Doha.
I can't face people.
My mobile phone is off for a while.
And you blame me Oh! Hope?
You are a girl and you spend your whole day at home.
What can I say when I'm a man spending the whole day meeting people outside.
Difficult! Oh! Hope.
I cannot live spending my day, my life, and always having my head bowed.
The father felt for a while that something was wrong in the house and that there was a change.
For how long will my father be absent from the events happening here at home?
Sometimes I blame the father and sometimes I don't.
I don't blame him. Oh, how I hope when I remember his dedication and loyalty to his work, that we can live with dignity among people.
And I really blame him.
When the father leaves home, the responsibility of the children falls on the mother.
We don't want to dwell on the past now.
Does the father know or not?
But I'm ready.
Turn on his Bluetooth.
But I won't give it to him.
I don't want to see the shock on my parents' faces.
I'll be devastated.
Whatever! Oh! Hope,
He knows how to throw us off.
It's much better to know that from someone else.
Alas, our house has come to this.
Because a dirty bomb called Khaleed had exploded in it.
And customs and traditions.
You will find them impudently.
Closing their ears to it
They don't want to listen to him.
They only listen to one voice.
You filthy and strange creature.
They trample on all the good.
What comes to your mind?
You suddenly decided to study abroad.
We can only say, God willing, He will help you, my son!
God help you.
People who come back bring gifts, not people who are going to travel.
You're right.
This is the law.
But every rule has exceptions.
Amal, come with me quickly.
Did you see her, my daughter?
I can't hear anything.
Abu Saad!
Abu Saad.
Abu Saad, what's the matter with you?
Father, what do you miss, Father?
Father!
Don't worry.
You are a great person.
And any man who wants to marry you.
I didn't divorce you for any reason related to your faults.
I have divorced you.
Because it's impossible.
To kiss my children's uncle.
Your brother is like me.
"So if they slacken,"
You're here every day.
Before you come at all,
I was hiding underground.
That was back when we were in the tunnels.
This is very strong language. Can you handle such language?
You make two thousand, you make a lot of money!
Say what God wills.
Go, go.
You've only been here for seven months, stop complaining and go home.
How embarrassing and shameful! Every time he takes me to someone's house, their driver asks, "How much do they pay you?" Nothing satisfies him, and today he asked for a raise.
This driver is mocking you.
He came less than seven months ago.
Annoy me, my son, annoy me.
Send it back so we can get rid of it.
Bring it back and bring someone else!
Tell your son that he doesn't know what lies beyond this word! He doesn't know the time and money it requires.
And leadership training. Return it and let's get rid of it!
When you came to my house for the first time six months ago.
Alright, then I'll tell you something new.
Gas is now $1.14, before it was half a riyal per liter, it might reach five riyals. Everything has become expensive, my friend.
Open your mind and listen to what I say!
When I first came here, what salary did you give me?
You gave me seven hundred.
You're new, new. You've only been here six months, and eight hundred dollars is a lot.
I need money.
The drivers you're talking about are old, old, and you're new.
This seven hundred has now become eight hundred.
Go!
He said, "I will only give you an extra hundred riyals."
No use with three hundred.
What I told you is the right thing?
No, no screen. I'll be in trouble when I escape.
No, fear God, O screen.
Those who flee from their shepherds.
Why are you afraid?
Due to the past shepherds of those people.
Give them a salary between six hundred and seven hundred. Do you know how much they get?
How much do you earn?
So, why are you afraid?
She wasn't afraid.
God is sufficient for him.
I woke Nasser up and told him to go visit him.
There was no one.
He even stole the phone I bought for him.
What did you do?
What have I done!
They did everything they could, took his passport, and put it with them.
You may go! Sir, you are excused.
We will look for him everywhere.
This is the problem, this is the problem.
And after all this, they escape.
They put us in trouble and harm us.
I told you to return it.
But do you think I'll let him go?
I will find him no matter what.
He will return, which means he will come back.
For me, I'd rather pay for his ticket and send him home than let him stay here to make money.
I'm tired of this, I wish I could find him.
Come in now, no one will buy now.
At the beginning of the game, you seemed nervous, as I noticed.
But what were we worried about? We were worried that our team wouldn't score any goals.
We need more than three, we want ten, twelve, fifteen.
You made me feel before the match that you were afraid, you feared the opposing team.
I'm not afraid of the opposing team, I'm afraid of our team. I'm afraid they won't score more than three goals.
This is our team's level, I know that. I'm talking about our team's level.
This is a great trust from you.
The rival team has something.
Great! The wolves have scored a goal now, you're the striker with the first goal.
Where are you going?
I'm going home.
Do you have a car?
Come with me, I'll give you a ride.
Thank you, man.
Why try, you can't beat our team!
Your Honor, the match has just started and the league has just begun.
Did you hear what he said?
He said it's a very difficult matter.
Mahmoud, bring the tea!
Now my friend is coming to pick me up to go to the stadium, quickly.
Take it, my friend, Sajeed.
Take it, Pasha!
What has he made of himself?
Yes, he is the Indian person.
Yes, oh! Man, he's a football fanatic.
Don't say such things about my wolf team.
They will win, they will win.
Let's go! Oh! Sajid, let's go! Oh! Sajid, hurry up, the match will start soon, hurry up. Bring water with you, the wolves are playing today.
Dear viewers, we have with us today one of the most famous fans of the Cheetahs club, a fox.
They say you defeat them because they are incomplete.
What they say, what they say is not true.
What's missing? Each team has twelve players.
If there's neither one nor two, nothing will change.
This fox is very clever.
This is our best fan.
Well, on the occasion of Oh! Thalob's win, a final word you'd like to say to the cats.
Stop all words.
When they say the name of the knights.
Her name is high in the sky.
This is the good fan.
Listen to me, brother.
You can find him enthusiastic like this.
Here we are! Oh, handsome.
So, where is the Indian who is a football fan?
I haven't seen him in a while.
Oh my God! This man is a big star now, he doesn't come here.
I saw the man a few days ago and didn't recognize him. He was sitting in a cafe in a village called Starbucks or something like that.
I remember this boy, he came and sat with us at the café and didn't have money to buy a cup of tea.
The man gave me twenty riyals as a gift for the boy in front of my eyes.
What made him like this?
Oh! [A man], sitting with important executives at the club, assisting him and doing everything he wants.
Can I say something stupid?
Yes, Uncle.
My uncle says: Whether you go or come,
I don't know why you support such a bad and weak club.
This is the Fox team in my heart.
When you open my heart
You can catch a lot of foxes there.
You haven't heard the poem, sir, that he wrote about governance.
When we played a match against them.
Please, please oh! Read, read this poem, read, read.
My uncle. Oh my God, who knows my secret.
My spirit hurts a lot.
I never sleep at night.
Learn that we are the Fox fan club.
You can't tell me the winner's name, until I get an exclusive scoop.
We will hold a press conference, and God willing, we will announce the name of the winner.
The one who spends.
The famous trio, this fan who is being honored today by the Wolf Club's management in a generous, rare, and amazing gesture.
Really!
Congratulations, Thalob, on this beautiful honor, and this is indeed a wonderful gift.
What do you think, is it a pen or a watch?
It's his father, man, I swear to God.
This is a gesture.
I tell you it's him.
We need to inform the police.
Don't go anywhere!
All fans, all fans, all fans.
No, no, no! Oh! This son is not him, he's his doppelganger.
I'm telling you it's not him.
I'm late.
I don't know the game times Oh! My brother.
Now how can we catch him?
We just need to wait until the Fox team plays their next game.
There he is, there he is, I saw him.
Alright, let's follow him.
Oh my God! My brother is late.
Here he is, here he is, here he is, here he is.
Follow him, follow him, follow him, go after him.
The problem is that we're not sure if it's him or not.
I say to you, Father, it is he.
I say the right and wisdom is to seek them out and ask them by telling them about the driver you have, where did he come from? How did he come to you? When did he come to you?
Father, you always make things complicated.
We'll report him, I'm sure of it.
Earth, oh God, preserve her. Yes, it is mine.
Yes, it's registered in my name, yes.
Also the other land next to it.
Tell your father that Abu Abd al-Rahman al-Sabee'i sends his regards. Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
No, no, God bless you, but I think we're mistaken. Oh! My son. We came for a friend and thought you were him.
God, glorified and exalted, creates many people who resemble each other.
Thank you, thank you, thank you very much, sir, thank you.
No, God doesn't bless you. Sorry, sorry, and thank you, thank you.
Alright, with your permission, sorry to bother you, and I'm here to help you. Goodbye, may God protect you, bye-bye.
And you say you're sure!
I don't know what your father will do! I'm very worried.
What have you done, Walid!
When, when, when was I walking, my suitcase handle caught on it.
And try to sort things out now!
Go to your room, leave.
I hope nothing bad happens.
I hope nothing bad happens.
Now, try to make your father understand this!
Did he know my father before?
It was shattered into a million pieces.
Alright, Mom, let's buy something like that as soon as possible.
Before my father comes.
Oh Mother, please!
You know your father, when he gets angry, he goes crazy.
Go to your room and don't come out.
He did nothing.
By mistake, he hit the pillow with his bag, causing it to fall and break.
Mom, I'm worried about him.
I don't know where he is.
No, no, no, no, his father is crazy.
Why are you doing this to the boy, my daughter!
You've been hiding it and hiding it, do you want the boy to go crazy?
May I say something, my daughter?
Where do you think the boy went?
Alright, if he comes I'll call you.
I hope nothing bad happens.
Aunt, I know where Wael is.
Come with me, I'll show you where it is.
Let's go. Oh my God.
Here it is.
Please, grandma, I don't want to go home.
Hide me in your place.
I didn't see the pot.
I swear I don't know.
This is how your father scares you, may God guide him.
Come with me, my son!
Don't worry, son, as long as I'm in the house, don't worry. Oh, son!
I have the solution.
We didn't say anything, Abu Walid!
Please, oh my God! Abu Waleed
This time, I'll forgive him for your sake.
What did I find in the house?
Where is he? Where did he go?
Where is he? Where?
Alright, my son. Oh! Waleed, your father won't do anything for you.
Are you sure, Dad?
Yes, oh! My son, yes.
Will you leave it here? I'm afraid one of the kids might hit it and break it.
He asked me and said, "I need you to get me one like the one you brought me that Waleed broke."
He wants exactly the same thing. I went and found only this, the last one in the store. He's very lucky. Where are the children?
In the room, I study.
Alright, go ahead.
Just this one game and I'll stop.
Oh my God!
Alright, then study!
My father just wants this game and we will study.
Please, Dad, don't tell Uncle.
Don't tell your brother, Dad. I swear to God, this is the last time.
I'll call him.
And you in particular. You've wronged me, am I your friend at the café?
You'll regret it if I don't tell my brother about you!
Alright, I won't call. Here's the phone in my pocket if you're going to study, that's fine.
My daughter, why don't you take him to a doctor?
Oh, how I wish your guidance, Mother.
He scares him to death because he beats him all the time.
What a poor boy.
Patience.
Mom, where's my money? I didn't see it with you today?
And I went with him.
My sister doesn't accept abayas.
Oh oh! My daughter, I haven't told you the story of Manira and her son Nayef.
Her son is the age of Waleed, may God heal him.
And the same height.
Yesterday she was telling me she didn't know what to do with her son.
She wants to take him to the hospital, but her husband Youssef
I learned about the story yesterday.
Discuss with her and shout at her.
He says, "Why didn't you tell me?"
This is a psychological condition.
This is against the boy's will.
He must take his son and lock him up in the middle of the backyard.
And then he tells him to do it again and pee in your bed.
It's a big fuss about nothing (metaphor).
What did you say, Umm Munira?
I was telling her to eat, eat.
I'm eating and have a good appetite.
Alas for me.
Mother, Mother.
It's good that your father didn't know about you.
He will beat you to death.
Alright, go to the bathroom and take a shower before your father wakes up, or else you'll be in for a disaster.
I won't listen to what you say.
According to them,
They embrace and cry.
I'm afraid something might happen to my children.
I must take them to their uncle to be punished.
I'm nervous.
They didn't fail, they succeeded.
Why would you take them to their uncle?
Nasser got forty-four out of fifty.
Why don't they get fifty out of fifty?
Their uncle had warned them.
Indeed, I agree with his viewpoint.
Forget the emotions.
And my brother must punish them.
Okay, I'll get it, I'll get it.
This is the last time, this is the last time.
Fifty out of fifty.
Our time is wasted, and I assure them that he is our son.
Why don't you get fifty out of fifty?
Shut up, shut up, shut up. I've warned you, but you don't listen to what I say.
Don't listen to what I say.
Boy, you've gone too far!
Hit him again, let me punish him.
Oh! Stop, Uncle.
So that you can review very well next time, review!
Alright, that's enough.
Do you know what I'm going to do?
I'll let you jump one by one, and you'll be falafel.
Be aware of going with your family to public places.
A misunderstanding is created for us.
Teacher, Waleed is crying.
Why are you crying?
This is an excellent sign.
It's strange that you're crying.
You're supposed to be happy.
Oh my God! My son, everyone has left, even the buses are gone. You're waiting for someone to come and pick you up.
At the school entrance, meaning he is waiting for the bus. The bus arrived and the children got off.
Did you hear about the boy who committed suicide today?
They gave him his certificate.
And his father threatens him if he doesn't get full marks.
Hand, hand. Come back! Oh! Hand, come back.
Hello and welcome to our new episode of our program "Without Borders."
Oil accounts for more than thirty-five percent of total energy sources.
While the rest is directed towards natural gas, coal, and hydroelectric power.
Therefore, oil is considered the world's primary source of energy.
The Gulf countries and Iran alone have 686 billion barrels.
Iran follows with twelve percent, then Iraq with ten percent, and then Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates with nine percent.
Each of them then comes to Venezuela with seven percent.
Then Russia by five percent.
Gulf states and Iran account for two-thirds of the world's reserves.
Unprecedented prices surpassing $109 for the first time in history.
And in this episode, we try to understand many of the complexities related to oil.
And the problems facing oil-exporting countries.
Despite their prices going through the roof.
Just like the problems faced by citizens and residents in these countries.
Due to inflation and unprecedented rise.
What will appear next on the screen or they can write articles for us through our website "www.aljazeera.net"
Because the market today is the main factor.
And not the producing countries.
Today, it is market forces that determine the price.
No, it's not OPEC.
Certainly, supply and demand play a role of course.
But other factors are
Other factors are political tensions.
In the world
Real estate markets
and stock markets and others
And moved to prices in speculation.
Goods like oil, for example
And tomorrow it will reach one thousand dollars, God knows best.
In 2004, the price of oil jumped from $44.
And today we see that even oil prices
Fluctuates from day to day
Oil prices fell below ninety dollars.
And it increased in the second quarter.
Especially with the arrival of spring and secondly because most global filters are under maintenance.
"That is always, for the second quarter"
Seasonal demand for oil is declining.
In winter, it drops below ninety.
And all this indicates that speculation now has power and influence over the market.
"A lot has changed, meaning when we return to the traditional market of the past."
The market was influenced by supply and demand.
Seasonal supply and demand
Today, we observe that economic growth is
Today or yesterday, General Commander Fallon, the leader of the Central Command in Afghanistan and Iraq, resigned.
His resignation sparked a huge reaction due to its connection to the so-called anticipated American war.
Political or Geopolitical Effects
It can affect the oil market positively or negatively and rapidly.
The effect will certainly come and will have its impact.
Even speculators respond to political influences.
Some might assert, he will say, some will tell you that an American war on Iran is coming.
What will happen to the market here? The market will be optimistic in some way.
This question, Mr. Deputy, is now in light of what was announced by the White House.
And returned this area to a tense atmosphere.
This is the confusion.
But Fallon might see this scenario.
He had a quick reflection on the oil market.
Today, with the numbers proven, there is no shortage.
Let me give you an example: In the past seven weeks.
In the United States of America, their oil reserves have increased to exceed half in the past five years.
Today, I don't mean to say...
Even for the coming war, because I tell you today that even the world has a profitable warehouse.
Even today's global consumption, you can choose any country and find a long line of queues in front of gas stations.
This is another matter.
What risks does this issue pose?
What number do you expect it to be? I don't know.
Two hundred dollars or maybe three hundred, possibly less but
You may reach real tensions if these tensions turn into real tensions.
Because, as I said, the Gulf represents sixty percent.
In a country far even from oil-producing nations.
You will see how influence works in reverse on the oil market.
And it can reach three hundred dollars.
And moved from stock markets and others to the oil market. Today you will see more than two or three trillion dollars.
We see printing today.
The speculation is over a hundred a day.
These tensions in the region and the waiting.
April, as has been said before, will be the month to end this war.
God knows, I didn't do it, I mean, China.
In the area because now
This year is an election year.
And the current American administration still has only a few months left.
George H. W. Bush launched a war on Somalia and sent thirty thousand Canadians in his final days in the White House.
We see but do not anticipate events.
But I don't think this scenario will happen.
Because this scenario is very expensive.
America won't pay anything, you will pay, along with Iran and the consumer countries.
America Today
Now it depends on Africa's oil and has many other alternatives.
Look, there's none, let's be clear about this.
You said in your introduction that sixty percent
From oil reserves
But now they export twenty-two...
I get oil from West Africa.
I am from West Africa and what they export from any other region in the world.
Oil production
Because this is a difficult number and fixed reserves and reserves.
So-called offshore or deepwater production
So, the Gulf will remain a tough player.
And the Caspian Sea oil.
I consider them dreams because they are neither truth nor reality.
They vandalize and destroy it.
The important thing is that there is a means.
Today, Qatar is the world's largest energy exporter.
Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is why these countries are a tough number.
And the energy needs of states
Certainly means the existence of what is called secure provisioning.
And despite internal objections within the United States, even at the level of the Walloon general wing.
But there are still some concerns.
President Bush turned and said that he...
Try to notice how political risks do not come from the Gulf states.
That means he didn't come, no, no, no, it's not about generosity because none of us deals with generosity.
No, there's too much generosity involved.
But not "in the current domain"
We are not part of a charity.
Or be generous.
But be generous to Westerners, and not to anyone else.
With America accurately.
Where is the market?
Wherever we find economic returns, we will go.
We won't win.
Like oil and gas
You'll put it down to generosity.
I have the proof.
I have the proof.
No more than sixty to seventy dollars.
Not the rise in prices.
But the persistent decline of the US dollar
You are primarily as Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and OPEC members.
Exports must be in dollars, and you reject that.
Currency exchange even though the currency has collapsed and therefore...
Even if the outcome is not in your favor.
No, I didn't say it has to be 70.
It's the experts' talk, not mine.
Alright, the dollar dropped by thirty percent and oil prices rose more than that decline.
So if we take the base year as 2004,
We see oil prices ranging from thirty-five to thirty-six dollars.
Of course it means
Oil prices rose.
But it's a minor increase, esteemed deputy.
That means if we take it.
We consider him now.
Even at these prices
I mean if we compare it to the year two thousand and four.
Surpassed even the rate of decline of the US dollar.
The exciting thing is
Interacting with the declining dollar
As the dollar falls, oil prices rise.
This is also something the market has started to feel.
Our concern now is to reduce.
No, the situation has changed. Perhaps at the beginning of the reduction two years ago they were saying this, but the situation has changed now and has become...
And the dollar began to lose value against other major currencies like the euro and the pound sterling.
So the question is, why did you peg your currency to the dollar?
Weak currency and not covered.
This is a historic age.
Oil and its derivatives are priced in dollars, including European production in the North Sea, Russia, and Norway.
Stating that America in the mid-seventies
Abolished the gold standard that the U.S. dollar was pegged to.
This is not true.
So tell me what is right.
OPEC includes
Four Gulf states
Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
Today, OPEC's share of the global market
Forty percent
Today, if we say that the world consumes eighty-five million barrels
Dealing with the dollar in oil pricing
If you set a price in another currency, everyone will...
You can't
All oil-producing countries must agree.
You, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf states are business hotshots.
Those who own 66% of the world's reserves are the elderly.
Reserves, but I consider them exports.
Including Venezuela, Libya, and Iran.
Cameron, Angola, and all these countries organized under the umbrella of OPEC.
Her market share does not exceed forty percent.
Non-OPEC producer and exporter
And this cannot be linked to the forty percent.
He cannot do it alone unless...
There are some countries that tried but...
Not a real attempt.
It's you who's being rejected because of American ties.
Convert from dollars to another currency
All oil-producing countries
He used to export only one barrel before.
It's a pity if they import it.
And its currency rose significantly.
He sells his oil in dollars.
Upon receipt, either at the point of entry or later, he gets his money in dollars and then converts it to his local currency.
Its currency is not linked to the dollar.
Real, but...
But it's also your problem; you sell in dollars, but if your currency isn't pegged to the dollar, you won't have a problem.
My main question now is
What are the concerns and implications of pegging your currency to the dollar amidst the dollar's depreciation?
It has been tied for many years.
Especially in the 1970s when the dollar was a very strong currency and had immense power.
This withdrawal is not as easy as it seems.
Divorce is easy.
No, not here.
Divorce comes at a cost.
Works for the benefit of this country, not against it.
Profit and loss
Dow Jones announced yesterday that there are 4 countries, including Qatar.
But there is also a report on Gulf finance saying that there are four Gulf countries, of course, because Oman withdrew from the unified Gulf currency.
I read a statement in the Dow Jones, and I don't think it's a genuine statement.
The governor of the Qatar Central Bank has been exiled.
He said yes and that there is a study, but also all Gulf countries must
Profit and loss must be examined very carefully, free from emotions.
Leave the matter for testing until they come.
Look, I can bring you other economists who can provide another study.
Which contradicts this study.
The global organization said something simple and organized in a report released on March 8th.
Just four days ago.
The global home is the simple solution and it needs a non-political decision.
The political decision can be summarized in two things.
Not three, first thing.
Her intention, along with the five Gulf Cooperation Council states, regarding her plan in 2010 to issue a currency or study the issuance of a unified Gulf currency.
The second point is to issue a decision to move away from the dollar.
For the single currency first.
From my personal point of view
For viewing the unified Gulf currency
This currency will be strong.
Will be
Perhaps one of the strong currencies in the world, as you said.
And what will come of reserves and enormous profits.
So that's what the Prime Minister focused on when he said
Gulf countries because no single nation can do it alone.
Unless it has a strong economic content.
And today we are witnessing economic growth, even to the euro we see it.
Certainly, you should not forget that the central bank plays a major role.
In assessment
And the profit and loss account.
From all this news
Tense situation
2008, as observers have said, a global downturn, said this inflation will continue.
For a long time in the Gulf countries, but the solution is in the hands of governments.
Some countries have raised their salaries by seventy percent, such as the United Arab Emirates.
To stop the inflationary process that
And this is my question now, when will you increase the salaries of these poor people?
I'll hear your answer after a short commercial break.
Today's episode: Oil reserves and daily production of Gulf Cooperation Council countries (Saudi Arabia)
He has reserves of 264 billion.
And two out of every ten barrels.
Nine out of ten are produced daily.
One million, 101.5 million, and two billion, seven hundred thousand.
Qatar's population is one hundred and fifteen billion, twelve billion, with a production of eight hundred and fifty thousand. Oman's population is five and six tenths of a billion, with a production of seven hundred and seven thousand.
Bahrain is one hundred and twenty million, five hundred thousand.
The total annual income was thirty-eight billion.
From 2003 to 2007
Europe one hundred billion
Sixty billion in the Middle East and forty billion.
In Asia and other countries
While the GDP of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries reached $717 billion in 2006.
The total in 2007 is seven hundred and ninety-nine million, seven hundred and ten billion expected.
In the year two thousand and ninety-one, one in ten billion.
While inflation continues to devour the salaries of employees and people working in this field.
But it will increase to three out of eight by 2008.
Kuwait represents fourteen percent, but in 2008 it is expected to be eight out of every nine from the United Arab Emirates.
It will be ten while Saudi Arabia was six and a half and will reach six.
And eight out of ten
Salaries are being eaten.
So, what amounts and percentages will you provide to the poor here?
If we want to solve the problem.
Real solution
Always salaries, always salary increases.
It's not the solution.
I'm not against raising salaries.
This is not true, I, this is not true
We always
Certainly, there is faith.
In the case of an increase, an increase without control over inflation will cause inflation to devour all these increases.
To solve the inflation problem, a high-level committee comprising all experts and specialists is formed.
And now this committee is developing
Because salary increases in the world
And of course, the golden rule of economics says
It will have no end.
And whatever it is
A significant increase in salaries, no matter how much the increase is.
Inflation will increase.
The solution is necessary and must be implemented.
The recruitment specialist Bayt.com, in collaboration with the British institute YouGov, conducted a scientific study on this topic.
They conducted a survey of fifteen thousand employees working in the Gulf countries in twenty key sectors.
Especially for experts and those with professions, there is no job satisfaction.
Because inflation here has started to devour.
Especially those with experience.
They are thinking of moving from these countries where inflation continues to devour everything.
Now you will lose.
This is the simple concept, you put the simple concept, and try to implement it.
The solution to inflation is to increase salaries.
Balance exists.
He is there.
We are concerned, the state is concerned, and we are trying our best.
To solve this issue with a real solution.
Temporary solutions never solve the problem but rather exacerbate it.
Its increase means
We hope to have more time so that this committee can finish drafting...
All applications
This boredom and Your Majesty.
He will always feel bored.
True, but the government tried and increased the raises to forty percent.
No, there's an important point here regarding raises.
As for increases, you only want Qataris as if non-Qataris work in Burkina Faso and Zimbabwe.
It takes into account Qataris but does not take into account non-expatriates.
While the highest percentage is found in it.
You, Ahmed, live in Qatar, not in Germany.
And everyone is talking about this and suffering.
Much higher salaries than in the government sector.
On the contrary, we saw
In the public sector
In contrast, the government sector
Because the best units and competencies started.
I also read a report, as you know, we are in the oil field.
Work
Follow our experts.
Engineers and workers coming from outside Qatar
Because we also interact with the global market.
What is the rate of increase in salaries for all these things?
Hope is with Allah the Most High, but we say...
The government has a plan.
And I say that controlling inflation is more important.
Temporary solution
And we'll see, I'm sure.
There will be
Positive results
It will be on the verge of fifteen percent.
Alright, the second nice report says that 22 billion riyals worth of oil will come to you and 43 billion riyals worth of gas.
No comment, it's not the spraying process.
The procedure, of course, we...
But talk of economic growth must also reflect on the people.
Even if it reflects any economic growth at present, Qatar has the highest economic growth in the world.
And vice versa.
The country's giant "carriers" are also part of it.
And if there were no such huge "stores" and big businesses
In this country, that won't be part of inflation either.
It resulted in some inflation.
And this also led to a lot of criticism in the market.
Firstly, regarding the link between the dollar and oil.
Oil was established as a guarantee of protection.
I am from the United States of America, thus the stability in power.
Thank you.
Saad al-Ghamdi is from Saudi Arabia, your question, Saad.
Peace, forgiveness, and blessings from God.
It's really a good ring and a good title.
What I really want to talk about is that the region is now under American policies.
America's policy in its current war, in addition to the cultural war it is trying to wage against Islam, is a global economic war.
Now in China
The American deficit with Japan also reached sixty billion dollars.
And Japan has already invested in 2000.
With America, there are nine equivalents.
Billions, while now investing with the European Union at over $27 billion.
To keep up with American politics and make the dollar the inevitable currency throughout the whole world.
I tell my brother to buy now.
And the Arabian Gulf region will become
Place
Thank you, brother Saad.
Mohamed El-Wasai from Egypt
Welcome, Your Excellency, the deputy with you.
Middle Eastern Arab rulers, Your Excellency, remind me of...
When there is
When there are demands to adjust prices
Adjust salaries against prices as you mentioned.
In Qatar, we considered you a prototype.
And he continued not to promise a salary increase, which is an Arab style.
We consider Qatar as Abu Turka.
He has the right to say what he wants. Do you have a question? It's certainly his right. He is responsible for this policy.
The question first.
His Highness must take that into consideration.
This is one second in which he must respond to public opinion.
With the poor, as I said, because they are the people of countries that need special care.
Arab leaders who do not care about the poor.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon him
Good evening to you and good evening to him.
I want a raise, too.
Salaries are excellent and good, which is great.
Alright, thank you for the topic we need and suffer from.
I am with the poor and will always be, God willing, and we know that there are no poor in Qatar, we are sure.
And it can be judged from what he said that the money goes to the ruling family and the ruler in Qatar.
And this is the important question now.
Let's start by answering the brothers.
Cannot judge
What happens to wealth?
Now there are new cities like Lusail and others, which means Qatar is expanding.
This is not the case, the situation is different.
Suitable urban plan
In short, because we only have two minutes, tell us what Qatar will strive for?
Qatar today, there is a post-oil and gas Qatar.
There is a clear policy of the state.
Because she
Non-renewable facility
Because it is a non-renewable resource.
So the trend today in the State of Qatar is...
The capital of the Middle East in education
Today we see the Education City.
Today, this educational city includes the best colleges in the world.
Building medical cities, media cities, and financial cities
Because today oil and gas
Certainly, we don't imitate anyone, of course.
Other satellite channels
Not only the island, you will make a hundred islands, and of course we do not stand in the island's camp.
Because my brother, these are our countries in the Gulf now.
In the 1970s, change was happening. Now, everyone remembers the change of the 1970s.
Now when we see what Qatar has in terms of growth.
And this requires a special episode about Qatar in the post-oil era.
With our vision for oil, its future and resources in the region, especially in Qatar. In conclusion, I send my greetings to the program team.
I am Ahmed Mansour, greeting you without borders. Peace be upon you.
Peace, mercy, and blessings be upon you.
Greetings from Doha, the capital of Qatar, for this week.
And I welcome you to a new episode of our program "Without Borders"
At the same time, Qatar hosts the largest US military base outside the United States, Al-Udeid Air Base.
With the United States' enemies in the region
Like Iran and Syria
Its doors are open to leaders.
In fact, Hamas leaders enjoy special relations with the Qatari leadership.
The Emir of Qatar was also the only Arab leader.
Who visited the southern suburbs of Beirut that were destroyed by Israel during the summer of the 2006 Lebanon War
And to this day, unlimited support for rebuilding what Israel destroyed in Lebanon.
And at the time when Qatar reconciled,
With her older sister in Saudi Arabia for about two years.
At the same time, clashes with the regime in Egypt.
Like the Lebanese file where he succeeded when others failed.
Gathering Lebanon's leaders in Doha where they signed an agreement that led them to safety.
To the final elections
Difficult files as well.
I am destined to be the driver of these files, not Qatar.
The smallest Arab country
And in today's episode
We are trying to understand the foundation and principles upon which Qatari foreign policy is based.
And for whose benefit?
Qatar, the smallest country in geographical and demographic terms, plays these significant roles.
And what qualifications enable her to do that?
That will be in a direct dialogue with the Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister.
For our viewers who wish to participate, they can contact us through the program's numbers, which will appear on the screen later.
The visit made by the Emir of the State of Qatar.
The loud Al Jazeera channel is trying to improve relations with Saudi Arabia.
From the past like Saudi Arabia's attempt to seize the Qatari government with the help of the Al Murrah tribe.
In its edition published on June 20th last.
What is the nature of the confidential treatment?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Many things that are not
What I believe is accurate.
In many interviews here on this program, I've always said that the essence is that...
And we consider it the backbone.
I am from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
There was a misunderstanding.
Moreover,
Different opinions
It's true that the border issue has been resolved, and it was a major obstacle.
The historical ties between Saudi Arabia and Qatar were special.
These relationships, if we notice.
Between the two countries and between the two families.
He was ruined by a misunderstanding.
Neither us nor them.
Because there are no conditions between brothers.
And this has been done, and now the relations are in a state that I can confirm is excellent.
In the interest of the Cooperation Council
But how was the situation improving between Qatar and Saudi Arabia when Qatar was the obstacle and the reason in 2001?
There is an important point.
And I repeat, if you go back to all the programs I was always saying
Not only the elder sister, but I was saying that our reliance in the Cooperation Council is on...
That Saudi Arabia is an important country in the region.
And we value our relationship with her.
There was a heated exchange of words, and it was clear to both parties.
These countries find themselves
Unsuccessful when the brothers agreed.
Especially the Saudi-Qatari house.
They found themselves in a conflict.
Where there are no camels.
And I don't think it was a strategy of anyone involved in this conflict.
But excuse me, Sheikh, let me put things in perspective or dot the i's and cross the t's.
Many observers find the island to have changed significantly in the past two years.
At the time when the positions criticized on Al Jazeera's screen were still in place.
What's happening inside Saudi Arabia.
Whether the arrested, the opponents, or others are still standing.
The island stopped processing these issues.
Al Jazeera's coverage of the Hajj has turned into
Praise for the system and what the custodian of the two holy mosques does in different times.
First, you can ask the Al Jazeera channel management about this matter, don't ask me because I...
What connects the two countries.
For the stability of the region
This strategy continued and reinforced the stability of the region.
The region you are referring to is the Gulf Region.
Gulf Region
There are many cases surrounding the Gulf region.
Invitation from the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques in Kuwait
He influenced all listeners and the Arab world as a whole.
He spoke from the heart about resolving, surpassing, and burying Arab disputes.
Not just in terms of opinions
No, it's about politics and politics is a matter of opinion.
In the Arab world, it is considered
A type of war
While in the developed world
Talking about the same interest.
I've stayed for many years now.
The situation now
Listen first.
There is a difference between this subject and that.
The idea of a small country standing up to larger nations and making them feel vulnerable.
Any difference or misunderstanding
He had his reasons.
And its causes have ended.
Due to the wisdom of our two leaders.
Are there any warranties for future relationships?
There are guarantees between two parties.
Based on the bonds of fraternity and mutual interests between the two countries.
And leaders, their words are considered more than a document.
Between Qatar and Saudi Arabia to develop this relationship.
We hope for much from this Saudi-Qatari relationship to develop it.
For the best, and there are more fields.
This relationship is similar to the one we have with other Arab countries and other Gulf states.
Because Qatar is an important country.
Alright, Saudi Arabia is an important country.
What does Egypt represent for Qatar? Because what is bad is that at the same time it reconciled with Saudi Arabia.
And three organizations, namely Hezbollah.
Al Jazeera
Are you pro or against the regime in Egypt, the largest Arab country?
First, let me start with this.
Egyptian people
And we respect the Egyptian nation.
And her interest
With many Arab issues and the sacrifices of the Egyptian nation
And the state of this.
One might think that through this case, we are trying to reach an understanding with the brothers in Egypt.
In light of what you say about your respect for Egypt and the Egyptian people.
We believe he is a good person.
Our differences with Egypt are on two points.
Or a single point.
We were accused of planning to overthrow Gaza, and I don't think that's true.
And we do not interfere.
In cases belonging to other countries
He does not believe in interfering in the affairs of any state unless there is room for reform.
Does that mean you intervened in Hamas' coup against the authority in Gaza?
Certainly, I don't deny that, in fact, we didn't know as much as others did through the media.
We have relations with Hamas and we have relations with others.
What made Egypt different or led to disagreement between you on this point?
I will come to this.
Hezbollah plot
Hezbollah
But I speak on behalf of my country.
We were very surprised by this subject.
Thank you, Qatar Interest.
What did the pyramids say?
The pyramids said: ...
Attack on Egypt and its position
Can I reply?
We return to the plot they mentioned.
The days will show that.
The launch was not from the Gaza conference.
I absolve the Egyptian people and President Hosni Mubarak of that.
If we delve deeper into our conference in Almina
After the Madrid conference, do you remember the exhibition held in Doha called "The Port"?
And that was by coincidence, and when it was scheduled to hold the conference with us.
They said they didn't want to hold the conference.
Oh people, we know that you are coordinating with Israel.
"Heading to Qatar and this is it"
What are we trying to understand why?
We sat and talked, and talking is always good.
It has two parts.
Who are they?
There is a disagreement.
In political orientation
If we look at the gas conference that was held.
His Highness the Prince spoke with all the presidents, including his brother President Hosni Mubarak.
We were informed by a foreign state.
The opinion of the elders in Egypt on this matter should not be adhered to.
And people are being killed while we watch.
If you don't want to hold it in Doha, we can hold it anywhere in the Arab League.
And it would be embarrassing to discuss the issue at the Kuwait Conference game.
Israel and the Western world are watching and standing by, seeing what happens.
When we all agreed that this is a common matter and that there is no power or strength except from God, we, as Arabs, cannot stop it. In fact, even a large country has not stopped this fighting.
Egypt's request to halt hostilities in Gaza, fighting stopped within an hour.
Even we
We should not take the Arab street with such naivety, our disagreement with the brothers is on one point.
This is in accordance with international standards.
And the inadequacy of hospitals and detained doctors at the borders.
It was you who stood at the border.
There, and no one can enter.
The brothers didn't take it well.
Because Gaza is adjacent to Egypt and is considered part of the national domain.
When we talk about any human issue anywhere in the world, we are talking only about a human issue.
And we respect sovereignty in Egypt.
And we know her position, but this does not harm the Egyptian position.
We expect a lot from Egypt.
It is the largest Arab country.
We believe he can amplify our voices and those of others from the Arab world.
To all other parties
Even the rescue mission after Gaza
The Europeans tried to save him.
What happened in Gaza?
Whether it's a conference that presents this thing, I consider it a salvation for the government.
We were not invited to the conference; instead, we were asked to coordinate among the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
And we were gathered in the Cooperation Council.
These amounts will not be released to any party.
But it will be issued to
The affected parties in Gaza

Because entry is not allowed from any side.
I am happy for Egypt, and all the people in Qatar are happy for Egypt because Egypt...
Egypt's victory in political issues is very important to us.
But you expect
Just give me two minutes.
One of the ministers boasted about what had been refuted.
And anyone who harms Egypt, we will cut off his leg and break his arm.
Frankly, I think this official has done his country a disservice.
In fact, they didn't fail, they only talked about themselves.
What helped them in this, and I told our brothers in Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia intervened because the King has wisdom in this matter.
To cut a long story short in the Arab world
We agreed.
For the king to decide that this is in the best interest.
We accepted King Abdullah's decision because we respect and trust him.
But for someone to say that we stopped them is an insult even to those we stopped.
As if they were students in a school.
I believe this is it.
The maximum has been reached.
He thinks he should impose his strength.
We're sorry, we're sorry about this.
If you think a small nation has no rights, its rights are taken away.
And you intrude and impose your noise in Darfur.
This is an Arab decision at the Arab League.
An African decision and a United Nations decision
I think the main issue is
Hezbollah plot plus Qatar
A plot I don't know what it is in Qatar.
If that happens, it's likely that after swine flu, you'll be the cause of spreading this epidemic somewhere in Qatar.
Qatar is a peaceful country that knows its size and capabilities.
But Qatar has a point of view.
Qatar has a separate policy.
If Qatar can solve any Arab issue, we consider it an honor.
Because any Arab conflict
We believe that any Arab dispute may weaken our position regarding our main issues, namely Palestine and all other challenges we face.
The Arab world is turning towards the future.
Until our analysis becomes like theirs.
Western analysis
But there is one thing we know, we know what happened in Pakistan.
I want you to greet me and roll out the red carpet for me in Washington.
Is anyone blaming Qatar?
Did Qatar insult any Arab country?
I tried to contribute money.
These contributions are controversial.
I can pass by to say hello, and you'll say: You're greeting me to provoke my anger.
This is another case that means you have a problem or you have a shortage.
This matter doesn't concern me, it concerns you.
But if you have internal issues
We always say it.
Especially after the speech of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah.
In Kuwait, and I know that this man is honest.
A man speaks from within.
His heart, I always say this.
I always say this.
I always say that even in the midst of our conflict with Saudi Arabia, I used to say that
And you can refer back to all the documents you have on the island but
The matter is different, no, no.
From one part we said no, this is where we stop.
And we tried as much as we could.
I don't want to get into this topic.
To see their own affairs and where their mistakes lie
Seeing our mistakes does not mean everything we have is correct.
Are you referring to His Highness the Sheikh?
To the existence of internal problems in Egypt.
They want to get out of it.
Do you deny that Qatar contributes in any form of conspiracy against Egypt externally and tries to cut its relations with Turkey and any other country?
It seems we have superpowers.
And if we can do that, then their number is seventy million, not eighty million.
They also have a problem that needs to be solved.
That you played a role in the Shalit soldier case despite your knowledge of the importance of this file to the Egyptian government.
And you requested with the French.
We received a call from a friendly nation.
"There is an issue we need to address, we said brothers, this issue concerns the Egyptians," they said.
We want to look at this issue as a request.
From Israel and another country, we want to see another part of it to see this.
When we saw this, we told them that if the same conditions applied, the brothers should speak to the brothers in Egypt.
And we announced this, meaning that there is a responsible party who can say that we, in a sense, deceived the Arab League.
This means he is a poor person.
How did he let us pass?
To keep President Mahmoud Abbas
We endorsed this.
Is he addressing his people? Is he addressing us? Is he addressing the Arab world?
The problem is from you.
I think this is a healthy phenomenon.
I do not own the island, as I have been accused.
The island must engage in a media competition, similar to the presence of multiple media outlets in the West.
There are many media entities, and during adolescence, they all curse each other.
But after a while, they will reach maturity.
It can be or not be.
First, our situation with Saudi Arabia is different.
Even if we concede Saudi Arabia, we accept it in Qatar.
Important relationships
Egypt is an important country, but there is a special relationship with Saudi Arabia.
There is also a distinction between Egypt and any other Arab country; Egypt is the largest.
This is true, but we have a history with Saudi Arabia and the relationship is different.
This is a personal dispute between some officials here and there.
We respect the Egyptian president.
I hope it's just a difference of opinion in terms of policies.
I told you the problem when there was an attack on Gaza.
The second problem is that they have issues with us, and so far we don't know what Qatar has done to cause this.
Why don't you try to arrange a meeting between the Egyptian president and the prince now?
Saudi Arabia intervened in this matter.
And when the news leaked to the newspapers, they initially said it was a secret meeting, and then we learned about it the next morning.
There was a meeting between me and Omar Suleiman.
In Saudi Arabia
Irrevocable separation
And I cannot tell you that we agree on everything.
Let's say it so that no one interprets it as no, you are comparing yourselves.
But dignity is dignity, whether with the young or the old.
The minister said that Egypt, if it obtained the appropriate satisfaction.
Children's satisfaction
I don't think so, Egypt is not that big, I think he didn't find the right expression.
Do you have any ideas on how to resolve the issues with Egypt, or are you, like the Egyptian people, waiting for divine intervention?
Please, I don't want to talk about divine intervention or otherwise, because only God knows who will live and who will die.
And I call out.
Tell him that there's a way.
And our pride in Egypt.
There must be a certain way.
He will be either with me or against me.
And every pain felt by the Arab citizen
In the Arab world, we struggle with this, and it is the policy of His Highness the Amir.
States derive their strength from sources of power.
The United States has the resources of China's power, the resources of France's power, and the resource of a small country like Qatar.
Our faith in God
Clearly
You're trying.
But we are a small country, and I keep that in mind.
And I will repeat it a hundred times.
So that no one can say we have any sensitivities.
No one will take from us
As for Israel, you have been embarrassed now.
Alright, before I go to Israel.
How can you resolve the issue with Egypt?
What's the problem now?
And every day they lodge a complaint with America, if I can tell you about the major countries you were talking about.
They deal with us based on self-interest, just as we do.
All complaints and all of them.
To ruin the relationship
I think any great nation that does that will affect its image.
Our Arab pride will also be affected if we exchange complaints among ourselves.
Everything came and we know everything.
Our solution is based on Arab interests.
We're here for them if they need anything.
Are there further steps to repair the relationships?
But I know that there are good relations between the President and His Highness the Emir.
If there's someone pulling the strings.
The opposition between the two countries and their leaders will find itself losing.
No, maybe tomorrow or in ten years, to be honest I don't know, but from our side, if we are invited to a conference by anyone, we will be there.
Anyone will invite us to a conference we attend, and if we have an opinion, we will say it at the conference.
We can't
Because Egypt is our older sister, but we have viewpoints and discuss together.
This is all that is required. When the time comes, we will be very happy.
It was canceled due to this policy.
As I said, we respect the Egyptian people.
Certainly you are asking about the number of cancelled contracts, ask about the number of Egyptians who came to Qatar at the same time.
But as a state policy, as I told you, the Egyptian people in Qatar are very close to our hearts.
On June 4th of last year, your decision to close the Israeli office stirred the feelings of Arab countries, and it was published in the arts on June 4th.
Why do you say that we manipulated them? If we wanted to manipulate them, we would have shut it down twelve years ago.
When everyone was campaigning for reconciliation with Israel and before secret meetings were held between Arab states and Israel.
And after the reconciliation of most Arabs
With Israel, whether under the table or on the table, or talk to it in any way.
If we wanted to stir emotions, we would have done so at the previous Islamic conference.
At the United Nations, Nasser's ally hosted a dinner for Israeli Ambassador Gabriela Shalev.
He was one of the many guests who attended this banquet, and I don't know the reason that prompted the ambassador to hold it.
Because at the United Nations we sit next to Israel, and no one can deny that.
Or we find a glimmer of hope to alleviate the suffering of our Palestinian brothers.
Now the management has changed and I have a small space for the Egyptian issue, but unfortunately.
It wasn't me, it was you.
My question is about the United States and the new administration and its impact on your (Qatari) relationship with the United States, given the presence of the largest military base in Qatar.
There are differences in opinions.
My grandfather is instrumental in resolving many issues in the region.
And if they are serious, we will help them as much as we can.
We expect a special relationship or a resolution to the problems that existed between you and the Bush administration.
Many of these issues have been resolved.
The Emir of Qatar spoke yesterday in Paris about what is happening in Iran.
And you have special relations with Iran, even though its relationship with the United States is bad.
First, we must place it in the context of internal affairs because we must respect each country and its internal affairs.
Lebanon after the elections
Before the elections, Saad Hariri said on this program that the Doha Agreement ends with the holding of elections.
Is this also your vision, or do you think the agreement is still valid, or will you have to reach a new agreement?
The Doha agreement was for a phase that would lead them to hold peaceful elections.
A year and a half has passed since the Doha Agreement.
We were following it day after day, minute after minute, until they reached the elections according to the Doha Agreement.
We recently intervened in a constituency to correct some misunderstandings that had arisen.
But you still have something to do regarding the arrangements in Lebanon.
We are always close to Lebanon; you know how much Qataris love Lebanon and enjoy going there.
The first country I visited after a Western country was Lebanon.
What is happening in Yemen? Yemen is going through a critical phase of conflict and upheaval.
You intervened in the Htin case, and there are accusations that you supported it.
Or that your involvement would put them face to face with the state, and now there is a greater danger, the danger of the South.
And we suffered a lot, and this indicates the reason for our standing here and not there in Qatar.
We did face a lot of pressures, but this was our vision and His Highness the Amir's stance.
The topic of the two whales.
Its stability affects us positively, and the impact of instability affects us negatively.
We intervened in an honest mediation between two parties.
And we signed an agreement.
But I understand if it's meant to be used for other reasons.
And I was with them there, and we always stood by them in all situations.
It's not based on facts.
I see that we have no need.
We sell them.
I say this with apologies, as I know there is a large Arab audience that disagrees with me.
Dear viewers, thank you as well for listening, hoping that we have clarified some of Qatar's foreign policy to you.
In conclusion, greetings from the program team, and this is Ahmed Mansour greeting you without borders.
Peace and blessings be upon you.
Dear viewers, peace, mercy, and blessings be upon you. Welcome to this special dialogue.
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani is the Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State of Qatar.
Certainly, why do I say a special and exceptional interview? It's because...
Qatar and this man in particular was the main sponsor.
Sir, one simple and direct question.
I believe it happened because there was an Arab consensus from the beginning.
And we tried that when we went to the United Nations.
The Arab consensus was important, and the Lebanese management from both sides was important.
To achieve some results
It is very important that there be external intervention.
Too many external opinions and suggestions.
Lebanese and international Arabs, if you wish to say.
It went through stages, but it meant something.
The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
Does that mean the complications are in Lebanon?
Since the time of truth
I mean when you were all gathered and now directly came on the Lebanese line and the Lebanese file.
Did you find the Lebanese complex huge?
Lebanese Arabic international regional needs major decryption
Or is it just a simple complication but magnified due to external interference.
Because we know that Lebanon is a beacon for journalism, a beacon for culture, a beacon for tourism, and a beacon for many things.
Lebanese should not allow
The Impact of Peace and Security in Lebanon
The first problem
Externalities in Lebanon
I suddenly decided after twenty four hours to take everyone on one plane.
Directly from the plane to meet the Emir of Qatar.
They didn't even expect it, they can't rest a minute unless you're kind enough to leave them alone.
The secret is to not let them rest and think too much.
And make several calls.
We propose bringing them to Doha because we need the atmosphere.
Or you will gather them with a lot of difficulties.
And in many circumstances
Let's move them from these circumstances to ones where they can find a solution.
If we want to succeed, we must get them out of this atmosphere.
And quickly.
God created us successful with the Venetian statement or the Beiruti statement.
And we succeeded because they agreed to go to Doha.
The parties decided to go to Doha.
Some believe that Qatar leans more towards one side at the expense of the other.
And I'm from Beirut, though.
His Highness's policy is that if we are mediators.
In this process
Well, frankly
Were you seriously consulted?
With the main parties concerned at least about what is happening here in the Kingdom of Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Syria.
Especially the brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, I spoke with Prince Saud.
He expressed his support for the idea.
We benefited from Prince Saud that we
Everyone protested for a solution.
His justifications are weak.
If we rely on logic
His justifications are weak.
It had to be removed because there is tension in Palestine.
There is the case of the Iranian nuclear program.
The Arab League must have a mechanism to resolve issues.
Is the African Union better than us at solving issues?
And try to bring the parties together.
Holding conferences to find solutions, why can't the Arabs, with their ancient ties, do the same?
Unite the Arabs or unite the parties if there are any, or intervene to support the oppressed.
They must be studied.
If we want to have a wake-up call for the Arab League, not the Arab World University.
The Arab League is just an instrument for implementation.
He was one of the officials here, and the president was Nabil Al-Bar.
Requires two "s" letters.
Now it seems the Lebanese have agreed.
Alright, listen up, we...
And above them is Qatar.
What never led to a result.
In the interest of the Arab world
It will be considered a strength for the Arabs.
We tried that.
At the United Nations when we went for the Doha Agreement.
Agendas are made for solving, not for other reasons.
There is no doubt about it.
And play a more important role in the entire Arab world.
Placement
Stop him by our agreement.
For others to come and help us
Because this is a serious matter, but
Why have we reached a point where everyone is playing in our garden?
In our yard.
It is very important to put the interests of our people first.
Now we need an Arab university after this agreement to see what we will do with our Palestinian brothers.
What will we do for the Somalis?
What will we do for Somalia? Isn't it a member of the Arab League?
Sudan is not a member of the Arab League! Iraq is not a member of the Arab League! Why don't we give it a try?
We are part of the Arab world and a small piece of it.
I hope this isn't a suggestion for this idea.
Qatar has good relations with Syria and Saudi Arabia.
I think that if we are not asked to do something, we will do what we can.
But I am certain that His Majesty King Abdullah
King of Saudi Arabia
And his brother, President Bashar
Because historically, Saudi Arabia and Syria had an agreement.
It could just be a passing phase.
With God's permission, we will find.
Despite my insistence on asking, could you play a role in this scene, if you agree?
Even if you're not in a public place right now, you have a kind of acquired confidence.
We strive for any rapprochement between Arab countries.
And this was His Highness's policy from the beginning, but this matter...
What happened in Lebanon, does it indicate that the region is on the verge of serious changes?
Or what happened in Lebanon is an internal Lebanese affair in the region that still is.
It's not attached in this case.
I wish the opposite, I wish this wasn't the case.
The beginning of a new phase in the Arab world.
We can create.
It will happen somewhere else.
In another sense, sir, are you afraid of an escalation that has been going on for a while?
At least until the end of George Bush's presidency.
I have no doubt that I still have ongoing concerns about Palestine now with the Gaza issue.
I want to ask
We need something else.
He asked me to pay attention to the humanitarian aspect in Palestine.
We cannot supply them with medicines.
No food.
Electricity for the patient in the hospital.
He dies when the power cuts out.
I wish
For the Arab League to approve an amount for this food and medicine issue, we call it food and medicine.
We don't want the Red Crescent to deliver it.
Let the Red Cross deliver it.
But sorry, the Arab side is committed to this Israeli siege.
I don't want to go into details, I'm just saying that as Arabs, we should deliver medicine and food even if we disagree with Hamas.
Saudi Arabia made a tremendous effort and pledged at the Holy Kaaba.
Because this difference will only serve the other party.
Don't deal with this party because we will find a solution for you.
And I
So far, I have no signs of a solution.
Are you afraid of or expecting an Iranian-American meeting in the near future?
Of course, this is possible.
At least I'm talking about Qatar.
Iran is an important neighbor of ours.
We may not agree with all of their policies, or they may not agree with our policies in Qatar.
For example, they tell us that we don't want you to have relations or ties with Israel.
Some might consider you an integral part of it due to the American bases located there.
We know how to handle this.
Some said that the visit of the Emir of Qatar to Saudi Arabia
He may meet, consult, or talk with the Saudi host.
In Istanbul: Negotiations between Syria and Israel
And I can say it was sheer coincidence.
The second subject was one that the Saudi kingdom was keen to find a solution to, and the communication was with Prince Saud.
What happened in the past few hours
Change tactics, change negotiation tactics.
From your side or from other sides
We are responsible for
And we came from all sides and locked ourselves in the room.
Finally, we found ourselves... and then His Highness's intervention was very important.
And through it, the intervention is made.
Now it's done without saying.
And his message was clear when he said, "We know our size, our place, our role, and so on," as if he...
He wanted to take a role without provoking any other party.
Whether it is Arab, national, or regional.
But nevertheless
I became responsible.
Did you want that or not?
We try to prevent some jealousy because we are a nation.
These countries.
He can do that.
I believe this will be the profitable composition.
The final question is about your relationship with Washington. Is it long-term, ordinary, or special?
I can say that our relationship with Washington is good.
That doesn't mean we don't have different views in cases.
But this is our right. If they talk about democracy, this is democracy.
How can it be good? How can you explain it on earth?
If we talk about the economy, it's excellent. If we talk about education, it's excellent.
As for health, but if we talk about politics, I can say it's good.
Your opinion is clear for the next stage.
In my opinion, let's set aside confronting Israel.
And if we want to stop the display in the Arab court
And repair the enmity between the Palestinians.
We agree on one opinion so that we are a respected force.
I don't think we have
To be effective
Thank you, dear viewers, for watching. We'll meet again, God willing. Best regards.
Welcome to our followers in this conversation with the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar, His Excellency Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani.
In this dialogue
We attempt to explore the political reality of the Arabs and their Arab efforts.
Happiness Sheikh William.
To understand what's happening in Gaza.
And I hope that through this dialogue we will be able to
Shedding light on some of your questions
The brutal Israeli incursion into Gaza
Our goal was to achieve a unified Arab stance.
Dealing with friendly nations
Sister countries
And how can a clear and strong Arab position be found that Arab states...
And then, we find areas for reconciliation.
From our perspective, we know that more than one Arab country has been violated.
In a demeaning manner
And no one was punished while
We are punished for everything, whether it is intentional or not.
We are the specialized people.
In the world, they are the only ones who are always targeted.
Always disciplined in a way.
I think
To the extent that we won't be able to
Gathering at the leadership level
Halting the disciplinary campaign
We didn't want to create a rift in the Arab world.
And there were five other verbal agreements.
By a two-thirds majority
But the purpose of the meeting is not
Where they wish it to be true and our perspective false because the goal...
He is solving the problem, not holding a summit.
But will it be solved at the expense of Palestinian blood?
What we are asking for now is for the ministry not to cancel Qatar's request.
And which His Highness also confirmed.
In the speech he delivered, we do not insist on it being in Qatar if it will cause any embarrassment, we do not insist on holding the summit in Qatar, it can be anywhere else.
An Arab stance that earns us respect from others.
Yes, and ministerial.
We want to inform them that the Security Council resolution has been issued.
and Israel
He was not involved in the decision, and the killing and bombing in Gaza continued and still does.
And I need to ask the Arab what we will do about it.
What will we do?
Is it when Israel ends?
To implement the remaining Security Council resolution
Or a stand will be taken because Israel has not stopped.
Archery, we don't force our brothers.
To a decision that is considered final.
A few days ago
We will discuss the ministers' meeting.
You'll support this eventually.
Certainly, we support holding an Arab summit, and this was our idea as well. Some other countries also requested the summit, including Syria and Yemen.
An excellent Arabic speaker is already there.
Or they classified us in the camp of moderation.
And the camp of immoderation
What is meant by "immoderation"?
It was arranged by the West.
Moderate and non-moderate Arabs
You will not find an organized nation or a disorganized nation.
And we want to know what is moderation and what is immoderation, what does moderation mean in following Israel's plans?
And it ends in a humiliating way.
Or we just need to leave the case open.
I mean, this is an important question.
Are these the countries?
They follow Israel's plans and want to solve problems in their own ways.
I don't want to say that he follows Israeli plans, and I don't want to accuse anyone.
But I say
If we name a camp "Moderation"
What is moderation in the West?
Do we agree to slaughter a certain category of Palestinians?
Certainly, the elections took place.
I am neither for nor against Hamas, but I am talking about an existing reality.
The reality is that there exists
Idea
What some people call radical action
But we must ask ourselves, what is this radical movement seeking?
Is he claiming what's not his right, or is he demanding his rights?
Or will we organize them?
And create other audiences as well.
Against because we
Internal and intellectual Arabic
And it started happening.
So we don't want to fight a war on behalf of others.
Yes, Your Highness, briefly.
Who prevented the Arab summit?
I can't say it was prevented, there were some efforts, and the subject is somewhat known.
Prevention topic
But as I said, we could have.
Vote and get two-thirds of the votes.
But that's not the point, because it's not a matter of challenge as much as it is a matter of urgent need, that's what we believe.
While others believed it was not an urgent need.
We went to the Security Council.
Or there is a decision in the Security Council.
But the decision is for the Security Council; Israel said it would end and then consider the matter.
All I want to focus on again
We will not exert efforts to implement the decision on the weaker party.
What will make it different from the first meeting?
For changes, sometimes disagreements occur.
To the extent that
Will we be ready to take a clear Arab stance?
Humanitarian aid
Support our brothers greatly.
ترجمة النص إلى العربية القطرية، والتواصل مع الفريق.
I don't think everyone is ready for this, we need to investigate this matter.
Why don't we freeze it?
"Forty-eight and forty, and we were committed to the truce, forty-eight and the Israeli was not committed."
It is natural for disagreements to arise in meetings, but in reality, these disagreements
Representing their attitudes and what is in their hearts.
One of the reported fights.
Some have described Hamas' movement as disintegrating.
Not even a little
This case occurred and we responded to it, and among us was one brother from the ministers.
And I believe that this is what the West says.
These are radical movements, disintegration, and other names.
And we do not want to be other people's men.
And so it always means, and I don't mean anyone by that.
Any foreigner they find.
"Whether a Western country or Western countries, you will find..."
Among the Arabs
Alright, now His Highness the Sheikh.
Call for a Second Ministerial Meeting
Her agenda must be one thing.
Where are you Arabs from all this, and what is the position of the nation of three hundred and so on?
One million Israeli shekels
Issued after the decision of 1608
The issued decision.
Israel has not implemented that; it will implement it after completing the mission.
There is no doubt that the Arab delegation made an effort.
He should be grateful for this decision.
Because Israel is above the law, we demand Chapter VII.
And when they are asked, they say, "We understand."
It's not the Arabs' fault if they
If that's the case, Israel won't be asked.
And he is above international law.
This is a fact.
Why did you go to the Security Council and why did you link the Arab summit to what will be issued by the Security Council?
At the summit, the Security Council will try for us.
He needs to make a tough decision.
A decision is made.
Can cause an official to lose their position.
We were afraid of the West.
And we work hard after they make their decision.
I don't want to stray from the topic.
Those who carried out the attack to rebuild Iraq in its entirety at their own expense because they were the ones who destroyed it.
Let's not demand from the Iraqi government, and let's not demand blood for the dead.
No compensation.
The exact same thing in Sudan when they started talking about prosecuting Bashir.
Happiness of Mr./Ms.
His Excellency Sheikh
A Major Arab Diplomatic Victory at the Security Council
Listen, they faced some difficulties in the Security Council because the first speech was about a presidential statement.
Consequences
Israel did not comply with them.
She will be obeyed in two days, and after a week, after she finishes the task.
Because they didn't agree with her.
I'm sorry, but people need to gather themselves.
Because Israel agreed after finishing the mission.
Do you have an alternative to this decision now?
All we did
Some brothers, unfortunately, with some efforts.
They participated in the siege of Gaza.
I am pro-West and it doesn't concern me if we have any relations with the West, and I am not.
Against the West, not against America.
But these people know the language of interests.
Your friends if you are strong.
Or perhaps you have a point of view.
And in the end, they'll take one percent of our viewpoint and say we won.
What is victory?
Including what it contained.
I cannot say anything about the precautions now because the decision has not been made.
And the council's master is he.
I participated in the training.
Yes, we participated in the training to some extent.
But you weren't invited to the meeting with the Arab ministers and the US Secretary of State.
But I think the brothers who went were enough.
I pointed to the Arab parties for a certain interest.
In this regard, Your Highness.
For two years now.
Listen, I don't want to talk about accusations.
I can't pretend that we knew everything.
If they were people.
There was Israeli rejection and international rejection, and we also contributed to this rejection.
And from here the problem began and the siege started.
Last month, Israel killed 28 Palestinians during the ceasefire.
And we let them starve to death until they burn themselves because we don't want them in power.
Those are your parties, Your Highness.
I clearly state that the Palestinian conflict
I mean, if there is
Who created the Palestinian conflict? Perhaps there was a Palestinian conflict to begin with?
Tell one party, "No, you are 100% correct."
I'm not saying that enthusiasm is 100% healthy.
I'm not asking for that, and that's not what I'm saying.
But, the mediator is usually in the middle and equidistant from everyone.
And not only the mediators, but we Arabs as well are equidistant from everyone.
But without the desire for its existence, it must be ended by any means possible.
That is by training the soldiers right and left.
That is by surrounding them and not giving them any money or salaries.
And when we create a positive model in the West Bank
To show people in Gaza how they live.
Luxury living
On the contrary, in Gaza.
I was invited to attend a second ministerial meeting, an Arab ministerial meeting, but at this time...
The ongoing talks mediated by Turkey between Hamas.
This meeting you were invited to attend seems to want to trick you.
This would be a subterfuge if we were to take another initiative.
We have no initiatives.
In this case
Because Egypt is an important Arab country.
We are asked to play a role, and we support any Egyptian effort made to reach an understanding.
But it's important.
Why don't you come?
Tomorrow's party looks like it's going to outshine the other one.
No path to harmony.
Balanced Egyptian Initiative
Between international demands, Arab demands, and humanitarian demands.
And the requirements of Egypt's role, which is an important role.
It is a leading Arab country that we all respect and appreciate.
In your opinion, are these the requirements from Egypt?
The proposals now, the current initiative, do not meet these requirements, Your Excellency the Minister.
I have a vision for the initiative.
We hear some information here and there.
I can't comment on something I don't know.
With all due respect to the Palestinian government or presidency, which should exist, we all recognize the Palestinian presidency.
But there are also people.
Those who are affected in another way, we must also take their perspective.
Until we perform this intermediate task.
By the way, to get a different perspective.
Hamas' position is clear that this decision was made without our input, so how was it issued?
A decision was made for the Arabs to participate in its formation without consultation or seeking the opinion of the main party concerned in the matter.
We only want, of course, to deal with the Palestinian territories as a state.
We deal with power as a one-sided aspect.
But now there is a split in one party and in another party elsewhere.
This does not mean that if we deal with people from Gaza, we have to stop dealing with people who are either in the bank or in the Palestinian presidency.
We treat the Palestinians as one people and one government.
They ask someone from Gaza to be with them.
And now we start coordinating with each other.
What was announced about that?
First, regarding the resolution, it did not mention a mechanism, but welcomed the Egyptian initiative and any other initiative.
Some consider it a mechanism.
This is an interpretation, but what I understood from reading this decision is that it welcomes the Egyptian initiative.
We hope that the Egyptian initiative will succeed in implementation.
Whoever stops the fighting.
I have no doubt about our brothers in Egypt.
Because Israel did not accept the Security Council resolution.
And you consider this decision to be non-existent since Israel did not accept it.
Even if you accept it later, things will change on the ground.
Yes, Your Excellency, when talking about Egyptian efforts.
In cooperation with Turkish efforts at the same time and
Or an Arab excuse.
Or the intractable Arab conflicts, so it came to fill a void.
It is supposed to be filled by Arab parties.
I welcome Turkey's stance.
A status worthy of appreciation by Arabs and Muslims.
Turkey is an Islamic country.
So this is a natural role.
And that people should follow him.
There is no Arab consciousness to resolve the situation.
Someone will say, "Let them finish the task."
There must be a clear Arab stance, and a clear line against all this aggression, its continuation, and the delays.
There will be an opposite Arab stance.
Israel can postpone the decision. I'm not talking about an Israeli-Arab war, and we are the people who always call for peace.
And we are a country that loves to live in peace.
But I don't call for an Arab war, I call for
A clear Arab stance
In the context of initiatives and proposals, you are certainly following what is happening.
The proposals and conditions set by Hamas
Do you believe?
Now as an on-the-ground observer
And the policy resulting from the military operation will now allow Hamas to impose its conditions.
Must he be right?
We agree on this point and disagree on that point.
The second
I don't know about these negotiations as I've told you, they aren't there now, they're negotiating.
The second one.
At the required sites for Arabs.
This Arab reality
We witnessed after the start of those operations.
It seems that there is a very advanced position adopted by the Arab street.
As governments, we have a responsibility to act.
Certainly, I regret that some people describe the gift of nations as "charity."
They will tell me about this matter at another time.
Representing the views of the people.
Bosses now
I mean if they want to.
At least they see what
Certainly, there is a high and a low ceiling.
Cease normalization and diplomatic relations with Israel.
Qatar to
Closing the Israeli representative office in Doha
Qatar, which takes this stance.
Take into consideration that the Arab side should be radical and take radical positions.
Whatever the Arabs agree upon will be a collective agreement.
As long as we have an Arab agreement, never.
A treaty is one thing, and relations are another.
We are ready.
To participate with our Arab brothers
If there was clear Arab decision and credibility.
They engage with others not just countries with which they have relations.
But also countries that do not have any of them.
Very important
Don't become agents for others.
He says, "Why doesn't Qatar set an example in this field?"
If this is the only model, we are ready to participate in it.
But we also want
A Qatari Arab model committed to part of his Arab commitment.
For example
And no one sells one to another.
Our problem is the absence of trust among Arab countries.
Unfortunately, I don't want to reveal our secret. I don't want to tell the intermediaries.
So this is very important.
For formal invitations anywhere because we need to rise above this.
Some made appeals to the ambassador, some organized protests, and some expelled the ambassador like Chavez.
And that's part of the disagreement.
But some of them requested the ambassador, and those who summoned the permanent member states, and all of these are films about our people.
We talked about the moderate ceiling of the people's demands.
For high expectations, some call for opening the fronts, and some call on Syria to open its fronts with Israel.
Listen, I told you that we call for peace and not for fighting with Israel.
And we do not want to fight Israel.
To ignite a war with Israel
And how will they agree?
This is also a problem.
That which makes us speak to one another and which overcomes our differences.
What His Highness mentioned caught my attention.
If countries don't sell to each other.
What do you mean?
I mean now.
The street will not have mercy on us.
His Excellency Sheikh
What is happening today is the completion of a project that began in 2006 during the Lebanon War.
Or there is a disagreement.
No, I think there are differences in goals.
Lebanon has free land.
Some parts are still supposed to be a United Nations depositary, of course.
"أو شيء مشابه." (In Qatari Arabic or similar dialect: "أو شي مشابه.")
Lebanon, I mean, we have dealt with the Lebanese issue to a great extent.
Certainly, Israel needs weak states around it.
So that he may prevail and become the one with the upper hand.
Certainly, there are countries supporting them and they are foreign.
That's why you want to remain the only power in the region.
And now they want
Change this example with Gaza.
In Lebanon, how many sects do you speak with?
And how many sides?
Whereas in Palestine there is only one party.
But I can assure you once again that the problem in Palestine is that they listened too much to many Arabs and foreigners.
And this is where the rift began, and everyone believes that one will dominate the other.
As an observer and a viewer, in your opinion
As planned, it will end in broken bones.
As Arabs, do we accept this because it might happen to those who disobey?
Say his opinion.
Whether they are Israelis or others in the future
We set a good example.
Compliance and assistance in bone breaking
We have a moral example that says: "My brother and I against my uncle; my brother, my uncle, and I against everyone else."
Now we are assumed to be in any dispute with Hamas, and I am not saying that Hamas or anyone else is infallible from making any mistake.
They all contain errors.
Now we must leave this matter.
Force a part to kneel
Because failure here will not be the failure of the group.
His Excellency Sheikh Qatar, whom I have often met in the past, was trying to make suggestions.
Initiatives to find solutions took place in Lebanon.
That happened in Darfur. We'll talk about this in a minute, even in a hurry.
We
I don't want to rely on our brothers because there are sometimes some sensitivities.
That country will take all these initiatives, we don't care as long as there is a solution.
Our goal now is not to make Qatar a prominent headline.
It was not among Her Highness's goals.
One of his goals was how to stop the bloodshed.
And stop the hegemony.
What happened surpasses imagination.
And we are in Qatar.
Do we know anything they don't? I don't think so.
But the most important thing is to have good intentions.
To reach a solution that preserves dignity.
Speaking of initiatives, it is useful to know what has been achieved in the initiative to resolve the Darfur issue and the Justice and Equality Movement.
The Sudanese government in Khartoum
And it will primarily be about resolving the Darfur issue because the Darfur issue at its core...
Help the Arab.
But we don't ignite an issue we've made international.
Based on the revenge of the system, and now we want to solve the problem but we don't know how.
And as I mentioned earlier, we always strive to implement decisions, we are the best people at implementing decisions.
Removing the competitive mindset, is there also competition in the Darfur issue?
I don't want to go through this.
Before we summarize the conversation, Sir Sheikh, there is an economic summit.
Will this summit be held, and will you attend it?
No, we will attend the summit.
We would like it to be held in a different atmosphere from the Arab atmosphere, but it is programmed.
It would be a shame.
It's good if the Arab leaders attend this summit.
When the blood of Palestinians in Gaza was shed as they gathered for financial and economic reasons.
Help with heating
But it seems that no one is afraid of this street.
You don't know the circumstances, of course I hope nothing happens to us but safety first.
And to ensure safety.
But no one takes a person in their little pocket.
Thank you very much to the Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani.
Dear viewers, wherever you are, peace be upon you.
So what is the point of this celebration and how sincere are the statements of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights?
People with disabilities are the most neglected in the world.
What about our Arab region and to what extent are they concerned about this issue?
These and other questions will be put to our guest on today's show.
Former Special Rapporteur on the United Nations Conference on Disability
He holds a Bachelor of Arts in Social Work and Sociology from Qatar University.
A Master's degree in Social Planning and Social Policy from Helwan University in Egypt.
And he held several positions in the field of disability.
She was a founding member and general coordinator of the National Committee for Disability Affairs.
In the year one thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight
And the vice president of the National Committee for Disability Affairs since 1999.
Until 2003
He also contributed to the establishment of the Shufala Center for People with Disabilities.
For the disabled in Qatar
Our guest has overseen the launch of numerous programs, projects, and media campaigns.
Activities related to people with disabilities in the Arab world.
He also contributed to delivering lectures and participating in meetings, conferences, and forums.
Welcome Ms. Hissa to this episode.
The term used is "people with disabilities."
Initially, we called them "disabled" perhaps in the 1980s or earlier.
A more educational concept when
Among those who provide this education
An important document at the United Nations appeared in ninety-three.
Translate the term and before we go into the details
From other regions, although there are regions that are not classified as developing countries and are classified as poor.
And Latin America in particular, for Latin America is indeed the region that is experiencing this trend more strongly than any other.
But the statistics proved the opposite.
The trend towards legal rights continues in the Arab world and exists in many countries.
The resources and political will can also be found.
Okay, let me tell you here that some statistics you might know about
Eighty percent of their origin are poor countries.
UNESCO says that around ninety percent of disabled children from poor countries do not go to school.
Madame Hissa, how can you not comment on these statistics?
It's largely true.
I have seen this in Darfur and Gaza, and in areas experiencing such events as wars and conflicts.
There, you can't distinguish between a disabled and an able-bodied person because they are in such large numbers.
In fact, children suffering from female illiteracy, for example, amount to about fifty or fifty-two.
And in other countries
There are many barriers that prevent these children from accessing school, even without disabilities.
In fact, the city doesn't have the infrastructure, even if this child finds a school.
He can't access it.
For children and other residents
These agendas and projects are great, but we rarely hear about them.
Except when we talk about the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, which the world celebrated just a few days ago. What is the benefit of this celebration?
The situation in the world
Better than non-disabled people.
There are organizations that arrived and established numerous projects.
Implementing a health strategy is very important.
Through this strategy
There is an overlap between humanitarian affairs and working with marginalized groups such as people with disabilities.
Now there is a degree of awareness in the Arab world, and it is better.
At the awareness point, we pause, take calls, and continue our conversation.
Thank you.
I have two questions I'd like to ask her because she's been to the United Nations before.
The second point
United Nations laws calling for the combating of systems that hinder society for the sake of the child, now for example the Syrian intelligence system.
Is there a law that allows for the prosecution of the entire regime as is the case in Syria?
Yes, Suleiman, your question is clear. Suleiman Kraou is from Syria. Thank you very much. We have Naif Saeed from Kuwait. Welcome, Naif.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Peace be upon you too.
Good evening
Good evening and welcome
If you can, I am one of those who suffer from a mental and intellectual disability.
Arabs say that the free man understands the language of signs.
And there is a verse in the Quran that says, "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Allah has given us speech, so praise be to Him who gives speech to everything."
I sat for thirty years without uttering a word or two a day.
So praise be to Allah who has given me the ability to speak.
I was referring to the Quran and found...
People attack me because I use the Quran as a reference and consider me a hypocrite.
They attack me without knowing they are at the bottom of hell.
I just got slandered.
And not telling the truth.
If your house is made of glass, don't throw stones at others.
And of course, psychological disabilities.
Regarding Brother Suleiman's inquiry, it also falls within the same definition.
United Nations programs or reactions regarding the causes of disability, such as political goals or otherwise.
Go to various agencies and institutions.
Discussing with them, convincing them, and knowing the extent.
There are disability issues and situations on their practical agendas.
UNESCO, the International Labour Organization, UNICEF, and the fact that these organizations have already addressed the issue of disability.
It's one of the programs that try not to lose sight of children with disabilities.
Good opportunities and schools
From various environmental aspects
UNICEF as well
But there are shortcomings, we must acknowledge that there are shortcomings in the United Nations as well.
What are the most prominent weaknesses and inefficiencies that you talked about?
United Nations Organization
The issue of routine and bureaucracy
I was in my country, Qatar.
But there was a routine and bureaucracy that hindered.
My work is especially challenging during times of restrictions or shortages.
Challenging or attempting to dispute the recognition of people with disabilities.
Until I reached a somewhat satisfactory level, not including it in a separate article as the Global Disability Movement wanted.
But it occupied a rather suitable part.
Unfortunately, there is no coordination among them.
This is one of her main flaws.
Survey, applied by the Special Rapporteur and addressed to States
Among the employees or individuals working on those programs
Unfortunately, we received only three responses out of eighty-four organizations and agencies, and only three responses came to us.
Do not put.
The issue of disability is a permanent, stable, and ongoing matter for several years, although this issue is primarily a human rights issue.
In the recent period, praise be to God, for the past two or three years.
The issue of disability has at least been raised through events such as seminars and the like.
Peace be upon you
Madam, why are there no binding laws and decisions for Arab countries, and who is responsible for enforcing these international regulations?
Regarding Arab countries and salary distribution, for example, the distribution of disabled persons' salaries.
Are there funds allocated by the United Nations?
Will this money go to governments or UN agencies, and will this aid actually reach people with disabilities?
The final remark, in the absence of binding decisions for Arab states.
Thank you very much, Ahmed Halabi from Greece.
With us is Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia, welcome Ibrahim.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
To adopt this proposal.
Writing directly to the Secretary-General of the United Nations
Transferred to this box.
A productive or efficient factory
Allocating only one percent of the annual net profit
I return to our guest to answer callers' questions.
He said he advised the doctors to perform surgery, but
It costs a lot and he can't afford it, so where can he get help?
He is from Algeria.
I believe it's important to meet Brother Naji's needs.
Like any other rights, the rights of persons with disabilities.
A citizen must obtain all these rights and duties.
To join the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, this agreement is legal and binding.
Fulfilling the rights and needs of people within the national scope.
Or even at the non-governmental level
An obligation on all states and must be restricted to ensure the implementation of these laws.
At the very least, there should be awareness at the level of officials.
It must be at least that if we work on these treaties in this way.
Even if there is no great commitment towards it.
Is there any response to the surveillance reports about what you're doing, and was there any concern?
But don't forget the rules, they are indeed a morally binding document, not legally.
Having a commitment and achieving legality.
And realizing that these issues will be resolved or discussed or will be in the context of a society suffering from many problems.
Naji Zcharna, Manager, Qatar Sign Language Center for the Deaf Expert at Al Jazeera
First and foremost, Mr. Ali would like to express his sincere gratitude to Al Jazeera.
Which aired this episode live now.
Now Ali is talking and saying he is very proud.
He was a servant to all the special needs people where she was and still is.
We support her and stand by her always and forever.
And I also say that there are many people with special needs.
Some of them are unaware of this agreement because there were no training sessions.
Around them, especially in schools or hospitals or in public and private institutions
And it is necessary to publish this agreement.
As a law dealing with people with special needs in all countries of the world.
And I would clarify and emphasize these countries.
Adoption and signing of this agreement
Like the State of Qatar, some countries have signed this document aimed at serving people with special needs and serving us.
Many thanks, my colleague Naji, I speak on behalf of Ali.
Many thanks
Your opinion might make a decision.
The former UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, we can start with a proposal submitted by caller Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
Creating a fund to support
A fund for donations and accepting any contributions from countries.
This means that the fund is supposed to spend on the activities that the Special Rapporteur undertakes when participating in
Even the Arab countries did not offer donations except for one: Syria.
Confronting those commitments is a problem within the United Nations, therefore
The box
Lack of commitment and interest from member states, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, many people boldly say that this means we don't care about the situation now.
It's really a matter of obligations.
On human rights.
In its broad and general form
The marginalized in particular
But for this reason, there are those covenants.
For these countries to honor their commitments, even though this is a good idea from the brother.
In addition, it is essential that there not be a separate box in the sense of independence in form, but rather organizations that already exist in the region.
What they have in their budgets
Submit special projects for people with disabilities in Gaza.
Assistance for People with Disabilities
The issue always involves political factors.
A state or its government dramatically guaranteed his support.
Unfortunately, reduce the number.
As part of strengthening
The father is disabled.
Certainly, revocation of citizenship.
They took her girl away.
Sometimes from
Teaching problems
When traveling or going out, we mix.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
And peace be upon you too.
And we can
Reconstructing themselves with knowledge.
I hope that Arab countries allocate a portion of their budgets for this matter.
Many thanks, Behjat Karwan from Kuwait.
Aisha Mohammed from Qatar, hello.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
Good evening to you and Sheikhah Bint Khalifa.
I just want to send her a message of thanks and appreciation.
In recent years
With our warmest wishes; Parents of children with special needs.
For the continuous support of Sheikhah Hessa to them
Banner bearer, generous sword from Tunisia, hello.
There is another level, and it is genetic.
I believe there is genetic care that reduces the percentage of disabled people.
In our Arab customs, an uncle always marries his female cousin and so on.
In this way and at this level, the level of disability, thank you.
Can you comment on what the viewers said?
In fact, as I said, at the national level.
I know there are programs for guidance and support.
They fall under healthcare services.
which also falls under the umbrella of Hamdan Medical
I believe within the psychiatric clinic and also the programs in the Supreme Council for Education.
The Special Education Administration, to be honest, I don't know if it still exists.
But certainly within healthcare services, yes, there is support and there are medical services.
Rehabilitation therapy provides treatment for these cases.
Prevention is better than cure, he pointed to the genetic factor and consanguineous marriage, are there campaigns?
For example, to raise awareness.
In this area
Certainly, this is a very important and serious point.
And among the matters that I and others have dealt with are many words and many posts.
Yes, there are awareness campaigns, not just targeted ones.
Implemented by the World Health Organization
As for UNICEF
Now in many Arab countries, including Qatar
And certainly Tunisia.
There is now a binding decision for early exams.
and which have been implemented in many countries
This is all about the preventive aspect.
And do such campaigns receive any positive response?
Especially when it comes to customs and traditions.
Certainly, the difficulty lies when it clashes with societal culture.
To continue making decisions, developing strategies, finding the will to deal with them, and committing to them.
The issue of early examination, for example, as it is a very important matter before marriage.
I ask if there are statistics on people with disabilities.
Especially people with disabilities from the Arab region.
Arab World
Especially
With the recent events that have taken place in the region
In conflict zones and areas of war, especially in wars and conflicts, etc.
For every person killed, there are three disabled.
And what happened in Lebanon, Darfur, and in many other places.
Not at all enough and it is not the case, first of all the matter.
Under the principles of human rights
There must be something for people with disabilities and their programs and plans.
Agenda within institutions established in ministries in the government and non-governmental organizations
In circumstances such as war or unrest
Only your words, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, were not created.
In the world and even more strangely, the International Monitoring Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities stated that the census includes...
To this extent, people with disabilities are not included in statistics conducted for residents.
They don't always advertise.
For example, in the State of Qatar when the census was conducted, I think it was more than five years ago.
But frankly
In collaboration with the Planning Council and with
Prepared by the Council as a matter of fact and in sharing with us like the Office of the Special Rapporteur.
Adding more categories for disabilities.
The things we should find
Types of those needs require all these important details that should lead you to a conclusion.
Is there a disabled person or not?
But at least
Statistics are improving in this regard.
Peace be upon you
Lady, thank you for this program and thank you to Sheikh Hessa.
But thank God I am Qatari and receive all this attention from my country.
My daughter is now a student at independent schools and receiving a good education, praise be to God.
And I would like to thank Mrs. Hissa.
Her motivational role and her role in preventing us from fearing or worrying about our children.
Praise and thanks to God, and thanks to her and those who rely on them in this category.
Thank you very much, Fatima Al-Dosari from Qatar, still with Qatar with Latifa.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
Dear sister, the truth, expectations, and what we await is the solution to our children's problem.
Where is the role of our Qatari children's sheikha?
I hope you can answer this question.
Peace be upon you
And I bear witness to what the State of Qatar has provided as a special service to the hearing impaired.
We had an early detection program for hearing loss.
There is a Higher Council for People with Disabilities.
For the disabled, regardless of the type of disability.
Until civil society, non-governmental organizations, or other communities gather.
Because reality and what we hope for, if you compare them in five years.
What was provided to people with disabilities five years ago and what is the situation now?
Many thanks to Karim Naem from Jordan, and now we return to our guest.
Certainly
The society as a whole, its individuals, and especially its families who have
I have high ambitions and expectations for my children with disabilities.
Whether at the planning level or the implementation level
But as for one of the points you mentioned, which is a very important point.
Children who are unable to obtain documents or otherwise, whether in Qatar or elsewhere.
The international convention resembles many international documents.
I am committed to translating it into plans and strategies.
Automatically providing those services.
Based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, regardless of religion, race, color, gender, or sexual identity.
Alright, Sheikhah Hessa, you previously served as a Special Rapporteur, and after six years of work, your mandate at the United Nations was related to people with disabilities.
Did you wish?
Perhaps there wasn't enough time or the financial aid wasn't sufficient.
There are many achievements that have been accomplished, and I am proud of them.
Through my participation or through existing organizations and government institutions in many countries.
Especially in the Arab region
There will be more research and larger studies.
We started with a global survey and had more than one report.
Raising awareness is an ongoing process that must be worked on continuously and dramatically.
Coordination among Arab countries
And among people themselves, persons with disabilities and their organizations, because they
But they have a duty to fulfill.
They must fight for
Many thanks
Thank you.
Dear viewers, at the end of this episode, I thank everyone who shared their opinion and comment with us.
God willing, we will meet a new guest tomorrow.
Stay with us through your messages and social media in a new episode of "Live" (live broadcast). Goodbye.
Good morning
I'm very happy to have you here with us.
First, before we start asking you various questions and chatting this morning
Thank you, Shayma. Maybe I'll congratulate you.
The entire Middle East deserves this international achievement.
Qatar has truly marked its place on the global football map.
Thank you, Qatar.
Also me, keep going Ali! Oh! Ali.
First, I'd like to say good morning to the viewers.
And I extend my congratulations to him and to all Qatari citizens on the hosting.
And God willing, as Sheikh Mohammed said.
It was a dream, and if God wills, it will become a reality, and you will start working on it from today or during the promotional period.
Did you expect Qatar to host the World Cup in two thousand and twenty-two?
Despite having strong files like the United States, Japan, and Australia, weren't you afraid in this field regarding this particular subject?
No, look, to be honest with you, I said Qatar would get it with seventy percent certainty.
Very strong
He has global and competitive plans.
We were competitors.
Why are we afraid?
But praise be to God, Qatar's bid was truly strong and deserved it.
It is true that Qatar's file for the 2022 World Cup and its hosting
So, what do you think the athletes themselves feel?
They are in the field, of course they feel very happy, God willing.
I'd like to, we were talking off the air, but we want to hear that on the air.
The moment of announcement.
Where were you, how did you receive the news, and were you surprised? Tell me and the audience.
On the radio
Then all the people joined us.
They heard about the announcement.
How did you find the international media?
On the level of sports channels, everyone was supportive, especially the Arab channels, praise be to God, everyone supported us.
As soon as Qatar's win and hosting were announced.
All Arab states have announced their full support for Qatar, through the media, human resources, and volunteers, in the future.
Arab countries are known for their generosity.
Even at the level of international media, it is a characteristic.
I went at that time to celebrate at the Souk Al-Wekif.
Even the AFP was filming there.
We also conducted interviews.
Everyone cooperated, Qatar is now mentioned daily.
Hundreds of times a day, because it's the smallest spot on Earth.
I suppose everyone will know Qatar even online.
To host the World Cup in two thousand and twenty-two.
I mean, any footballer dreams of serving his country by being in the team.
Certainly, any player, whether in the Qatari league, wishes to represent the team.
So, it's a positive thing to work very hard.
He is in the league, even when he is in the league he does his best.
Whether in training or matches, because he wears the league's logo on his shirt, he must dedicate his energy.
Look, the responsible people have made a great effort to take care of the young players, as they teach them professionalism from an early age.
Food, sleep
Tell me about your experience, you've played at several age levels, how was your experience, and what stage was the most important to you?
Was, of course.
I progressed step by step through the league, from the youth team to the first team.
The camp is known with the club and the league.
So each stage has a special mark.
Yes, Lana, as God wills, you were moving between ...
We're getting used to you as "athletic Lana" now.
We always see you as a sporty lady. We enjoyed watching you and learning about sports news from you. So, how is sports with you?
I frankly don't see a difference between them and talk shows; in talk shows, we hosted famous stars in their fields, and in sports, we also host stars.
Like Ali and the others in their sports field.
On the contrary, the sports field is active.
Especially since we are the capital of sports.
And Qatar has now become the capital of world sports and football.
Instead of offering a variety of programs for conversations, social, economic, and cultural shows.
There are different fields, volleyball, basketball, different champions.
But it's still a sport.
Amazing, wonderful
I truly wish
I wish I were ten years old now, not twenty-five.
So I think the young players got a tremendous opportunity.
I hope they take advantage of this opportunity.
This is great, Ali. What would you like to say to the players?
God willing, the young players who will have a bright future in the coming days, God willing.
Certainly, I told you it's an opportunity they should seize.
It's a golden opportunity.
So they have a great advantage from it.
Tell us, what are you doing, what new programs will you present, I know we asked you to come during your vacation.
So tell us about your news, God willing.
Always keeping up with events, we are preparing for the Asian Cup which will start in January.
Just a few days ago, we finished the Gulf Cup, and on this occasion, we would like to congratulate the Kuwaiti league.
News broadcasting is also available to cover events.
My first appearance in the media was through Qatari TV, of course, my roots come from Qatari TV.
I'm grateful for their kindness.
Deliver the media message across different channels.
Whether they are private, sports, or other channels
So, thank you, Qatar TV.
We wish you good luck, we're still on the same topic.
First, I would like to thank the management of Al-Wakrah Club.
And its fans, I was at Al-Wakra Club since
My childhood
The sheikh was here with us yesterday, and Sheikh Nasser was with us too.
He is still at the club.
I'm still a son of Al Wakrah.
But, as I told you before the start of the program, professionalism.
Concerns every individual in Qatar.
We know that young people already love and depend on sport.
How can we make sports a social issue?
Media awareness primarily, the media plays a crucial role in promoting sports across various aspects of life.
I said that youth are addicted to it, and schools have also become aware of the importance of sports in school.
For example, they celebrate any sporting event.
In Qatar as well, you see signs on the streets, reflecting an awareness of sports.
Allocating seats for women in stadiums and elsewhere
This also points to women's awareness and participation in the field of sports.
And now we have a Qatari women's league, for female players.
So I think sports are evolving.
I also think that this period of time
To produce massive projects and increase sports awareness, I believe this timeframe is sufficient.
If considered and implemented carefully.
It is both sufficient and necessary to use it with intellectual care, as you said.
Also, there is one point, which is how the young generation benefits from the league.
Everything is available, capabilities, experiences, and equipment.
There's also an important point, praise be to God, we in Qatar, as all Arab and Gulf societies know, are renowned for our passion for sports.
How can this audience be attracted to follow sports news and football matches in Qatar?
And attend the matches at the same time
Most Qatari people love sports and football, but the problem is that they don't attend.
When you browse internet forums, you'll find there's tremendous interest, especially in most club forums.
There is enormous interest in the football league.
As a Qatari citizen, what is the best solution in your opinion to attract me to participate, aside from being an athlete or a player?
How can you get the audience to attend, for example, your friends?
It depends on the individual themselves, there is no universal concept.
Some people like to watch it on TV at a home gathering.
For example, Japan, has devised a dazzling plan to attract the public en masse.
When you attend matches, you collect points or something, so they're looking for solutions, so hopefully.
And Arabic.
The most important point is that every player will be here in Qatar specifically in the year two thousand and twenty-two. Lana, what do you think he needs?
Aside from financial support, what do you really think we need?
Providing the means to make them ready as a national league and participating in massive global tournaments, the World Cup.
Time passed quickly with good people. When the producer told me time was up, I really said, "Inshallah."
Always achieve the impossible, for it achieves the dream we thought was impossible, thank God we live it in reality.
As Sheikh Mohammed said, it was a moment of celebration, but the hard work begins.
And if God wills, the year 2022 will be an event remembered in the name of Qatar.
I congratulate everyone living in Qatar, and with all honesty, Qatar has become a global landmark.
To host the year two thousand and twenty-two
Thank you, Lana, the outstanding presenter. I wish you success, and I will always watch your shows to keep up with sports news.
Thank you, certainly happiness.
Young Qatari talents
They are singing a new genre that has become popular nowadays.
But in the form of repetition with music and a fast rhythm.
And also a group of rap lovers, God willing.
Stay with us, we're starting now and good morning.
We're trying to get a glimpse of her.
We can briefly define rap as fast music.
It's a performance that requires repetition, but it's not rapid-fire rhythmic singing of the song lyrics.
It includes several axes and addresses a number of different topics and issues.
It can be personal sometimes,
Social, emotional, or political.
He is often controversial.
And he is very tolerant.
Performing rap, our viewers are not singing the lyrics.
But he keeps repeating it.
He delights them with his voice, which is a secondary element.
Generally, sound is not important in rap songs.
For this reason, he is not called a singer but a rapper or an MC.
Rapper's in their songs deal with the following elements:
For example, the flow of sounds, their synchronization, and delivery.
They have followers, an audience, and fans.
They have a unique style of rapping.
I think they'll give you a better idea than I personally could.
Good morning, hello.
First of all, it was a time when we wanted to do something new.
To be distinguished by something.
So we said, "Why don't we rap?"
And rap is an art present in all countries of the world.
So, why isn't it available in Qatar?
So we said, "Let's invent something new."
We gave him an idea that includes a message.
We discuss the advantages and disadvantages that occur in society.
So, we submit that message first and secondly it is an art.
It is an art among the various arts, this is for the viewer's information, it has addressed many social and psychological issues among young people in a radical way.
Times change, and in my opinion, this is related to the change in time.
Before that, there was little acceptance.
We've been singing since around the year two thousand and five, acceptance was slow at first.
We can say that our new beginning was in two thousand and ten.
There is greater acceptance and popularity.
People love singing and performing in a similar style to rap these days, have you noticed that?
Yes, of course, a high percentage of people.
There's also something we want to talk about, you've been a founder in many teams.
A beautiful band, and I think you have concerts, can we talk about this band?
How was it founded, how did someone think of forming a band, and how many are you in this band?
Initially, before the band was formed,
Rap came to Doha starting in 2005.
That means anyone who loves the concept of rap and can rap sing, can sing and upload it on the site.
I can carry it, Salman can carry it, and someone can carry it, so there was a competition.
We met the people.
So we started competing with each other.
After a while, after all these years, we reached the year two thousand and ten.
Before 2010, it was a system based on groups, meaning each group worked separately, and three or four individuals would come together.
So we said, "Why don't we unite as one group under the name 'Rapperz Qatar'?"
Qatari rappers
So we agreed to this, saying, "Under one name we are all of one mind."
And we come and present this thing and say the same idea.
About twenty-five people.
Twenty-five, what a wonderful thing! God willing, it's a big group.
So, does one of you play or, or, or do you all rap?
Formatting and composing.
You could say it's personal.
Excellent, how are these twenty and twenty-five organized? How is this number organized in the band?
Each individual has their own capabilities.
That means everyone in the band can write a whole song.
Without any help from anyone else.
But capabilities can differ, for example if Salman is better than me.
He listened to her and told me to change the words there, change something.
It is possible for each one to change into the other.
We help each other a little.
Or a company that takes care of you, so a formal entity takes care of these tasks.
And there will be appropriate distributors.
So that the work turns out in a sophisticated style and becomes something official for you.
Frankly, we hope for and receive support from a company that came and adopted us by producing an album for us.
We don't have any problems.
Some things are a little difficult.
So, why don't you think the first move should come from you?
So that the individual is identified on the first CD.
By doing this, you can attract companies later on, what do you think?
Almost in the year two thousand and seven, I made a CD.
I distributed them among my friends.
How was the order?
I believe.
Average, because rap in 2007 was probably not prevalent in the Gulf.
But not as popular now.
We were talking before the broadcast, for example, there are great groups like Valencia and Castro.
Let's talk about her?
They said they'd organize the party for you.
They covered all the costs, procedures, coordination, and work; frankly, we didn't expect the level to be this high.
Frankly, we were surprised and it was a great performance.
But there was little pressure because there were no advertisements and there was nothing before the show.
There were no ads or anything two days before the party.
We assumed that no one would come due to the short notice.
When we were coming in, before the party started.
That was a good point.
This means that our message reaches families as well, not just young people.
We thought the idea would only appeal to young people.
But at this point, we discovered that many age groups were listening to us.
Is there a particular song that the audience loves?
The audience interacts with most songs.
Yes, most songs, but there were a lot of songs and we were many.
The whole group
How do words express, and how do they address different issues?
We're talking about the current situation.
At least, even if it is...
Even if they spoke, before *
It must be like this.
I mean, there's a rhyme.
We think about every word and try to find better synonyms.
Alright, you have some songs, let's listen to one of them.
One of the songs I produced.
Let's hear him and see what the public thinks.
I hope they like the words.
Thank you, Ali. I liked the introduction because it included the name of my program.
This is KD and DJ Mary's program in Doha.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This lady Bobo is with SKT, very hot for the body.
Don't forget, the show airs at 9:30. Everyone should watch it.
Produced by Hassan Namma, presented by Shaima'a Al-Hamdi
The manager is Nasser Al-Maliki, and the guests are Qatari rappers, of course.
Because it really contains the name of the program, thank you guys!
I have to applaud you and the people in the control room.
We broadcast it last night.
And who wrote these words, or are they mine?
Everyone writes their own words.
Because if I wrote to Joseph
I'm not just writing this out of love and passion for singing.
I assume you need to write about the 2022 World Cup and the Asian Cup, I suppose if you can.
Yes, certainly, personally, we will produce a song about this subject.
But, I don't think it can be official at this stage.
So I think there should be some national songs.
Through the art of rap
Yes, in fact, today, everyone.
We are now watching directly.
The cup arrived and the streets of Doha were decorated.
So, viewers, as we've seen, Doha has been adorned to celebrate the Asian Cup.
Participating agencies have made all preparations to host the event.
And there will be more crowds.
I suppose they'll gather along the coastal side.
I'm sure they are ready to host that important sporting event.
Are there any celebrations in the coming days?
There is an offer from an official party, they promised they would throw us a party.
But, still, there are some complications.
Procedures and some issues, so we're unsure.
So, we try, if you meet Joseph and see.
Some of them have a song theme.
If we find that it fits the song.
And the possibility of doing it.
When I am at home
And then send it to Youssef's email.
This part of the song is dedicated to Youssef.
There's also another thing, do you travel abroad?
In this field, there are those who have millions of fans.
Don't try to imitate, but we listen to people who are advanced in this field.
But we try to be competitive.
Why don't we take some ideas and copy some things?
But on the contrary, I adopt the idea and implement it in a different way in my song.
I formed a band and have more than one album.
A person named Abdullah Diyal.
He has the experience and ability to detect groundwater.
This talent is the ability to detect underground water tanks.
A resident of Marat City
There are many experts.
Who determines the location of groundwater before drilling?
It may require drilling wells or some wells may be drilled where there is no water.
Using copper bars and pomegranate branches
Or figs, through which he can locate water tanks.
What tools are used?
To discover groundwater
That was in ancient times.
But now, it has been replaced by copper columns.
So, we place the sticks parallel.
Walk slowly.
We notice, when walking on the water flow.
The bars will open.
Now, we're passing a wider watercourse.
It opens like this.
As we crossed, it starts.
Now we are in the midst of a water flow.
And here, the medium will be.
So, in this way, we can determine the path of water, or groundwater in the earth.
And the process is repeated more than once in more than one location to find the areas of highest density.
Abu Ibrahim confirmed.
Upon reaching an advanced stage of this profession
For his discoveries to be very accurate.
In Marate, outside Marate, in Shqra, Hraymila and Aththiya.
More than one hundred and fifty wells have been discovered.
The error rate does not exceed five percent.
You need training, experience, and a gift from God.
Surpasses modern equipment and laboratories.
In a short time
Abdurrahman al-Marshed
Morning of Genius Program
Marat Twain, northwest of the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
We watched this report and promise you more reports from Arab and international countries.
And the Gulf countries, God willing.
And we reached (()) and various titles, but they have
Meaningful
I assume the presence of a large group of Gulf youth in the Gulf.
Which specific people do you follow as an example?
To follow him instead of imitating him.
There is a general connection between all Gulf rappers.
It's not a competition, I mean if you produce a song.
Deals with a specific topic.
We can call it a meaningful competition.
I have relationships, but no one can... (the blank is left to complete the sentence according to the context)
In Saudi Arabia, there is Qusai, God willing. He
He has fans and CDs.
Many companies are eager to adopt it.
Do you wish to reach this stage, perhaps surpassing it more and more, God willing.
We wish you good luck through this band.
There, upon receiving the cup, let's take a look at some clips of the corniche.
In addition to a group of Qatari youth
Even if taken from the West, it's in a Gulf style.
There are also love rap songs and a unique band consisting of twenty-five people.
It's important to stay in touch with you to know how you're doing.
If you assume you have an email, a website, or a forum.
How can people communicate with you?
We had our own website.
But there were some issues with the hosting company.
It would sometimes close without apparent reason.
So, we faced many problems and eventually shut it down.
No use, the site will definitely close.
So, what do we do? What are the alternatives to solve this problem?
The United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, and even Morocco and Egypt.
You should communicate with them to find out the latest news and songs produced from time to time.
So, what's the alternative now?
We currently rely on special pages like
Under what name?
Okay, when you search for our name on Google.
Qatar Rap or Qatar Rapper
You can create your own video clip.
I worked on the program yesterday.
We uploaded many videos to YouTube.
Songs with pictures
Song and the same thing, with pictures
I think we should see more improvement from you.
You need a place that brings you all together instead of each of you having equipment at home.
Mixer, piano, computer, and guitar
Honestly, I hope we find support.
For example, a company.
CD production
And he allocated us a special place.
We work for ourselves.
In the end, we're still working for ourselves.
We don't want that.
It's not different from what Joseph said.
We need a video clip.
And album
Videos contribute to the rapid spread of the song.
You convince ideas more quickly.
If there is support, everything else will eventually fall into place.
And your beautiful voice will be everywhere.
It's a type of art that deals with various issues and problems.
Thank you, Youssef Al Naemi and Salman Abdullah, for attending.
Let's look at it and wish them all the best on behalf of our program, guys.
These were the projects, yes.
There is also a project that is almost ready, but it needs some technical development.
Expiration Date
When you go to the cashier, you already have the total and all the details.
It introduces goods instead of reading the components of each good.
And you walk with the cart
Connected to the cart, so the person can choose the material they want.
Most projects are a reflection of children's feelings towards an issue.
He has many activities and goals.
The center offers a range of programs and activities that focus on one central idea.
We have ten objectives set by Her Highness Sheikha Moza in establishing the center.
Also possible, yes.
which takes you directly to the subway from his house
But his idea was that it's for clothes.
All shops in Qatar that sell t-shirts will appear.
That can also be done with the car key, press the button.
Identify the things I've lost and take me to the key.
Yes, let's get back to the projects the center will work on.
Early childhood education
Skills development and talent adoption
Thus, it varies between different children's skills, media, and research skills.
Personal skills, such as public speaking and persuading an audience
Skills vary, and we have a special program to cater to them.
We started with the future of media, and we performed really well on this project. We reached the end, the project graduated.
As we got numbers for children and young speakers.
And their creativity...
Do you have young presenters?
Regarding television, it's important that they broadcast children's programs.
We're getting them ready for TV.
Through their television, Qatar TV
We raise them until they reach eighteen years old.
We welcome them wherever they are.
This is also the national television.
We need to attract, identify, and nurture these talents.
Whether it's media or research.
Intellectual dimensions
Reading and various other fields
Is there collaboration? Do you exchange ideas?
In all fields, such as the Promising Speaker Program sponsored by the Ministry of Awqaf.
Our exhibition, Generation Exhibition, is also...
The Science Club played an important role in improving projects as well as providing technical support.
The main role was played by the Higher Education Council, through supporting schools and partners.
Mr. Abdullah, moving to a Katra building like this,
which also includes a variety of activities and clubs
Do you consider that a push towards more success?
In addition to moving to a separate building
Regardless of how vast the place is.
And it facilitates dealing with the public.
These are pioneering and distinguished projects.
And in receiving the guest and introducing them to the programs presented to the child
This is our main project for the next three years.
National Reading Development Project
Under the patronage of Sheikhessa Hessa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani
I adopted and supported this project.
It is a major project, which is the development of reading, writing stories, and child development.
Various cultural skills related to reading in particular
Because there are definitely different programs.
We recently moved.
We are rearranging some activities.
Designed and optimized to suit Qatar visitors
We wish you success, through this center.
Contains very important ideas.
First, I'd like to thank you for hosting.
The most important thing is that whenever we deal with children, we discover that...
Today's childhood is different from ours.
They need more care, focus, and time.
Listen to his interests and imagination.
Connect with him mentally.
They ... treat their children like a hotel, providing accommodation.
Or like a bank, saving money.
Children really need someone to listen to those ideas and imagination.
In the past few days, they transferred us to 2030.
At this exhibition
I wish success to the winning projects.
Thank you, Mr. Abdullah Al-Jumaily, Director of the Children's Cultural Center, for your presence, and we wish you success.
So that these projects become a reality and are not a dream forever.
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. The Children's Cultural Center at the Diplomatic Club was inaugurated yesterday evening.
Closing Ceremony of the National Future Generations Dreams Exhibition under the slogan "Dreams of the Generation, Facts or the Nation of Tomorrow"
Organized as part of Qatar's National Day celebrations, with the participation of more than seventy children from Qatar.
There were many activities and numerous competitions at the exhibition.
Creative projects for children
We would like to welcome Mr. Abdullah Al-Jumaily, Director of the Children's Cultural Center. Good morning and welcome.
Good morning, dear sister.
First and last, I'd like to thank you for giving us the time.
To talk about this exhibition, it's truly unique.
We are happy to have you with us on the program to cover as many activities of the exhibition as possible.
This is the National Exhibition of the Dreams of a Generation
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, this exhibition.
With the contribution of the Children's Cultural Center
To celebrate the National Day
Who was
In an attempt to calm the children
Living a dream
With the project
This project or dream
Children's imagination is very vast.
So we limited it to twenty-thirty.
Other key areas of Qatar's Vision 2030
We started training children in four stages.
Then, think about the brainstorming mechanism and the tools that expand the scope of thinking.
What exactly does this phrase mean?
Is it the facts or the nation tomorrow?
That means whatever a child dreams of today.
It will grow as the project grows.
In fact, that was the true interpretation of the vision, that the children should live from today.
I dream big.
Whether they are environmental, health, human development, or any other field
He who serves the country.
I think when we know that there are children somewhere
At a specific exhibition
All that was available through
At the exhibition, there were also guest speakers.
Children learn from them, as old role models.
Yesterday, or the day before, there was a *
There were also winners of various awards in the Gulf Cooperation Council.
There was a schedule for submitting their projects.
Yes, the pictures are the best evidence of what you say.
This is a collection of photos from the exhibition and various activities.
Here too is the owner of the last project, the forest.
We also want to talk about the colored ball.
A very bright idea, we can simplify it for the viewers, this is one of the children's innovations.
What exactly is this topic, the colored ball, let's talk about it.
Suddenly, there are four or five projects dealing with this subject, one of which is the colored ball.
This smart stadium is also named as such.
When the ball goes out of bounds.
The colors change.
I assume in the future, this will help a lot in matches.
What next, after all these dreams?
And it is attached to matters related to his field of interest.
I assume especially when there are responsible people who take these small projects into account from small minds.
But we never know, maybe these projects will serve us. What did the football federation president say?
Think about the idea of a colored ball.
Does he love her?
His visit to numerous football-related projects was very intensive.
He supported and adopted these projects from the moment he saw them.
And also adopt these projects.
That's what our children did, and people also voted on many projects.
Okay, what were the projects on the site that people voted for the most?
There is an evaluation committee that has a way to evaluate projects.
The first, second, and third prize-winning projects
The forest won the first prize.
He was very precise in the details of the projects, and the project was ready for implementation.
Certainly, it requires many administrative elements.
There were very detailed descriptions in the brochure distributed to visitors.
Certainly these are the images we see now.
These are some of the big projects.
Perhaps they don't try to do what they see in movies and cartoons.
Indeed, part of it is already accredited by institutions.
For example, let's name the projects, what are these projects?
Collect, use, and recycle.
Among two hundred and seventy-four students
Qatar University celebrated yesterday the graduation of 247 students from the 33rd batch.
And His Excellency Dr. Khalid bin Mohammed Al Attiyah, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs for International Cooperation
A large number of parents and faculty members
And the university is celebrating today the graduation of seven hundred and seventeen students.
We would like to thank our colleague Salem Al-Majed and we will remain in the same artistic atmosphere. Today, we will be hosting a very dear guest.
From the "Classification" series family, actor Abdelhamid Sharbani.
Proved himself through many works such as Hearts for Rent,
They worked hard to prove themselves in the art scene.
Especially since the field of art does not know flattery.
What does it mean?
Thank you, good morning, and I'd like to say good morning to the viewers.
No, I'm a fan of the whole show.
We'll watch a very short clip from one of your works, and then we'll start talking to you.
Are you mocking me?
Take the fake coat and bring the real one.
Go and get it.
He has the coat, he will return it.
What? Give me the bisht, return it! How do I return it?
She has already ground them in her belly, praise be to God.
I am a member of a five-member committee.
On the conference's steering committee.
I won't agree with you.
I have no objection.
This is a quick glimpse, a very short clip from the series "Tsanif" whose second part we will watch.
We would like to ask you about your participation this year in Part Two.
Can you tell us about your roles where the series "Tsanif" covers a different topic in each episode?
What is your contribution? Can you tell us about it?
Sure, later.
I passed by Maraath at that time.
Mara is also famous for the mountain.
The era that poets have celebrated throughout the ages.
When history is a witness and remains in the memory of cities.
This shows how ancient its history is.
One hundred and seventy kilometers north of the capital, Riyadh.
Some believe it is named after Imru' al-Qais al-Tamimi.
It is characterized by ancient ruins, the sweetness of its water, and the purity of its air.
It inspired and captivated poets, renowned for its famous mountain, Comete.
They call it Comet Valley.
Certainly, Marath City is an ancient city.
It was founded before Islam.
There were some ancient things with an unknown history, such as the well of Khalid ibn al-Walid.
What we are in now.
The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) commanded his companion Khalid ibn al-Walid (may Allah be pleased with him), during the time of the Ridda Wars, to dig this well.
It still exists until now.
The proverb says: Guarantee me a commitment, and I guarantee you a marathon.
If you can see a comet, you can see Mars.
Another effect is the Wadi Kumeit.
O sweet river that flows through the years.
It was enough for the city for a whole year.
From the beginning of the rainy season until the next rainy season.
And the date of establishment of these monuments is unknown.
There is also the bride and there.
Mount Komait is one of the landmarks of the city of Maraat.
There were many proverbs, poems, and thoughts based on this mountain.
Many people come to her from different parts of the kingdom.
One of her important works is the Al-Walidi Well.
This is because he stayed in Marrat during the Ridda Wars and was on his way to Yamama.
He pitched his tent there and ordered the men to dig this well.
Some people still drink from its waters and bathe in it.
Yaqut al-Hamawi mentioned in Mu'jam al-Buldān that Khalid passed through Marrat.
It is an old house made of mud that has been restored to its original state.
It consists of diverse sections reflecting the area's architecture, heritage, and antiquities.
The poet once said of her: "When we faced her with water, it was free water."
We encountered a stream of darkness, not a stream of gospels.
Mr. Ayman, there, God willing, is cooperation between the family, the guardian, and the center as well as the child.
I believe there are different ways he can be with you at the same time.
Generally to manage the training process.
Ever since he comes to us, whether as an intern, a student, or a child,
This record contains his full personal information.
Even his monthly grades, for example, every month he has a rating.
We were responsible for the Minds program.
In every four sessions, there is a report.
The guard through a password and username.
We gave it to him, can he get to it?
Yes, he can see the level he has reached, since he joined the center until now.
Yes, we have different models to see.
We have a girl.
With Mr. Ibrahim, who will join us later,
We'll see different models, I wish we had enough space.
However, we brought a model of a girl.
You will undergo various tests before you are broadcast.
We will ask her math questions and varied questions.
We'll take a short break and then we'll be back with you to see this smart girl, stay tuned.
Artistic representation, the audience is very smart now.
If any show from the first, second, or third ring catches his attention, he'll use the remote.
He won't bother, he has twenty thousand other chains.
Correct, the Twenty Thousand series, that's right.
Twenty thousand rings. There are people who don't do that, they focus on one job.
He can see other works.
This is how it is, this is the majority.
He claims that I only watch TV during Ramadan.
Certainly, we welcome you among us, a very dear and highly honored guest, Abdel Hamid Charshani.
Would you like to say something to the viewers, or to your fans who love you? Of course, I am one of your fans.
Do you want to say something?
And I say to them, "Happy New Year!"
It's true that we don't go out much, we don't show up much, and we don't act frequently for that reason, I've mentioned the reason before.
What's to come will be better.
Insha'Allah, we wish you every success in this year's endeavors.
If God wills, we will conduct another interview with you so that we can talk about those plays.
Everything leads to the other.
Because fashion shows are very popular among many people and are anticipated by trend enthusiasts.
Welcome, dear viewers, to our live broadcast on Doha Morning. We are on air with you now.
Certainly, we are talking today about the Skills Development Center and a group of students enrolled in this center.
This center offers a variety of different sciences.
Certainly, they focus on developing other potentials.
And also to fully activate their minds.
Mrs. Nesma and Mr. Ayman Khogali, CEO of the Skills Development Center.
Hello, good morning.
Welcome!
And with us is the beautiful Omania, good morning Omania.
Good morning.
How old are you, dear?
I am in the seventh grade.
God willing, we wish you all the best.
What things are presented to our sons and daughters?
This was clarified with Mr. Ayman and Ms. Nesma, and it was specifically directed towards the benefit of our children.
The program that deals with mental math.
Finger counting and abacus.
To achieve certain specific goals, we tried to show a small part of it.
Did you really feel, Mr. Ibrahim, that there was a difference between the student on his first two days?
And after he completes maybe three or four months?
Whether taught in public, private, or even independent schools,
Basically, the program scientifically works on specific methods.
After completing the first level of the program,
that reveal missing capabilities or the need for further development
Has he reached a certain level or what updates have occurred to the child?
So, we work on a scientific method, a scientific program.
Not all methods and mechanisms are applied in a routine manner;
But in a scientific and systematic way.
Before starting the program and after finishing it, complete these courses or levels he has passed.
Mr. Ibrahim is with us now, as you can see from our followers, Omnia is one of the students who registered in this center.
We wanted to do this right away to show our viewers the importance of these matters.
If you're going to return the bisht, I have no objection.
So this is a very fast clip and a very small part of the "Classification" series, of which we will watch the second part.
But as we have seen, this part of the series complements the first part.
Can you tell us a bit about your roles in the "Tsanif" series, where each episode tackles a different topic?
Focus this year on the fact that it will be.
Jafel Fadel
Encouraging through providing opportunities
Sixteen episodes in Season 2.
He will be a director in an episode, an episode in which he will be an old man and another episode in which he will be a baker.
So, it's a set of rings.
Mr. Ghanem Al-Sulaiti is from Qatar.
We have representatives from Qatar.
Many actors that I don't remember right now. Of course, we have actresses from Bahrain such as Zahra Arafat, Ibtesam Abdullah.
We have
Faisal Rashid and Muhammad Adel.
Flew, of course
Without Tara, the young actors won't perform.
We now have little work in Qatar. There are two jobs a year.
Qatar TV also produces drama works, can we say that too?
Qatar Channel provides an executive television product.
Qatar TV has expressed the best it has, but with one production per year, all Qatari actors want to work.
And that was the reason.
I've answered you. It's just one series, and all Qatari actors want to work on it.
So, if someone finds a scene, they should thank God.
Thank God for everything.
Let's go back to your roots then.
Certainly, I'd like to thank him a lot.
I consult him on various matters.
Certainly, actor Abdulaziz Jasim from the series "Human Judgment," after the dispersion even yes or no.
In his plays, we started working with him in theater when he became the first executive producer. Abdulaziz Jassim, we worked with him in television and theater.
So he is the one who adopted us, taught us, and brought us up.
Then came Mr. Ghanem in his life story, as he did his best in winning the Tosh 2000.
Because it gives us opportunities as youth.
They have between thirty and twenty-three working days a year.
We have two jobs a year, so thank you, thank you, Tara.
The deathly feeling is also produced by the arts of Tara.
The chain manager is Mr. Monir %PW.
We return to you, dear viewers, and today we will talk about contemplative medicine.
The message is by hand, the hand of a human.
This treatment has actually been practiced since ancient times.
We have a guest with us.
The testing method is as follows.
The swelling increases, the degree of pain.
You can feel something like sand or ruptured veins inside the hand.
Relax your hand.
My brother Sabhi has nervous tension.
You feel pressured and have a bit of stress, stress.
Left side.
Now, dear viewers, we are examining the left side of his body.
So they know what we're doing.
Any health issue will be apparent, we now know about his headaches and dizziness.
Is there any pain here?
Pain means trouble.
Problem! What does "problem" mean in this context?
In this case, the sinuses, the ear.
He's shivering. Do you have a sinus problem or any previous issues?
I had an operation, but that was a long time ago.
Is it adrenal or something like that?
He gains weight without eating.
Alright, your left shoulder.
This is due to nerves, when I told him he had nervous tension.
Ten years ago, he walked naked on the beach.
We know that a person is walking on the beach, I think he is venting.
Any uneven ground is not just the sea.
Negative energy may %PW.
And perhaps he was amazed at you because you discovered these things through massage.
Certainly, children are the most important.
Oh children, praise be to God. This is for mother, focus with me!
What hurts him is the milk and the food he eats.
Her child is parallel to her, she will put it down and it will automatically close.
Close your hand.
Just a little pressure, thank God.
You'll find it in a few seconds and the baby will be happy. First, he'll feel the pain due to the hurt here.
Later, you'll see the gases suddenly escape.
What discoveries have you made, Mr. Abdulaziz?
But less than other problems, people now suffer from arthritis, bones, headaches, thyroid and obesity.
The second for menstrual pain or period pain in general.
She should focus on a rock or stones, by pressing here, you give orders, God glorifies and magnifies, to release the lower back and period problems. If you feel pain,()
In seconds, God willing, it will be gone.
Pregnant woman
Delivery has become easier for her.
Here or there, God knows best.
If they tell her there's a chance of giving birth in the seventh month or you can give birth in the ninth month.
Unless it's on the sand.
If you walk on sand, it's fine, but if you walk on rocks, it's not.
You should eat seven soft dates for breakfast, soft dates are better.
If she doesn't have soft dates, dates are sufficient.
As Allah Almighty says, "I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan and his whispers, and I turn to the Quran."
That means God couldn't bring her these soft dates, no, He wasn't incapable.
Thank God, and I seek refuge in God from the word 'I'.
You must bring a stone or small balls.
Delivery bed. For example, if you forget and come to the delivery bed, hold the handles.
In private hospitals, you will notice an Asian lady will come.
So, this is a practice in East Asia.
You already have my phone.
Only mobile!
For our mutual cooperation, I advise everyone who is listening to me now.
Make charity a habit and also care for others. You were created to worship God.
To serve people, that's the first thing. Second, I'm not a religious man or a sheikh, I'm an ordinary man.
I would like to thank you, Mr. Abdulaziz, for this wonderful interview, and also thank our guest.
Thank you for coming, and I wish you all the best.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al Thani, Director of Public Health at the Supreme Council of Health, will address this topic in more detail.
Good morning, Sheikh.
Let's start with a look at these activities.
The program is healthy steps towards Qatar.
Is the program part of the national strategy to address and combat obesity?
Around four of the world's top countries in terms of obesity are in the Gulf states.
We launched a strategy at the Supreme Council of Health, of course in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and other entities, to combat obesity.
For fear of its spreading further.
One of the programs that protect against obesity is "Healthy Steps for Qatar."
We can hold this competition together, making it an international one.
The program consists of six weeks.
Every week is different from the next.
To inform seventh and eighth-grade students about the importance of health at this age.
Because this is the first stage where they become aware of themselves.
In the first week, as you remember, the question was about your favorite fruit?
The second week is walking.
You must walk! The more you walk, the more points you get.
This is a map of Qatar, and whenever someone gets points, they move their school forward and their classes move up.
A beautiful competition was created among the students.
In the second week, he drinks water, we don't want him to drink soda.
We tell him to drink water, there's no need to drink a lot of soda every time you feel thirsty, don't drink water!
Later, in the fourth week, your favorite sport.
There are some games at school that some people don't like.
We are looking for a sport that he loves.
So we can force him to exercise.
The child is having a healthy meal.
And her family knows that they should allow their child to eat a healthy meal.
And Al Jazeera Academy, an academy for girls and boys, so we can take it.
Certainly this is just a sample, and with its success, God willing, we will increase the expertise in the coming years.
The students are happy and feel more energetic.
We need more games, we had so much fun with our peers.
The girls say their skin has improved now, and acne has decreased.
This is it, this is it and it becomes conscious.
Parents know about their children.
And their classmates in the different classes ask them how they are doing and learn from their classmates.
Praise be to God, the word is spreading that many schools are eager to participate next year.
Insha'Allah.
Qtel was the official sponsor in supporting this.
We had the Aspire zone which provided sports competitions and awareness.
On the dining table.
So thank God for these many authorities, some of which I have mentioned and some of which I have omitted.
But praise be to God, everyone got a share.
And otherwise, the brothers did it in the form of separate lessons, or curricula, or
There was variety.
We tried doing different kinds and involving as many people as possible.
It's the next generation.
To spread this experience as widely as possible in Qatar.
When you assess, there are things that need to be fixed.
After its spread now and achieving satisfactory results,
God willing, we will spread because there are people asking us why we weren't there.
Eat healthy food and get to it, you won't have a problem.
When we are at this age, when it starts from a young age, it will reach what it wants by the age of twenty or twenty-five.
Dear Sir/Madam, you mentioned a series of titles, and each group has a title.
If we return, we'll try in our segment today to talk about closing events.
And when we mentioned people again in our program, we had more than one guest.
Let's repeat, what information do we want to provide to the students every week?
Alright, first thing, of course, the first week is your favorite fruit.
Every page was about fruits and their benefits.
What are the benefits of fruits rich in vitamin C?
Therefore, he starts to like some fruits, not all fruits are his enemies.
He might be allergic to one or two, but why doesn't he eat the rest?
The second week is walking; people think that walking is only for the elderly, and why should young people walk?
That means when I'm older, I'll walk.
On the contrary, you walk because it relaxes your mind and brain.
This helps to alleviate the burden on the individual, meaning improved mental clarity through walking.
I took the students on excursions.
Yes, they were all required to walk, whether at home or at school.
They earn their points through the class coach.
What they used to walk through daily.
This was an event, people marched, the girls' school marched.
We want them to like this, being creative with unique ideas.
The spirit of competition and teachers should think outside the box; we don't want to give them ideas they should stick to.
Everyone has their skill in this point.
Certainly, the third week is about drinking water. We constantly try to encourage them to drink water so they don't feel thirsty and want to drink soda.
Certainly, the fourth week is your favorite sport.
If we can find out his favorite sport and help him with it.
He will be interested in sports.
His love for sports is manifested in practicing them, he plays sports unconsciously.
We said previously that we would talk about the Qatari Multiple Sclerosis Society.
Let me welcome our guest for today's show, who is with us in the studio.
Thank you.
We are happy to have you here at this exhibition.
And part of it is this disease that some of us may not have heard of.
Initially, as the Egyptians say, we will go straight to the point.
It's a chronic disease.
It affects the nervous system in a person's body.
The period between twenty and forty years.
There is still a cure for this disease, and the cause of suffering from it is unknown.
It affects the active group in society, usually the youth.
A treatment used for cancer patients, Lord, protect you from any harm besides illnesses.
This disease is an infection in the nervous system of the brain and spinal cord.
What is the central nervous system in the human body?
The body assumes that a foreign body is entering the body.
A nerve cell is
Cover this wire.
White cells or white blood cells start to kill or dissolve this insulating layer.
that lead to the absence, weakening, or interruption of the nerve signal.
Leads to paralysis, God willing, may He protect you.
Despite advancements in medicine, there is still no cure for this disease.
Alright, apart from the solution, we want to know how to get there.
As one should also have protection from this thing.
The main reason for that is, quality of life, nature of food or flow of life?
Or what is the exact direct cause that leads a person to suffer from this disease.
All we have now are theories.
Even through marriage.
They are trying to solve the health issues that humans suffer from.
Yes, yes.
All of these topics may be controversial in some way within society.
So far, we don't know the reasons.
Alright, the age group that might suffer from this disease, multiple sclerosis.
Of both sexes.
Certainly, after forty years of the illness, it starts to calm down with the person.
So far, we haven't been able to find a cure for this disease.
Is this evidence of a lot of people in the Gulf or the Arab world, or let's talk about Qatar.
In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, statistics indicate that they have twenty-five thousand cases.
Also Qatar.
Recently, just last week, I was informed of three to four cases that were diagnosed.
Currently, we have one hundred and twenty-two patients, this is recorded in the files.
Many people, when diagnosed with this disease, go to receive treatment in other countries.
Alright Mr. Abdulaziz, are there any traces of someone who has been affected by this disease?
Are there any symptoms that manifest to the family or the patient themselves indicating that they have multiple sclerosis?
And this virus, for example, is deadly.
We must be clear about this, it's not a virus.
Due to the nervous disease, the nerves control the whole body.
When giving a specific reason related to a particular location, the nature of the food, or the lifestyle.
