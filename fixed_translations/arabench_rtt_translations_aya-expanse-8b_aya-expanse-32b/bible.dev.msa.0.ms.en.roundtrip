Azariah was the father of Jotham, and Jotham was the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh, Manasseh was the father of Amon, and Amon was the father of Josiah.
And Josiah was the father of Jehoiakim and his brothers. At that time, the Jewish people were taken captive to Babylon.
Then the family line continued. Konaniah was the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zechariah was the father of Abijah, Abijah the father of Azariah, and Azariah the father of Jehohanan.
Zadok was the father of Akim, and Akim was the father of Eliud.
Elijah was the father of Elizar. Elizar was the father of Matan. Matan was the father of Jacob.
Jacob was the father of John. John was the husband of Mary, who gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Messiah.
So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen generations from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen generations from the exile to the Messiah. And so was born Jesus Christ.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband, Youssef, was a pious man. He didn't want to humiliate her publicly. So he planned to divorce her quietly.
But while he was pondering these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
You will give birth to a son, and you must name him Jesus. This is because he will save his people from their sins.
All this happened so that what the Lord had said would come true, as he had spoken through the prophet.
The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel, which means "God with us." (Isaiah 7:14)
Joseph woke up and did what the angel of the Lord commanded him. He took Mary into his home as his wife.
But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And Joseph named the child Jesus.
The wise men visited Jesus.
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the reign of King Herod. After Jesus' birth, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem.
They asked, "Where is the child who has been born to be the king of the Jews? When we were in the east, we saw his star. Now we have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was greatly disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
So Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, sent and killed all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all its districts, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had determined from the wise men.
"In Bethlehem in Judah," they answered. "This is what the prophet wrote. He said,
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, yet out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times." (Micah 5:2)
Then Herod called the wise men secretly, and learned from them exactly when the star had appeared.
Send them to Bethlehem, and said, "Go and search carefully for the child. When you find him, bring me word. Then I too can go and worship him."
After the wise men had listened to the king, they continued on their way. The star they had seen in the east went ahead of them. Finally, it stopped over the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, they were filled with joy.
The wise men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They knelt down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures. They gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their country by another road. The flight of Jesus' family into Egypt.
After the wise men had departed, Joseph had a dream. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him. The angel said, "Arise!" "Take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt." "Remain there until I tell you to return. Herod will begin to search for the child. He wants to kill him."
Joseph arose during the night, and departed into Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.
And they remained there until the death of King Herod. Thus were fulfilled the words of the Lord spoken by the prophet, who said, "Out of Egypt have I called my son." (Hosea 11:1)
Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him, and he was very angry. He issued orders about Bethlehem and the surrounding area. It was intended to kill all the boys under two years of age. This corresponded to the time when the wise men had seen the star.
And thus were fulfilled the words of the prophet Jeremiah, who said:
"A voice is heard in Ramah, wailing and great mourning. Rachel weeps for her children; she refuses to be comforted because they are no more." (Jeremiah 31:15) The return of Jesus' family to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead."
So Joseph got up, took the child and his mother Mary, and returned to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee.
And he lived there in a city called Nazareth. Thus were fulfilled the prophecies of the prophets about Jesus, who said, "He shall be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Cease doing evil deeds! For the kingdom of heaven is near."
John is the person of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke, saying: "A voice cries out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight paths for him.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes were made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
People came to him from Jerusalem and all Judea, and from the region along the Jordan River.
When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the place where he was baptizing, and he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Bear fruits that show you have turned away from your sins.
Do not think that you can say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' I tell you, God can raise up children for Abraham from these stones.
The axe is already at the root of the trees. Every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water, calling you to repent of your sins. But after me will come one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
He had a pitchfork in his hand to remove the chaff from his harvested field. He will gather his wheat into the barn. But he will burn the thresher with an unquenchable fire." Jesus is baptized.
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. He wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to stop him, saying to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you. Why have you come to me?"
Jesus answered, "Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness." And John consented.
In the moment Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment, the sky opened. And Jesus saw the Spirit of God descending on him like a dove.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Jesus is tempted.
The Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness, where he was tempted by the devil.
After forty days and forty nights of fasting, Jesus felt hungry.
The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.' " (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple.
"If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down. For it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.' " (Psalm 91:11-12)
Jesus answered and said, "It is also written, 'You shall not tempt the Lord your God.'" (Exodus 16:6)
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain. And he showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
"If you worship me and bow down to me," he said, "I will give you all this."
Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
Then the devil left Jesus. Angels came and attended to him. Jesus began to preach.
John was put in prison. When Jesus heard this, he withdrew to Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and made his home in Capernaum by the lake, in the region of Zabulon and Naphtali.
And thus was fulfilled the prophecy of the prophet Isaiah, who said:
Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee of the Gentiles! Land by the Sea of Galilee! Lands beyond the Jordan!
"Those who walk in darkness will see a great light. For those who live in a land of deep darkness, a light will shine." (Isaiah 9:1, 2)
From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, "Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus chooses the first disciples.
One day, Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
"Come, follow me," said Jesus, "and I will make you fishers of men."
So they immediately left their nets and followed him.
From there, he saw two other brothers, James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and Jesus called them.
Immediately they left their boat and their father and followed Jesus. Jesus heals the sick.
Jesus traveled throughout Galilee. There he taught in their synagogues, preached the good news of the kingdom of God, and healed every disease and every affliction among the people.
His fame spread throughout Syria. People brought to him all who were sick with various diseases. Some suffered from severe pains. Others were possessed by demons. Some were convulsing violently. Others were completely paralyzed. Jesus healed them all.
A large crowd followed him. Some people came from Galilee, and from an area known as the Ten Towns, and from Jerusalem and Judea. Others came from the region across the Jordan River.
Jesus grants blessings.
Seeing the crowds, Jesus went up on the mountain, and when he had sat down, his disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them. He said:
"Blessed are those who spiritually poor. The kingdom of heaven is theirs.
The poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
The blessed are those whose hearts are free from pride. The earth will be given to them.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Good people are those who show mercy, and they will be shown mercy by God.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
Blessed are those who suffer for doing right. The kingdom of heaven is theirs.
"Blessed are you when people mock you and persecute you because of me. Blessed are you also when they say all kinds of evil lies about you because of me."
Be happy and joyful. Your reward in Paradise is great. Similarly, people harmed the prophets who lived long ago. Salt and light.
You are the salt of the earth. But what if the salt loses its saltiness? How can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by people.
You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden.
People don't light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead, they put it on a lampstand, so that it may give light to everyone in the house.
Likewise, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven. Jesus gives the law its full meaning.
Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
What I am about to tell you is true. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. Not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will be erased from the law until everything is accomplished.
Do not break even the least of these commandments. And do not teach others to break them. If you do, you will be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. Instead, practice and teach these commandments. Then you will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
Here is what I tell you: You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you are not, you will surely not enter the kingdom of heaven. Murder.
I have heard what was said to people long ago. They were told, "You shall not kill" (Exodus 20:13). Anyone who kills will be held accountable for their deed.
But this is what I tell you: Do not be angry with your brother. Whoever is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. And whoever insults his brother will be subject to the council. But whoever says, 'You fool!' will be subject to hellfire.
Imagine that you are presenting your gift at the altar and you remember that your brother has something against you.
Leave your gift before the altar and go first to be reconciled with your brother, and then come and present your gift.
Imagine someone has a claim against you and takes you to court. Settle the matter quickly. Do it while you're still with him on your way. If you don't, he may hand you over to the judge. The judge may hand you over to the officer. And you may be thrown into prison.
What I'm about to tell you is true. You're not leaving until you pay the last penny! Adultery
You have heard that it was said, "Do not commit adultery." (Exodus 20:14)
But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
"If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell."
"If your right hand offends you, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better that you should lose one of your members than that your whole body should be thrown into hell."
It is written: "When a man divorces his wife, he must give her a written notice of divorce." (Leviticus 24:1)
But this is what I say to you: Whoever divorces his wife makes her an adulteress, and whoever marries the divorced woman commits adultery. It is not lawful for a man to divorce his wife except for sexual immorality. Oath.
Once again, I have heard what was said to your people long ago. They were told: "Do not break the covenants you have made with the Lord. Keep the oaths you have sworn to him."
But this is what I tell you. Never make any such promises. Don't make them in the name of heaven. It is God's throne.
Do not make it in the name of the Earth. It is the footstool of God. Do not make it in the name of Jerusalem. It is the city of the great King.
And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black.
Let "yes" mean "yes." Let "no" mean "no." Anything else is from the devil. Be kind to others.
You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
But this is what I tell you: Do not resist the evil one. "If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek to him as well.
Suppose someone sues you for your shirt. Let him have your coat as well.
Imagine someone forces you to walk one mile. Walk two miles with them.
Give to anyone who asks you. Do not refuse anyone who wants to borrow from you. Love your enemies.
You have heard that it was said, "Love your neighbor (Leviticus 19:18) and hate your enemy."
But this is what I tell you: Love your enemies. Pray for those who persecute you.
"Then you will be sons of your Father in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust."
"If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Even tax collectors do that."
If you only greet your own people, what more are you doing than others? Even unbelievers do that.
"Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect."
Giving to the needy
Beware of doing your "righteous deeds" before others, to be seen by them. If you do, your Father in heaven will not reward you.
When you give to the poor, do not announce it with a trumpet. Do not be like those who claim to be holy. They announce what they do in the temples and on the streets. They want to be honored by others. What I am telling you is the truth. They have received their full reward.
When you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
Then you will be rewarded in secret. Your Father will reward you. He sees what you do in secret. Prayer.
When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
When you pray, go into your room. Close the door and pray to your Father who is unseen. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret.
When you pray, do not babble as the hypocrites do, for they think that they will be heard because of their many words.
Don't be like them. Your father knows what you need even before you ask him.
This is how you should pray: "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we also forgive those who sin against us.
Protect us from sinning when we are tempted. Save us from the devil.
Forgive people when they wrong you. If you do, your Father in heaven will forgive you as well.
But if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive you your trespasses. —Matthew 6:15 (ESV)
When you go without eating, don't look gloomy like those who are called saints only. They express their deep sorrow. They want to show people that they are fasting. What I'm telling you is the truth. They have received their full reward.
But when you go without eating, put olive oil on your head. Wash your face.
Then others will not know that you are fasting. Only your Father who cannot be seen will know. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret. Store up treasures in heaven.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
Instead, store up your treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
Your heart will be where your treasure is.
"The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light."
But what if your eyes are bad? Your whole body will be in darkness. If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. He will hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not be anxious.
I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you eat or drink; or about your body, what you wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
"Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?"
Can you add an hour to your life by worrying?
And why do you worry about clothes? See how the wild flowers grow. They don't work or spin clothes.
But I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of these.
"If this is how God clothes the grass of the field, will he not clothe you even better? After all, the grass is here today, and tomorrow it is thrown into the fire. You of little faith!"
So do not worry, saying, "What shall we eat?" or "What shall we drink?" or "What shall we wear?"
People who are not followers of God chase after all those things. Your Father in heaven knows that you need them.
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Be fair when you judge others.
Do not judge others. No one will judge you that way.
You will be judged by the same standard by which you judge others. You will be measured by the same measure with which you measure others.
You look at the splinter in your friend's eye, but you don't notice the log in your own.
How can you tell your friend, "Let me remove the splinter from your eye," while there's a piece of wood in your own eye?
You who claim to know! First, remove the log from your own eye. Then you will be able to see clearly to take the speck out of your friend's eye.
Do not give what is holy to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Ask, seek, knock.
Ask, and it will be given to you. Search, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you.
He who asks is given, he who searches finds, and he who knocks will have the door opened for him.
What if your son asks for bread? Who among you would give him a stone?
Or what father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead?
Although you are evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will your Father who is in heaven give good gifts to those who ask Him!
In everything, do to others what you would have them do to you. This is the law and the prophets. The great and small doors.
Enter the Kingdom of God through the narrow gate. The gate is wide and the road is broad that leads to death and hell. Many people walk this road.
But the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and only a few find it. A tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
You can tell what they are by what they do. "Do people gather grapes from thorns? Do they pluck figs from thistles?"
Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You can distinguish every tree by its fruit.
Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?' But I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'
Many will say to me on that day, "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?"
Then I will say to them plainly, "I never knew you. Depart from me, you evildoers!" The wise builder and the foolish builder.
"But whoever hears my words and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock."
The rains come. The water rises. The winds blow and strike that house. But it does not fall. It is built on the rock.
But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
It rains. Water rises. Winds blow and hit that house. It falls with a loud noise.
Jesus finished saying all these things, and the crowds were amazed at his teaching.
He taught as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain. Large crowds followed him.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus, knelt down, and said, "Lord, if you choose to, you can make me clean."
Jesus reached out and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!" Immediately the man was cured of his disease.
So Jesus said to him, "Do not tell anyone. Go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." And the centurion believed.
When Jesus came to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached him and pleaded for his help.
He said, "My lord, my servant is lying at home, unable to move. He is in great distress."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
The captain answered, "Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof; but say the word, and my servant will be healed."
I myself am a man under authority, and I have soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, "Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with faith like this."
I tell you, many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of heaven. They will sit with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
But those who believe they are of the kingdom will be cast out into the darkness. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then Jesus said to the Roman officer, "Go, and it will be done for you as you believe." And at that very hour his servant was healed. Jesus healed many people.
When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to serve him.
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to Jesus, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
He did this to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah had said: "He took up our infirmities and carried our diseases" (Isaiah 53:4). The cost of following Jesus.
Seeing the crowds, Jesus went up the mountain. He sat down and his disciples gathered around him.
Then a scribe came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
One of his followers said to him, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me. Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus got into the boat. His disciples followed him.
Suddenly a fierce storm swept across the lake. The waves crashed against the boat. But Jesus was asleep.
The disciples went and woke him, saying, "Lord! Save us! We are perishing!"
He answered, "You of little faith! Why are you so afraid?" Then Jesus got up and commanded the winds and the waves, and there was a great calm.
The disciples were amazed and asked, "Who is this man? Even the winds and waves obey him!" Jesus heals two men possessed by demons.
Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake in the region of the Gadarenes. Two men possessed by demons approached Him. They had come out of the tombs, and they were so violent that no one could pass by.
"Son of God, what do you want with us?" they cried. "Have you come to punish us before our time of reckoning?"
Not far away, a large herd of pigs was feeding.
And the demons begged Jesus, saying, "If you cast us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go." And the unclean spirits came out of the men and entered into the swine. And the herd ran violently down the steep place into the lake, and were drowned in the water.
Those who were tending the pigs fled. They went into the town and told everyone everything. They told the people what had happened to the men who had been possessed by the evil spirits.
Then the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk.
Jesus got into the boat, crossed to the other side of the lake, and arrived at his hometown.
Some men came to him, bringing a paralyzed man on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
Then some of the religious scholars said to themselves, "This man is saying something very evil!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he said, "Why do you have evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say "Your sins are forgiven" or to say "Get up and walk"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he spoke to the man who could not walk. "Get up," he said to him. "Take your mat and go to your house."
The man stood up and went home.
When the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe. They praised God for giving such authority to men. Jesus chooses when.
As Jesus was walking away, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. Jesus said to him, "Follow me." So Matthew got up and followed Jesus.
Later, Jesus ate dinner at Matthew's house. Many tax collectors and sinners came. They ate with Jesus and his disciples.
The Pharisees saw this and asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this and said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick."
Go and learn what it means, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice" (Hosea 6:6). I did not come to follow those who think they are right with God, but I came to follow sinners. "Jesus asks about fasting"
One day the disciples of John came and said to Jesus, "We and the Pharisees fast, so why do your disciples not fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
People do not sew a new patch on an old garment. The new piece will wear out from the old one. That will make the holes worse.
People do not pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the wineskins will burst, the wine will spill, and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins. In this way, both are preserved. (A Dead Girl and a Suffering Woman)
As Jesus was saying this, a synagogue leader came and knelt before him, saying, "My daughter has just died. But come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
Jesus rose and went with him. So did his disciples.
At that moment, a woman approached Jesus from behind. She had been suffering from a discharge of blood for twelve years. She touched the hem of his garment.
I thought: "All I need is to touch his clothes. Then I'll be healed."
Then Jesus looked up and saw a woman standing there who had been ill for twelve years. "Do not weep," he said to her, "for your faith has saved you." At once her body was healed, and she could see.
When Jesus entered the ruler's house, he saw the flute players there. And he saw the noisy crowds.
He said, "Go. The girl is not dead. She is sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After the crowd was led out, Jesus entered, took the girl by the hand, and she arose.
The news about what Jesus had done spread all over the region. Jesus heals two blind men.
And Jesus went from there, and two blind men followed him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus entered the house, the blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They answered, "Yes, Lord."
Then he touched their eyes and said, "Your faith has healed you."
They could see again. Jesus strictly warned them, saying, "Make sure that no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They talked about it everywhere in that area.
As they were going out, another man who was possessed by a demon was brought to Jesus. He was unable to speak.
When the demon had been driven out, the man spoke. The crowd was amazed. They said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel before."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons." Only a few were working.
Jesus went through all the cities and villages. He taught in their synagogues. He preached the gospel of the kingdom. And healed every disease and every weakness.
When he saw the crowds, he felt deep compassion for them. They were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few.
Therefore pray to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.
Jesus sends the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
Here are the names of the twelve apostles. First, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then, James the son of Zebedee and his brother John.
Then Philip and Peter, also Thomas and Matthew the tax collector. Two others are James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus.
The last two are Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas was the one who later betrayed Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent out the twelve, instructing them, "Do not go among the Gentiles, and do not enter any town of the Samaritans."
Instead, go to the people of Israel. They are like lost sheep.
As you go, proclaim this message: "The kingdom of heaven is near."
Healed the sick. Raised the dead. Cleansed those with leprosy. Cast out demons. You received freely, give freely.
Do not carry any gold, silver, or copper in your belts.
Don't take a bag for the trip. Don't take extra clothes or sandals or walking sticks. The worker must be provided with what he needs.
When you enter a city or village, look for someone willing to receive you. Stay in that person's home until you leave.
When you enter a house, greet its inhabitants.
If that house welcomes you, bless it with peace. If not, do not bless it.
Some people may not welcome you or listen to your words. If they don't, shake the dust off your feet as you leave that house or town.
What I am about to tell you is true. On the day of reckoning, it will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah than for that city.
I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.
Beware! The men will deliver you to the local courts. They will whip you in their churches.
You will be made rulers and kings because of Me. You will be witnesses against them and even against the non-Jews.
But when they arrest you, don't worry about what you'll say or how you'll say it. At that time, the right words will be given to you.
It is not you who will be speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.
Brothers will hand over their brothers to be killed. Fathers will hand over their children. Children will rise up against their parents and kill them.
Everyone will hate you because of me, but whoever stands firm to the end will be saved.
"If people attack you in one place, flee to another. What I am telling you is the truth. You will not complete your journey through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes."
The student is not better than his teacher. And the slave is not better than his master.
It is enough for the student to be like his teacher. And it is enough for the slave to be like his master. If the head of the house is called Beelzebub, what do the others who live there expect?
So do not fear your enemies. Everything hidden will be revealed. Everything buried will be dug up.
What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, shout from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Aren't two sparrows sold for a farthing? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father's knowledge.
He even counts every hair on your head!
So do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.
What about someone who says in front of others that he knows me? I will also say in front of my Father in heaven that I know him.
But what about someone who says in front of others that he doesn't know me? I will say in front of my Father in heaven that I don't know him.
Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
I have come to set "sons against their fathers, and daughters against their mothers, and daughters-in-law against their mothers-in-law."
A man's enemies will be those of his own household. (Micah 7:6)
He who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. And he who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
"And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me."
If anyone finds his life, he will lose it. And if anyone loses his life because of me, he will find it.
Whoever welcomes you welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.
If someone receives a prophet as a prophet, they will get the reward of a prophet. And if someone receives a righteous person as a righteous person, they will get the reward of a righteous person.
If someone gives a small child who follows me a cup of cold water, what will happen? What I am about to tell you is true. He will surely be rewarded.
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus finished teaching his twelve disciples. Then he moved on to teach and preach in the cities of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Jesus had done, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked Jesus, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?"
Jesus answered, "Go to John. Tell him what you hear and see."
Sight is given to the blind. The lame walk. The lepers are cleansed. The deaf hear. The dead are raised. And the good news is preached to the poor.
"The blessed are those who do not abandon their faith because of me."
As John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John. He said, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No. Those who wear fine clothes are in the palaces of kings.
So what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, he is more than a prophet.
It is he who is mentioned in the Holy Book. It says: "I will send my messenger before you, who will prepare your way before you." (Malachi 3:1)
What I am about to tell you is true. No one born of woman is greater than John the Baptist. Yet even the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and forceful men lay hold of it.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you're ready to accept it, John is Elijah who was supposed to come.
He who has ears, let him hear.
Who can I compare the people of this day to? They are like children sitting in the city markets, calling out to others. They say:
We played the flute for you, but you did not dance. We sang a funeral song, but you did not become sad.
When John came, he neither ate nor drank as you do. And people say, "He has a devil."
But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank, and they say, "Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!" Yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds." Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the deeds of power done in you
Jesus began to denounce the cities where most of his miracles had been done, for they did not repent of their sins. He said:
How terrible it will be for you, Chorazin! How terrible it will be for you, Bethsaida! If the miracles that were performed in your midst had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
But I tell you this: On the day of judgment, Tyre and Sidon will be better off than you.
And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades. For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until today.
But I tell you this: On the day of judgment, it will be more bearable for Sodom than for you. Rest for all the weary.
At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants."
Yes, Father, this is what I wanted.
My father gave me everything. The father is the only one who knows the son. And the only ones who know the father are the son and those chosen by the son to know him.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Become my disciples and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
"My service is easy, and my burden is light."
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On one of the Sabbath days, Jesus was walking through fields of grain. His disciples were hungry, so they began to pluck some of the heads of grain and eat them.
The Pharisees saw this and said to Jesus, "Look! Your disciples are breaking the Sabbath law!"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and his men?"
So he entered the house of God, and he and his men ate the sacred bread, which was restricted to the priests.
Haven't you read the law? It tells us that the priests in the temple are to perform their duties every Sabbath day. Yet they are not considered guilty.
I tell you that what is more important than the structure is here.
The writing says: "I desire mercy, not sacrifice" (Hosea 6:6). You do not know what these words mean. If you knew, you would not accuse the innocent.
"The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
Leaving that place, Jesus entered their synagogue.
There was a man with a withered and deformed hand. The Pharisees tried to find fault with Jesus. They asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
And he said to them, "If one of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
"Man is more valuable than the sheep! Therefore, the law allows us to do good on the Sabbath."
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and it was restored, just like the other one.
But the Pharisees went out and plotted to kill Jesus, the chosen servant of God.
Jesus knew all about the Pharisees' plans. So he left that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But he warned them not to tell who he was.
This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah, who said:
Here is my servant, I have chosen him, he is the one I love, I am fully satisfied with him, I will pour my spirit upon him, he will proclaim to the nations that everything will be alright.
He will not argue or shout. No one will hear his voice in the streets.
He will not break a bent branch. He will not quench a flickering flame. He will repair everything.
"The nations will put their hope in him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebul.
A man possessed by demons was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Afterward, the man was able to speak and see.
Everyone was amazed, and they asked, "Could this be the Son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man casts out demons only by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.
The devil casting out the devil is like a house divided against itself, how then can his kingdom stand?
You say that you cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. But by whose power do your people cast them out? Therefore, they will be your rulers.
But what if the demons are cast out by the power of God? For the kingdom of God has come to you.
Or think about this. How can you enter a strong man's house and simply take what he has? You must first tie him up. Then you can rob his house.
He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather the sheep with me scatters them.
So I say to you, every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven, but the evil spoken against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come."
A good tree bears good fruit, and a bad tree bears bad fruit. You can tell a tree by its fruit.
You are a nest of venomous snakes! How can you evil ones say anything good? Your mouths speak what is in your hearts.
The good man says good things, and these things come from the good preserved within him. The evil man says evil things, and these things come from the evil preserved within him.
But this is what I tell you: On the Day of Judgment, people will be asked about every careless word they have spoken.
"By your words you will be condemned or justified." "The Greek Miracle Sign"
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus and said, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
He answered and said, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign! And no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
"Jonah was in the belly of a great fish for three days and three nights. Something like this will happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the tomb."
The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and will condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And behold, one greater than Solomon is here.
What happens when a demon comes out of a human? It roams the dry lands in search of a place to rest. But it doesn't find one.
Then he says, "I will return to the house I left." When he arrives, he finds the house empty. It has been completely cleaned and organized.
Then the devil goes out of the man and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself. They go in and live there, and the man ends up in a worse state than before. So it will be with evil people in this generation." - Jesus' mother and brothers
While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.
Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside. They want to speak with you."
Jesus answered and said, "Who is my mother and my brothers?"
Jesus pointed to his disciples and said, "Here is my mother! And here are my brothers!"
"Whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother, sister, and mother."
The Farmer's Tale
On that very day, Jesus went out from the house and sat by the lake of Galilee.
A large crowd gathered around him. He got into a boat. He sat in it. All the people stood on the shore.
Then he told them many stories. He said, "A farmer went out to plant his seeds.
He scattered the seeds on the ground. Some fell on the path. Birds came and ate them.
Some seeds fell on rocky places, where there was little soil. The plants grew quickly, because the soil was not deep.
When the sun rose, it scorched the plants. They withered because they had no roots.
Other seeds fell among the thorns. The thorns grew up and choked the plants.
Other seeds fell on good soil. They produced a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty, or thirty times more than was sown.
"He who has ears, let him hear."
The pupils came to him and asked, "Why do you use stories when you talk to people?"
He answered, "To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given.
Those who have this kind of knowledge will be given more, indeed they will have abundance. But those who do not have this kind of knowledge, even what they think they have will be taken away from them.
That's why I use stories when I talk to people. I say, "They look, but they don't really see. They listen, but they don't really hear or understand."
In it, the words of the prophet Isaiah are fulfilled. He said, "You will hear, but not understand, and you will see, but not comprehend what you are seeing."
"Their hearts have become callous; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes, so that they may not see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, nor understand with their hearts and turn, and I would heal them." (Isaiah 6:9-10)
But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and blessed are your ears, for they hear.
What I am going to tell you is true. Many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you see, but they did not see it. They wanted to hear what you hear, but they did not hear it.
Listen! Here is the story of the farmer and its meaning.
People hear the message about the kingdom but do not understand it. Then the evil one comes. He steals what was sown in their hearts. Those people are like the seed sown on the path.
Others took the seed that fell on rocky ground. These are the ones who hear the word and accept it with joy at once.
But they have no roots. Therefore, they last only for a short time. They quickly fall away from the faith when problems or suffering come because of the message.
Others received the seed that fell among the thorns. These are the ones who hear the message, but then the worries of this life and the deceitful promises of wealth choke the message, and it does not bear fruit.
But others fell on good soil. These are the ones who hear the word and understand it. They produce a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was sown. - The Parable of the Weeds
Jesus told the crowds another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like this." He said, "A man sowed good seeds in his field.
But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. The enemy planted weeds among the wheat and then left.
The wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
The landowner's servants came to him and said, "Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Then where did these weeds come from?"
"An enemy did this," he replied. "The servants asked: 'Do you want us to go and weed?'"
"No," the owner replied. "While you're weeding, you might pull up the wheat along with the weeds."
Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the workers what to do. This is what I will say to them: "First, gather the weeds. Bind them in bundles to burn them. Then gather the wheat. Bring it to my barn." "The Parables of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast"
Jesus told the crowds another parable, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. A man took the seed and sowed it in his field.
It is the smallest of your seeds, but when it grows, it becomes the largest plant in the garden. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest in its branches.
Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount of flour until it worked its way through the whole batch."
Jesus spoke to all these people in parables. He did not say anything to them without telling a story.
The words of the prophet opened the way for their fulfillment. He said, "I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter hidden things from when the world was made." (Psalm 78:2) Jesus explains the parable of the weeds.
Then Jesus left the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
He answered and said, "He that sowed the good seed is the Son of man.
The field is the world. The good seed represents the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the devil.
The enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the day of judgment. And the workers are the angels.
Weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire. That is how it will be on the Day of Judgment.
The Son of Man will send His angels, who will remove from His kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.
They will be thrown into the blazing fever. There, people will weep and scream in pain.
Then the people of God will shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom. Let those with ears listen. Parables of the hidden treasure and the pearl.
The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and for joy went and sold all that he had and bought the field.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.
He found one of great value. He went and sold all he had and bought that pearl. The parable of the net.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered every kind of fish.
When the net was full, the fishermen pulled it to the shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish into baskets. But they threw away the bad fish.
Thus it will be on the Day of Resurrection. The angels will come. They will separate those who did wrong from those who did right.
The wicked will be thrown into the blazing furnace. There they will wail and cry out in pain.
Jesus asked, "Do you understand all these things?" They answered, "Yes."
He said to them, "Every teacher of the law who has been instructed about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old." A prophet without honor.
Jesus finished telling these stories, and then he left.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth. There he began to teach the people in their synagogue. They were amazed. "Where did this man get this wisdom? Where did he get this power to do miracles?" they asked.
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother called Mary? Aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
Aren't all his sisters with us? Where did this man get all these things?
They were not at all pleased with him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home."
He only performed a few miracles there because they did not believe.
John the Baptist's head was cut off.
At that time, Herod the ruler of Galilee and Perea heard about Jesus.
He said to his disciples, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles."
Herod arrested John. He bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, who had been the wife of Philip, Herod's brother.
John was telling Herod, "It is illegal for you to own it."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he feared the people, for they believed John to be a prophet.
At Herod's birthday feast, the daughter of Herodias danced before Herod and his guests. And Herod was excessively pleased with her.
He had promised her by oath to give her anything she asked for.
Her mother told her what to say. So the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very angry. However, he remembered his promise and his dinner guests. So he ordered one of his men to give her what she asked for.
Herod cut off John's head in prison.
His head was brought on a large platter and delivered to the girl. She then carried it to her mother.
John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed the five thousand.
Jesus heard what had happened to John. He wanted to be alone. So he went in a boat to a quiet place. The crowds heard about it. They followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus reached the shore, he saw a large crowd. He had compassion on them. He healed the sick among them.
As evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, "This is a remote place, and it's already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves."
Jesus answered, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat."
They answered, "We have only five loaves of bread and two fish."
"Bring them to me here," he said.
Then Jesus directed the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, and gave thanks. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, who distributed them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of the broken pieces that were left.
The number of men who ate was about 5000. Women and children also ate. Jesus walked on water.
Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat. He told them to go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent the crowd away.
After sending them off, he climbed to the top of a mountain to meditate alone. As evening fell, he was still there by himself.
The ship was already far from the shore. The waves were crashing against it violently because the winds were blowing against it.
Early in the morning, Jesus came to his disciples. He walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and were terrified. "It's a ghost!" they cried, and screamed in fear.
Jesus answered immediately: "Take courage! I am. Do not be afraid."
"Lord, are you?" asked Peter. "If you are, tell me to come to you on the water."
Jesus said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid. He began to sink. Crying out, he said, "Lord, save me!"
Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?"
When they boarded the boat, the wind died down.
Then those who were in the boat worshiped Jesus, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God."
They crossed the lake and arrived at Gennesaret.
The men who lived there recognized Jesus. So they sent a message throughout all the surrounding villages. And people brought all their sick to Jesus.
They asked him to allow the sick to touch only the edge of his clothes, and whoever touched him was healed.
What makes people "unclean"?
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came from Jerusalem to see Jesus, and they asked him,
Why don't your students obey what the elders teach? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!
Jesus answered, "Why do you not obey the command of God, but prefer to follow your own teachings?"
God said, "Honor your father and your mother" (Exodus 20:12; Noah's Code 5:16). He also said, "Whoever curses father or mother shall be put to death" (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9).
But you allow people to say to their parents: "Every bit of help you have received from us is a gift dedicated to God."
They do not need to honor their parents with such a gift. You make the word of God of no effect in order to keep your own teachings.
"You are the counterfeiters! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you. He said:
"These people honor me with their words, but their hearts are far from me."
"Their worship means nothing to me. They teach only human rules." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand.
What goes into your mouth does not make you "unclean." Rather, it is what comes out of your mouth that makes you "unclean."
Then his disciples came to him and asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus answered, "Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots.
Leave them. The Pharisees are blind leaders. If a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Do you not yet understand?" Jesus asked them.
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth reaches the stomach. Then it exits the body.
But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart. These are the things that make you "unclean."
Evil thoughts come from the heart. So do murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. As well as theft, bearing false witness, and lying to others.
"These are the things that make you 'unclean.' But eating without washing your hands doesn't make you 'unclean.' " A woman of Canaan's faith.
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A Canaanite woman, who lived near Tyre and Sidon, came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon."
Jesus remained silent. His disciples came to him and asked, "Send her away, for she is crying after us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
Then the woman knelt before him and said, "Lord, help me!"
He replied, "We have no right to take the children's bread and throw it to their dogs."
"Yes, sir," she said. "But even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' tables."
Then Jesus answered and said, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour. Jesus feeds the four thousand.
Jesus went away from there and walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountain and sat down.
A large crowd came to him, bringing with them the blind, the lame, the paralyzed, those unable to speak, and many others. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them.
The people were amazed. Those who could not speak began to speak. The disabled were healed. Those who could not walk began to walk. The blind were able to see. So the people praised the God of Israel.
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have compassion on these people; they have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."
His disciples answered, "There is nothing here but five loaves and two fish, unless we go and buy food for all these people."
Jesus asked, "How many loaves do you have?" They answered, "Seven, and a few small fish."
Jesus told the crowds to sit down on the ground.
He took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks. Then he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and they distributed them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. Afterward, the disciples gathered seven baskets of leftovers.
The number of men who ate was 4000. Women and children also ate.
After Jesus had sent the crowds away, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
Jesus is asked for a sign.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus, and asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
He replied, "In the evening you look at the sky. You say, 'The weather will be good. The sky is red.'"
In the morning you say, "Today will be stormy. The sky is red and cloudy." You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you cannot understand the signs of what is happening now.
"An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." And he left them and went away. The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
The pupils crossed to the other side of the lake. They forgot to bring bread.
"Beware," Jesus said to them, "of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The pupils talked among themselves about this matter. They said, "He must be saying this because we didn't bring any bread."
Jesus knew what they were saying, and he said to them, "You of little faith! Why do you talk among yourselves about having no bread?"
Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets of fragments were gathered?
Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you gathered from them?
How is it that you don't understand at all? I wasn't talking to you about bread. But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not warning them about the yeast used in bread, but about the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter says that Jesus is the Messiah.
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi, and there he asked his disciples, "What do people say about the Son of Man?"
They answered, "Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah, and others Jeremiah, or one of the prophets."
But what about you? he asked. "Who do you say that I am?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
Here is what I say to you. You are Peter. On this rock I will build my church. The gates of hell will not be strong enough to destroy it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Then Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Jesus speaks about his upcoming death.
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the chief priests and the elders, and be killed, and on the third day be raised again.
Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him, saying, "No, Lord! This must never happen to you!"
Then Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me."
If he wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he sacrifices his life for me, he will find a better one.
What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?
The Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father, with his angels, and then he will render to each according to his works.
What I am about to tell you is true. Some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
The appearance of Jesus changed.
Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
There before them, his appearance changed. His face shone like the sun. His clothes became white as the light of day.
At that very moment, Moses and Elijah appeared before them. Moses and Elijah were speaking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three booths: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
While Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them. A voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love. I am very pleased with him. Listen to him!"
When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces, terrified.
But Jesus came and touched them. He said, "Arise, do not be afraid."
When they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. And as they were coming down, Jesus commanded them, saying, "Tell no one what you have seen. Wait until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
The students asked, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus replied, "That is true. Elijah is to come and restore all things.
But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So will the Son of Man suffer at their hands."
So the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus heals a boy who had a demon.
As they approached the crowd, a man came up to Jesus. He knelt before him.
"Oh Lord," he said, "have mercy on my son. He shivers so much and suffers greatly. He often falls into the fire or into the water.
I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.
"You evil, wicked people!" Jesus answered. "How long will I be with you? How long must I bear with you? Bring the boy to me."
Jesus commanded the demon to leave the boy, and it did. He was healed immediately.
Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why couldn't we cast it out?"
He replied, "Because your faith is so small. What I'm about to tell you is true. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
(No
They gathered in Galilee. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men."
"They will kill him, and on the third day he will rise again." When the disciples heard this, they were greatly distressed. "Jesus pays the temple tax."
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. And there the tax collectors came to Peter and asked him, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
"Yes, he does," he replied. When Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "From whom do the kings of the earth collect taxes and duties? From their own children or from others?"
"From others," Peter answered. "Then the children are not paying," Jesus said to him.
But we don't want to anger them. So go to the lake and cast your line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. You'll find there the small coin you need. Take it and give it to them for our tax.
