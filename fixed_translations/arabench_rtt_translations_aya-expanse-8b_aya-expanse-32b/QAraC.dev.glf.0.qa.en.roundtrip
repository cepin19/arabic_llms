No, no, no, no, I don't care what you say.
Walking in the street.
nasyid: "And some dates, two dates were thrown."
And you're hungry.
Will you eat or not?
No, I'll eat.
Tell me, has it happened before?
Your husband is too old to accept that.
I'm tired of him.
This is our chance, our cars are embarrassingly old.
Try to talk to him, please.
These things are common and normal.
Fool! He lacks self-confidence.
Ha, scared?
What really bothers me
Is he in charge of the budget?
What is this project that he is responsible for?
It's a massive government project.
Hidden at the bottom.
I have the right to take the money.
Do you work in another ministry?
Oh Mother, how could you forget!
And today in the workshop
That means I will do it.
I consider myself a participant!
It's not fair that I get nothing from it.
Will I get something?
That means I'm involved too.
We're all supposed to take.
This is a government project.
But your stupid son won't understand.
I will talk to him.
The good that you reject
This is a government project.
This is your chance.
As others do.
A feast of luck lies before you.
Take your share.
He had almost no money in his pocket.
I heard it myself.
It is known that government projects are...
And the last third is plunder.
Son of Solomon
He went to Souq Waqif.
One lamp costs eighteen riyals.
They included it in the budget.
180 Qatari Riyals each.
They said they didn't do anything wrong.
You'll get bored of him.
Seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan.
Yes, but I think he changes his mind.
Inshallah! Oh my God!
He is the president and everything is in his hands.
Most importantly, don't forget about us.
We are your friends.
We need to be together.
A government project like this is an opportunity.
Certainly Oh! Ali
We can't do that without you.
Don't worry, oh! It's on me.
And if God wills, everyone is included in the project.
Certainly
Yesterday, I was talking with our friends.
From your side
No, we are not concerned because you are members of the project committee.
They are worried about Saleh, the project manager.
They say that
Don't worry, oh! It's on me.
And tell your friends not to worry.
Really? Oh! Abu Fahd?
This is good news.
But oh! Saud, don't forget.
No, no
Insha'Allah, everything will be alright.
Let this good man agree first.
I'll take care of it.
I was wondering if I would get some benefit.
Is it possible?
You are also involved in the project because you work with us in the same department.
But most importantly, it should remain a secret between us.
I found a plate of rice and meat in front of you.
Certainly I will.
Good luck with your eating.
What's wrong with you!
If you continue like this, oblivious.
It's not going to work.
This won't work.
Or questions
If you need help, we'll be happy to assist you.
How will we get our share?
Is it logical?
How will we name it!
We're also not the only ones who will take.
Every participant will demand their share.
Why not!
Don't be afraid Oh! Saleh
We're the ones who will set the budget.
What about the land he bought today?
Did he also just find it?
No one can afford to buy it.
Where did you get this information?
Call me today.
Because my brother's phone was turned off.
I said what's wrong?
Tell your brother.
Another earth
which is next to the land he bought yesterday.
Approved for sale.
Please contact him to confirm his interest, I will reserve it for him.
He doesn't want to share the money with us.
What about our money?
We are considered participants with him.
Even if we weren't participants!
You're eating a big bite by yourself.
Give your brother and your mother at least some.
I'm not here to beg you.
We are also participants in the project, we have the right to ask for our share.
Tell her, tell her.
It's true that when the sultan came and asked him about his share, he refused.
But I didn't agree with him.
You need to give him a share of the project.
Phase one.
You are no less than anyone else.
Project Committee Members
I heard him speaking to them.
They bring in their brothers and friends.
I know that government projects are free for anyone.
We don't want a limited amount of money, that's all.
Paid-in capital.
His brother Sultan can attend committee meetings if he wants.
It seems that the committee members
Project budget
But we want
Thank you.
Yes, Abu Saleh.
Your wife's brother!
You will be amazed by him.
The project will benefit.
Let's remind ourselves.
We divided the task, didn't we?
You, Saleh!
I'll be in charge of cement, bricks, and reinforced concrete.
And leave the rest, from water to electricity, to me.
Oh people!
Claim your share.
I swear,
Sometimes I decide to take an amount of money,
And sometimes I say
Let me take a percentage.
No problem, Saleh, no problem.
Take what you want using your preferred method.
The most important thing,
We do too.
Even during this week,
Everyone determines how much money they want to have.
For example,
And after a few days, they change their minds.
And ask for another hundred thousand.
Well, but why is that, isn't it?
What do you think?
I agree.
Even the participants,
Focus on your work, ignore him.
There is also the money of orphans.
Or increase the budget.
Many people are tempted to eat.
Who does he think he is?
What is this! Is it your father's project!
Yes, he is a sultan.
Ah! My brother, ah! Sultan
Which means he's involved.
Is it a last name?
Your friend Saud mentions a lot of names.
He continues to add names, saying, "Let's take advantage of them."
So, in which group do I add it, percentage or amount of money?
No, put it with the beggars.
%pw How much should you allocate to him! Put twenty thousand for him.
Yes, enough.
They even add a note here saying
He is our neighbor.
But Saud's list is longer than Abdulaziz's list.
All of that will be considered part of the Phase One budget.
As a bundle, no one will notice.
Yes, there's also the list that my mom sent.
Every two hours, you call and add people without asking.
Haha, may she live long.
My eye and my son.
God bless you, she is sick and poor.
But the woman has no money.
May God bless you, I told you this last time.
Tell him it's a liver transplant.
What! Yes, wait, wait... How much do you need?
Enough for the liver, lodging, and hospital!
Around one hundred and eighty thousand riyals.
How many livers will you be transplanting?
One, but my sister says it's expensive.
Yes, God bless you, put her name on the list.
Hussaina, yes yes, Hussaina bint Hilal.
Are you giving her from your own money!
Reassure him and tell him that I don't receive anything from phase two.
Yes, one hundred and eighty thousand riyals.
Oh my God! They're going to replace her liver with a new one.
Tell him, tell him to add two thousand, I want to buy gifts for my daughters.
Alpha (2000)
Write for me.
Yes, she's very strong.
Can I embarrass you in front of your friends!
No mother.
I have a lot of work.
I'll call you later.
More people ate from the feast.
The infrastructure can handle the load.
Don't forget me.
Write the number you want.
I don't know.
It's up to you.
I am the chairman of the board.
And I say you deserve a million.
They decide that the project will start tomorrow.
And they will give us payments continuously.
How much! We want to know!
They will give it all to us at once or in installments.
Why do you take more than us?
There's an electric shock or looting, it doesn't matter, the important thing is to stay quiet, waiting for them to come.
I tell you to stop talking, so stop talking.
Don't contradict.
If I hear any of you speaking
I will sew his mouth shut.
They detained them for far too long.
You know this is money, it's not a simple matter.
What was its price before?
Fifty million
It seems you're taking a big bite.
You are the boss after all.
We don't want any headaches.
Let's agree on the budget.
Mr. Saleh, through your speech about the project, we noticed that it is a worthy and exciting one.
And not only for this generation
Yes yes
Tomorrow, the first phase of the project will be inaugurated.
We would like to thank you for your presence and congratulations once again.
And I welcome
On this occasion
I am from the United Nations.
Where to? To the project.
Here we are!
I don't know where we are.
I am confident in myself.
Don't you see that the officials spoke and the people applauded them?
We are at the official opening, and what about you?
Alright, now talk, which means we're on the project.
Yes, we are in the project.
And people sweat.
And as for those divisions, I don't know what they put inside them.
Leave the box alone.
These divisions are the infrastructure.
The official opening of International Beaches %pw
Third millennium, what's bothering you.
Honestly, I don't know.
Yes, praise be to God, old age is a disease.
I wish I knew why I was fired.
He's just parking his car.
I found this visit strange.
But when you told me
No one told me anything.
I saw it myself, there's a big farm over there.
Praise be to God, you are comfortable.
You receive checks while you're comfortable at home.
Why are you tiring yourself, my dear? Don't let anyone wander in your mind, Manira.
You should thank your God, Munira, for having brothers like Rashid, Saad, and Saqer.
To take care of your share and invest it.
Look at my friend Hessa.
Her brothers don't give her a single riyal from her father's inheritance.
We don't behave like this.
This is your legal right.
This is a matter of trust... Don't you trust us!
I don't know.
I'm not satisfied with what my brother, Rashid, said.
He constantly reminds me of the transfer they give me every three months.
But, this is true.
He always tells me.
Don't trust us.
Financial and estate matters should be clear.
If you, my dear, are not satisfied
You know what he does to people.
And the mother of Salman is an example for you, O poor lady.
Who could believe she inherited millions?
Because of her brothers.
Money destroys people.
But business is business, and this is your legal right.
And then what?
We run the company.
Investment in land, real estate, and money
Without any problems or trouble.
She said she was passing through the earth, in the desert.
This is more than enough for her.
I'm afraid her husband, Nasser, is behind this.
What's the problem?
Your sister started *searching*.
This is the problem.
She's planning to get us into trouble.
It's kind of us to give her the money.
Calm down, Saghra.
We must find a solution to this. Oh, Rashid!
In my head
What is this?
My share of my father's estate
The charitable assistance they give me every three months.
Everything is clear.
No more than forty thousand.
As if they don't invest money.
I see, I see, I see, I see
Clear
It's clear.
They said, "Let's give her more so she feels happy and stops asking."
This is true, everything you said is correct.
They give me a little at a time.
If you only see their wives
He has many different diamond jewels.
And I have half of what they have.
They don't feel that I deserve my father's inheritance.
If you ask for it.
You're welcome.
Legal and legitimate right
I feel like they're stealing from me and lying to me.
I'm not comfortable with the way they're behaving.
Life is unpredictable, oh! My dear.
They exhausted me, they made me sick. Oh, my darling!
Don't they know that there is a judgment and a punishment?
And that God will punish them for taking people's money.
And beware, don't mention anything to them about the court, oh! Dearie.
They will be happy.
Is this due to our growing population?
That's the reason I'm telling you, dear!
Calm down.
Everyone has an apartment that resembles a skyscraper.
I just want my right.
I want to build a mosque before I die.
And give Zakat to the poor.
Mother of Salem
Lower it, for God's sake!
And don't mention anything to them about the court.
Or anything else
You know why!
At this time
Her rights are violated.
You were asking the accountant.
Who are you!! to ask him
Answer them!
Yes, I am... No, no, I'm here for your sister.
The door through which I entered.
Do not be repelled.
Do you know which door I entered through?
No, no
No falcon.
Alas, Saad.
Manor, don't expose yourself to trouble.
If you want your share of the company and properties, it doesn't matter.
Six hundred thousand
She was content throughout her life.
I'm sure she's his evil wife.
Because she is kind.
It's as if I'm begging them.
It's a well-known, legal, and specific law.
He tells me it's either six hundred thousand or nothing.
It's not fair.
Expect anything! Oh! Munira
My father's company.
Eight buildings
I want to express my feelings towards someone without mentioning lands and houses.
He says only six hundred thousand.
By signing the waiver document
No oh! Munira
Don't be fooled and sign that paper, be careful, I warn you.
It's your right to know everything about the lands, money, and everything else; it's not their right.
But the company,
You are a partner.
You've just been fired from the company.
No one can stop me.
Do you know what?
Is it your father's company?
Don't you see him screaming?
Let me in, I tell you.
Leave it, no need.
He has a paper I don't know what it is.
He shouts at us, let him be silent.
We're sorry.
My brother Saad went to the office and explained to them, they don't know.
Enter
See if Mr. Nasser would like to drink something.
Come please.
Certainly %pw
It will get us into trouble.
She will be found out.
He will realize that we owe her four hundred thousand, not forty thousand.
Let's do the calculations.
In ninety-six months,
Here's the thing, multiply it by three hundred and sixty.
Eleven million, five hundred twenty thousand
Well, and what?
Let him do what he can.
I'll tell him frankly.
This is our money.
All the people who inherited did the same thing.
Hello, welcome to your company, ignore what happened.
Welcome
Here is the accountant, Samer.
Answer any questions Mr. Nasser may have.
The whole company is under your control.
If you want to come in, please do, don't ask for permission.
Thank you.
Rely on me.
Go and get it, take it.
Let him look at all the files.
Supposed to take more than ten million.
They didn't even mention him.
Poor thing, she was saying.
That her father has left.
Four buildings.
I thought they had three lands.
Every country is bigger than the other.
God is sufficient for us, and He is the best Protector. - O my son.
What they're doing isn't fair.
Don't leave them alone.
What can I do, Um Salem?
I have to sue them, there's no other choice.
He will quickly flip through a few pages.
The case was postponed.
Beware, my God, my son, Nasser!
Don't mention anything about the court.
Oh my God! Madam, you are here and the doctor is looking for you.
Wake up, Mother of Salem.
Go to your room.
All the Muslim patients
What he told me
Sorry, who's speaking?
Ah, now I remember you, yes yes I remember you.
Yes yes yes yes
Brother, to what!
It doesn't matter, thank you.
Now that he knows we have money, he's gone crazy.
Do you think this Abdullah I sent to them could be him?
Is he a close friend of Rashid?
He has known him well for many years.
Can you trust Manira?
Even Abdullah gave me some advice.
Follow them.
Don't leave them alone.
Try to get as much as you can from them.
Do you know what Abdullah says to me?
Not for people who live seventy or eighty years.
This is for people who will live for at least two hundred years.
Umm Salmin, may Allah preserve her.
"May God have mercy on her soul," she said.
The number of our residents did not exceed four hundred thousand.
And the case takes ten years or more.
Do we have to *formally request* to consult the court?
It's him.
Yes, dear, are you sitting with them?
Good luck.
By the way, he's an old friend from school.
Life is short.
And I seek your benefit
And you come from a large and well-known family.
Deeply rooted.
Oh Rashid, we are friends, please!
Please go while I'm still calm.
Or they will be beaten.
Go, and forget about friendship.
Are you going out or what?
Paid one hundred thousand Qatari riyals for a diamond jewelry set from the jewelry exhibition.
Where did you get all this money from?
They waste money on their wives.
And he deprives his sisters of his wealth.
Do you still have hope, Nasser!
They fought with you.
When I spoke to him yesterday at the mosque.
Just let me do what I told you.
Famous people with deep roots
Maybe, why not?
But, I also advise
O Allah, bless this conversation and through these bright faces.
Oh God, enlighten our hearts with what is good for our worldly and eternal life.
You, listen
If you have something to say, except for the issue of my sister's share.
This is true.
It's better for you to go or you'll get beaten.
I don't care what you say.
I begged you for several months, and you refused.
What matters to me.
I will go tomorrow morning.
Give it to me.
Hello, hello
Don't listen to her.
You won't go to court.
The day after tomorrow
We'll give you a chance to see what you'll do.
Goodbye
Being nice doesn't work with them.
And they realized that their reputation was at stake.
We'll see what they decide.
Saad, are you busy tomorrow?
I've decided to take legal action against them.
I asked her to postpone it until tomorrow, so we'll go to her tomorrow.
What is this?
You are right.
I asked why.
that you want to go to court and sue us
To get your share of the inheritance
Yes, I did.
May your life be happy.
To keep your life whole
Why, I told you we want to go the day after tomorrow.
Upon your arrival, first park your car in the parking lot.
You will see the security guards.
You go to the eighth floor.
The judges are on this floor.
Business cards for all the lawyers in the country.
I'm sure you'll need them.
Come here to mock us.
We want her to sue us.
Go to court.
Listen to Manar.
And sign the surrender document for us.
"Who is good" or "The one who is good" (depending on context)
Know the way
Show us the way.
Let's go, brother.
I forgot to give Mona something important.
This is the Al Raya daily newspaper.
There's a very good article.
A woman wrote this text, I think she's a doctor.
I want you to take a look, as a gift *from me*
His marital status must be changed.
Alas!
He has four children, but his house is a mess.
Certainly he will, he risked all his fortune.
Take a risk on this project.
The one I would never expect to start a business is Bou and Waleed.
Eat, eat, the new merchant's sons, Bou and Walid.
My dear, do you want me to give you something to eat?
No, I'm fine.
Get up and move, get some fruit.
Mom, I want Hamood's toy.
Bon appétit.
My son Waleed put some candy out for your uncle.
Congratulations on the project, Abu Waleed! You deserve it!
My friends found me an excellent accountant.
Thank you, thank you my son.
Father, when we become big merchants, I want to have my own room.
Look what he asked for, he has no ambition, my dear son.
Okay, I'll get you a large-sized BlackBerry.
They have forgotten their possessions.
Just like everyone else.
Instead of our miserable little house
First, let's pay off all our debts, and then we'll see.
You seem very happy, Bou Walid.
He eats more than before.
He's a trader, how lucky he is.
All my hair is white like the merchant's.
Blessings to the project.
Leave some for my friends.
If God wills, may God bless you.
I met a Japanese young man, I was among them.
While we were sitting, I swapped seats with him, and he gave me a catalog as a gift.
Later, one of my friends saw that.
He said, "It's an opportunity."
Multi-purpose halls?
Always like this.
It's computer labs.
Click on the cinema.
If you want the field...
This is magic.
They were amazed, they all said yes.
I took a loan from the bank, some from my relatives, and sold a piece of land I owned, praise be to God.
Now, with the committee's approval,
Why didn't you request it since the ministry approved it?
And he will send an email to the factory.
You will be contacted when he arrives.
There's thyme tea.
Nothing, I'm still waiting in Ali's office.
And the secretary didn't call, brother.
And he will be absent for ten days.
A matter of luck.
My documentaries are ready.
The committee approved it.
Why don't you sign it?
Aren't you a fully empowered manager?
Why don't you go to him to sign on your behalf?
I told you he can't.
Not just him, all the staff there do the same thing.
Appearance can be deceiving sometimes.
You should thank God.
I was there trying to get the signature, and my anxiety was growing.
Are you finished?
How can I finish this if Bou Fahd never shows up?
What can I do?
After that, I'll lose my money.
I want him to sign as soon as possible to get it over with, I don't know what to do.
I'm afraid the manager will ask about you.
Tell him I'm sick, anything.
I'm waiting for myself.
She says if you're his secretary, what about us?
And give me your mobile phone number.
Not the secretary, please sit down, sit down, it's not him, what's the matter?
Don't call, you scare people, they thought it was the secretary.
No, we're still waiting for Bu Fahad.
%pw, My money for fixing the bathroom
He is stupid.
Oh people, wait, wait!
Quiet, very quiet.
I tell you to shut up, enough, close your mouth.
Bu Fahd had to go to the airport.
How did he leave?
Let's see him by car before he leaves.
What's his problem?
May God bless you.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't blame your father, my dear!
But he behaves strangely.
And if he does not receive the goods,
He won't be able to get his money back.
And now she needs it.
Where is he now?
What are you looking for?
It's here, in front of you.
You're calling me in the middle of the night.
Brother, I told you.
I told you.
It's beyond my control, my daughter.
I know my father, but this isn't fair.
The next class starts next week at the university.
If I don't enroll, I'll have to wait until the next semester.
Three months would be a waste of time.
Oh my God! Dear, I'm trying.
Don't you see that I go to the ministry every day?
Wait until Bou Fahd comes, Bou Fahd.
And I will stay at home.
I don't understand!
Don't call me during lunchtime.
This is the fourth time you've called me.
Are you stupid?
I know you need the money.
But, hopefully, Boo Fahd will sign the papers this week.
And they will give him the first installment.
I don't know what to tell you, sister.
Woke up in a panic.
He sleeps, walks, and talks to himself all night long.
If Bu Fahd falls.
Oh God, help him.
Therefore
Bo Fahd must sign this paper this week.
What is he waiting for?
He comes to work once.
And I travel for a year.
And leave the welfare of the people
Oh oh oh oh, how is this?
Do you feel better now?
Shattered me into pieces
This strange fever is dragging me, pulling me.
What does he want?
I heard that I'm going to the ministry.
Processing my papers
He told the staff that he would punish me.
The time period is about to end.
Give me the phone, give me the phone.
He is the librarian of Bu Fahad.
I'd like to tell you that
Bo Fahd will definitely come tomorrow.
As soon as I call you.
Come directly.
Good
You were never that kind of person.
I'm talking to you.
And your eyes on your phone screen
I said I'm sorry.
Until you feel responsible.
And if you commit yourself
I'll take you back to your department.
Ten boxes of printing paper
Fifteen boxes of paper for printing.
He is poor.
The principal is punished.
By bringing him with us
Have you heard about the factory?
He will lose his money if they don't sign his papers today.
If he goes while the manager knows.
Oh, tell me about it.
What if the manager asks about him?
We'll take care of it, just let it go.
Bu Waleed
I'll go, but I'm expecting a phone call.
Tell me
Oh God, help him.
Wait, people! Wait, people! Wait!
How am I supposed to know where he's going?
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Do not move.
Don't sit.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't go to work.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
We'll go look for him in Uzbekistan.
Room by room
Alley after alley
It seems that
Call the hospital, quickly.
Don't call the hospital.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
I've spent my whole life as a mail carrier, for many years until today.

Maybe about fourteen years.

A tragedy, my son!
But what can we do, O son of man?
Bu Saad
Alright, sorry gentlemen, as he said the manager has arrived, let's go finish our work.
The manager has arrived. Oh! Great, let's go.
Congratulations, Bou Said.
They said your son, Khalid, is an employee.
What did I tell you?
I told you, God willing.

I told you when my last son graduates, I'll resign.
Graduated and got a job.
Thank God, I'll finish my work.
The service was provided correctly.
Thank God.
You've changed your mind, oh! Bou Said
And you deserve it.

I'm truly grateful, Abu Abdulaziz!
Here you are
We did our duty.
Let them continue the journey.
You're welcome.
After all this age and work

You must rest, oh! Bou Said

Don't worry.
Ready-to-eat donuts
Jay, sure, goodbye.
I told you the khanfroush is ready, waiting for me.
I will complete all your papers now.
This is your chance to introduce him today.
He told me that their manager would travel.
I'm not in the mood.
I don't even want to move.
Send it with someone else.
Now, you are officially free.
Thank you.
Now, you are free to rest.
"Thank you very much. Oh! Abu Abdulaziz, goodbye."
Congratulations to me.
No more work.
It means you're free, Father.
Alright, please, Father.
Yes, Human Resources.
Thank you, goodbye.

Oh God, help him now.
He has done enough, let him rest.
Let him rest.
He asked me to bake some cannoli.
I've prepared it.
And I waited for him.
Fear God and have mercy on your father.
Your turn now.
He will eat it tomorrow.
He wants to rest.
You've tired this old man out.
As soon as he returns
He was tired.
Don't worry me about them (singing)
Don't worry me about them (singing)
I wanted to take these papers to the bank on my way to work.
He said he would punish anyone who was late.
Certainly, my love.
Go to your work.
On this nose, and those small Chinese eyes, goodbye.
Bu Sa'id
He sends you to a different place every day.
As you wish, Um Saeed.
A scent is detected.
In my nose
"Snail seller, snail seller"
Why did you go to the central bank?
No, father, take it to the market branch.
And go there.
Sure? I don't want to go there and they tell me he's not here.
Okay, goodbye.
I got sunstroke.
The sun's rays struck.
I entered our neighbor's house.
The maid recognized me.
She asked me what's up.
What compels you to do that?
No, Mother Saeed, I can't eat the khunfush now.
Oh mother, where is father?
Back and forth
You didn't tell him which bank to go to.
Tell him that some papers are missing.
I asked him to take a taxi.
Mom, we had a meeting with the principal.
How is my father now, is he better?
I slept a little, and the headache is gone now.
I tell you in front of him.
Leave your father, let him rest.
They are sad, or happy.
They must adhere to their tasks, they will be evaluated, so what can they do?
As you like it
%pw Bo Shehain
You could say I retired, but I didn't retire.
How does this happen?
Before, in the past
The humbleness is destined for me.
Your children are grown up.
I must help them.
They were telling me.
You are wrong.
Do you think all young people without a father don't finish their personal work?
It depends on the job.
In some jobs, you are allowed to leave to finish your personal work.
May Allah reward you with good.
I'm close to you, the coffee shop is behind you.
Where are you going, Abu Shuhaym?
I'll finish some papers for my son Saeed.
In this ministry, next to this cafe.
I will refer it to the Land Departments.
Goodbye
What's the matter, Mom? Okay, I'll see you later, goodbye.
This won't help you.
I warn you.
I heard you say that to Saeed.
Your father is sick.
I don't care about you.
If your father complains
He is silent.
And don't talk about her.
Weary him not, fear God.
Your very loud scream woke me up.
Father, I was a government employee and you know well what hoarding means.
And they are writing this first.
And now they are making it like this.
Tomorrow is the last day for loans at the Development Bank.
No, no, who said that?
Alright, son.
I believed his lies.
He says he has a sock committee meeting tomorrow.
What's wrong with you!
%pw, as you wish.
Go immediately to finish his work.
Nothing, nothing
He has kept silent since he returned home.
Doesn't answer me.
You don't feel any shame at all.
I don't blame your father for being angry with you.
If you agree with this.
"Often, and may God reward you with good."
He was supposed to call you.
Why will his servant be called?
You are the most respected among us, O Father!
And I am grateful to you.
Please forgive him.
Let me organize it.
And from now on, Father!
And relax.
"Khunfuroosh, Khunfuroosh" (Singing)
Thank you, ...
Your satisfaction, O father!
Oh Lord, grant me Your reward.
We have decided from now on,
We'll do our own paperwork.
Thank you all so much, may Allah reward you with good, and praise be to Allah.
But, Father!
Consider it the last.
But I can't.
Let me now.
Father, I won't go to the meeting. I hate meeting the minister.
The minister will be angry with you.
No, no, no, this can't be, you can't bother the minister, you have to go, even before him.
I won't go any further, what can I say, I don't want to bother you.
Don't say that.
Your papers are with me, and they are considered complete.
He'll be on his way once you're done with Saeed's papers.
Please, Father.
Consider this the last paper you'll finish preparing for me.
I'm happy to serve you, Father!
But your son is supposed to sign this paper.
Do you mean I should come back to give it to you tomorrow?
I advise you to bring it today.
And if they didn't see the papers
You will have to wait for two months.
Don't give it to him until he signs it and comes back to you.
No, no, no, there's no need.
Just call him and ask him to come, just for two minutes.
I'll finish it.
Don't you know Saeed?
No, he's on vacation.
Promised after sunset.
All our friends are there.
Whenever I ask a friend, "Where are you?"
He replies that he is with Saeed.
I wait until the work day is over.
Alright, man.
Why did you come to finish your paperwork yourself?
Why didn't you send your sons?
Do you have any sons?
Are you alright, sir?
Please, sir, take them.
Many thanks
No use.
I will leave you.
And go to the old retirement home.
I don't want to tell them where I'm going.
What will you tell them, Bou Said?
I will write something else.
Yes, praise be to God.
He emerged from the pandemic yesterday.
She's not really my sister.
Why are you tiring yourself out?
I told him never to appear on TV or radio.
We talked about "fighting corruption," that's what got us into trouble.
O Allah, guide him to the straight path.
Okay, sister, goodbye, may God bless you.
Did he go to prison?
I was absent.
What can I tell you?
The program called "Mylas" I think.
Talk to the man.
The one called Khalid Jassem
She said to him, "Stop corrupting."
His colleagues at work heard his voice.
He started talking about the government.
Even oil and money
I don't know what happened to him.
None of his friends
Those who encouraged him to do that.
He left it.
Oh Lord, guide him to the straight path.
Sorry, I must go and cook now.
Hello anytime.
Come, my son.
Sit here.
Stop the corruption, son.
I'm tired and bored of this.
I've been in the hospital for two days.
You don't deserve this, Mom.
I'm sorry to hear that this happened.
I told you this.
What is this, Mother?
And he screamed.
This commitment
God saved you this time.
I warn you.
Don't worry, Mom.
Let's just not talk about it.
Stop corruption.
Why did the manager fire her?
It's sad, after all these years, you're firing me.
Do not listen.
Stop corruption.
Again, please.
Yes, I will do it.
You are a reasonable man.
Those who follow public affairs and criticize.
Well informed
We just excluded some people.
And you are one of them.
There's nothing personal.
Okay, goodbye.
Brother Saleh
I hope your uncle, Manira's father, doesn't find out.
He's already angry with you.
Who will know it?
If he asks you
Tell him that I'm working.
I told you they were going to fire him, didn't I?
I asked his mother and she said he's still working.
Certainly
His mother should have said that today.
What can we do with it now?
We cannot let our daughter suffer with him.
What you see now
I'll give him two weeks.
But, if he doesn't find a job, I'll take him to court to divorce my daughter.
Drink your coffee.
Don't beat around the bush unless you have something in mind.
Frankly,
I want to go out.
You are grounded.
I know you're dying to
Go to the coffee shop.
Until you speak without logic.
Go to your room and sleep.
And in the early morning of tomorrow, look for work.
God willing, I will wake up early.
Mother, I told you, I've broken this habit.
I swear
Mom, honestly, I'm a little bored.
And don't talk nonsense.
Act deaf.
He has changed.
What's the matter, man? Where's your voice? Why aren't you speaking as you used to?
We want to hear your thoughts on fighting corruption.
Stop corruption.
Stop corruption.
Salih is here!
He must be sleeping.
Did my son do something wrong?
I just saw him at a cafe.
What did he say?
He did the right thing.
Because there are a lot of people around.
Call him only.
Don't waste your time.
If I see you here, I'll break your leg.
If you make a mistake.
His mistake prevented him from stopping you.
I know you well.
You're like someone who has just quit smoking.
Whether we talk or not, whether we engage in anti-corruption conversations or not.
I warn you.
If I hear you speaking on the radio
Or a halt to corruption.
Mr. Saleh, you are a good citizen, you have a high sense of patriotism.
We can't hire you.
What can I do?
Sorry
Hello Saleh, how are you?
I wish you hadn't gone to the trouble of coming. We appreciate it.
There's not really much to this.
I yearn to hear him every day, stop the corruption.
You are a very brave man, you fear nothing.
Please say it only once.
God bless you, I...
Is it a cigarette? Just say enough corruption, please.
He is asking you, make him do it just once.
This is amazing.
Now, my dear
About the job.
You are a loyal citizen, and very dear to us.
We wanted to let you know by calling you.
He would have humiliated you in public.
Are you serious?
All that is said is that there are no vacancies.
They really wanted to hire me, but there are no openings.
And now, how will you provide money for you and your mother?
And don't forget that
She has four children.
May God bless you.
Do not despair.
Don't lose hope.
Never stop.
You must look for work every day.
So my father won't get angry.
I'll take any kind of job, just for you.
I will never say enough to corruption.
Stop corruption.
You don't know what he's doing these days.
I told you.
But you never listen to me.
May God guide you.
I cannot go to the minister and tell him what this man is doing.
The minister will think.
Certainly, he will think that.
You are right.
But it's a serious matter.
We need to do something.
They say he's going to replace you, you know such rumors are very effective.
I'm trying to find a way to stop him.
I don't want anyone to feel like I'm behind it.
I agree with you.
What are you thinking about?
The only way to keep him from influencing our interests.
Have you heard about Saleh's anti-corruption campaign?
He lives in my neighborhood.
He will take care of that.
We miss your voice.
No good
I am one of your big fans.
Saleh is a very good man.
And hopefully soon.
He will return, and we will enjoy listening to his voice.
Even Bou Fahad himself asks about you.
Tell me, Saleh.
Why did you stop?
I've faced some problems, some health-related and some psychological.
Frankly,
You are a perfectionist.
It's been a long time since I heard that.
How wonderful, please be kind.
Just once, do it for me.
I want to hear you talk about it.
Salih says he agrees.
No, people, it's really hard.
What's wrong with you?
The man is asking you.
Abdurrahman, I had already resigned.
Didn't you tell us you were looking for a job?
Alright, this is your chance.
Appease him and let your voice reach him, and go ask him for a job the next day.
He will certainly come to you.
I want what's best for you.
Do you know what?
Forget it, go back home.
No, no, no, we don't want your help anymore.
Alright, hold on a second, man. Let's discuss the matter.
No, we don't want to.
Alright, alright.
Alright, if I speak for the last time now, we've stopped, but I'll do it one last time.
What does Bu Fahd want to hear?
What is the problem that worries him the most? You see, there are many problems here as well, more than necessary.
What does he prefer to hear? Or does he prefer chaos, I don't know, tell me.
According to the contract.
Use his authority.
Eight and seventy centimeters.
Destroy it.
Don't interrupt me.
Why did the officer do that?
Where is number seven? Seven.
Don't interrupt me.
Number seven, minister.
Why did the officer do that?
When the ministry moved to its new headquarters.
Bring your brother's cars.
People, stop corrupting.
Since your return, we want you to stay in touch with the program.
I am from a proud people, meaning, this is the last time.
Because, frankly, I had given up.
Oh Mother, didn't you say that he had stopped and that you prevented him?
Yes, my daughter.
Yes, my daughter.
The man known for fighting corruption spoke about it on the radio.
I hadn't heard of it, but some people told me about it.
I'm sure someone from the ministry has revealed it.
His expression "H
He is free.
Alright, Your Excellency the Minister
Don't worry.
My entire day is dedicated to serving the ministry, may God bless you.
Did you hear that?
I said it only for you.
Ignore me.
He didn't speak to me.
Abdulrahman told me he would hire me.
He didn't speak to me.
You are very poor, Saleh.
I feel sorry for you.
I am Bu Fahd's secretary.
And I know the case.
They used you to achieve their goals.
Unfortunately, they reached her.
Do you know who planned all this?
Your neighbor, Abdurrahman
He was behind all of that.
Bo Fahd will never hire you.
You will do the same thing for him.
As long as you're known.
No one will hire you.
I want to take you to court tomorrow for a divorce.
I found a solution.
We are the best community in the world.
Free of any problems
No, we don't do that.
We don't have any problems at all.
We are happy.
What is nepotism?
Everyone stands in line.
Because it's the system here.
Get his rights more than the foreigner.
We do not rely on foreigners.
We don't have this.
Your effort and work make you the best, we don't have any problems.
Or an important official
And I'll expel you.
We don't have this here.
With my regards
Saleh Rashid Saad Rashid Al-Bahiri
Known as anti-corruption
I didn't want to have dinner.
I was running and turning, trying to grab my shirt and tear it.
He's jealous because you're wearing a new shirt.
Walid was seen wearing the shirt we just bought from Villaggio.
He pulled it eagerly, tearing it into pieces.
He has a kind heart, he can't blame others.
I think
Yuck! Adol saw my son as handsome and you were jealous of him.
It's none of his business.
Why did you tear Waleed's shirt?
I saw him wearing a new shirt, so I got angry. Ask your father to buy you a new shirt.
What do you think of yourself?
Why did you tear Waleed's shirt?
I'm telling you
Don't be forced to lose.
Sultan, my brother
Why don't you also punch him in the face and disfigure him?
He's a little child, not your age, so have some shame.
Is this a child?
Yes, child.
He needs people to lift him up and fix him.
Not just left
Be careful with your words, Sultan!
You think I'm a child, to correct me.
You are arrogant.
Raise your child well.
And if you are unable to do that
I respect him.
I don't want to rebuke him in front of his wife.
And brothers
If Adol hits Waleed again,
I will punish him.
It's me who's wasting my time arguing with you.
Act politely.
Let me go and show her.
A discussion with fools.
Where are the days of the past?
And the intentions were clear.
Forgive us
Do you have a larger one than this?
No, no, this one is the biggest.
Leave everything and come now.
Come and see the problem we're in.
Yes, but my dear, tell me what happened.
Brother Ahmed, sorry, I have to go home, there's an emergency and I have to leave.
Ruken Adol has left.
He is a jealous and hateful person.
It's... It's Sultan.
How would a child cut all these clothes?
God is sufficient, I didn't use them, God is sufficient.
I'll show him.
Sit down, listen to me.
If you go and talk to him, he won't admit it. He'll say it was the child.
So, what do we do?
Father, do you know how to ride a bicycle?
Yes, I know.
The hand, my love.
Yes, I'm telling the truth.
But tell me
Where did you put the scissors, dear?
Under his bed.
Destroy them, O God, destroy their lives.
But I'll show him.
I will not be silent.
He's crazy, crazy.
So far
And do not change it.
But the computer is another matter, I'll show him.
I will not be silent.
Do you think it was our son Adoul who caused their computer to crash?
Ask him to come, let's see who's behind this.
Don't do it.
Go mock someone else, maybe your friends and not me.
I told you it's Advil.
And laugh at someone else, oh! Tigers, not me.
Come, please.
Where hearts were generous.
And the intentions were clear.
Is there a child?
I don't go to look for friends.
He laughs at me, not I, oh! Sultan.
Falsely accused
Keep these scissors.
Act politely.
Hello, Abdulrahman, come quickly, oh! My son.
Come and see your brothers, Fahd and Sultan.
They fight every day, my son!
I don't know.
At such a meeting,
We should be noble.
Look carefully at our works.
And the actions of those who came before us.
We see.
It will be a lesson for us.
We must learn from them.
Don't behave like children like this.
As big as a camel.
They have children.
Without any knowledge
You are his role models, not them.
His role model is his father.
You, Sultan!
And you, Fahd!
And I am your older brother.
To me
I'll make him pay for the computer.
You raised his hand.
You haven't forgiven each other.
No, I just shook his hand to escape.
From Abdulrahman's never-ending story
Where are you going?
I swear I won't leave him.
Did you make this tea?
Get out, don't hide.
Open the door, if you're a man.
Why didn't you say Abdelrahman hit you?
But, I swear to God, if he doesn't calm down, I'll destroy his room.
Your brother
Crazy
Your brother is crazy.
I'll show him; keep the tea.
On his head
Be quiet, be quiet, stop! Oh! Children, they have no shame, hitting each other.
You're behaving like little children, stop it, my son!
I swear I'll show you.
Hit, hit, oh! What a big nose.
Blood, mother
Your scream scared me.
Oh God
Leave us alone.
Shame.
Even if I reconcile you both.
I won't leave you.
When he came at night to reconcile with them.
He didn't have time, oh! My daughter.
Poor him.
Inshallah
Speaks fluently
But, oh! Girls
May God guide you.
You must calm them down.
Don't start a fight among yourselves, girls!
What happened, I hope it's good.
You've disappointed me, Abdelrahman!
I wanted you to help, not do the same thing.
You are the wise brother, O Lord, guide you.
Two consecutive strikes.
Stretch your arm.
You've embarrassed us, may God guide you.
Our neighbor Saeed is laughing at you.
Officer! We've told him repeatedly.
Don't believe him, officer.
They were throwing stones, the three of them.
Sorry.
Don't do it.
My officer believed me, I saw them *from my window*.
Did you hear him?
It's too far away.
My brother was right when he said he was "ready."
Sorry, now that I've signed that, they won't do it again.
Thank you, thank you.
Welcome, my brother, welcome!
Officer, how are you going to release them, I'm sure, trust me.
Listen to me.
I didn't want to say that in their presence.
Abdulrahman, the eldest brother
He is the assistant under-secretary.
The middle is the head of a public authority.
Take two Panadol tablets and rest.
Panadol! Officer.
Do you have two Panadol tablets here?
There is no abundance except from Allah.
There is no abundance except from Allah.
"Perhaps God will suffice for the enemy, do I fear?"
What is this * What is the percentage?
He will throw a child into this dimension!
This is a strong hand, it looks like his father's hand.
Can you believe it?
He seems to be from a respectable family, kind and polite.
That's because I come from a poor family.
So what's the matter?
He follows you.
He never takes his eyes off you.
And your annoyance
And you say you didn't get the chance.
When you passed by, I looked at you, what does that mean?
Coincidence, you think!
You turned your head, and she turned her head at the same time.
No, but certainly there is something.
I notice when you enter.
She feels happy, deep in her heart.
Go and ask her about a pen.
Give her your notebook.
I don't know her name, can you believe it?
Romantic, more than it should be.
Dude, we're in the 21st century.
You're really desperate.
Frankly
It's been a long time since we sat and talked like this.
No, here's the good news.
From now on, I'll have more time to sit with you.
But you must go and rest now.
Especially after the outdoor shooting session in the desert yesterday.
We were very tired, long hours, I informed the secretary that I didn't want any press or TV interviews, nor any contracts.
I want to spend some time with my family.
God be with you.
Even if you're busy,
The first thing that came to my mind
I have the owner's number, I'll call him today.
Late for what?
The villa has now been sold and the buyers moved in a few days ago.
You were busy with serials and photography.
Umm Abdul Aziz says they are poor and *
This is what God has decided for them, we will not interfere.
Good morning, Uncle.
What's the problem?
This car, my son, stops every now and then.
It seems to be the battery.
No problem, don't worry, I have a charger and I'll charge it for you.
May Allah reward you with the best.
Anytime, Uncle.
Peace be upon you
The hand is correct.
Alright, from tomorrow I'll start looking for a villa nearby to visit you daily.
What do you want now?
Alright, enough already, man.
Take it.
What is your full name?
Rashed Abdullah
The same name?
I told your father that.
Your mother is right.
I was very happy when I found out that Rashid Abdullah, my favorite actress, is our neighbor.
Everyone loves him.
They say he is kind and humble.
Neighborhood before housing.
I want to take a picture with him.
So that my colleagues at work believe in me
He couldn't believe our house was right next to the actor Rashid Abdullah's.
Talk to him until he believes.
What is this life?
What we used to see on TV
And we hope to see him.
Our neighbor, praise be to God, oh my God!
If they need a sailboat, I have one.
I'm happy to help, but folks, be nice to me, I'm not used to this yet.
I heard about her.
That was very kind of him, may God reward him with good.
Peace be upon you
This has confirmed that some employees will be relocated to the ministry's new branch in Doha.
Did they tell you who's moving?
I didn't hear the names.
But, what I heard, I'm sure of it.
Is Bu Ali among them?
My name!
But, we don't exactly know who we'll transfer.
I can't go, God bless you, Doukhan is too far away from me, I can't.
Whether you can or not, work is work, man.
The committee is still considering the matter.
But if they choose you
Thank you for visiting me, Father, please have some.
Thank you, thank you, oh! Bou Ali
We're sorry, the furniture is old.
We are neighbors today.
We're like a family.
"That's very kind of you, oh! Boo and Waleed" (Note: "بو وليد" seems to be a name, so it's kept as is in the translation.)
Oh, may Allah reward you with good, Abu Waleed!
I've heard a lot about your kindness.
Oh God, preserve this love forever.
But, oh! My daughter.
I'm ready to walk around the market for you until you find the most beautiful and cheapest furniture that suits you.
When? To be honest, our furniture is very old.
We need to change it.
Inshallah
I've told you before.
If you need anything.
Consider me your sister.
I didn't want to cry over you (metaphorically)
Where did you go, my love?
I forgot to scold her when she called me yesterday.
Not because she forbids you.
No more
I'll call you later, goodbye.
In fact, I was talking to her.
But those people are different from us.
They are rich, and we are nothing compared to them.
Don't worry, Mom.
Just wait a little.
Just wait a little.
And I'll give you the green light to suggest it to me.
I told you.
No, Mother, don't worry.
And you come and ask me to propose to you.
I set the dinner in the living room.
If you want to eat
The driver will take her to the university now, God willing.
Aren't we agreed that we're a family?
Whose car is this?
And soon, God willing.
I called to thank her.
Good people love charity.
Yes, you're right! Oh, Dad!
Even our relatives don't do that for us.
Certainly! Is my name on the list?
Sure?
What's this disturbance? Why do problems follow us?
I don't know, I'm now at a loss, after hearing this news, what I'll do, I don't know.
Go, go, go, go, go now, okay, okay, thank you, may God reward you, may God reward you.
Oh my God, what happened! Bou Ali
The committee met today.
And a list of the names of the people who will be transferred to Doha.
My name is listed.
Talk to the manager to get your name removed.
I don't think it will be useful, oh! Umm Ali, I don't think it will be useful.
I spoke to him, and he said there was no way.
Famous actor
Consider that your name was never on the list.
May God bless you, thank you very much. Oh! Bu Salem
If you don't mind
I want to take a picture with you to show my children.
My children will be happy.
May God bless them.
Can I take a picture with you, actor?
Certainly, God bless you.
Come please, come.
Certainly, I'd be happy to help you.
You and those you love
He told me a day or two ago.
Oh mother, be ready.
Ready? Ready for what?
Are you crazy? What's wrong with you?
She said, "I don't have a problem."
Let his mother come.
Go to them.
But, my son!
I don't want them to feel that we are poor.
You have to keep up with the fashion trends.
I don't have any elegant dresses.
You've gotten me into trouble.
Why are you taking out all this jewelry? It's the first time I've seen you do that.
What is not mine.
Mother of Ali
Um Ali will suggest to her son.
You want some elegant clothes and gemstones.
You want to show them that they are wealthy and rich people.
(Surprise) God willing
Good luck.
Inshallah, is this my wife? She's taller and blonder.
God willing, I'll listen.
You are a queen, God willing, a queen.
You must be ready too.
They will ask you to meet her father.
Certainly, I don't go in this dress.
When I enter in my new costume
Oh mother, beware of her intentions.
It's very kind of Um Waleed to give you her things, so use them carefully.
Yes yes
So we should be like them.
Why didn't his mother go to arrange his marriage?
That was for the women.
I have to go meet the men.
As you can see, God blesses you.
Only the bisht remains, God bless you.
Good people helped me.
They were helpful, only the pashtun cap is left.
I want to borrow it from you to complete the outfit.
All people stand for you.
Yes, but my brother Rashid, should I loosen it like this, or keep it tight?
No, look, first.
You must close this button.
It takes my breath away.
The robe (the man's garment) is loose, but
May God bless you.
The left hand should be in...
The right hand is relaxed, like this.
You're carrying the lower part of the bisht.
Oh my God, oh my God
How wonderful
You must slow your steps a little.
Oh! Yes, of course.
Now you look like a millionaire.
They didn't give you, okay, seconds.
Put your left hand like this, your right hand, this way.
Do you know my friend Aisha?
What's her situation?
You know what she was telling me today.
She told me, "Because you're my friend, and I don't want us to drift apart."
I will ask my brother to approach you.
Tell your friend not to ask her brother and embarrass herself and him.
I see that many suitors are interested in you these days. A few days ago, you told me that Sa'ad wants you for her aunt, and today this one wants you for her brother.
They want to take my beloved.
While I just sit and watch
Don't they know about our relationship?
No, they only know that we are colleagues.
Alright, then.
From tomorrow, they must know.
Why did Waleed refuse?
I am screaming.
My request is denied.
The actors are more truthful than you, my God! Double-faced.
But you,
They offer advice throughout your life.
What doesn't reflect you.
To serve people
Lying to people
Wear costumes in life, in front of everyone.
I wore a costume while acting on television.
It's me or you!
You wore accessories, gold, and jewelry.
To play
To get married
What's the scene?
A man walks in front of his wife.
He is wearing his keffiyeh (traditional Arab clothing) over the side of his face.
He doesn't turn his head to the right or to the left.
Reminds me of your friend you were talking about, who works with you in the same office.
Is he with a girl and a boy?
Why is he walking like that?
As they said,
Oh my God, help him! Man, come on!
Walk straight, don't stop.
He has no personality at all.
He laughs, he's happy!
Show us the city center.
No, no, no, no, it doesn't look good with you sitting.
You look better when you're awake, when you're standing up, get up, get up, get up
I beg you, Thursday!
What's up? Are you going downtown?
Come, I want to talk to you.
Where are you going? Stay with us for a while.
His wife annoys him.
Are you happy about that!
Oh! James
I run it, and if the presenter is female.
I change the channel because I'm afraid of getting into trouble.
I swear I'm at work.
I'm sitting with Salem, my coworker friend.
Talk to her.
She hung up on me, take it, take it.
I hung up the phone, and now I'll be bothered.
Now you say I let you talk to her because there's a woman with us.
Now you might throw me out of the house.
Get out!
You're not the first to get divorced.
No, no, no, I can't, oh! My brother.
I don't want to torment my mother in her grave.
He entrusted me with it.
She said: Don't shoot.
No, no, no, I can't, it's impossible.
Are you trying to find something?
No, no, no, please stay.
You are completely crazy.
Don't drive me crazy.
Tell me, I want to know what's wrong.
No, no, no, Mother, don't say that about him.
Salem, in particular, is one of the best men in our city.
He is asking you for a divorce.
Even if he asked me for a divorce, would I be stupid to divorce him? That's unreasonable.
Jameis, I've officially gone crazy.
Leave me, please leave me.
I was talking to him, alone.
May God guide you.
Poor him, he's heartbroken.
I want to give him an important message from the minister's office.
Who do you want to give it to, may God guide you?
No, nothing, nothing
Give it to me, I'll take it to him.
It's about meeting the women's delegation tomorrow.
Women's delegation
What's wrong with you! Aren't you going to sleep today?
Hello Salim
I am your brother, Khamis.
No, I'm really and consciously talking to you.
Ah! My brother.
Remove my name so I don't attend.
How can we delete your name?
The only one who can remove your name is His Excellency the Minister.
It's a meeting at the ministry.
Official meeting
Who are you talking to?
Healthy, healthy, healthy
Tell me the truth.
Who is the lady you were talking to?
Safe and sound, safety, I swear by God it was safe.
If you're talking to Salem
Will you speak?
This lie doesn't work.
Don't lie! Oh! Five.
You're not telling the truth!
You're wearing casual clothes.
I thought I was talking to a woman.
What is this miserable life?
God bless you, please contact Salam.
Please, so that you believe.
You were asked to call.
What's your business with him?
Don't meddle in others' affairs, or you'll see what is displeasing.
He complains about you.
Hello! Oh, it's you!
How can you live with a woman with such a sharp tongue?
Let's start the meeting now.
Hassan went to call Khamis.
Alright, let's discuss the real estate budget first.
Let's start.
Let's hope he finds it.
He was terrified when he saw the ladies.
I searched the whole ministry and you're hiding here.
Let's go, let's go, people are waiting in the conference room.
I cannot sit with the ladies.
Oh! James, how do you know your wife?
I'm afraid you'll call.
*Oh my God*, do you want her to doubt me, don't you understand?
If I don't answer her call, how will I get home?
Will your wife call at this time?
Certainly, since your company is large.
This project that your company will implement for our ministry
It's one of the biggest projects in our ministry's history.
People, why is the table shaking?
No, it's too old, not the table, me.
You can answer your call.
Who is this?
Excuse me, who would you like to speak to?
This is my phone, %pw
I'll explain to you, wait, wait.
He fainted out of fear of going back home.
Her brother came.
Tell him that his wife said not to come home unless you change your job and don't work with ladies.
This is what prompted him to send a letter to the ministry to transfer him from our department.
Exactly, the minister himself told me that he approved it, what more does he want!
What about his wife?
This is madness.
Ask him who you are talking to.
I told you he's crazy.
What will you do! Your wife and children will return tomorrow?
I don't know what to do.
As long as she did what she wanted, why was she afraid to go home and see her children?
You want official proof.
Alright, give her the papers.
Alright, this is what I did, I sent the paper with her brother.
So that you see the minister's signature and make sure.
And I hope you agree, if you do, I'll be back home tonight, God willing.
Sister, this is the minister's signature.
What else do you want?
Work in the new department will start tomorrow.
A desk and a job other than the one he used to work in.
Where is this department, bless you.
Yes, God bless you, here is the minister's permission.
Nothing, nothing, it's right here, on your right.
Yes, may God bless you.
Please come in, your office is ready.
Saad, and Abdul Qadir, God willing, a big office, yes.
Goodbye
How do you request a transfer?
The department consists of women only.
My wife
No one can execute another's decision except the minister himself.
You have to work until the minister returns.
Aha! Brother, make a deal with your peers.
Call them by male names so your wife won't recognize them.
And I added two more for the new employee.
The new employee, he is a male employee.
A few days ago, the minister's office referred a man to work with us.
Are you serious!
It looks funny, this poor man, a man working among five women, looks funny.
They say his wife is extremely jealous of other women around him.
Blind jealousy
The poor, is in need.
But he asked us to be quiet when his wife called, so we complied and didn't speak.
Yes, Abdelkader who is with you in the office.
**Check if it fits your size.**
My son called and said my wife is coming to the office.
What are you doing?
Go straight, it's the first floor on your left.
This is at the social welfare office.
Translate the following text.
These are six employees.
And here, I'm sure he came to work.
These lies don't help me.
My wife is jealous of other women around me.
Because I'm handsome.
May God guide you, Sultan!
But we want to know what stage we've reached.
My uncle, Sakr, and I were at the bank yesterday.
that the project
Peace be upon you
Brother, I have an important meeting at work today.
Go to the kitchen quickly.
Dressed and ready to go out.
In fact, your place is the kitchen.
Women must obey men.
Scorpion stings are painful.
This is important for the rain, look look
Look, Uncle.
Aisha, please contact the secretary and ask him to inform the staff.
So, the meeting has been postponed until tomorrow.
I hope it's not serious.
They keep issuing orders.
And we must implement
They must realize that you are an important supervisor.
He has many responsibilities and obligations.
Women are considered servants.
I have never seen people who hate women as much as they do.
At what age do they believe they are living?
She asked me not to go to work today, and to go to the kitchen to make tea instead.
Where are the maids?
And the other one fled a week ago.
Even the servants couldn't bear their insults.
I understand them.
God be with you.
There is little paper money.
Tea
Uncle, they mean that they...
In fact, the villa complex is worthless without a park.
Alright, now, the park...
Sister, before you go, I'd like to talk to you about something.
Dear Fatima, I must go, I'm late.
Alright, tell me, what do you have?
Speak or I'll leave.
I perform it at school.
A committee from the Women's League came today.
The school nominated me to be on the committee.
Are you crazy?
And you want to go to the league.
Do you know that if you tell your uncle and brother about this, you won't see any good?
You are the one to blame.
We have warned you.
Why don't you come and visit me? It's been a long time since I last saw you.
A year has passed, a year since I saw you.
Is he married or not?
Oh God, guide him.
Who would agree to marry an illiterate woman with no certificate?
No, no, no, it doesn't matter if he's illiterate, he's a man.
And the fifth is the son of scorpions.
The scorpion's bite is painful.
And also, one must marry someone of the same social status.
A scorpion like him.
May God bless you.
What can I do, Aisah!
Since the minister's departure, all papers have been referred to me.
Inform Mustafa, the head of the HR department, that I would like to meet with him the day after tomorrow.
But the ministry's guests arrived today.
I have the schedule.
And now I'm free to talk to you, Oh! Aisha
Yes, Mary.
Okay, coming, alright, I'm coming now.
What should I say, Ayesha!
My brothers are the source of all these problems.
I don't know what happened.
Alright, sweetheart, ice packs are necessary to avoid swelling in your face.
Didn't we warn her not to go talk to them about this?
I went to them, they hit her.
Did you learn that I told them it was a football?
They would have defeated you a long time ago.
How embarrassing, you're playing soccer!
Next time, we'll break your neck.
Know who you're talking to.
The big spider
That little one
Yes, but Uncle, I didn't just defeat her, the Sultan did.
Did you hear that?
I chose economics and political science.
I chose graphics because they are in demand at the moment.
Engineering architecture!
It's not your turn.
You had your chance.
Don't be greedy.
Alright, scorpion.
Hit her and break her teeth in her mouth.
Let me defeat her.
She is here with me.
Go to the Scholarship Department.
And remove architecture.
Take your time.
To make sure
I spoke with Sultan and Saqr.
What matters to them is that you marry Manira.
What else do you want?
Yes, our son Khamis deserves all the best.
I'll arrange a meeting with them and let you know.
Your nomination to join the delegation.
I understand your personal circumstances.
But give yourself a chance to think about it until tomorrow.
To tell you the truth,
They care about you a lot.
And your nomination by the minister.
He is right.
I know my brothers very, very well.
They will never agree.
Surprising
Their car loans are paid from my salary.
I'm getting the house ready.
She wants me to travel with her too.
Why aren't we getting married this week?
What are you saying?
He's a stupid bumpkin, he doesn't even have a school certificate.
Get married and travel with him.
I'm done, let's go.
This is a shame.
They will kill her if she refuses.
My son, I've told you time and again.
Why don't you go?
Tomorrow, I will go tomorrow.
It doesn't matter, as long as he's a Scorpion's son.
Appearance doesn't matter.
I don't want to marry Khamis.
Go to the kitchen.
Put it in the living room.
The Madrid and Barcelona match will be tonight.
I hope Valencia doesn't defeat us.
My sources are reliable.
She is loyal and works hard.
What do you think about that?
What do you want me to do?
We need to go.
Please proceed to your offices.
Thank you, may God grant you a long life.
Long life
Serve the coffee there.
Happiness
Oh God, prolong her life.
Hello, may God grant you a long life.
Good evening, sir.
Yes, God prolongs your life.
Did you wash the coffee cups?
Go and pour coffee for Captain Emad.
And also
We will play in China the day after tomorrow.
Yes, Captain, I forgot to introduce you to my sister Mary.
I will go to the official engagement party.
Are you stupid?
You don't know anything in life, and you want to marry a minister.
Say hello to %pw
Yes, ma'am.
Empty it and make a new one.
Actors' Calls
You know, Masha also called me a few minutes ago.
What can I say to her?
This is unfortunate, Ron's role is not suitable for Mashal.
Nouf is a sixteen-year-old girl.
And Mashael appears to be in her twenties.
Well, why doesn't she take Mary's role?
Suits her better.
Nouf is thirty.
We need to get rid of the hardliner on the committee.
He's a troublemaker, I'm sure he won't let it go smoothly.
It's detailed.
He will talk about art, family values, moral art, content, etc.
Who chose him for that committee?
The minister is the one who formed the committee.
You, me, and Hamed can influence him.
No, no, no, this is impossible.
There's nothing to indicate that they are ours.
Even if he went and asked at the Ministry of Economy,
He won't find our names.
The company was registered under the name of Hamad's wife, may God protect her.
Don't worry about that.
Don't worry, in fact, who is the head of the committee?
The last word is mine.
No, no, man, everything is fine, please come in.
I contacted them and we agreed on everything.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, welcome, hello
As you know, this meeting is specifically to determine whether we will approve the "Conscience Extortion" series or not.
And they are produced by the Institute of Arts for the modern recipient.
It's a beautiful, unusual, and bold serial work.
I agree with Hamad.
The story of the series is very beautiful.
I agree with you.
I admired you when you took the weapon and killed your neighbor.
She wanted to hide the weapon, so she put it in the car.
And he didn't know it was for her son, it's exciting, and when the police came.
And her son comes from school.
And kick the box.
He kicked it, and it flew into his mother's window.
Here's the surprise.
This part of the box goes into the mother's room.
And it's a good thing that a local company is producing this advanced level of output.
We need to encourage and support them.
Mr. Rashid, you didn't share your opinion with us.
You left me something unspoken.
With all due respect to your opinions and reflections on the series, this is "conscientious extortion."
Exploiting human values
Disgusting surprises
One and a half people per ring.
The other half is left for the next episode.
This series is written without social awareness.
Does not carry a moral message that helps society progress.
Tears fall, why should they make the viewers cry?
Sorry, Rashid.
You've given us your opinion, and Ali has given his. Let Mr. Rashid express his opinion.
It is clear from the meeting.
There is an agreement between you both.
I organized it.
Some people understand, and this is their field, while others have nothing to do with the field.
I don't agree with that chain.
I'm afraid he'll get us into trouble.
Ignore him.
What can he do? He can't do anything.
I'll do what I want.
He gave me the bag and said it was from Ms. Samira.
I don't know what to do.
I can't believe it! Oh! Nasser
This is for the new series we will produce soon.
The driver rapes the man's daughter.
For the gifts we have through her.
The first blessing is the beautiful ring on your hand.
I'll tell you how.
They are displaying it in the name of Hamad's wife, who sent you the ring.
And your husband's role was to cover their backs.
He has a five percent share of the production.
It's a beautiful role.
I just played a similar role, didn't you see "Lost Dreams"?
By the way
It's called "extorting something," I can't remember it.
Yes, extorting dreams.
Why are all the names similar?
Last year's series were all about girls.
You notice that each chain has more than eight or even ten girls.
Your place is guaranteed.
You are very beloved.
Good luck to you.
Yes, Omar.
Yes, alright alright.
Sorry, my love, I have to go to work, I don't know what happened there.
Eat, then go.
He said he wanted to see me on a very important and urgent matter.
I have to go.
I heard that Rashid met with the minister.
Spent half an hour with him.
And tell him you'll give him trouble.
I told you that he complained about us to the minister.
What happened was that the minister's office called and wants to meet me.
I, too, am afraid the minister will believe it.
I will meet with the minister.
The man came to clarify his viewpoint about the series.
This is all.
This is true, may you live long.
But first, sir, I would like to say that it is not acceptable to talk about a colleague behind his back.
Everyone knows that Rashid is
He is envious of everyone around him.
He cares only about financial gain.
But it's his specialty.
But, God bless you, no educated person can handle these technical matters.
Television productions in particular
Awareness of extortion, the series we're working on.
It's a massive production.
We will launch a media initiative at the Gulf level.
Strong distribution
Certainly, it's your specialty, you know more about this than I do.
I promise you a wonderful series.
He will defend our name.
Look what the journalist Abdul Hamid wrote, listen, listen.
As one actor said
That the series promotes immoral ideas.
That which is limited to the fall of modesty.
This is indeed bold and powerful criticism.
They will be in big trouble if journalist Abdelhamid continues writing articles about them.
And if the people I appoint know this.
But they are sharp, they know how to handle her.
They are beautiful.
We need to create our own website.
List all our company's activities.
What's the name of the company again?
From now on, you are the media advisor.
The Venus Media Production-supervised Conscience Extortion series is considered to be
A Quantum Leap in Arabic Drama
Because it carries ideas and moral values.
It's a series aimed at developing society.
It's the same journalist who criticized them a few days ago.
Is it possible for him to change his mind to the opposite?
How can he accept that?
The journalist Abdelhamid and others like him
Don't worry, Mr. Hamad.
He asked me: What do you think of the series? I told him: It will be the best in the Arab world.
I hope so.
I feel our series will be a hit.
I don't know where he is.
The other is packing his bags and ready to leave.
An uninteresting beginning.
Your stories are always unrealistic, and the events never actually happened.
It's clear at first glance.
Your books are stupid.
It's possible.
Your necklace is stupid, stupid.
What do you think?
Very tragic
Other bad series are no excuse.
This output can be understood at first glance.
These are subtle lines and dimensions, you need someone focused to discover them.
By the way, it's a political drama.
It is criticized that he was seen.
What's wrong?
You weren't this nervous yesterday.
I was at Souq Waqif with Ali yesterday.
We were at a café.
I ignored myself.
Nasser, what do you think about what happened? If the minister is angry, it's a big problem.
Within a week, we'll all be fired.
What a failed series, everyone who watched it said it was a flop.
I heard that Rashid is planning to visit him.
And tell him that the chain is a failure and there is no action in it.
This is a disaster.
Leave it to me.
Let's see what Nasser will do.
Listen, Eli!
From now on, I don't want any criticism of the serial on your page.
Please give it to him.
A few days ago, I saw an article that not only criticized the production but also cursed those behind it.
Don't make me angry.
I'm sorry.
On that day, I was free.
I will never allow them to write that.
But frankly, I haven't received any message worthy of praise.
Once again, a resounding success.
Goodbye
My brother Rashid,
Should I believe you or the newspapers?
Awareness of blackmail is the best TV show.
May you live longer, they have an agreement.
Listen to what the other newspaper wrote.
Do they also have an agreement with the viewers' page?
I almost had a heart attack.
At some point, tell me.
Good luck, the minister is satisfied.
Frankly, Nasser,
Be ready to watch "Conscience Extortion 2"
No, no, no, no, enough! Oh! Brother,
He said the series, I will not write again, as he said.
He prefers to stay in his miserable job.
Part Two, After All This Trouble
Third and fourth as well.
What's wrong with you, don't you want to benefit?
One of his friends told me.
Here I am
What can a magician do?
I wish you more success.
Please tell us what you think about that success.
I thank God for that success.
They are haters and enemies of our success.
I find that strange.
That this series wins awards while being a failed series.
But they are the experts.
They awarded her the prizes, certain that they saw what we didn't.
Create a second part of the series.
Well, may you live long.
A real wizard.
You will see, "blackmail of conscience" is a...
I saw you talking to the minister at the beginning of the event.
TV festivals lie too!
I heard him say, "Get ready for part two."
It's the same thing.
They are brought to the bank to be washed so they become clean.
All the weak, silly, and immoral series you watch.
They nominate her in Arab and Gulf festivals.
To clean it and award it, so people will see it as first-class.
Yes, that's correct.
As long as the courts are the producers themselves.
Peace be upon you
"Peace be upon you, praise be to God for arriving."
It's true that we signed a contract with them, but they want to lower the prices.
Come to my office.
We are not a small bakery or a bread shop.
We are one of the largest bakery companies in the world.
We won't lower it.
Otherwise, we will terminate the contract.
We already signed a contract yesterday.
With the British company.
A cup and a saucer.
As you like it
He did a great job.
He will be the first person in the world to produce that product.
Not only the best baker in the world
I'll tell you.
How can bread be with a zipper?
You can either open it with your hand or go to the kitchen and look for a knife to cut it, and you might cut your hand.
So he made bread with a zipper.
Put the cheese back and close it again.
This is not bread, it's a pair of pants.
So, in reality, it's a bag of bread.
How can we remove that zipper?
So, he can tell his friend: "I ate two locks."
Why weren't the Noor Mountains Hospital sweets delivered yesterday?
I know, but why didn't you hand it in yesterday?
The bakers who make it
Again, use the bakers.
This is what happened, sir.
Why are you shouting at him?
You're wasting your time with football and delaying my work.
You know your son loves football.
So what, what's the problem if some employees from the company take some for entertainment?
The company has four hundred employees.
Eleven starting players
Four substitute players, two administrative assistants, that's all, just seventeen.
And the team's spokesperson
Why are you angry with him?
But this is acceptable for now. Although the fans are the most important players on the field, they are the twelfth player.
Let you enjoy them.
We have already signed a contract with the people.
When I first told you he wanted to play soccer.
Listen to you.
He did nothing.
No, you're only angry at him because he took some employees to play football in front of him and enjoy themselves.
I didn't say he couldn't take some employees.
Even if some of your friends need some staff, you can lend him some of them.
Important bakers
Yes, my son, why would important bakers do that, it cannot be.
Next time, tell me before you hire any staff.
No, no, let Hamdy do this paperwork.
He is in the hospital.
Why didn't they tell you?
I finished my work, and as I was entering my car
Nasser called me.
I went to him.
He said they couldn't find a goalkeeper and they have an important match today.
He told us to find a goalkeeper, and then we arrived at the stadium.
Wear the goalkeeper's outfit.
I've never played soccer and I've never touched a ball.
That case
Impossible
And we'll find you a job instead of wasting your time on football.
Let me clarify.
Father, you want me to disband and dismiss the team, don't you?
Yes, that's correct.
Alright, Dad, please, I beg you.
I can't let the team go, tomorrow is the final match.
No, no, no, he's right.
Do you agree?
Congratulations on the win.
Congratulations to Mr. Nasser on winning the cup.
We wanted to know how you planned to win.
Look, I've prepared the team psychologically, physically, and mentally, and the coach has worked hard.
At the hotel
Congratulations to you all, and there will be a party as promised.
Your father seems happy.
I'm afraid he's just acting polite and well-mannered.
Uncle Abu Nasser, first of all, we would like to congratulate you on the great victory of your team, the International Bakers Team.
For such a huge success
God bless you, no, no, no.
No picture without a "bisht" (the traditional Arab cloak for men), wait, wait, hold it.
No, no
He is wearing a bisht.
Your interest, diligence, and creative insights played a significant role in this success, undoubtedly.
And the coach's plan
But, they played 5-5-3-2 in the finals.
And as an athlete, you know that changing the game plan confuses players, yet you didn't confuse the baking team and did a great job.
And the coach's plan
Bo Nasser, as the first athlete in the International Bakers Team, what do you suggest players do?
To eternity
Hello hello
Long life
Welcome them, is Hamad Sultan with them?
They are welcome to visit us, but they must have dinner with us first.
Dinner, done!
Thank you, Abu Abdulaziz!
And this is considered a contribution to the private sector.
The team is still young.
Don't envy me.
No, who?
Bu Abdulaziz
Our engines' deputy that we use in the factory.
You see.
I've wanted to know him for a long time.
Football hurt him, I reminded him of that.
I said to him, "Oh! Abu Abdulaziz!"
You've never been interested in football your whole life.
What's your involvement in this?
The ball was always close to me, just fifty centimeters separated us.
Has Abu Nasser not arrived yet?
No, he didn't show up today either.
There is a seminar on football injuries, he is the silver sponsor, he should be there.
You will see more.
Did you see the building behind the bakery that he wanted to convert into worker housing?
He is obsessed with football.
As is customary, we tend to meet and interview a figure in the sports field.
This man inspires the bakery team with his great ideas.
What about the International Bakery Team? We heard you're undergoing a comprehensive overhaul.
Compared to offices and all efforts
It's a small amount of money, just a million dollars for all this effort.
No man, be generous.
It's not my mistake, brother Shain.
My mistake.
So what's my mistake then?
She told me you need players for the Gulf countries.
Gulf prices are very high.
If a player is assigned 2000
For his purpose, it costs three or four million dollars.
I don't understand it, explain it to me.
Receive fax here
And read it to me when you have it with you.
My father bought four new players for the team, in addition to a new batch of four players.
You know, he's amazing. He can easily defeat Pelé and Ronaldinho.
But 800,000 is written on it.
Yes, that's correct, God bless you, but it was a Turkish club that set this price.
In the UAE, it is sold for one million and two hundred thousand.
Don't look at me.
Alright, can we examine the goods?
He is here.
Calf of the leg
Sweet, perfect.
No, no, no, I don't guarantee you.
He is fat, God willing, it's better that he is fat.
This is slim, suitable for the middle.
The connecting muscle
It is the most important muscle, a player is useless without it.
Thank you.
Let your driver take them to the Automatic Club, Automatic, what did you say? Automatic.
How does this happen?
Hamdi, let's go.
Congratulations, congratulations
These, God bless you, are young players.
Yes, we bring them from the forests of Africa.
We feed them and raise them, then release them into the playgrounds.
I have a server, please take it, do you have a place for it or can you transport it with your moving truck?
When he saw that they were putting pressure on us.
The offending player was asked to play.
They were not told about it.
Ask the defenders to play.
Kagumakakani Lololo was supposed to play.
He is a beginner coach.
Even if it's on Mars.
Spain! Even if it's trained on Mars.
I don't like how he runs the game.
This should be on the way to the north.
There are rules to the game.
Even if it's just for two days.
What's happening, why are you screaming?
Your stupid son
He is not convinced that the coach is not an expert in football.
Listen to her, she speaks like "Mitsu".
He knows that the mistake player Silulu Tekawawa is a good central player, as Ahmed El-Tayeb said.
No one will give you a headache.
Mere distance
I know how to handle him.
Why did the team lose ground?
The team is supposed to think about changing the plan.
Because the players are not playing in their positions.
If the player "Takulamaka" is in an incorrect position, he should be moved to his usual place.
Ask the coach to change ...
Hobo Way Malalo's dismissal
Well, well, well
No, no, no, no, what's happening in the stadium?
This is not supposed to happen.
The coach shouldn't do that.
Please defer these issues until the game is over.
People are watching this, it's happening in front of the camera.
Fourth goal for Al-Najah team, the ball entered the goal area.
He scored the fourth goal, he's the star of the match today.
This coach is unaware.
Tell him, Uncle Nasser no longer wants you as a coach for his team.
And you, be quiet.
I'm watching the game on TV and you're playing as a substitute, do as I ask you to do.
Don't do that, it's not good.
We have a match tomorrow. How are we going to play without a coach?
What does your father do?
Enough! Oh! Rashid
What's wrong with you? You scared me, tell me what's wrong with you?
Divorce me, mother, divorce me.
I divorced you! How is that?
I don't know, Mother, I don't know.
Why did he divorce you? You were married for less than a month.
I swear to God, mother, I don't know, I don't know how.
He divorced you without a reason!
Yes, Mother, yes.
I swear to God, mother, I don't know. He suddenly came and told me, "Go to your family's house."
I asked him why? He said: "You're divorced."
I swear to God, I don't know what's happening?
Their marriage lasted only a month. What will people say about us?
I agree with you.
I don't know what to say.
I only know that he's divorced you now.
Sit. I'll be back in a minute.
Because of her high morals.
Insulted Barcelona.
Light of my eye, Abdullah.
He came to me crying.
He said he disrespected Barcelona, a team he's a big fan of and respects.
She insulted him and hurt his feelings.
He told me that his mother had spoken ill of Barcelona, so I told him to divorce her and I would find you another wife.
Telling him that your daughter is divorced because of her insults to Barcelona team.
Just, that's why he divorced her, are you serious.
I don't care.
Is it easy to hurt someone's feelings?
The wife doubts her husband's loyalty.
I can't believe what I'm hearing!
We don't need a girl who doesn't respect international differences.
This time, you started making fun of Messi.
Problems arise between couples, and we must address them.
Instead of one, there are a thousand girls.
There are many girls who want to marry him.
Listen to me.
I don't want to hear anything.
And please don't interfere. This is my son and I know him well.
I told you it's none of your business.
I'll be angry with you.
Don't trouble yourself, my son, and don't think about it.
Instead of one, there are a thousand girls.
Why are you angry!
When I remember her words
Real Madrid is better than Barcelona.
Okay, my love.
What's wrong with her?
Her name is Mona.
Married for one month?
If I tell you her story and why she got divorced, you won't stop laughing.
To involve you with him, we need your attention.
What's the point of dealing with someone like this? He divorced his wife for a football team.
The hairdresser knows them and told me the whole story, Mom. Don't involve me in this; I don't want to have a problem with someone like that.
That is, you're listening to shaving nonsense.
Tell them I didn't accept.
Let her say her nonsense and say what she wants to say.
Wealth is coming to her.
I told her, "Girl, don't stop your luck."
If it's just her luck, I don't care at all.
But she will stop her luck and ours with her.
This building
He won't refuse me.
God is sufficient against this bad barber.
They hear a rumor and spread it.
Don't listen to her.
Tell her and make her understand not to close the door of opportunities that will open for us.
He knows how to convince her.
You must be joking. Do you think he divorced his wife because of Barcelona?
Forget all this nonsense and don't be crazy.
Don't miss the opportunity.
And perhaps she is the reason or something wrong with her made him divorce her.
Listen, girl! Don't let Abu Borgain slip through your fingers.
What is this, a two-towered father?
But when they get closer, they discover they are two towers.
This is what earned his father the nickname "Shahin Abu Borgain."
Welcome, I hope.
Oh, no, no, no. Sweet. Thank you. Thank you.
Yes, thank you. Please.
Oh, may your life be long (figuratively), they have already taken the money from you, you signed, and they are spending the money.
Happy Ambassador, I was inattentive and you seem to be very busy, this was a month ago.
The first marriage was a month ago, this is a new marriage, divorced.
He also married and divorced.
Yes, this is his third marriage.
And that's his story, oh! Brother, be firm with him.
Oh my God! Man, this is a tough generation.
Opinion and Counter-Opinion
Congratulations, congratulations my daughter!
My daughter, don't forget your cloak, I put it on top of the bag.
Carry it with you as you board the plane.
When you arrive in London
Yes, my son, don't you want to go to London?
Hello, Mother.
Alright, that's good.
So you can come with us and drive as well.
Malaysia, Malaysia.
Take the fur with you to Malaysia.
Goodbye, Mother.
What's wrong with her?
I don't know.
I ask her and I don't know what's happening.
Tell me, my daughter, what's the matter?
You did well to ignore her.
She is nothing.
On your honeymoon, you're supposed to be taken care of in every way.
Is it logical for her to sit while you pour the water?
And the bottle by your side, it's what you hold and it lets you drink.
You didn't have a good upbringing.
You should have told her that since my birth, I only drink water from my mother's hand.
What's wrong with her?
You look very sad.
And who is this lady with her?
His name is Mashal.
Sad is she, divorced during the honeymoon.
Won't you believe me if I tell you her story?
Oh, bless you! Thank you, Auntie.
Your aunt and aunts requested.
Yes, but I don't know where the mother booked us?
Hello, Mother.
Where did you book us?
Because she wants to go there with us.
There is no power or authority except from God.
Why did he do that at the airport and why did he take the children?
What happened between them?
You ask me, I don't know what happened between them!
In fact, this makes no sense.
So, where's Monira?
She's in her room talking to this idiot.
Now she says she has been calling him for two days and his phone is switched off.
I just found it.
We're waiting to see what he has.
How do you know he's angry? The boy comes from outside tired and wants to relax.
Every day I tell my mom to peel the apples, but she doesn't. It bothers me every day.
And you know I don't like the apple with its skin.
Don't peel the apple.
Hello, let me tell you
You are divorced.
And if necessary, another one as well.
Go, my dear.
Go, my dear.
Monira, what did he say?
Why are you angry too!
Call him three times and tell him you're divorced.
Be quiet, God gives you health.
I don't know, mom, who saw me at the disco in Spain and told him.
He has nothing to say.
Yes, he has nothing to say.
You will dance twice or three times.
Let him die who divorced my daughter.
How did he divorce you?
Where are you going?
Where am I going? I'm going to vent my anger on this outrageous man.
She has a tail like a peacock.
Adorned with gold, rubies, coral, and diamonds.
The other girls are a game for you and your son.
They have no families, no mothers with a bad taste in their mouths.
Who are you mocking?
And you will divorce them as you love.
She didn't help you drink water, and she dissed Barcelona, divorce her and forget her.
Who went to a nightclub?
Without shame or hesitation.
A ministry agent, Arab and Muslim.
He cares about his reputation and that of his children.
Stay still and don't move.
Show some humanity.
It was my son's.
Who sells land like this?
Abu Sakr took it from his father by force.
Why is he selling it?
God guides him. If Abu Saqr wants something, can anyone say no to him?
Leave it to God, man.
Come here, come here.
Let's go, let's go.
What happened to your project, Abu Saad?
As you know.
Okay, last week you said you were going to his office?
I told you, if you want to manage your project, you have to start driving it.
Abu Sakr, this great billionaire
Doesn't he eat? Isn't there anyone in this world who doesn't eat?
This is not the problem, brother. We'll let him eat, make him feel full, and fill his belly. The problem is how to get to him.
And you must know the key to Abu Saqr so that all the doors will open for you.
I meet him during Umrah and greet him more than once.
You don't need to know him as long as you pay him and run your business, all you need to know is the right time.
When the secretary told me that Abu Sakr was waiting for you for dinner.
I came immediately.
Abu Sakr, may God preserve him, has a feast every day.
Oh my God! A man, anyone.
He loves to socialize and hang out with friends.
It's so wonderful to stay at this farm at night.
Yes, sir, this is Abu Nasser, the owner of the car agency behind the mall.
He wants to meet Your Highness.
I got the license.
Like my son who got his license.
Thank you, may God bless you.
Congratulations on the license, Sager.
May God bless you.
Abu Sakr
I asked you not to disappoint me, say yes.
Just say yes, Your Honor.
As a gift for him.
And please, don't say no.
Do your best.
That means you met him easily and talked to him.
Don't be stupid.
Yes, all good, Abu Nasser.
Tell me what technology is, what have you done?
Circumstances served me.
When we were sitting with him.
His son has just got his license.
I have a gift to read.
If it's about the car,
This is easy.
Oh, please take me to him.
Yes, that happened.
I just got out of the hospital.
He underwent a tonsillectomy.
And he will certainly hold a feast.
You deserve your son's health, sir!
We hope he recovers, we hope he recovers more, God willing, he will not see any harm, God willing.
And we met at the prayer hall.
I think so too.
Oh my God! We forget and grow old.
They told me your son was in the next room and had already left.
So I thought I should visit you.
And our congratulations on the recovery of Falcon.
Listen, sir, you shouldn't go without having dinner with us.
I'm not in the mood for it.
Just say yes at the beginning.
Because our beloved son Shain left the hospital.
In the Corniche Tower.
Just say yes.
Oh my son, don't insist.
Mother, don't try, I don't like business and I'm not inclined towards it.
Who can start a business without capital these days?
At the vehicle and crane agency, he said: Let him just point.
Love is from God, and people love you because of their love for your father.
Until university,
All the doctors love and respect your father.
Most of them are in his office every night.
Masha'Allah, everyone loves your father, you just point him out.
Goodness! People take loans from banks to start a company or business.
Am I sitting in the supermarket?
Have you opened a pickled vegetable store?
This is also something new.
This is Sakar, my dear, he brought them to me yesterday and said they were samples, try them.
He only took their agency yesterday.
You see.
He also told me that all businessmen are like me; if only all people were like you.
Yes, Your Honor.
On my way to the office.
I saw a new supermarket.
They were counting on her.
Truly, I love her.
I don't know who owns it.
Congratulations, congratulations oh! Uncle Falcon, congratulations
May God bless you.
In the name of God, In the name of God
Who is he to offer as a partner and take her so easily (figuratively).
You, you can now say no.
So, where's the problem?
What should I say?
Be his partner.
Don't you know who his father is?
Who doesn't know his father!
I said I was Qasem Abbas's friend. He asked me if I had work experience.
I said that, praise be to God, I have a bakery and earn a living from it.
No, no, I don't like the name.
What I noticed.
No, oh! My brother, the name is not beautiful.
So this is a suitable name for Iranian bread.
Understood, big bread.
Qasim, we'll call it the Big Bread Bakery.
Wait for me a little.
Peace be upon you.
Peace and blessings be upon you, my lord.
Excellent, excellent, so do you need anything or any assistance?
No, thank God, everything is fine.
Ayad, she's a new employee here!
She sent her car for repairs, sir, and came to take mine because she's an advertising agent in a marketing company and can't do anything without her car.
You might need your car as well.
No, I don't need the car today.
Alright, no problem.
This is the age of science, knowledge, and study.
I agree with Dr. Rashid that everyone should have sufficient knowledge in their field, whatever that field may be.
Excellent! Oh! Dr. Sami
Yes, Your Honor.
Study and study.
You're repeating what's in the books.
He didn't study either business or economics.
He has never read a book in his life, and even a newspaper—I have never seen a sheet of paper in his hands throughout his life.
You all know who Sager is today.
I didn't want him to get into this business and %pw, but
His uncle, Abu Nasser, is here alive before you.
Who loves him.
But there are people who are born for trade, and by nature, they love trade.
You're right, Doctor!
Insha'Allah! O Shaykhah, may you be like your brother.
God is generous, God willing.
It's still early.
This depends on education.
No one can be like you (metaphorically) Oh! Dr.
Frankly.
How did Sakr, who hates trade, easily reach this great economic feeling?
If they count a hundred billionaires in the world today, they will count them among them.
Do you know Oh! Abu Saqr?
He had chosen Sakar to chair the market.
Peace be upon you.
How are you, Nasser!
Mohammed called me and told me that Abu Nasser was in the hospital.
Do you remember when you once told me that you heard Sagar ibn Abu Sagar wanted to take over the car dealership from his father?
You no longer have the agency.
People are never satisfied.
Help your father enter the market.
He opened his eyes to commerce.
Frankly, the doctor said he was in critical condition.
This won't work.
Nothing works.
Crashed or collided, not my business, I say you're going to take it off, take it off and you have to take it off.
There is a people like this in the 21st century.
We meet with our dear viewers with one of the kind and generous men in this country.
A man who knows the way to the poor and deprived.
So, we have the founder and owner of the Sajar Charity Foundation.
Certainly, if we speak, Sir, about this organization,
We all know your noble goals that you are trying to achieve in the world and for everyone, of course.
Without hypocrisy or a desire for fame, may God spare us.
Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds. Recently, we were able to provide thirty sacrifices for our brothers in Africa.
And now, praise be to God, we are ready to deliver.
Seven boxes of candy for our children in Gaza.
"Masha'Allah, sir, may God increase the likes of you."
My wife and I just left home.
But my wife will be passing by for half an hour to open her new project.
And I will wait for her.
Alright.
I really love their atmosphere and enjoy sitting with them. I truly have a great time.
And it's also a source of income for my children.
He is my whole life.
I think you want to waste my time.
Avoid problems.
Alright, hot bread, hot bread.
Let's go, oh! People.
There is a people like this in the 21st century.
There is a people like this in the 21st century.
If anyone wants to dive, diving requires effort.
You need brave men.
Live in the standing market.
You deserve it, you deserve it, congratulations, congratulations.
May God bless you all.
"Masha'Allah, everyone loves you, Sheikh! Oh! Love is good."
I want to say something, but please say yes.
On the occasion of getting his license, my son Shahin must go to the showroom and choose the best and most expensive car as a gift from me to him.
Breezes blew upon us from the valley's cleft.
Oh breezes, for love, take me home.
Hello Fadi.
How are you, Anood?
No, no, no, no, no.
You told me the dress would be ready in a week, and yesterday you texted me saying it would be ready in ten days! Oh! Fool!
And you want your dress with crystals, which takes more time.
And if God wills, you will start talking to Alanoud and ignore me?
How many lights do we have?
No, no, no, no, no, let the whole world disturb, but Anond will not be disturbed.
What more do you need, Fadi? They're starting to get jealous.
Oh my God, I love the way they speak, I'm jealous of them unlike our people.
Don't let me forget about it.
Is my dress ready?
Here you are, Fadi.
Thank you, my brother Fadi.
My brother Fadi, I'll come next week to get the dress, bye.
How can I assist you?
Send the dress to my house only.
No, I didn't like it.
Whatever God wills, today I went to Fadi at the shop, he's doing exceptional work and girls are coming and going.
Thank God, we were very successful in this project.
What's the problem?
Abu Nasser, my uncle.
What's wrong with him?
Look at the jealousy!
And we never heard him start a business, where will this bankrupt get the money from?
Open their mouths, plunder!
And when he starts his business,
Sure?
I heard some rumors.
And if God wills, what will you do?
7 a.m.
Do you want him to bring you breakfast?
No, thank you, I've already had breakfast.
But I want to talk to you about something.
I heard that you,
You want to start a business.
I know nothing about such matters, may God guide you, cousin.
Design, women's fashion design, and so on?
Who lied to you?
I'm a businessman!
No, no, no, no, no, no, but, I
You need advice, you need %pw. I'm ready if you need any help.
Thank you, thank you oh! Uncle, thank you.
So if you want to give me a chance, I have to leave.
Come in, welcome director!
The first time you tell me if I need a raise.
So, oh! Fadi cleaned the shop. I see you're busy.
The store is no longer sufficient.
I said you should rent the shop next door, rely on God, and take it.
I hope so.
Have they rented the shop next to them?
Is there anyone named Khalifa Sultan Al-Saifi other than your cousin Abu Nasser?
No, there isn't?
I'm from the Ministry of Economy. I saw his name on a transaction for my friend. His name is Ismail, and he's in charge of his papers.
Women's fashion design
Sure?
I saw the contract and wrote his name on it.
What's wrong with it, what's wrong, what's wrong with it?
What's wrong with it, what's wrong with it, what's the matter, there's a fault in it.
Your sick heart didn't stop you.
When I saw that my project was successful,
You said I should destroy it.
This is an open market for everyone.
%pw Abu Nasser.
Is he a shepherd? And what does he say?
And I was testing you, I told you, do you intend to start a project?
I didn't lie to you, man.
Secrecy is the best policy.
I don't care about you or your demands.
But this doesn't lead you.
Man, it's a living, and everyone takes their livelihood.
You've defeated me.
Oh my son, you are uncles and cousins.
No, no, no, Abu Saleh crossed the border.
You hit me in my own home!
Open to everyone!
You are brothers.
My friend Ibrahim advised me.
Bring a Lebanese designer.
I am a lady, ask me.
I know our women, they love Lebanese men.
Oh my God! Madam, this looks amazing on you, no, no, no this dress, this dress is unlike anything else in all of Doha.
Ah, this suits you, madam, and such kind words and a piece worth a thousand they sell for thirty and forty thousand.
Yes, do as he does.
As you know, the cabinet I made last year when I brought the Lebanese carpenter.
Oh! Madam, I will design for you a wardrobe unprecedented in all of Doha.
Look, if you want to achieve success.
What exactly did he do wrong?
Why don't you know?
That means he stole from the clients.
What do you see in moving to another place, Sir Director!
Don't mention it, don't mention it! Oh! Fadi.
By this time, they will be playing by themselves.
That means we're defeated, no!
We need to confront them!
And we're bringing our customers back, whether they like it or not.
Do you have money to pay?
I'll pay.
I'm ready to do anything.
But most importantly, he won't defeat me.
This dress that you chose is valued at sixty thousand riyals.
Certainly, without ties in the middle.
This is a gift from the designer, from me.
And I clothed you in a crystal from it, for there are only fifty pieces of this crystal in all the countries of the world, and this piece is unique.
Certainly there is no discount, our prices are internationally known.
No, of course not, who would do that?
Lady, wait, wait, what's the matter? What happened?
Leave us alone, you hypocrite, leave us alone.
Is this something they do?
They killed us; we have no more clients.
This is called war, Abu Nasser!
We're just watching!
We need to fight them as they fight us, and we must also retaliate.
Tomorrow I will borrow from the bank.
And I will start a war against them, and you will see what I will do.
Abu Nasser won't stop.
Check the ad!
Check his ad!
We offer two free evening dresses with every wedding dress.
He made four evening dresses with each wedding dress.
We publish a quarter-page ad.
Look, he's publishing a half-page ad.
What was his intention to do that!
Do you believe me or Nasser?
For six days, not a single customer entered their store.
No, and even until this afternoon they haven't opened, they are closed.
And you will hear that he has put his shop up for sale.
I'll kill him, I'll kill him.
They couldn't even sit there, so he sat outside.
Alright, drink your tea and go to him.
What tea does God give you? I can't drink it, that's the problem.
Is there anyone bearing a grudge against you?
There's someone God bless you who deliberately sprayed the store with this smell.
They are chemicals.
Are you sure someone sprayed a scent in the store?
You are both adults, not children, to fight like children.
He came at night and sprayed a foul smell in the shop, is that fair?
I didn't spray anything that smells like you.
Do not cross the line.
I signed an undertaking at the police station.
Don't worry.
This time,
I've prepared a hell of a plane for him.
Without anyone realizing my mistake.
No, everything is fine.
This is what surprises me.
I swear I don't know what's going on, this is the fourth day that not a single customer has entered our store.
Oh my God, this isn't the store, we have to go to the other store, I've revealed my face, oh God, we seek your help.
And what did the doctor tell you?
The store is empty and no customers are entering.
I don't know, as if they had cast a spell on him.
Women and girls do not approach the store.
As if a spell had turned Saad into a beast.
Possible, anything is possible these days.
There is magic, and it is evil.
Well, is he asleep or awake?
Go and look at it, for heaven's sake! Brother, go, I'm afraid the ceiling will fall.
You're lost, Sultan! You're lost.
I don't know, he turned him into a dog!
He turned him into a monster!
Calm down, brother, don't get angry.
I don't know what he did.
Tell me, my love, what did you do to him? They say his friends have started collecting money and paying off his debts.
It's his design.
He is not Lebanese.
I told him, didn't I?
Don't you know where he is?
Stars are the same and we desperately search for that extra one.
Call the man again, he might have an emergency.
What's wrong with you, Uncle Ahmed!
What's wrong with you, man! Ahmed, you're just sitting there while the manager is yelling at me! What am I supposed to do? Where are those damn extras you said you'd bring today?
It's better for you to leave me alone, I've been in touch with him and even Mr. Abdullah got a headache.
First, don't shout, we're actors and we want to rest a bit, we need to focus on our roles. Second, the man called more than once in front of me, just calm down.
What are you saying, Mr. Abdullah, what are you saying?
Oh! Mr. Abdullah, what should I do now? The director will end the scene and shout at me.
All right, guys.
We want to wrap things up, but the additional people who are supposed to act in the scene haven't arrived yet.
No one wants to be shouted at, right?
Do your work quietly and without shouting.
This is our situation, always screaming, since morning. We need to focus.
I've found a solution for you.
What do you see in managing yourself with a scene, even if I bring you an actor who does a good job in the role, God willing?
It's true that he'll be acting in one scene.
But that scene is the most important scene in the series.
But please, sir, go and shoot now please.
But if you're not ready today, I'll resign.
Guys, let's go upstairs.
I'll tell you something, there's a Filipino, is that okay?
You don't know Abu Walid, he will resign immediately. He needs someone who is like elite, he should be the elite and a Qatari.
Oh! Man, he'll wear a keffiyeh and a ghutrah, no one will notice.
Are you serious, Alaa? You just want the easy way out. This is disrespectful to people's feelings and intelligence.
Alaa gave you all the responsibilities, distributed the tasks, and you'll be free of worries.
Calm down so we can think. Focus your thoughts with me, you might remember one of your friends.
Who is he?
Ahmad, do you remember anyone in the Salata neighborhood named Saud Bouqtam?
The same as Saudi sidr.
Say "Saudi Qaness"!
The manager said he needs a wealthy man of stature, and you say cans.
Dear, by the end of the day it's extra, you will bring a rich and famous man for an extra role.
But with a little makeup, Reem, in her abaya and clean thobe, and the luxurious car.
Please be appropriate.
How can we reach him?
I know their house.
Peace be upon you.
Happy hunting?
So, who is he?
Yes, yes, yes, that's it, that's it.
Yes, it's him, thank you very much.
And now, how will you manage, Mother? There's no other headscarf besides this triple one that Uncle brought from abroad.
Do you only have the one you're wearing?
My son, here she is inside the closet under my clothes.
Mom, people are waiting outside, where should I put them?
Oh, may God help you, my son!
That means I'll be watching you today and you'll be on TV.
Yes, Mother, they said I'll be on TV as one of the elite.
Sit down, you ... you scoundrel!
Dude, what is this? It's all over you.
Cracked, cracked.
Here it is, Mom.
Quickly, Mother, are you feeling better?
God willing, my son!
God willing, they will only give you some money.
God help you.
Pray for me.
I'll bring you your Saudi computer, your Saudi laptop.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Is this Abuud, son of Fatima, Abuud?
Hello, hello.
Hello, Saud?
Will he perform the scene?
Yes, yes, Inshallah, he will do a good job, be quiet and silent, until they give you a complex role.
Tell me how your mother is.
She is not the same person who used to gather the boxwood shrubs.
Shame on you, shame on you, be quiet.
You are now wearing glasses.
You are an old man now.
You don't change, I'll regret nominating you.
The man they brought to play the role of Abu Abdulaziz's father.
He's here, bring him, hello, hello, hello.
Do your best, this is our manager, Mr. Gavil Fadil.
The most important thing is not to be afraid of the camera.
Brother, I only fear God.
Don't worry, stay calm, listen to his instructions, and say yes to anything the manager tells you.
Ah! My brother, ah! My brother, please, you will play the role of one of the elite, one of the rich, do you understand or not?
Come here, boy, come here, boy!
I'm talking to you.
He is too superficial, the role needs a sensible person.
Everything is acceptable from some people.
Ask me why I speak like this.
My brother, we bought this for filming. Listen to me, I'll take you to the makeup room now and I'll rehearse you for the role.
Shame on you, shame on you, shame on you.
Come here, please.
Offer it to me.
Stop, stop, stop here here!
Thank God you're here, come in, come in.
Director, the car you need for the scene is ready.
Saoud, he finishes everything, he fixes it.
Let's repeat it again, and the assistance manager is here to see you and reassure the manager.
Imagine yourself as a renowned merchant.
Are you saying this?
Yes, yes, I'll tell you, wait, wait, don't rush, I didn't expect that from you, oh! (Abu Abdulaziz), say you're Abu Abdulaziz.
To get our rights.
Beautiful, and you should know!
Let him clean my teeth, brother!
Abu Abdulaziz Falah Al-Marzook, Latif, will clean and complete the full name.
Beautiful, go ahead, go ahead and think.
Consider your daughter divorced.
Don't worry about why she got divorced.
Your daughter is divorced, is she beautiful? Is she beautiful?
She's beautiful, go reflect on yourself, we're not getting married.
Why don't I throw dirt at him?
Great, you're amazing and he remembers everything, amazing.
Let him clean my teeth.
How? Why?
Oh my God! The homeowners surprised us, they need the lounge, and the director decided to finish the indoor scenes, and we'll shoot the outdoor scenes later.
How is this? They don't want %PW!
Yes, they want to, they want to, but it's been postponed to a later time. They'll film another scene and we'll be right behind them, God willing.
Should I tell them to bring you some tea?
Peace be upon you.
And peace be upon you.
Good morning, sir.
Hello, what tribe are you from, man!
My name, sir, is Salem Abu Shweih Shweih.
The Shawys are also famous.
You deserve it.
Laughter moves me, my nose is big and here too the lips can be placed.
Tell me, my brother, people's noses are high now.
I carry myself.
If it were someone else, they wouldn't stop laughing.
Hold onto this for a minute.
Hello, Mother.
My mother is very sick, I have to go quickly, Oh! My brother!
You're going to wear that outfit.
I don't have time, I told you my mother is sick, she is very sick, he says!
Listen to me, you can go like this, but when I call you, you must come immediately.
He and I, we can't leave the site.
Alright, alright, I'll try to find a taxi. Oh! My brother.
What is this taxi? If you tried to look for a taxi for a year, you wouldn't find one.
You know we rented the car for filming.
As long as it's parked, take it.
Yes, oh! Brother, please give me the key. Mom is sick, give me the key, give it to me.
He's in the car.
I need a wheelchair.
Hold on, hold on, I'll get the wheelchair now, right now, old man.
Can I tell you something?
My mother is very sick in the car and I need a wheelchair, please.
Where is the patient? Inside the car?
Oh my God! My son, what happened?
Be silent and do not speak, just look while you are silent.
Peace be upon you.
There's nothing wrong, but your mother, my lady, has asthma badly.
I'll tell them to make the bed.
Alright, alright.
Don't bother.
God is sufficient for what you have done.
Alright, oh! Rashid.
Take care of our son Rashid.
As you wish, come with me, Mr. Rashid.
Come with me, Mr. Rashid.
And take Mr. Rashid and do what is necessary for him.
This is what is expected of you.
I'll tell the nurse to come and see what you'd like to drink, sir.
Come with me, Professor Rashid!
Excuse me.
What should I do with so many people, just wait!
The problem is that no one takes care of us.
Sir, what would you like to drink, tea or coffee or cappuccino?
You're not the first; Nassor, the hospital guard, married a Filipino woman.
Who told you I was rejected?
Not a single woman pays attention to me.
They philosophize and demand.
He doesn't have a certificate, I don't want your mother, what do you mean I don't want your mother! Go find your friends.
Oh my God! Brother, there's a girl in the hospital, I like her.
If she ignores you, find someone else.
I can't! Brother, my heart is hanging by a thread.
When you see her, will you believe that your brother has fallen in love?
Give this to Dr. Mohammed.
What's wrong with you!
Go now.
May God curse you.
Your Honor, our grandmother is now in perfect health.
You are a professional actor Oh! Saud, oh! Guys, next!
Bravo, see how they applauded you and praised you.
Now, go change your clothes and remove your makeup.
Oh! Man, forget it, come here first and sigh for me.
Yes, from now on, my name is Falah Al-Marzook.
Forget about it and write Saud.
Saud died.
From now on, my name is Falah Al-Marzook, Abu Abdulaziz.
Dear Lord, bless you, my dear.
One buffet!
I did two things.
Until I heard one of the bride's relatives say, "Wow, they are so stylish. I don't think anyone can do something similar to what they did at the wedding."
Okay, my love, goodbye.
Look at this, Mom.
I must bring them something on the occasion of signing my marriage contract.
What's wrong, Mom?
Look at your brother who will lend us the insult!
Oh my god, this is embarrassing, by the way, it's cheap.
But this depends on our budget, it works.
Leave this for the maids to eat.
He wants to make us laugh.
I'm glad I saw him.
This type is the free class, dedicated to the upper class.
Almost above average.
No, we want something unusual, something that no one can buy.
Sorry, Sheikhah, you can't blame those who don't know your capabilities.
Shut up, just shut up, you don't know anything.
I'm afraid the money I have isn't enough.
Don't embarrass us, pay with the credit card.
What luxury, it's very advanced.
Yesterday, Saleh signed his marriage contract.
Salih Nasser!
I'm at your disposal.
He comes to you.
They reserved the small ballroom and the food was disgusting.
Very brief.
What did she say about the Saadi wedding?
Certainly, everyone is saying the same thing.
This is what scares me!
My dear sister,
He cares only about money.
He doesn't care what people say.
He wants to make us laugh.
But we're supposed to come up with something based on our budget and circumstances.
Do you know that some people take out loans and sell their homes and cars just to have an extravagant wedding and avoid being talked about?
Leave it to us, this cheap chocolate is enough to embarrass us with.
I said the manager liked Chinese food and took it home.
Alright, if the bride's family says we choose the ballroom and theater and prepare everything ourselves.
And you think we'll choose anything!
No, not really, but the store we usually go to has very reasonable prices.
By the way, this shop designed Abu Thaqib's wedding ceremony.
Has anyone used it before?
Frankly, once.
At the wedding of His Highness's daughter, Mubarak.
No, no, no, we don't need anything used.
I need a platform where we are the first in the world to use it.
That means you want to stand out.
Show me what you've got.
This stage is being used for the first time in Qatar.
Inspired by the information revolution, like Facebook and Twitter.
Very modern and updated.
How much does this stage cost with other arrangements?
I'll calculate that for you now, but it's not less than one hundred and twenty-five thousand.
Mom, mom, if we do it this way, our money won't be enough. Everything is luxurious, better, and distinguished; all of this requires money.
Everyone loves to do that.
Please be quiet.
What is the decision?
So, did you like this?
This is Noah's Ark.
Both are new, but Noah's ship is twenty thousand more expensive.
No, for God's sake, I think the mouse stage is much better.
Be quiet, no, I need Noah's Ark.
This is marriage and its costs. By the way, we are considered middle class.
Do I have to pay one amount of one hundred and fifty thousand for the stage and another amount of one hundred and fifty thousand for the dance hall, the royal hall that you call it?
I didn't say a box, but why this showing off and everyone wants to look at the other and everyone wants to do better than what the others did.
This is a battle of bragging rights, and the only ones who benefit are the wedding hall owners.
Those who know that everyone wants to be special, exploit us and pounce on us with lies.
I swear I know one of my friends who says his brother has a wedding planning shop.
He says that the theater doesn't cost more than two thousand riyals.
I'm just waiting for this moment when his father says yes.
Alright, do something then.
Like other men who get married and settle down.
Hello Sheikh, Your Highness.
How are you?
I know you love to stand out.
That's the reason I'm calling you.
First time in Qatar, designed by international artist Peter Salomon.
A collection inspired by the nine planets.
I am from the solar system.
With the Noah's Ark stage, it will look amazing.
There is no such harmony, you will be the first person in Qatar to use the nine planets.
Alright then.
It was one hundred and fifty thousand, and now?
Alright then.
O God, inspire us with patience.
As you wish.
There are costs, my brother.
By the way, I couldn't get all eighty thousand.
All I've gathered is sixty thousand, and I took twenty thousand from my brother.
Thank you, thank you very much. Oh! My brother. Oh! Fahd.
How can I sort things out, Fahd! As long as we boast at weddings, we'll be in trouble.
Without any pretense.
You will surely get the invitations you want.
Yes, this week, God willing, we will start sending out the wedding invitations.
Our wedding will be better than theirs.
Oh Mother, look at the invitations my son has chosen for the wedding.
Where does your brother live?
People now travel to countries just to design their invitations.
Unlike Amina's family, they went to Italy to design their invitation, print it, and come back. Also, Manar's family.
They go to France, even people who are not rich, go to Lebanon to attend their invitations.
The system works this way in the country, do you want us to be different?
So, which country would you like to travel to?
We saw some wonderful invitations.
Indeed, it's expensive, but...
But it's private, and no one has done it before.
Sparkle, I love it.
Gold would be much better, shimmering.
Oh my God! If my brother can't afford the wedding expenses,
Then why get involved?
And leave all this boasting and pride in weddings and all these useless expenses.
Since the only beneficiaries of our madness are hotels and wedding planners.
It's him, leaving, poor him.
Let me choose it, for no one may take it.
Come on, I'll give you a ride.
Thank you, Abu Nasser!
Oh brother! The bride's family must support you.
I tried once, just once.
I said there that there was no need for a dance hall in a well-known hotel.
Why, I found our daughter in the street, and the others are no better than her.
This is the problem, everyone is looking at each other.
Who told you I got married?
At least they don't have that arrogance.
It's all about a simple party and some small expenses.
Oh man! Today, people get married on Facebook.
Cheaper and less costly.
That means you won't marry from your country.
Forget about it, do you want me to go crazy?
You'll see.
If I don't get Abdullah Roaished or Nawal for my son's wedding.
Curse her, she won't be better than me.
I want to ask you something, dear.
If your son has Raed's number, give it to us so we can contact him.
Alright dear, thank you very much, goodbye.
Mom, we agreed on a DJ, why did you change your mind?
And my mother-in-law is better than me?
I forgot who she is and we are?
The people who were below us have become better than us.
That's not the case, Mother, but look at my brother Saleh, he broke my heart, so don't pressure him too much.
Truly, he broke my heart.
How real a thing it is!
In the hospital! When and which hospital.
I don't know, it suddenly fell.
I heard that and suddenly fell.
He has no excuse and no one can blame her, after she prepared everything and people knew, he simply said he didn't want a marriage.
He wants to embarrass us.
What did the doctor say?
He will embarrass us, he wants to cancel the marriage.
Insha'Allah, everything will be alright.
Don't break her heart.
Oh my God! You're a man and the breadwinner of the family.
Go, go and reassure her.
I swear to you, if I told Abu Youssef that, his heart would stop beating.
You know why the minister kept Abu Yusuf until now.
By the way, he should have retired three or four years ago.
There's nothing wrong with it, it will help me.
I swear, you're crazy.
Did you understand what I want from him now?
And he runs, leaving the papers and statements to hide, until he brings the money.
They call it quantum annealing.
I won't speak, and I don't know why you're panicking.
No worries, I'll pay you back eventually.
Do you know what they call me, do you know what they call me?
Disciplined, disciplined.
Uncle, uncle, I tried, but there's no other way but this.
If I give you and the subsequent auditors,
And they are strict in scrutiny, they will take me quickly, quickly.
Quickly, the tablet, the tablet, the tablet.
I ate, I ate the pill.
No, no, God willing, from 7:30 we will be in the dance hall to receive guests.
No, we will definitely be there.
I will throw a wedding for my son that will be the talk of Doha.
Surprise!
Alright dear Fatima, I'll meet you later.
I'm afraid for you of people envying you, my son. Oh, if you walk in among them tomorrow like this with the peacock feather!
Here you are, Mother. Is the dress long enough?
The police are here!
Insha'Allah, there's nothing wrong.
Police, just stay here and I'll be back.
God alone is sufficient for you, O Salam.
Forget your marriage.
Marriage cage, now we'll enter the prison cage.
They discovered the document I hid for your loan and now suddenly, they discovered me.
Why are you angry!
You will hear of much greater disasters than this.
What do we say next!
A respectful and honest employee
Whoever loves their job, the ministry contracted a company to carry out maintenance.
Out of fear of losing his job, the employee went and inquired about the materials.
He discovered that it cost four hundred thousand.
It will save the ministry one million six hundred thousand.
Punish the minister! No, no, no, I don't believe it.
Why can't you believe him!
Here is Saad.
He certainly has all the news.
He fired him from work.
What happened to the world? Where are the values?
They say he called his office manager.
He told him: Let her work instead of Uthman.
And who is she?
She is the daughter of the manager of the same company that offered the maintenance contract.
It was revealed by Uthman.
No, no, no, no, this is unbelievable.
You're always surprising Oh! Saleh!
Who does this company belong to?
For whom?
This is how we became!
What do you say!
It's not what I'm saying, this poor employee Osman, what's his fault!
His mistake is that he is honest and trustworthy!
Do you think the manager is in his office?
Yes, he left a while ago.
What's wrong with the world!
We started seeing some strange people.
I agree with you, Uthman doesn't deserve it, but there's nothing we can do about it (figuratively).
It's not fair, sir. He has seven children and doesn't have a passport.
This work earns him a living! What will he do now and where will he go?
Do you know what happened?
The new employee appointed by the minister
I entered Uthman's office and started working. The poor Uthman came to take his belongings, I prevented him and told him to go, I will send your belongings with the tea boy.
Where is he now?
Things have changed, my God! Uthman?
This is the reward!
This is God's will.
God bless.
The great God of generosity, O Uthman, may God not forsake you, farewell.
What's the matter? You don't seem okay!
I know, I know you're very sensitive.
What work is this! I can't work now, I'm leaving now.
It's an opportunity for my mom to pass by and bring the items to you.
I don't want you to stay upset like this.
Why are you shouting in my face? I'm your mother.
I'm not yelling at you, I'm asking you.
How can it be acceptable, and by what right do you go with him? Is he your husband, father, or brother?
The world has changed, where do you live?
I don't know, Mother!
You're crazy.
People are free, and the world has become a small village. Where do you live!
But what can I say!
Be modern, live this period, and don't be backward.
Take the stuff out of the car quickly! Go, don't look at me and lock it.
What's wrong? Oh! Saleh, what's the matter with you?
No, you're not fine today.
I shouted at the poor maid, it wasn't her fault.
You know I didn't mean it.
No, no, no, I don't have an appetite.
So that I can forget the disasters I've seen.
Dear, don't cry.
The manager is a bit angry.
It is an honor to have you here.
Thank you, thank you very much.
Hard work and perseverance.
Oh, my God!
The most important thing,
The most important thing for me in this ministry
This is it. Oh! Your Excellency.
Tell me, what's the use of an official who doesn't take bribes?
He is useless.
This is the reason why I want all of you.
There is no place for honest people and those with tattered principles and values.
If you ever discover
He will only blame himself.
Being just is a principle regardless of the reaction!
That's the reason why I want your cooperation.
If you have a doubt
Just tell me.
We are thieves and sons of thieves, and no one can compete with our sisters.
If Nora ever refuses a bribe, she steals government tea before going home.
Excellent, excellent, bravo. This is what we expect from everyone. I don't just want her to be like this, I want all of you to be like her.
May God bless you.
That's why I want you to leave the purchasing department and become my office manager.
Frankly, you know how to pick, you've chosen the right thief for the right place.
Enough! Um Saud, enough, don't torture me anymore.
I don't want to live in prison.
But God is sufficient against Satan, who tempted me and made truth beautiful in my eyes.
He told me to be honest.
You are a father.
Why bother with honesty and loyalty?
Throughout your life, you have been a thief and a scoundrel.
It's good that I didn't become a saint.
Let me talk to your father.
Never do that again.
One must be on the straight path, buying consciences, stealing, and claiming hypocrisy to live in peace.
My father is in prison because all his money is illegal.
Stop it, stop it.
Is this something to wear?
We are a respectable family.
Shame on you.
Where is your stomach?
Why is it not exposed?
Don't be shy, you're shameless.
I'm shy to wear this brother.
Are there any shy girls these days?
Why are you screaming?
Look what your daughter is wearing!
Is there any respectable lady who wears such a thing?
And you will walk in the street without showing any part of your body?
I'm tired of her, she doesn't listen to what I say.
I never stopped supporting here.
I bought her some transparent clothes she didn't need.
I warn you, if I ever see you with anything below the knee.
Since you are aware of the situation, never blame me for the consequences.
We are here, God bless you.
It is hoped that he will be a player and a villain.
He is like his father.
As you can see in front of you,
He is a very good man, how can we find someone like him.
Don't worry, Uncle, I'm bad.
What a kind man. Frankly, I love my daughter Sarah very much and care about her future.
Only after we heard about it.
Thank God, she has a very bad reputation.
I came home at 3:30 a.m.
I arrived home at 5 a.m.
Hello, hello, what's this! Hello.
Come and pick me up from the bar.
Start your car's engine and come to pick me up from the bar.
This is the first time I've seen a father who doesn't obey his son.
Stop, Dad. Start your car, I'm waiting for you.
Mary, I love you.
I love you too, you've disappeared, disappeared, disappeared.
Basically, Dad, Dad is here.
Where is he?
He is brave, unlike my father who doesn't enjoy it.
Let me introduce you to my fiancé, Majid.
No, Dad, Abdulaziz was my ex-boyfriend.
Hello, come in, good opportunity.
Arab and Israeli satellites
I discovered that many Palestinians didn't cut their nails.
In accordance with the State of Palestine's commitment in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement,
In any case, the United Nations meets today to discuss Israel's request to send special inspection committees to examine Palestinian fingers.
To know if their nails are long or not.
It was a condition that nothing should be cut or wounded, or anything that would draw blood.
State of Palestine
I call on the entire international community to visit Palestine.
From the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.
It is made of cork.
Oh my God, the olives!
We press the olives like this, this is how we press the olives.
We and our Arab brothers call upon the international community
To form inspection committees for Palestinian nails.
And now, let's start the voting.
No, no, no, no, it doesn't go that far, no.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Salih, Salih, what's wrong with you?
What did you dream about?
I dreamed of the upside-down world.
Good heavens! Rashid, you must have a strong character.
Now, my God! Brother, the school you will work at tomorrow is number ?
I am a teacher like you.
Why haven't I changed my school since I started teaching?
What kind of character is this, brother?
But the problem is his weak personality.
By the way, the teachers who are with him are the ones who complained about him.
To that extent! Brother.
That's why you see him silent.
Later, he started teaching.
It wasn't ketchup, it was 100% mayonnaise.
Oh! Brother, we don't talk to you until we cause you trouble.
We're telling you because it's your last chance.
He told me that he accepted Rashid even though he had a weak character.
He is shy and very good.
Whatever he is, he is a citizen.
Why are you so silent, brother?
Because everything you say is true.
Everything you say is true.
From tomorrow,
New master Rashid.
Mr. Rashid,
You are absolutely right.
Alright, forget it.
And from tomorrow,
Yes, this is good. What's next?
Here I tell you.
I am a teacher who does not like mistakes.
Let's say a boy jumped up and told you what the other boy said at your previous school, and the inspector was present.
And take your bag!
Slowly, slowly, you're breaking the door.
Well, one learns from one's mistakes.
From the first minute
Here I tell you.
I'm nervous.
I have to do it!
Just silence!
It seems he just said, "Shut up!"
Did you hear him?
Tell him that Mr. Rashid fired me.
It seems he said, "I don't care, but he will see, I don't want to see your face here in class."
Teacher, don't you know who he is?
Who is whose son?
Here comes Mr. Rashid.
Did you see him?
Teacher, the problem is that if he tells his father.
Okay, where do you usually see him sitting? Sitting during break?
You might find him in the seating area, sitting down.
Above the chairs.
Chairs, chairs.
By the end of the day, he's human.
But you shouted in my face!
Friends joking, you're joking with me.
My father is abroad and will return next week, and when he returns, I will tell him.
No, no, no, no, Abdel Rahman, may Allah protect you.
We, we are friends. By the way, strawberry ice cream is very sweet, you might want to try it. It has a little sour taste, but it's wonderful.
Alright, go and get it quickly.
The only thing that scared me was that he would tell his father.
You said his father was abroad.
Yes, he's outside. What, his father doesn't come back? They took his father's things and threw him out!
I hope there won't be dire consequences.
You carried his bag and brought it to him, gave him your phone number, and told him, "If you need anything, call me, I'm your friend."
Yes, but.
Yes, but what?
You are the ones who told me.
Scream and claim that you are strong.
Bathroom, bathroom, bathroom.
Oh my God! Rashid!
Sleep, you can sleep, you can sleep, don't worry, sleep.
Mr. Abu Nasser, Mr. Rashid is in the bathroom.
One juice.
Come here, come here, come here, come here, give me.
Go quickly.
Put them on the table.
That all people are equal.
This is the reason I've gathered you together to hear your ideas for the party.
How can anyone guarantee a boy?
That will get us into trouble. It's him who's calling.
At three o'clock.
Hey, hello. He hung up, I swear he's joking.
Faster, faster.
Peace be upon you.
Support the inspector, sit down.
Yes, I'm at your service.
Ah! Teacher, come, come here ah! Teacher.
Are you done screaming?
I'm not kidding, my God! But I'm asking you, are you done?
Whether it's finished or not, where is the teacher's authority? By doing that, you are humiliating yourself and degrading the teaching profession.
Alright, alright, good, good.
And you're raising your voice too?
Yes, I'm raising my voice, first you need to know who this boy is?
Faster, faster.
Only two cars.
Two cars, no, no, I want four or five. Stretch out, stretch out, we have plenty of space. Go, go, go.
He thinks he owns the neighborhood!
Abu Nasser used to do this and not do that.
Oh God, help him.
I am the school principal here.
It is known that Abu Nasser
He used to give all the teachers extra lessons.
Except me.
Who is the principal of the school here?
You are the school principal, God guide you, what's bothering you?
Put your leg out.
I didn't put it in your head, it's on the chair. Oh! My brother.
What do you mean?
No need, I swear I just want to ease your burden.
What's it called?
So, what do I do with you now?
Act better for yourself and you will take extra lessons whether you like it or not.
What's wrong with you, go, go, go, get out!
Alright, I'll leave.
As you wish, we've told you, man!
We need to keep him in check.
Wait, oh! People, wait.
Don't blame us, oh! Abu Salmin.
Oh! Abu Nayef, you're the neighborhood chief and you must stop him from crossing the line.
I am not my father's son.
You will see what I will do with it.
Faster, faster.
Goodbye, sir.
Oh my God, when did he buy this new car?
I told you, but you didn't believe me.
He shaved his beard, and his face became red.
Do you believe that when he came, I didn't recognize him, but when he spoke, I recognized him by his voice.
Did you know he was promoted a week ago?
That means he is responsible for eight schools for boys and girls.
What is this magical secret? Ask him to tell you, what is the secret that got him out of the bottom!
I told you from day one.
When I'm teaching, I don't want to hear any noise.
Not even a breath.
Act politely.
And you, too, answer me, you, too, argue with me. Get away from my face, get away, get away.
When you are appointed a minister, look for a good staff to work with you.
So don't tell me to come and take this job.
Either the other job, no brother give me options, different jobs and I'll choose the most suitable job.
My brother is a minister!
I swear I'm not okay after the call I received.
Everyone blesses me.
What will they say, oh Mother, God guide you.
This is very common. Every minister automatically appoints his friends and people from his circle.
From this side, don't worry, it's my pleasure to meet you, %Pw.
They know I'll become a minister.
So, they're buying me with this, it's a bribe.
Wealth will come to us, a treasure, a treasure will be opened to us.
The big earth.
Go, each one of you go congratulate the new minister.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Congratulations, Your Excellency the Minister.
By the blessing of your respect, congratulations.
Congratulations, Your Excellency, you deserve it.
You deserve it, Your Excellency the Minister.
Oh my God! My brothers, the responsibility is great, please help us bear it.
As they say, you are more than qualified for this job (figuratively).
You left after Abu Saleh's phone rang.
It was far from him.
Forget about him.
I'm amazed to see how he loves it now?
And Abu Sultan is not naive.
Yes, I opened the car door for him.
Bravo, you've done a lot!
We are waiting for our brother to become a minister.
I told you, Mother! But you don't believe me.
You were saying it's café stories, café stories.
After her husband's death, she said she envied him.
Insha'Allah, Insha'Allah.
Yes, you have nothing to say, you have nothing.
Oh mother, let's go, I'm tired even here (metaphorically).
What do you mean by "It's none of your business"?
You just need to rest.
I interrupted them because they made me nervous.
Yes, they are right.
But I didn't like to say that in front of my mother, you know my mother, she'll tell everyone.
She repeats everything she hears, they call her a sieve, we don't want a scandal.
So, what assures you that if they remove him from power, they will put you in his place?
Because I asked.
If he's out of the office, you'll be the first candidate.
What assures you they will kick it?
No, I'm very sure about this.
I remember, I saw him outside the office just as I see you now in front of me.
You will cast a spell on him.
But the plan in my head is foolproof and effective.
It's a plan to burn and kick him.
I'll make him attend every event that happens in the country.
By that time, he will be burned out. When he is burned out, he will be out of office. When he is out of office, he will be fired.
I swear to God, brother, I don't know how to tell you and I don't know what to say to you!
Your visit is called, is called a participation that reflects the extent of your love for your country.
Do you believe that?
Today you are a statesman, you must always be present.
You must participate in everything, excuse me, sir, excuse me, excuse me.
Before I forget, thank you for the lamb you sent me yesterday.
Come with your dignity. This is just a sheep; this is not your place. What do you think your dignity is? Will you come with me today?
The man is waiting for you outside!
Frankly,
I don't want to go.
I am sick, I am bored of the place, I am bored of her.
You are the minister today, and he is right. As he said, you are a social person, make a glory for yourself!
God sent you this generous man.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Don't take pictures of me.
Take, take.
Today I'll take him to the poetry night and to a wedding, and they've taken at least a hundred pictures of him.
I'll also tell you about a very nice thing to take to him.
Listen, I've also prepared a very nice educational activity for you.
Yes, like this. Let his light shine, I want it to shine, shine, shine until it glitters. I am looking for this light.
The trader, heartfelt thanks, blessed be the subject, %PW picture, picture your happiness. Take a picture, take a picture. Don't take my picture, I'm far away, take my picture.
This is a bicycle.
Blessed beginning and congratulations, and His Excellency's greetings.
Picture, picture like this. You are fat, fat sir.
Nothing, God bless you.
Go to the second page.
No, he doesn't know that.
It's a national contribution.
Say what God wills.
This is the fourth friend who has called me today.
Everyone praises your activities; Um Khalid calls you the active social activist.
Yesterday, I heard a hurtful word.
The association that Abu Sultan took me to yesterday.
Children's swim meet victory party.
Someone was telling his friend,
They thought I hadn't heard them.
This minister said
I want to buy a birthday present for my uncle.
Hello, hello.
I see you, sir, in the newspaper every day.
True, true
You brought light when you came to this place, I'll give you a discount on anything you want.
Whether you want to pay or not, no problem.
That means you won't be wandering around and hanging out with your minister.
I, I am Abu Saleh, the minister.
Sultan's father didn't come to pick anything up, I'm waiting for him.
And he sat me in the front row, then went to the car to relax.
We don't need his help. May God guide you.
Woman, God blesses your parents, ask him. I'll call you later just to make sure.
And you're inviting yourself.
People are offering us discounts.
I told you.
This work is wonderful.
But let this man come and take me!
The minister's excellence disturbed me, may God protect him.
Hello, hello Your Excellency the Minister.
No, but I feel tired today and
Alright, if you're that enthusiastic, we're at your service.
We are at your service, but my brother Saad will take you and show you around, and I hope he can find a party or something similar for you.
Then, a party?
No, no, we don't have any activity today.
No, we don't have it.
Well, where can we find him?
Yes. Thank you, thank you.
Is there anyone we can ask?
God willing, you will succeed.
Sleep and relax.
One moment, Saad.
Anything for an easy night?
Yes, this is good.
And there might be extra time.
Take him! Put him in the cabin and find a photographer to take some pictures of his face.
Alright, alright, goodbye.
What did you find for him?
I don't know, a match in the reserve league. Let him stay alone on the field!
What is this! This minister is a path for us!
Beautiful, that means he reached the top.
His end is very near when he becomes the talk of the town.
My lord, he has become much more popular than you.
Your Honor, if I go somewhere and take Abu Saleh with me,
Ah! My lord judge,
Shining star.
We'll turn it off and return it to its normal size.
The minister came, came, came. The minister came.
Don't take pictures! Don't take pictures! I swear, if any of you take my picture, I'll destroy you. I won't come out.
Brock broke their cameras, I don't want pictures.
She sends you her greetings.
As they say, I missed the train.
This is my brother Khalid.
There is no power or authority except from God.
Why?
This is the first time I saw him.
When you see him for the first time!
The first time I've seen him in years.
Oh my God.
Is this my immortality?
I haven't seen him for a long time, come to me, dear.
What do we do? He's so attached to her.
There is no power or authority except from Allah, it always comes back to the same point.
Get out, get out and don't give me a headache. I came back from the wedding at 3 a.m.
Just let me rest and don't make a big fuss about it.
Your brother is a girl.
I swear I'll tell my dad, look at yourself, you look like a girl.
That means he was playing, playing.
Yes, he was playing, I tell you he was playing with the makeup palette.
And this is Saud; I know what to do with him.
What a poor immortal, I wish all children were like him.
Turn these campaigns and the mischief they create around his brother.
Come here, my dear brothers, come and say hello.
How are you, dear?
No, dear, we won't be traveling to Spain this summer.
Who are you talking to?
Cheetahs from Kuwait.
Hi, Hamada!
Listen to what I say.
There is no power or authority except from God.
I'll leave my dear Amal to choose for herself.
But really, what do you think?
I say that the one overlooking the sea is better.
Even in the near future, if we buy a yacht, we will go directly from our home to the sea.
Us and our children.
Please set a wedding date.
Well, it's just a year and a few months.
What's with your brother, he's using too much perfume.
Frankly, Ammar, I've noticed that your brother Khalid... I don't know.
But he is completely different from your brother Saad.
Different or not, dear, everyone is free in their actions.
And your fiancé is backward, he doesn't know that there are unisex perfumes.
Let your fiancé keep his opinion to himself!
I don't care.
I can't believe it, Khalid!
It's not the perfume that men use like women.
Even you use their colors.
Why are you doing this, Khalid?
Really, you have nothing to say.
Oh mother, why don't you want to believe anything about him? Don't you see his actions and behavior?
Nowadays, perfumes are not gender-specific.
Here I warn you.
Have you seen the Bluetooth?
I heard about it from my friends in the council; they say it's very common in Doha.
I've heard about it, show us.
You must watch him, and I'll tell you later.
Look how this girl dances!
Look at the moves!
These are girls! Look at this one who says she dances well and does some moves, do you know who she is? She's Khalid Muhammad's cousin.
What is for my beloved is eternal.
Alright, you'll see what I'll do to him.
I'm waiting for his brother Saad now.
Why? Let him come and see, let Saad come! I'll send him the Bluetooth so his family can track him.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, hello, hello.
Certainly, I was defeated.
Why is my cousin sitting so far away?
Nothing, but is your Bluetooth on?
No, but I'll send you something.
No, thank you, Amira.
He ran away from his family.
Are you crazy, Saad?
And I will travel tomorrow.
You won't see my face in this country.
Where are you going alone? (Figurative)
What will people say?
They will say that their son left them and traveled, you don't want to cause a scandal for us!
How very true that is.
And what your son Khalid did is honor and glory!
A man who becomes a woman, isn't that a scandal?
I can't face people if they say this is the gay brother.
Tell him that he travels for medicine, or study, or work, or even that he is committing suicide.
The most important thing is that I don't live in a place where scandal chases me every day.
So, where are you going?
I don't care where I go.
This is the end.
The other one, we don't know where he is, and this person here is packing his bag to travel.
Even if we don't know where we're going?
What did you expect from him?
What's wrong with you? I came to comfort you, and you're throwing harsh words at me that break my heart.
I was telling you to take care of him.
Don't leave it to the servants.
You don't know anything about him, and you should have been busy.
And your father is busy with his work and has left the responsibility to you.
You are right, Mother.
Does your sister have no hope?
In this, you are right.
What Khalid did honored us among the people.
I can't see anyone.
Did you say anything to him?
This is my father's greatest flaw.
We are in the strange, bad case of Khulood.
I told him.
Put it on a CD and give it to him.
Only when I go to the airport.
I'm very worried about him.
Our house has to reach this point, oh! {Amaal.
Don't be surprised.
Khaled and his colleagues don't care about their families' reputations.
And the reputation of their brothers and sisters
Whatever religious values they have been ascribed.
They go dancing and having fun.
In the evil swamp.
Really, oh! My son, I am perplexed.
Goodbye, Father.
Take care of yourself, my son!
Yes, Father, I have a small gift for you.
A gift for me!
Now put the CD in the laptop, I'm afraid of what will happen, come with me!
All right, Mom.
I can't believe the father is still looking at the CD, it's only been three minutes.
He may go out.
Where will he go? He doesn't have enough time to go anywhere.
Answer me, what's the matter with you, Abu Saad?
Father!
Alright! Amals,
If I search, I will fail.
To find someone with your manners,
But forgive me.
God help you.
I see you coming to the roof!
Yes, my love.
We live in an age of freedom.
The age of human rights, and no one owes us anything.
If anyone has a riyal, they can take a thousand! Oh, my dear.
Certainly I can handle it. God bless America, my love.
Do you know that salaries are high now?
It is one thousand two hundred.
God is sufficient for you. Every time you speak to a driver, you ask, "How much is your salary?"
My salary is too low.
When he sees me, he starts complaining, my salary is low and there are no benefits. We agreed with him that his salary is seven hundred and I raised it by a hundred when he got the license, what more does he want?
I told him, when you complete one year of work, we will raise your salary.
It seems he is greedy and we will have a hard time dealing with him.
Stop it, stop it, just shut your mouth, just be quiet, just be quiet, take it back and get rid of it.
Make this word easy for you, easy.
You'll let him insist, I hate going out in the car with him.
Alright, leave it to me.
You've told me the story now, I am the master of the house. Be quiet, stop, and you too be quiet, I'll handle this.
Get up, I want you outside, get up!
Come and stand up.
What did I tell you?
I said your friends shouldn't come to your room. Did I say that or not?
Manager, this is not my friend, this is my uncle.
He came for five minutes and will leave, God willing.
Five minutes!
Keep that in mind!
Don't tell the lady I need a raise in my salary, I need a raise in my salary!
Everything in the world is expensive now.
And when did I give you eight hundred?
Boss, I have a lot of problems at home.
Those drivers in Doha earn one thousand one hundred, one thousand two hundred Qatari riyals.
And it could be one thousand three hundred.
Wait, I'll think.
Listen, I'll turn up the volume one hundred percent, I'll shut my mouth, I won't turn up your volume.
Don't say I raised another hundred like you, go to work!
What did he say?
I'll tell you.
A hundred is no use.
Two hundred is no use.
I'm afraid of screens.
Why are you afraid?
All the drivers fled.
Because they work abroad for three or four thousand.
What's the problem? When you work at home, you don't get any benefits, but when you work outside the home, you earn more money.
I'm very scared.
Look at them, they are all drivers.
How much?
One thousand five hundred twenty
But I'm afraid of the police who will take me and put me in jail.
No, don't be afraid.
I guarantee you.
I was wearing my cloak and getting ready to go out.
I used to call out, and now someone answers me.
He opened his room and the closet was empty.
Monira's maid ran away for a year.
I will just say, God is sufficient for him.
Alright, I'll come to you.
I went to the police.
If you have reported, you bear no responsibility.
We'll do everything we can.
Also, look around the neighborhood, you might see him and let us know.
Yes, he will make money and when he is satisfied, he will surrender.
We bring them in, spend money on them, and give them clothes, food, and driving lessons.
It's none of his business.
The match is starting now, come in, entry is better.
Yes, we were worried.
These are foxes, and foxes are not easily caught.
Do you know that not getting more than three means we haven't won, we need ten or fifteen.
This is blatant mockery, blatant mockery. Let's be clear, this is blatant mockery.
This is the level of their team. If they don't score more than three goals, it's not the Fox team.
Take it from me.
In ourselves, in the players, and in the performance.
They have nothing, they should thank God if they score less than three, they should thank God.
Any goal, these are the trainees. Our team is still hungry, this is the Fox team, leave us alone, man.
You've scored a goal now, you're relieved and happy now.
Do you think there are other goals or that it stops here?
This fox is very good, it's very smart. It goes here and there and no one can catch it, you'll be running in circles. This fox eats chickens.
No, I don't have a car.
You are my friend.
Did you hear what he said?
He said this fox is a big problem.
You can't catch him.
Yes, oh! Sir.
Do you know him or not?
He's a Foxes fan.
He sometimes appears on the show "Renew Yourself."
They will win today and you will lose.
I swear I will defeat you. The Fox team is invincible, it always wins.
Coach, what's your opinion on today's result?
Why are you asking me about the result?
It's over, the wolves are the winners.
The birds came to get their food as they flew.
Let's be realistic, don't say the foxes won and flew away.
These are the foxes, my friend.
This fox takes the chicken and eats it.
You didn't see what your honor did in the arena.
The audience can't stop laughing at him.
Clear in the arena and thank you for listening.
The true fan with genuine loyalty to the club.
He spends his time with the Qatari elite who go to shopping malls and similar places.
He invited me to have a cappuccino.
What a strange world, my God!
The boy gave me five hundred riyals and paid the bill.
Tell us the poem you wrote about our match against the frogs.
Thank you to all the listeners here.
You are a frog.
Don't be ashamed because my team beat yours by four.
Speak boldly, speak boldly about the club and the team and see what happens!
Don't say that!
When he drove out one of the wolves
The reason behind that is a rule.
A player was expelled from the Fox team.
I changed his name from Hakim to Ahmak.
Thank you, thank you, thank you to all the listeners here.
Every month, we meet to choose the best fan.
Great, who did you choose to honor this month?
The board members of the club will decide.
They are not children, and you are all big as camels.
I manage this big club. Thaloub.
Come, come and see the driver who escaped from us, he's on TV, come.
Is this it?
This one speaks very well, and the other is mute.
What do you think, is it a pen or a watch?
Now, I know how to communicate with him.
The audience has left.
Turn behind him.
He turned here.
He was driving fast.
We've lost him now.
Beautiful!
Be quiet, you don't decide. I'm the man of the house and I'm the one who decides.
We need to make sure.
Majid Abdulrahman Al-Subaie
Yes, yes, yes, God bless you.
I am from the Sbaie tribe.
Buy it and register it in my name. No, no, no, I don't want to live in it, I have a house.
I just want to invest.
As the investment price rises, God bless.
How can I help you, people, what do you want?
God bless you.
Come on, folks, let's have some coffee?
You don't have anything to say, God bless you, you don't need anything, God reward you.
You say you're sure, is that good? You're about to embarrass us in front of the elite!
I'm very worried.
Mother, mother, I am a mother.
Now, what will your father do to us, I don't know?
I didn't mean it, Mom!
Please, Mother, don't tell Father.
Your father will turn the house upside down.
He will surely kill you now.
Oh mother, I swear I didn't break it on purpose.
So, why don't we buy some glue and stick it together?
What will we prove, son?
How can we find another like it? I don't know where your uncle bought this, it was a gift.
I'm worried about you from him.
Oh mother, I'm afraid he will hit me.
Close the door until I find a solution to this problem.
Quickly, go to your room.
Blindness, blindness, blindness! Are you blind?
Don't you see the pillow is broken, don't you see?
Oh mother, why didn't Waleed come to you?
No, oh! Our daughter came. What's wrong with you?
He ran away from home, fearing his father.
This is not true. Show some empathy for the boy!
This is not upbringing, God guide her, my daughter!
What should I do now, mother?
I don't know what to do!
I don't know, but he's worried about the cars on the street.
God protect him, I think he went to the supermarket or went to the neighbors to play with the children.
Yes, he is sweet, kind, and lovable. Oh! A daughter.
No, no daughter, seek refuge from the devil and do not worry, God willing, everything will be alright.
Well, goodbye my daughter.
Where is Waleed?
My father will hit me.
Jeddah, my father will kill me with beating.
Don't be annoyed, oh! My dear.
Don't be upset, my dear!
I won't let him defeat you.
I didn't mean to break it.
Come, my son! Come and drink some water and rest in my room.
Your face has turned yellow.
Oh God, guide him, oh God, guide him. Come with me, my son, a little bit.
O Allah, the Generous.
I'm afraid my father will come here.
Come, my son! Don't be afraid.
No one interferes with raising my son.
This is my son, and I raise him the way I want.
But the poor buyer was anxious, trembling and panicking over something he hadn't intended to do.
Why doesn't he have eyes?
Let him see!
She accidentally knocked the bag against the pot, believe me, he didn't mean to do that.
You! You must support him!
Don't say anything to him for me, please. Forgive him this time, his state of fear breaks my heart.
But where is he now? Why is he here at this time?
What is here.
He's here! Where?
Enter, I'll go!
No, no, I'll take it to my brother today.
Why don't you bring something other than the old one?
Oh, Nasir, my brother, let's play!
And your mother says you're studying!
My dad just wants this game and we'll study!
Don't you have an exam tomorrow?
Yes, Father.
Oh father, come and don't spoil the game.
Go, father, don't take it seriously. Go, go father, we'll study.
What do you say! Listen to me.
If I go, I'll call your uncle Abu Waleed now.
No, no, no, no. Don't tell my uncle, don't tell my uncle, no!
I don't care.
I'll tell him you don't obey me.
Go. Everyone please take your book and start studying.
Alright, Dad, put your phone in your pocket. We'll study, Dad, but don't tell Uncle.
Mom, I'm really confused. I don't know what to do.
I fear that if he knows, it will cause us a problem.
Certainly, he will ask me, "Why are you taking him to the hospital?"
So what's the problem if I tell him?
If he finds out Walid is wetting the bed, he'll kill him.
Oh! Mother, he is the one to blame. Everything is his fault.
Oh my God! My daughter is psychologically affected.
The boy is not a child, but rather he is now twelve years old.
Alright! My daughter.
You will come to have lunch with us and I will give him some advice.
And I will see his opinion.
Her mother went to Bahrain to buy abayas.
It's just an excuse, my daughter.
Fun and shopping.
She says he poops in his bed every night.
My son wets the bed every night, don't tell me the story.
He said I must take him to the hospital so they can treat him.
Her husband is stupid.
He doesn't understand anything.
He is right.
They must take him to the hospital, oh! My son, so they can find out what's wrong with him.
He is looking for a good dry hose.
He beat him until his screams could be heard by the last person in the neighborhood.
Sit down!
Eat, my daughter, eat.
No, I didn't say anything.
Take it, go quickly, and take a bath. I'll get you some clothes. Go!
Please, I beg you.
I must punish them.
Don't interfere!
Do you call that a pass?
Khalid scored ninety-four out of fifty.
Is this a passage?
But their grades are good.
Tell them you'll be punished if you don't get fifty out of fifty.
Please, don't take them to your brother!
They must be punished.
They are my children.
Alright, I swear to you, uncle, this will be the last time.
Why don't you get fifty from fifty, fifty from fifty?
Give him another one.
I tell him, don't go to public places with us.
Yesterday we went to the hospital and he was told not to enter. No entry allowed.
You're different, don't go with us.
Be quiet! Let me punish his brothers.
Stop, uncle, I'm about to die, stop, stop, stop, stop. I'm about to die, stop, uncle.
Let me punish you.
Remember, this is not a punishment. What you'll see at the end of the year if none of you reach fifty.
I will drain the swimming pool.
I will fill it with oil.
Where is your certificate? Where is your certificate?
They said it will be ready tomorrow.
Khaled Abdul Rahman.
Sweet! Khalid, you did well.
Faisal Abdullah Rashid
Excellent! Oh! Faisal.
May God bless you.
You are an outstanding student. You were second in the class.
The teacher is crying because he got 94 out of 100 in math.
The teacher is afraid of his father because he wants him to get a perfect score.
Oh, my son! I am speaking to you!
Call, call his classmate.
He said he saw him by the school entrance.
Call, call your mother, she might be at your grandfather's house.
No, he didn't go there.
So, where is he? Where is he?
There is no power or might except by Allah.
Good heavens! My brother?
Ah, of course he failed and is afraid of his family.
No, he didn't fail, but he was an excellent student and ranked second in the class.
However, he was afraid to go back home.
Because he only lost two marks in math.
Rest in peace.
The hand, the hand.
The hand, the hand.
Oh! Waleed, come here.
Eighty-four, ninety-four, you lost a mark or two, it's fine. I won't say anything, I won't scold or hit you. Waleed,
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful

And Saudi Arabia takes the lead with 24% of the world's reserves.
Then Libya, the United States of America, and Nigeria.
With three percent for each of them and then the rest of the world combined with fifteen percent.
Therefore
In addition to production
And perhaps this is one of the secrets and reasons behind the movement of major industrial nations to occupy this region and its countries.
And above them is the United States of America, which is the largest consumer of oil in the world.
Nevertheless, oil prices are rising steadily.
With the fall of the US dollar
The unit used to determine oil prices
Where the price of one barrel reached yesterday
This led to increased revenue in producing countries while simultaneously
To further swell its ranks
Where inflation in some of those countries reached fifteen percent.
The most important source of energy in the world.
Prices of commodities and the cost of living
In a direct conversation with the Deputy Prime Minister
Qatar's Minister of Energy and Industry
Abdullah bin Hamad Al Attiyah
And for viewers who wish to participate, they can contact us on the program's communication numbers.
Honorable Deputy, welcome.
I'd like to start with you on the unprecedented prices that oil has reached.
Where might prices go?
Certainly, the limit to which prices might rise is a puzzling question.
Or what we call the power of the market.
What is not OPEC?
And not the producing countries?
Neither the producing countries nor OPEC have anything to do with oil pricing.
Is the only relationship of price between supply and demand?
So far, there is not much relationship between supply and demand.
So what are the factors?
There are other factors besides supply and demand.
What made investors
I feel a lot of pressure and have turned to oil and gold, or what is known as (commodities trading).
Investors lost confidence in stock markets.
And also gold.
We've seen gold rise from three hundred and fifty dollars in past years to nine hundred and seventy dollars now.
And as I mentioned before, around one hundred and nine dollars.
But they are all on the rise, and if they fall, it will be a slight decline.
Let me remind you that the first quarter of this year
The second quarter is expected to see a drop in prices due to lower demand for oil.
But we saw the market in a strange and volatile state.
In the second quarter and at the beginning of spring, it rises above one hundred dollars.
But this means that the previous factors that determined the rise in winter prices and consumption have now changed and there are other factors.
and economic growth
And at the same time, we see oil prices rising to this level.
You mentioned political factors and said that political tensions play a role in this.
Regarding Iran, do you think Fallon's resignation is in light of political complexities?
Accompanying today's events and leading to most activities of American newspapers and world press. It may affect oil prices.
Yes, one hundred percent, and today whatever.
Today, we are in the age of globalization and influence comes swiftly.
Unrealistic factors may influence.
And created a kind of disruption in the market.
Also created some types of political rumors
He said there was no plan, but he did not rule out other options that might apply to Iran.
And markets always react to uncertainty.
Certainly, there is nothing certain now that America is at war with Iran.
And I am one of the people who don't watch this scene.
And perhaps we didn't know what would happen in the future.
But it's us who work in the energy sector.
We see these political tensions
In the world's oil supply
On the contrary, there are very profitable supplies.
This shows that there is oil going into storage.
There is absolutely no shortage of oil supplies.
Perhaps preparing for the next war.
In light of this confirmed picture you're talking about regarding supply and that there are no obstacles in the supply.
In case President Bush and the United States decide to change their plan.
This is another matter.
Prices will rise to reach private records.
Oil prices may reach
Global oil reserves
You are here, today the Gulf represents paramount importance.
In addition to Iraq, Iran, and other Gulf states
Today they account for more than 60% of oil reserves, which underscores its importance.
You today
If a very small accident happens.
So it indicates.
Which means that in the event of any war with Iran, this means that there is no guarantee of the extent to which oil prices will rise.
God knows if you will arrive today, we arrived without you.
It ranges between $117 and $110, and it could go up to $110, God knows.
Today, oil, as I told you, is living under political and psychological tensions.
And speculators joined these tensions.
She invested only in oil.
Or what is called not investing in real investment, of course, neither in future purchases nor in future marketing.
And it is called olive paper.
And all of them are guesses in the oil paper.
Its total production is around three hundred thousand barrels or less.
These people might lead to more purchases than their updates.
I wish April was April Fools' Day.
I hope there isn't one.
It is said that China is coming to the region, and this is on his main agenda.
China is the owner of this project, as many politicians and media celebrities have said.
I didn't know what was in the Chinese bag.
And I can't predict what will be in it, you know.
Will he start a war?
America is in transition.
And why doesn't the son do something else?
Let's see what happens, if we're talking about April, April is coming soon, just a few weeks and we'll be in April.
And the world may pay a price.
And America is a huge consumer.
In the Gulf countries
The Gulf will be the tough number.
You can't throw this number away.
Their production cost is very low.
Compared to West African countries, most of which rely on
The Gulf, no country in the world can
Look, we've been hearing this talk from the West and the United States for many years.
Use
"Et cetera, and do you remember the story of the Caspian Sea War?"
What are these dreams, anyway?
When you sit with Westerners in a small circle
You hear them speak in a different way.
What are they saying?
On supplies, the importance of the region, and the value of reserves.
When I asked a European official, I said, "It's strange that you talk among us in closed rooms."
Not in the same way you talk in front.
Or as the media said: It is for political reasons.
And of course, there is what is called double standards or two languages.
The language you know is Arabic, and the countries of the Gulf are known as the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, which include Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman.
It has importance today, just like Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
The largest producer and exporter of oil in the world
And entering into it.
Despite all this
Commander of the Central Region
Starting a war on Iran
Even with an air war or air raid as they say.
In the supplies
You are not late, in fact, you are very generous.
I don't agree with what you're saying.
We don't even deal with Westerners.
We deal with America.
Where the prices are good.
Regardless of this vulgar nationality
Situation, I mean non-renewable energy.
For the sake of (between parentheses) generosity
Arab generosity
Please give it to me.
Observers say the real price of oil
The reason behind the rise in oil prices
You are citizens and residents of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, OPEC members, and other nations.
You are very generous with Americans, insisting on keeping their currency.
I said the price of oil should be seventy dollars.
I said the actual price versus the decline of the U.S. dollar is sixty to seventy.
The price is now one hundred.
One hundred and nine due to the dollar's thirty percent drop.
And now it's over a hundred dollars.
If we take the percentage and the ratio
No one denies that.
One of the main reasons
Compared to the decline of the US dollar
If we take
This is a comparison.
Oil prices
Because the United States of America
Certainly, it is in our interest at the moment for the dollar to fall.
A weakness or recession in the American economy, the United States cannot "do anything."
So what happened to this economic weakness and recession?
You too become like that.
The United States is reducing the benefits of the dollar.
Why the insistence on linking oil to the dollar?
Let's talk about why oil prices are linked to the dollar.
The first in over 100 years.
The first person to export the first barrel of oil was from the United States of America.
And it was exported in dollars.
And that has been since the twentieth century until today.
Pricing oil in US dollars
Historically, it became
And for a hundred years, the world has been rearranging itself and setting prices.
And today, Norway is the third-largest oil producer.
And oil export.
Russia is the second-largest exporter of oil.
North Sea field production in Europe
Pricing in dollars, not in ... (The text is incomplete, so the missing part is left as is)
Everything is changing in the world; there are other sources and information pointing to something other than this.
Gulf countries
I have secret agreements between you and the Americans.
And oil became the real cover.
This is true and does not exist.
And these agreements
If oil continues to serve as a cover for the dollar in exchange for the United States maintaining the coverage of these systems.
This is not true and there are no secret agreements.
Today let's discuss OPEC.
You have sixty-six percent of the honorary deputy.
Among thirteen countries
Out of the eighty-five barrels, forty percent are allocated to OPEC.
There are many giant countries in oil production.
Outside OPEC
What are the obstacles to pricing in another currency?
Search for prices in another currency.
Isn't it when the adults decide?
You, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf states are business hotshots.
Today's OPEC class is like everyone else's.
There are sixty percent.
Even if we assume that OPEC wanted that.
There is an agreement among all oil-producing countries.
There is a trend and an intention towards change.
What kind of attempts?
But now these countries cannot change the pricing currency.
Unless there is an agreement between
What is the impact?
Let me now talk about why Europeans are like that.
They do not export their oil.
From the North Sea or Russia or Norway in euros or rubles
Because it's in their interest, their currency is high and expensive.
On the contrary.
Here is where they lost.
One euro buys one and a half barrels.
No, you are the one losing because the value of your currency has decreased since it's pegged to the dollar.
He is also a big loser, a huge loss.
The monetary union here in the Gulf has a historical relationship.
Do you remember when the dollar was the strongest currency in the world.
And now it's attached when you talk about detachment.
Like marriage when we get married.
And you want a divorce, it's not an easy matter.
No, here.
Or you had a dollar Catholic marriage.
And costs must be examined in a way
It was examined in a meticulous manner and it was examined.
And thus, as Kuwait did, it dismantled 25% of its dollar currency.
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE, and Qatar
You may adjust your currency's rate.
Today about this topic, but but that means you don't intend to study the topic or think about it.
Exams do vary, as the Prime Minister mentioned.
He reported that the Qatari currency is undervalued by thirty percent.
Be part of this study.
There's no direction in which you are the only ones walking in this matter.
As Kuwait went its own way, why don't you follow in its footsteps?
Economists say it is more profitable for countries and their people than losing.
But we
And that's another thing.
to declare these four Gulf states
Believed by everyone.
And by that, I mean those who personally support her.
Will support her.
It must be included in the study.
The text
He made what he made from one country or two.
Until the time of the appearance of currency
You can't save the situation now.
Certainly, there are experts who will conduct this research.
And they are the ones who
The experts have no political decision in this matter.
Let's wait and not rush now, see what happens today.
People started, I mean.
Certainly in a position of complicity
Honorable Deputy, the inflation rate in Qatar in 2007 has reached fourteen percent and will exceed fifteen percent next year.
He ate people's salaries, swallowed their wages, the wages of the workers here.
Resident salaries in Qatar have been cut by 30 to 40 percent.
We'll be back after the break to find out the extent of the pay increases.
Many of the staff are in Qatar at least for the coming period, so stay with us.
Welcome to "Without Borders" in this episode where we host the Deputy Prime Minister, Qatar's Minister of Energy.
Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah pointed to the huge increase in prices.
In oil, which brought billions of dollars to the Gulf states and producing countries.
I am writing about oil, and my question was about the upcoming increase in employees' salaries. However, before this increase, I would like to give you some important information.
The United Arab Emirates owns 97.8% of the reserves and produces 2.6 out of 10 billion.
يتم نشر بس الطن، وتقرير جريدة الكويت الزمني هو تقرير اقتصادي، وايرادات الخليج من بين الأكبر.
Saudi Arabia expected revenues in 2008 of $89 billion.
And it was
Last year, the United Arab Emirates had one hundred and seventy states. This year, it had sixty-six, and it was expected to have seventy-five.
Kuwait is forty-six and was forty-five.
Qatar imports twenty-one billion five hundred million barrels of oil.
He is a genius, as other reports have mentioned, and God bless him, I mean, we don't envy the deputy minister for his excellence.
Iraq is forty-seven billion.
One and a half trillion
In terms of spending, it was around one and a half trillion dollars.
"تصدير دول الخليج يعني تريليون، ألف مليار"
The dollar was a kind of import.
U.S. investment was three hundred billion.
And nine out of ten billion.
In Bahrain, it was three percent.
In 2007, in Oman, it was six and a half but it will rise to seven, in Qatar, it was thirteen and a half but it will rise to fifteen percent in Qatar.
That means people living in Qatar expect higher costs of living, goods, and prices.
Life is getting more expensive, and prices are rising to even higher levels in Qatar.
We empathize with everyone.
Then the solution must be
And the solution means that it aims to control inflation.
That means you'll increase their salaries by 50%.
No, they'll say you're against raising salaries.
This is not true.
And in the cabinet, against raising salaries.
There is a problem, and the solution must be the ideal one.
And it's not a temporary solution.
Alright, there's a balance between the two.
And there will be, there, there... That's all.
The important thing is to solve the inflation problem.
And here in Qatar, there is a committee.
His Highness issued a formation.
And he places
And lays strong foundations.
To solve the problem and control inflation
What is important now is to control inflation.
Inflation
If you don't control it
But, Mr. Deputy, now
Specialized in market research and published last February, just a few days ago.
Among them because of the salaries.
Now the problem of inflation will be solved and inflation will be left to devour the income of those people.
Many of them now
Income destined for other countries
Raise our salaries, then solve inflation and lower them again.
I repeat what they say, which is to balance the subject.
But now
And it is not a temporary solution.
Increase it to a greater extent.
Therefore, here.
To end inflation.
He will always feel bored.
Because the increase was enormous over the past year, right.
The second point is
Those who work in the private sector are not like those who work in the public sector.
The private sector is very neglected.
So this increase must also now be viewed justly.
I don't know where she got these notes from.
We live in Qatar, Your Excellency, not in Germany.
I tell you on the contrary, today the private sector has started to pay.
It is the most
Among the Qataris who were working in government offices, some have moved to the private sector.
Due to high salaries.
Facing a problem
Transitioning to the private sector because it is more vibrant and dynamic.
It provides good salaries.
Linked to what is called market power.
Market force
They don't come with very high qualifications.
They don't come to Qatar because Qatar has low salaries or low expenses.
Or they come with expenses.
Agreeing with our clear understanding
I don't predict events, nor do I say there will be a raise in salaries.
No hope either.
To control inflation
Let's give her some time.
In the field of inflation control
And God willing, this is what the report said, that Qatar in two thousand eight...
God willing, we say that.
We see that these numbers will change.
Spray some on people.
It's a professional process.
Certainly, professionally and in detail, but...
Impact of Inflation
Because spending
Too much on different projects.
Let me take some questions from the audience, and I hope everyone will ask direct questions. Abdulaziz Mohammed from Morocco, what's your question, brother Abdulaziz?
Based on the ruling families of the Gulf.
So I don't think the justification for that is an OPEC dispute.
The entire oil revenue is directed straight to the governor.
Then to the royal family and the rest will be spent on development.
In the absence of accountability, the status quo will persist.
Peace, forgiveness, and blessings from God.
Hello, Brother Ahmed
I won't belabor the point. The brother mentioned something regarding systems of government, the Qatari riyal system, the dollar, or other Gulf currencies pegged to the dollar.
America wants to globalize the world and have it owe allegiance to her.
The American deficit has grown, with Sino-American trade reaching eighty billion dollars.
The European Union is providing her with sixty-eight billion dollars.
This means that all trends in global politics are against the dollar.
And now we are paying the price of its consequences as Arab and Gulf oil-producing states.
It will head towards a confrontation with America.
Among the advanced countries of the world, such as China and Russia and others, the subject may become
Pure military
For the explosion, Chinese, Russian, Japanese, and American bombs as well.
Many thanks for this clarification and information.
Your question, Muhammad, is...
Hello, your question?
Can you turn down the TV and ask me?
Okay, your question is...
But what I saw was that His Highness insisted on not replying.
The topic is not being linked to the dollar because the dollar is in decline.
And God willing, you will reach the bottom.
He is a good man.
He should not follow the style of the Arab brothers.
Thank you, Brother Mohammed. Thank you. Now we call for the final intervention from Ahmed Hassan from Qatar. Your question, Ahmed, is...
Good evening to you as well.
Thank you and thank you for the great interview.
What is required is a salary increase; with God's permission, things will improve.
It's true that we all face problems, but not because of salaries.
Insha'Allah, things will work out.
Alright, just tell me your question quickly.
Your line will be disconnected, do you have any questions?
All that is because of the high prices, the increase has reached all goods, they are all exported.
I am from European countries.
We in the Arab world have factories and laboratories.
Thank you, Ahmed, for taking the time.
The current state of price hikes is a significant one.
"In the context of supporting the poor, the man told you to stay with the poor, my lord."
Those who don't have a billion here are considered poor.
We are here for our brothers.
Who doesn't know Qatar?
For the State of Qatar, this is not true.
Today, anyone coming to Qatar can see the indicators.
What are the growth indicators in Qatar?
Highest growth indicators in the world
Where does this wealth go and what do you do with it?
What's included in the response?
When the Moroccan speaks, he speaks in a way that is not genuine and does not reflect reality.
The person who does not see with his own eye.
If he came and saw Qatar and how many tremendous developments are taking place there.
Given your remarkable growth, you are right to ask.
And every person has the right.
And you are a small people, so where will you bring people from?
Does that really mean you'll be bringing in surpluses from China, for example?
No, we will not export ourselves, God willing.
The country is based on a plan and
Complete independence from revenue coming from oil and gas, and everyone knows that oil and gas will run out one day.
that the State of Qatar will become
It is considered one of the best achievements in the Arab world.
Today as well
Focus on
And which will have a tremendous impact.
After oil and gas
You're not copying Dubai.
Every country has its distinctive features.
In the State of Qatar, we focused on education.
On the components
There will be a medical city where people come to get treatment.
There will be an adaptable media city.
Certainly, the world today, today we must build.
Building a vision
Beyond Oil and Gas
There were fatal errors.
Unfortunately, we did not welcome this change because it surprised us.
And we were not prepared for it, neither humanly, nor technically, nor even educationally.
Now it has changed after thirty years.
And better yet
Today there is visibility.
And the vision
And the vision
Thank you, Your Excellency, and I also thank our audience.
To stay with us in the hope that we have provided you with
Qatar's foreign policy appears to be enigmatic to many observers.
Qatar enjoys special relations.
And at the same time that Qatar had relations with Israel and still does

What angered the regime in Egypt.
To the extent of accusing Qatar of conspiring against Egypt.
Qatar was not far from important files.
Like Darfur, the Houthis in Yemen, and even the Israeli captive.
Gilad Shalit, the Qatari foreign policy extended a hand to him in a way that disturbed the largest Arab states.
And what kind of power do you put in this situation?
These achievements
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani
Write to us via our website www.aljazeera.net
Hello, Ambassador.
On September 22, 2007, to Saudi Arabia.
The visit marked a shift in the relationship between the two countries over the past two years.
Redrawing the borders
Wash what was stored.
This is what was mentioned.
In a newspaper or magazine reservation.
The one that was held with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in which the relationship was restored and the Saudi ambassador returned.
To Doha
First, your introduction was too long and required a lot of answers without your last question.
What I think you gave me.
Especially regarding Saudi Arabia.
What is flour?
Saudi Arabia is very important to Qatar.
Between the two countries
I spoke about the silence of the island.
I talked about a revolutionary movement.
I believe these matters have been clarified from both sides.
And we accepted the explanation.
In the State of Qatar
Conflict with Saudi Arabia
It was always limited in scope.
From perspectives
And, praise be to God, that was due to the wisdom of the two leaders.
King Abdullah and His Royal Highness the Prince
Noticeably in the Gulf
Over a hundred years ago
It was bright, noble, and based on trust.
I want to reduce misunderstandings between two parties.
This issue was addressed and there were no conditions.
In solving any issue
But there was understanding and there was sincere intent between the parties.
To resolve this pending issue
It's not a seasonal relationship, but a strategic one.
We want it not to continue but to evolve.
A pleasant diplomatic conversation.
Saudi Arabia withdraws its ambassador from Qatar.
I'm not used to speaking diplomatically, or I could have prevented a lot of problems.
I always say what I believe.
So, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is not diplomacy but faith.
The island is subject to media coverage.
Between the parties, many countries became involved as intermediaries.
Believing that it might take points to gain points at the expense of other countries.
Or at the expense of Qatar.
At the expense of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
Harmony within the Gulf household
I mean compared to what it was before.
It's part of a political agreement.
No, no, there was no agreement, just an agreement of love and care.
But otherwise, you can ask the island management.
Have you established strategic relationships with Saudi Arabia to prevent what happened before?
It was originally based on a close strategy.
Can we say it in one, two, three, and four?
There must be unity.
And some differences were settled on this basis.
Between some Arab countries and an attempt to reunite the other differences.
Because now, if we look at the differences in the Arab world, they are all differences based on different points of view.
When we have a viewpoint on a certain policy in a particular action in a given situation, and another country has a different opinion.
Two points of view are considered.
Some observers see that you enjoy criticizing Saudi Arabia.
His criticism
Were you tired and decided to head in a different direction, and from there moved to a bigger country, which is Egypt?
Alright, it's the same idea.
No, no, we don't enjoy either of those, and we have nothing to do.
To deal with any party in this manner
I mean that the reasons for the conflict with Saudi Arabia are over.
Among them, and I know that there is a very great understanding.
And you know that we created.
And there will be some kind of model.
But Saudi Arabia
Let me put this on two lines.
You started engaging with the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram in the eighteenth issue last April.
The Egyptian Official Gazette
In a comprehensive investigation, it was stated that extensive inquiries had been conducted.
Hezbollah's network uncovered a sabotage plot.
Egypt is the target, and there are three countries involved: Iran, Syria, and Qatar.
Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood
And a well-known media machine for its conspiratorial role.
Qatar is the smallest Arab country.
Conspiring against Egypt
We respect.
And its conflict over the years
What I say has no emotional impact on anyone.
Let me finish, I'm not done yet.
We appreciate
President of Egypt
"And who is eager"
On Arab relations.
The first point
Gaza Situation
As they say and as we acknowledge
Qatar is
Smaller country
It could be part of such plans.
Because we have suffered from interventions by other countries in the past, and I don't want to go back to that.
After the intervention of some countries in domestic affairs.
Thus, the policy of His Highness's government.
Now that they've discovered what they call a conspiracy.
What I'm trying to say is that the house is God's protection, Syria and Iran can defend themselves, I won't defend them.
If stability prevails in Egypt.
And why would Qatar want to change or interfere in such a matter?
As for the pyramids, they do not create things from nothing.
It was said that the small state of Qatar sought to undermine Egypt's role and its relations with Turkey and the European Union.
And you sought to hold a conference equivalent to the Arab Summit to steal the spotlight.
And you are using a media platform, which is Al Jazeera channel.
Yes, please.
With Hezbollah
And we're not comfortable with it.
But I can say that we are certain.
We
The principle is non-interference in such circumstances.
We were forced by our brothers in Egypt, and for that we blame the Egyptian authorities.
The ongoing dispute with some members of the Egyptian government
But some officials have problems with
With what?
I'm coming to that.
Days of the sweet scent of peace, and the cause of peace and that we are.
He was previously detained in Egypt.
And later with us.
Because Israel
We have a dispute with her.
You have no quarrel with Israel.
And now, because of the conference, from that day on.
Any Islamic or Arab conference, they are sensitive to it.
This is an allergy.
Why don't we sit with them?
Let me finish.
And we always hope for the best.
We discovered that this is an allergy.
Or three
The Gaza conference was held.
That Egypt does not wish for him to reside in Qatar.
It is not Arabic.
In Qatar, and there is a summit in Kuwait, we told them.
The Palestinian people are under attack.
For more than two weeks
But we hold it before any arranged conference, the Kuwait conference which we were the first to attend.
People are being killed and
And with postponement
The conflict began.
No microstate can
I know there are some brothers in the government, and this is also an insult to Egypt, not to anyone else.
When they said that after
Okay, you're on the island.
The Israelis reported the day before a meeting to cease hostilities before any speech or person or anything.
What is it?
My brother allowed medicine and food to enter during the beating that our brothers were forced to endure.
When they say the gate was narrow.
We can't bring in the trucks.
When they tell us there's an agreement on the other side and they have to come.
Now is not the right time to bring up Fatah or Hamas.
I am not concerned with either Fatah or Hamas; we are concerned with the one and a half million who are being beaten.
And those who have no medicine.
When we started talking about this subject and discussing the Gaza conference
And if Qatar intervenes in the matter, it will affect the Egyptian regime.
It's not an intervention.
We did not say how Egypt would resolve the situation because that is its own affair.
One of the officials said, "We have uncovered a major conspiracy behind this."
He hasn't told us what the plot is yet.
We mean this formal.
He tells us that Egypt is important.
Alright, we understand that Egypt is a large Arab country and we always say that Egypt is a big country.
That's why we always ask a lot of questions from a big country.
Because Egypt is ours.
And you were invited to a conference where there was also a movement for them.
We were invited to a conference.
Reconstruction of Gaza
We coordinated and had a unified position.
People in Gaza are suffering.
Forbidden, I know Turkey entered things through Israel.
I would be happy to see him pass through our brothers in Egypt.
They are part of us.
And if Egypt wins or does good political work
We believe that this is in the interest of Qatar and the entire Arab world.
Egypt's stability is very important to us.
If she does a good job, that's important to us.
Let me finish your question, your presentation took a quarter of an hour.
The issue now is that you've lost me.
No, I'll tell you, I'll tell you now anger.
Egyptian regime officials
We are behind the failure of the Qatar summit.
The second thing is that they were the ones who failed the Qatar conference.
King Abdullah had the wisdom he desired.
And he wanted to make reconciliations.
That's why some countries were not allowed to attend.
And I have said this to our brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia because we
I have no disagreement with Saudi Arabia, even on this point.
Because, as explained, there are internal problems.
Or an official
Among high-ranking officials
A large country finds it hard to believe that a small country is doing such things.
It means he was there for you.
Take on any role.
Darfur is part of the national security of Egypt and Sudan.
The five major countries decided.
There will be no country but Qatar that will be fine.
But these sensitivities will only make matters worse. Why do you have to bring your noise into everything around you?
We want to address this allergy, we take an antihistamine, they should tell us what this allergy is.
Why these sensitivities?
That some brothers from the government
They want, they have an internal failure.
They want to draw attention to a plot in Gaza Revolution.
As the English say, "It's a case of 'blame the Italians'."
Whenever something happens
Not only for instructions but also for analytics.
We know what happened because
The issue must be resolved locally.
And it has not been solved.
No, my priority is my country.
My priority is to first look into the reasons that concern my country.
Then see if I have enough time.
And to consider the causes that concern my Arab nation.
Qatar attempted reconciliation.
And thinking about any Arab issue where she can contribute as much as she can.
Why is it provocative? Why don't we take it in good faith?
I can't fix you.
I can explain my point of view.
Don't throw it at me.
And from our perspective
That sprang from his heart
Let me finish.
When he announced an initiative for reconciliation and gathered all the presidents in Kuwait, we hoped for something good and welcomed it.
There are instructions.
Of course, the Egyptian official who clarified his heroism.
In a report or TV interview or something like that, I think I wouldn't respond to that.
Because I have an answer for every point.
But to maintain the minimum of relations that bind us and connect Arab interests.
It is also a response to the call mentioned by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.
But what I can advise him and others is
They are trying to rectify their mistakes, both internally and externally.
In politics, economics, or otherwise, we have our own mistakes in politics and economics, so no one is infallible.
Because they accuse Qatar of all these charges.
Do you deny the existence of a relationship between Qatar and Hezbollah?
This is a funny topic.
Distortion of Egypt's relations, erosion of its role, and deterioration of its ties with Turkey and the European Union.
Primarily, we are few in number.
If we are able to play this role.
This is not true.
There are some accusations directed at you personally.
Paying money to Shalit's captives so that Qatar will bring Shalit and bypass the Egyptian role in this matter.
They always accuse us of paying money, but initially we didn't pay any money and didn't talk to anyone about giving money.
But this issue
We support Egypt in resolving the issue, just as we support Egypt, and we are still working on resolving the issue between the Palestinians.
It was he who allowed the Palestinian president to stay until the issue is resolved.
We were there and among the first to support the State of Qatar.
In power and to maintain Palestinian institutions until the conflict is resolved.
And We said:
At the Arab League, but he said no, we achieved it because we believe that some people don't want that.
But we did it cleverly.
Is he addressing his boss?
His Prime Minister
I honestly didn't know there was a problem.
I know some of them.
They decided now in the twelfth issue last month April exclusively with Al-Shuruq newspaper.
The political leadership in Egypt has decided to launch a satellite news channel to confront and end what is known as Al Jazeera.
This will be over in a matter of days.
Are you afraid that the island will become a thing of the past?
You mean we are now living in a political adolescence.
Just as you traveled to Saudi Arabia, the Emir of Qatar sat with the Saudi king.
We didn't give in to them, nor did they give in.
We treated them as brothers.
A small country yielding to the large countries, Egypt.
There is no Saudi Arabia, there is an important point we need to clarify.
The relationship between Qatar and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is different.
And then we talk.
Well, what is the relationship between Qatar and Egypt?
We rely on it heavily.
Let me be honest with you.
Is it a dispute in the main policy?
I hope this is not a personal dispute because we have no personal dispute. I told you that we respect the Egyptian people.
If you asked me, I'd say there are two problems: Gaza and the rest.
This issue has affected us all greatly.
We want to solve this from a psychological perspective, that is, to solve this dilemma.
Published in some newspapers
Minister of Foreign Affairs
In the presence of Sheikh Saud Al-Faisal
We talked about everything.
But it's clear that things have gotten worse and haven't been resolved.
No, no, there was no listening.
I cannot tell you about our relationship with Egypt.
They blame us, and they are entitled to as our brothers.
And we blame them as we rightly should our younger brothers.
With the big country, we don't want to compare ourselves to any other big country.
I mean, Egypt is large in terms of satisfaction.
It's not a matter of life or death, but rather the solution must come from above.
If there's anyone waiting for satisfaction, it's us.
Or wait for a way.
In Qatar
You will deal with non-peers or non-siblings.
As a large country, yes, we are proud of Egypt as a great nation.
But if someone misleads someone else
I know that Israel is doing this to us.
America's previous policy under the previous administration was with me or against me.
So I don't think they want to imitate Israel or America in this matter.
As if taking their policies, they also face pressures from third parties.
In many cases, let me finish.
We understand and know that even for a big country there are some guidelines.
What drives your policies?
We have no motion, what moves us is one thing.
Qatar's internal affairs are our internal matter.
And whenever we can help the Arab world, we will.
Sources of power: Al Jazeera and Al-Waleed base
Can you say that this is not strength?
Our faith in God and trust in Him.
Vision of Her Highness the Princess
We don't want to bother anyone.
Let me finish, we don't want to cause any trouble for anyone.
And we don't want to compete with anyone.
They can say what they want, Great Qatar or otherwise.
But we have a point of view.
First, we expelled the Israeli office and closed it down.
At first they were saying close the office, so we closed it, then they got angry and went to complain to the Americans. Do you believe these people?
Join the team called the Devil's Team.
What they say
Americans, Europeans, and my friends—we know how to deal with them.
Schemes
Created
This is a flaw. We've reached a certain point, and then what?
Tell me now.
How will the problem with Egypt be solved?
And based on the fact that Egypt plays a significant role in the Arab world.
We believe it is important to consider it.
And I am sure that President Hosni Mubarak was cautious about that.
But some of the crew
I need to leave.
Occupying the Egyptian public opinion or government leadership or others or absurdity.
And focusing on Arab and Egyptian interests.
Are there any steps?
We are behind them, not ahead of them, because they are a great nation.
In the near future
Frankly, I can't imagine how that would happen.
And I know that there is a time for rationality.
And there will be a time for either of us.
If it was up to me
Some of them
Major Arab interests brought them together.
One day we will solve this problem.
You mean that life still goes on.
That means we won't respond in the same Egyptian style you have.
If we help someone, we'll give them an arm.
Now, Your Highness.
We never used to run.
Unless we have a good foundation and are ready to work for Egypt.
Standing with Egypt
There are many rumors about Egyptian workers in Qatar and how they are affected by this issue.
There are contracts for Egyptians working either in universities or key positions.
Learn that in this matter it is not our habit to cancel and abolish jobs.
Because these people have nothing to do with this.
This is a market where demands change, they cancel one and bring in another.
It's supply and demand, and there are other nationalities that have increased while some have decreased.
Alright, a quick answer.
The office was there.
We've disturbed them in the office, so it's best we leave now.
We were going to discuss it during the days when there was a campaign, all our losses in negotiations with Israel were because of this office.
We've closed it, let them fix it with Netanyahu.
He was a guest.
And among them, it is our custom to invite all the ambassadors accredited to any foreign state.
So there was no formal invitation to honor Gabriela Shalev.
No, we didn't respect her before when the relations, as they say, were good. We'll respect her now. It's a bit difficult.
There is no reason now for you to reopen the office during this period.
The office will reopen when there are no longer any reasons not to.
Your crime is great.
Who made it as big as Egypt?
Egypt imposed this.
Let me clarify, our relationship with America is a strategic one.
In some things, and this.
What is the most important thing?
There are issues in our region regarding the resolution of certain matters where we disagreed with the previous administration.
Now we have high hopes for the administration, especially with the steps taken by President Obama.
We believe there is a great hope that this administration
He is considered serious about advancing the peace process and serious about resolving the Palestinian issue.
They are our friends, and we don't deny it.
What is happening in Iran, and what are its potential implications for the Gulf and you?
Iranians must decide how to solve their issues.
Among themselves
In their usual ways, and I'm sure they'll overcome this crisis.
Iran's stability as mentioned by the Emir of Qatar.
The Gulf region is of great importance to us, and we share a border with Iran.
Certainly, we have special relations with all our neighbors, including Iran.
Because our country seeks peace and stability for this region.
And we intervene whenever one of the parties wants to change the Doha Agreement.
And I believe that Saad Hariri said
Now it's over, and what remains is the strategic talk between the president.
And Lebanese groups
How to see
As for Yemen, there is no role for you or they have simply taken a stand.
Listen, it's known that we supported unity while most of the Arab world was against Yemeni unity.
We are the only Arab country and Gulf state that stood with the unity of Yemen.
As for the south, we have spoken with Yemen, and His Highness the Prince sent me twice to meet with the Yemeni President.
I explained to him that our goal is the stabilization of Yemen because Yemen is an important country in the Arabian Peninsula.
And this agreement was not respected, and I do not wish to say what each party did.
But what really touched me
This is Qatar, which took this position and was then accused of paying money to senior Houthi figures and high-ranking Yemeni officials.
Because we don't interfere in such matters.
And he who stands with unity does not stand against it.
Another goal is in the interest of Yemen, whether from a political, economic, or other perspective.
We don't mind that, but I was genuinely surprised.
Because I had gone more than ten times during the fighting, His Highness sent me to Yemen among the Yemenis.
Unfortunately, this is a strange accusation.
Time is up but briefly, will the problems you faced due to your attempt to solve issues change your policies of interfering in the problems of other Arab states?
If he had only heard it from me, I see no need.
There was a big show once.
Over five billion dollars at that time, if we had invested it, it would have been better than fifty billion dollars of this suffering.
But I say this with faith, because the time in the Arab world now
That is not allowed under these circumstances.
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
Perhaps even exceptional with Sheikh Hamad's case.
What happened to the Doha agreement?
How did the Doha Miracle happen?
Issuing a mandate to the committee and providing it with all support.
Discussion of Lebanon after the Israeli invasion
When there was an Arab consensus
And when we went to New York, we were able to make a fairly balanced decision.
And we strove for that, hoping that the two parties would be anticipating.
We tried our best not to hear it or be there.
Because we knew the committee, we knew.
The reality on the ground, and we know what the problem is after we sat with the Lebanese for long hours.
I believe it's a shared success.
But there was insistence.
I think Lebanon's problem is that the atmosphere of the region directly reflects on it.
Whether peaceful or non-peaceful
Lebanon was supposed to be in this position.
With these conditions
Unfortunately
External consequences
I can say that the problem between Lebanese people, even if there is one, will not be the first problem.
Alright, Sheikh, I know that perhaps the time is not now, maybe it's too early to talk about the scenes, but
What happened, you came here?
I've kind of stopped talking about the subject on the ground now.
You weren't even a second late.
I know exactly what was happening, even the leaders of Lebanon were telling me what happened.
Not from the beginning
When I spoke to His Highness
I told him that we went to Lebanon.
I'll put the idea forward, and he agreed and supported it.
Where all Lebanese leaders will be present.
Because you're here in Beirut, you'll have to go to each region separately.
While they are in the same hotel and in the same place.
They met on the same plane and talked.
Thus we created this atmosphere, but from the beginning, our idea was
And this was the most important decision made by both of them.
Certainly
And I felt this from the Arab League.
Then we must be honest brokers.
And thank God, I think this proved to everyone that Qatar has made an effort.
On both sides.
To reach a fair solution for both parties.
And that there is a solution and no one will lose.
Before you make any move
The consultation was held at the Arab League and we found support.
What did we do?
And I told him while we were there.
If we succeed in Lebanon, we'll take them to Doha.
And he recommended me.
Shut them down and prevent them from using their mobile phones.
We were able to bring them there, and brothers in Syria also supported the situation.
And I told you from the beginning that the committee could do anything without Arab support.
Why did they want a solution?
I believe that the situation in Lebanon and the developments that have taken place
And this time
There is tension in Somalia, there is tension in Sudan.
There are a lot of things happening in the world.
And every time we put out a fire
It is in the higher interest of the Arab world to be free from foreign intervention.
We try our best.
Send troops.
Even if he's a soldier.
For example, I think this is a topic.
There's a point of discussion.
He always said that the solution to the Lebanese issue was...
Saudi-Syrian Agreement
To stop the Arabs, I mean Qatar and the Arab league.
Could what happened in Lebanon lead to serious reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Syria?
You need self-criticism in the Arab world.
Because of Arabic differences.
And any agreement between two Arab countries.
And we tried this.
In the Seventy-Three War
When Arabs agree on a solution to an issue.
I think it's interesting.
Saudi Arabia and Syria play an important role in Lebanon.
Both parties must
Invasion of wisdom
Arab relations are on the right track.
Because we here in the Arab world face many big challenges.
All the people are playing in our yard.
And we have no power nor strength.
And how can we stop playing in the courtyard of Arab countries?
As Arabs, we should at least adhere to the minimum agreement.
Unfortunately, we complain.
While we watch
Our difference as Arabs and the lack of trust among us; trust is absent between Arab countries.
And the Arab states
It's not so much betrayal as it is a kind of...
Jealousy, what is this word?
This is a case that needs the support of everyone, I mean, I think.
Alright, will you make this wish come true and really call for an Arab summit?
We suffer when you suffer and rejoice when you rejoice.
He came in the middle of the conversation.
Could we take a role in repairing the situation between Damascus and Riyadh, even if?
He is seeking solutions, and I am confident in their wisdom.
They might reach an understanding.
Among them in many cases
There was harmony in politics, and I am sure that, God willing, this will continue.
Relations improved.
Both parties need to take a step.
But I can't be sure that's what's happening now.
I am sure that if Arabs focus on resolving disputes among Arab countries and the problems of some Arab countries that I mentioned earlier.
Optimism and a sense of pride for the citizen that there is a general Arab awakening.
But I can't say what happened in Lebanon.
This can be interpreted on the ground as an Israeli-Palestinian escalation.
There might be an American-Iranian escalation, perhaps other cases.
Will you still be afraid of him in the coming months?
We, as Arabs
We can't just deliver food and medicine.
Electricity for the people.
We in Qatar are ready and always up for it.
There are more than one and a half million Palestinians under siege.
And we do not want them to possess weapons or support.
They do all this.
And no electricity.
And we hand it over to the Red Cross to deliver it to the Palestinians.
With the Palestinians, we only provide them with food and medicine.
And our problem with them could continue.
And I hope that the Palestinians on both sides will place the national interest above all else.
Leave illusions behind.
The Palestinian division is now a deep wound.
To find a solution
But they didn't commit
This is a serious matter, they must abide by the Mecca Agreement.
And they must ask even to return to Mecca and Saudi Arabia.
Resolve this difference.
They won't benefit.
And any promises from any party
Wishing there was a solution, but
Our position is known and stated to all concerned parties that we
We won't be part of it and we won't accept being part of any military conflict with Iran.
We have good relations with her.
But we are a sovereign state and they are a sovereign state.
Everyone is looking out for their own interests, but these interests won't harm them or us.
We believe that the fate of the Gulf should be clearly agreed upon with the Gulf Cooperation Council.
Iranian cooperation and peaceful neighborhood
But when Your Excellency says that Qatar is not a party.
Any details or clarifications
Just a sign.
No, never.
Alright, I'd like to go back to the Lebanon file if that's okay.
Honestly, we faced a big obstacle, but we reached a solution in the last few hours.
Some linked what happened to what was announced.
The information might be scattered and unrelated to each other except for what happened.
What led you to this conclusion?
What happened in Istanbul I know, if it had specific dates before.
So you knew there were negotiations.
Continuous search for a solution
Undoubtedly, the Kingdom's support is very important.
And changing negotiation tactics.
These negotiations were led by her.
To a positive outcome; we gathered some parties from some sides.
And we started talking.
There is an Arab and Qatari approach in this paper.
Tell me what's wrong with this paper.
And we started talking about one topic after another.
At the last moment to overcome an obstacle that lasted until the end.
But the prince met with the parties.
And get rid of this obstacle.
And there was a solution.
We heard a word from the Emir of Qatar at the opening session in Doha.
Do not consider your role now.
It's very important that we stay out of the spotlight.
I have no territorial ambitions.
Or even control another state or something like that because our state...
Our size... We are proud of ourselves, we believe we can contribute to solving issues with our fellow peers.
But in the Arab world, it is of utmost importance.
To have countries that are
We want them to do something, and it's important.
Some small countries were allowed to take on this role and were supported.
In some things, it's excellent; in others, good; and in some, less than good.
Your last question.
What is the central priority?
Is it a political priority?
Security or repairing enmity
or confront Israel
We stop playing in the Arabic court.
We are fixing our problems in the Arab countries.
Choosing an active member in Iraq
To calm things down
At the national and regional levels
But if we become stubborn
Or he will have any hope.
Thank you, His Excellency Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani, for this meeting.
International efforts to end the war on Gaza.
We start by requesting a meeting with the Council of the League of Arab States at the ministerial level.
As if you changed your mind about
Request for an emergency Arab summit
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, I am happy, brother Hassan, to have you participate in this program.
Despite the humanitarian circumstances
Facing our brothers in Gaza
Conditions require us to do a lot.
Qatar did not ignore the Arab summit.
In fact, when we went with the idea of the Arab summit before that
Not only the Security Council resolution, but also through
It is neither desecrated nor belittled.
Let me put it another way.
And we are punished.
That the street can no longer bear it, if we, the responsible ones for the Arab street, have been negligent.
You won't bear it.
When we were in Egypt
There was written consent from ten to eleven.
Some of them spoke at the meeting, and we could have held a meeting.
We consider it as long as there is Arab consensus.
And I don't blame them if, in a meeting, they might have a point of view.
And how can the problem be solved?
Because it will be solved.
This is the important issue.
Since our goal is not propaganda and advertising, our goal is to find.
So you didn't ignore the summit.
So we ask ourselves
We will go to put pressure on the other poor side.
The previous and subsequent Security Council resolution, but let's just stick to the topic of the Arab summit, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Speak clearly that the situation may require an Arab summit with whoever attends.
We discovered that the majority of our brothers support holding the summit.
With whom is he coming?
And I don't know what they mean by moderation.
We are the only state.
The Arab state only if we go to any country in Asia or Latin America.
Unsolved
Classified as neutral nations
And what is moderation in our view?
Will you abandon the Palestinian cause?
Just because we don't like them.
Are we interfering in the affairs of the Palestinians in some way?
No nation allows interference, whether good or bad.
Like Hezbollah, and who knows, maybe another movement will emerge tomorrow.
Is he asking?
And can we accept them as part of the Arab body?
As if we were meant to engage in an internal Arab conflict.
Alright, if we go to the Security Council.
There is no decision in the Security Council.
I hope Israel completes its mission.
Alright, the second Arab ministerial meeting you were invited to attend.
Overwhelmed by intense debates, disagreements, and disputes.
There is an important point.
This is not what matters.
When we call for a meeting
Around the terminals
No more peace.
Are the ministers ready for that?
Because there's a party telling you we have to wait.
But we are in an Arab initiative.
And halt peace negotiations with Israel.
We say that we are on one side, saying that we are losing in this.
There is a greater loss than the one we have suffered now, but we have always been respectful, polite, and committed to decisions since the days of the truce.
You say that arguments are not important.
There was someone who wished that Hamas could be destroyed and such.
This reflects a political stance more than it does a dispute between two ministers.
Unfortunately, this happened.
But not everyone
I don't want to speak for others.
It is important to be men of ourselves and men of our state.
We implement our countries' policies.
Who does these things on her behalf?
I think
I don't think they'll respect us in the end.
Yes, is there anyone doing things on behalf of the West?
No, and I hope I don't accuse anyone. I don't want to accuse anyone in this matter.
After the Security Council resolution
What is her agenda?
The situation began with a decision to exert Arab efforts.
And the difference here is if Israel implements this decision immediately.
We can say that there is a decision.
But Israel did not implement the resolution.
Are we ready now to go and ask for Chapter Seven? I'm quite sure there will be difficulties.
The international community is not questioning them, and if it does, it's too late.
You will be ashamed.
The situation
Look, they did something for the Jew and the Israeli.
Taking their rights
This is the current Arab situation.
If the Arab does not go to the Security Council
They agree to hold a summit and make tough decisions.
And the Western countries will try for us.
Because we are in the heart of the Arab world, there are a lot of people, and you can see how the Arab street is reacting to this.
But this decision is important.
With the issue of naming our leaders one after another.
In the end, they said there was nothing, which was a lie.
We can be like Germany now or we will demand it.
They don't have to pay any compensation because they were the ones who attacked, just say you have incorrect information.
And the killing of a hundred thousand.
This is because you are a weak Arab party.
We went as Arabs, some of us.
Work hard on how to
Display it.
In a manner as if it were destiny and God's will.
If the Arab nation says you will send forces to Darfur, we will send forces to Darfur.
The Arabs, or some consider, consider Resolution 1860.
And our colleagues worked hard to issue the decision.
What has been issued by the Security Council.
I don't want to say whether it was a victory or not.
And what will lead to
Let's assume that victory
What will we do?
We are supposed to disagree with the rest of the decision.
But I assure you that we will abide by the decision.
Unfortunately, you will agree with the decision even though you shouldn't.
Even after the Israeli rejection, Israel came and agreed.
We mean that we
Will you have a substitute, or are you the one calling for a ministerial meeting?
I don't think the Arab nation...
At the same time, ready for any alternatives.
And I don't think the Arab nation is ready.
In implementing the Gaza blockade
For various political reasons
To make one group prevail over another in Palestine instead of reconciling them.
We start trying to make plans.
When they met, I don't know any European-Arab intelligence or anything like that without mentioning names.
And if they do that, I mean we participate.
In implementation
What is required of us from the West?
But if we go
I want there to be order in this.
Certainly, I'm not talking about the decision, I'm talking about...
Following up on the issue because the Gaza issue started two years ago, not now.
I'll talk about the subject two years ago but precisely regarding a specific decision.
Do you have reservations about his conditions?
Neither enacted nor implemented
We were invited.
Perhaps they think we have a different viewpoint.
It was necessary for everyone to have the same point of view.
It's not necessary for everyone to share the same viewpoint, but I think those who went made an effort.
And we thank them for that.
Regarding what has been happening in Gaza for the past two years, and you mentioned the parties involved.
Control of one group over another participating in the siege of Gaza
You really agree with the statements, insinuations, or accusations that have been made here and there.
Conspire an Arab plot amidst all that's happening in Gaza now.
We report partially.
From this case, let me tell you that we are not fully aware.
But I know.
The Palestinian conflict
He was fed at the Arab and international levels.
And if it hasn't been refueled, it won't make much difference.
And that was after the elections.
And Hamas came and seized power.
By majority
We should've given them a chance and seen.
Do they want reform, or are they still revolutionaries who only know weapons and fighting?
But the day they came.
At the Arab level, some of our brothers believed that these extremist movements should not come to power.
Some say that an assault has just occurred.
Manufactured by Hamas, which breached the truce, or those Palestinians from Gaza who breached the truce.
Truce
The suffering of the Palestinian people in Gaza from hunger continues for two years.
This is acceptable.
For reasons of Israeli security
It's clear we don't want them to have authority, but that doesn't matter to me in Qatar.
But what's wrong with the rest of the people?
And then who is supposed to decide?
That this or that, not every country has the authority to choose.
Our government
The main problem is.
But I'm sure it could have been solved.
If only we had worked hard, we had worked hard to ignite the conflict.
But it's clear that we were asked to empower one group at the expense of the other because this group...
We consider them terrorists or we consider them.
Everything that happened leads to
Even the promises they made to the party that they would grant them a decent life.
They didn't do anything for them.
We return to the international and Arab efforts exerted to end what is happening, according to what you stated as being your stance.
There is a Security Council resolution that Israel has rejected so far.
And there is the Egyptian Initiative, it is the only one.
And Egypt in Cairo
Those Egyptian efforts
Absolutely, there's nothing trying to wriggle free.
What is required for an important position?
Egypt's borders are also adjacent to Israel and Palestine.
We
And that we do not want to stop the chaos now.
In Gaza, and we are bringing people to stop the chaos in Gaza because
This is not the path to peace.
Must be
And thus we always ask them to play a big role.
What was announced.
Does that mean you can't assess the initiative now?
Giving the possibility of success or study.
I think there's a chance for his success.
If the brothers in Egypt are able
Making Palestinian perspectives more similar.
The party affected in Gaza is supposed to discuss the initiative.
Because he is the one who can say yes or no.
And this is an important point.
When Resolution 1960 was issued.
This is an Arab-Palestinian problem that we suffer from.
We don't want to hear any party.
But I really wanted to, when the Palestinian delegation went.
And when they went to the league, they asked to have someone from Gaza with them.
To show the Israelis that these are our brothers and we are with them.
This is an important point.
We don't allow authority.
Our goal is not to focus our policy.
Staying in power
Sheikh now
I don't know if it's possible to discuss the Egyptian initiative since you haven't reviewed its materials.
Do you think, in principle, that this could be appropriate as a mechanism to implement UN Resolution 1860 as some people have suggested?
Balanced role
Now, not tomorrow or the day after, because
Every day passes.
There will be bloodshed for our brothers there.
Therefore, we do not want any delay or postponement from the Israelis on this matter. When they finish their mission, we will put forward this initiative.
And I am sure that the brothers in Egypt know this and reflect on it.
I want to clarify everything you said.
Now we have to solve this issue.
And not as Israel wants it to be.
I've been drawn to the Turkish role since the beginning of the crisis.
Does it express?
Arab vacuum
And without a doubt, it's a prominent position.
And it has an Arabic depth.
His entry into the world of Arab disability.
We know there is an Arab disability.
Part of it was due to conflicts.
Partly due to perspective, everyone believes their viewpoint is the best.
And another person thinks his viewpoint is better.
And there is no conscience. How are people allowed to respect and acknowledge the existence of an Arab decision?
Or will they follow us one by one?
The other will say, "No, it's fine, we'll just give them two or three extra days to communicate with them and bring the comrades up to speed and solve the problem."
We need to rise above this and not accept it.
Hamas may have mistakes, but we will deal with them.
At the Arab level
But now
At least we tell them no.
In the context of the required stance for Qatar, such stances, we will return to this point later but
Also in the field at the same time I heard.
Yesterday, Khaled Meshaal, the head of Hamas' Political Bureau.
First, there is no need for all that Sheikh Khalid Mish'al said, and I have nothing but respect and appreciation for him.
Why don't we sit with Khalid Mash'al and talk to him as Arabs?
We'll go to him at the Arab League and tell him.
This is an important conversation.
I am from Hamas.
Imposing conditions Israel also imposes conditions.
Let them impose conditions, while they are not able to impose conditions where Israel is capable of doing so.
First, what do you think of this Arabic gift?
They are sheep, and we do not listen to this audience, for one day they told me that de Gaulle did not listen.
It is quite different, first of all because de Gaulle liberated his country.
With support or without, he liberated his country from the fiery occupation.
That's what we're talking about now.
Is this the Arab gift we are supposed to receive?
Leaders must represent the views of their people.
The Arab people in all those demonstrations we have witnessed.
What can be inferred from these lines that are required.
Many of those who criticize Qatar in this situation also demand
About what's happening with the actor and the office is still open.
They don't speak the same language.
To cut ties, we will go with all Arab countries.
To cut the relationship, all ties, even if someone says they have a treaty.
They just want Qatar to sacrifice itself.
We
This is more important than the relationship.
Not only in this decision, but in this decision and in more difficult decisions.
More than this decision.
This means that we should have a unified Arab stance.
To others
No one should be sold or offered for sale to another for moral or material gain.
Yes, before we close this file on this subject, there are also countries that have taken individual steps.
The beauty in the shawls is a separate issue that has disputes with the United States.
Our people don't need us to remember.
Five permanent member states, and arguments that these are films.
It's over now, and the street knows best.
With the high ceiling, Your Highness.
Or demanding Lebanese forces to confront the Israeli aggression and the like.
Do you think that if it's framed within a single Arab framework, it might succeed?
But we call for an Arab stance that makes people respect us.
I don't think the Arab countries are ready for war.
Nor do we encourage
How will you bring Syria, Lebanon, and other countries together when there are Arab states that don't even talk to each other?
There must be.
Change in Arab relations
This is the current policy among Arab states.
It's still there, but I think it's already expired.
In goals
The important issue
And we know how the Lebanese structure is.
There is no doubt that Lebanon
Provide an example if she returns her lands.
The situation in Gaza will change, they are still...
Surrounded on all sides
This siege
Give a different nature.
Yes, by Israeli targets, I mean the targets of the Israeli operation.
One day you hit someone, one day you punish someone, one day you please someone.
What happened in Lebanon, for them, is not good.
The sample solution that became in Lebanon
I consider him good.
To Gaza
The problem in Gaza or Palestine, their solution is easier than Lebanon's.
Those who disagree with each other, should we reclaim our land today or tomorrow?
Their differences revolve around power.
In the distribution of power
That differs because they are closer to each other intellectually.
Beyond Lebanese thought.
So the solution is much easier.
And herein lies the problem
His Excellency Sheikh
That means we only have a few minutes if we can finish this up so that we can...
The diplomat.
How can this process end?
I am a Palestinian from Gaza.
Let me tell you.
"Carry out a translation"
And help
What accompanied us
It will be an Arab failure.
In strategic terms
But from the Palestinian side
There were some efforts, but we haven't seen a full initiative.
Not before, not now, why?
The issue is not one of initiative as much as we feel it.
We'll help whoever solves the problem, without mentioning Qatar, because some people have issues with mentioning Qatar.
No summit was held because there is a summit scheduled for March.
If we take an initiative, we'll be better than our brothers. I don't think so.
And do not put pressure on them.
Because history will not forgive us if we pressure them.
Through this initiative, we saw all parties involved where there was a meeting on the fourth day, which was postponed due to the Security Council.
We hope, God willing, to make progress, and we ask our Arab brothers to provide all the help they can in this regard.
We hope to eliminate him from the competition.
Arab competition
Due to their dispute with the Sudanese government at some point, they are heating it up.
And here are our problems, well, we're fighting with each other and we don't agree.
I don't want to go through this.
In Kuwait, in the nineteenth month of this century - as I believe - of course, the Arab situation.
As you know, as you have mentioned and explained.
Does all this Arab atmosphere help? Is it the first economic summit?
His Highness
Of course, any summit held in a brotherly country, we are present in it.
And we have no objection to attending any summit.
But not afraid to become a political summit.
Certainly, considering that time imposes itself.
Too late even if it's in ten days.
Are you talking about the Palestinians after they were beaten for twenty-five days?
Will be
What are they saying the Arabs couldn't meet?
We said that
We said that
With all due respect, this summit has been scheduled and we are committed to it.
I mean, I think that we
The Arab street is against us.
In our own way that we follow
Therefore
Enter in peace.
And that's all, it's guaranteed.
For this meeting
Thank you for watching.
Covering the ongoing war on Gaza, goodbye.
A few days ago, there was a celebration of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani
In Doha and contributed to the preparation of a draft law specific to
She was also a member of several local and Arab councils in the field of childhood.
I have also delivered over fifty-seven lectures and workshops, and presentations and articles published in Arab and international journals.
Initially, let's agree on the term currently in use.
When referring to people with disabilities, do we say "people with special needs" or "people with disabilities" as I mentioned?
Good evening first.
Drawn from the culture of human rights or from a human rights approach because people with disabilities
Because he treated people with disabilities as people first.
Human
That led to his disability as he tried to adapt to society.
The medical concept was dominant at that time.
Towards the concept
Special education and special needs education emerged.
This category has become
So we started calling them "special needs" individuals.
What are the standard rules derived from?
The role of the Special Rapporteur in monitoring the implementation of this document.
The pace of work accelerated until the emergence of the international convention, which was legally binding and distinctive in terms of rules in this regard.
Set a fundamental condition or basic rule for this term.
These people are concerned that they are human, that they are people.
With the change in terminology as mentioned, is there a shift in the perception of this group within society?
Yes, and it is measured in a certain way.
Varies from region to region.
But the special thing about this
That the Arab world was distinguished or differed.
Nevertheless, legal trends include human rights, which exist, for example, in Africa.
In Latin America, but perhaps not the lack of financial resources?
Certainly, that's what I meant to say: culture exists, but there is sometimes a lack of resources and perhaps a lack of political will.
Sometimes, laws but
But unfortunately, awareness is also somewhat low, and there is no culture of human rights.
Ten percent of the world's population are people with disabilities.
Eighty to ninety percent of people with disabilities in developed countries are of working age.
He is exposed to unemployment.
I mean during my visit to Darfur.
Or the presence of mines and weapons
Males are one degree better.
In addition to disabilities, they will be in remote and isolated areas.
So there are many directions of organizations working in this field and trying to elevate.
Awareness and Realizing the Right to Education
Instead of creating many religious centers in one way or another.
They went on to establish rehabilitation centers, hospitals, and schools.
This is one of the things we thank God for through our work in the office.
I tried with the current organization in Qatar.
Developing an agenda
Or include the agendas of these humanitarian organizations to encompass those centers.
In light of the deteriorating conditions of persons with disabilities in the world
I cannot deny that and I agree with you that there is a decline.
If there is a setback in the Arab region due to the disability issue.
When placed within the social context and within the political and economic context, we cannot expect the conditions of people with disabilities to be the same.
While they are from marginal groups
In a country like the one I told you about, like Gaza and Darfur.
On the contrary, I cannot absolutely assure that no improvement in the situation has occurred.
And it has been actually applied on the ground, and if I wanted to give an example, I would say...
Qatar Red Crescent
We agreed that projects include
Individuals with disabilities who have health issues are covered under this strategy and there are other programs as well.
We try to add it too.
Ground-based organizational operations
Kamal Kirro is with us now from Syria, hello.
Good evening, I am Suleiman Kiro.
Sorry, Selim, go ahead.
My best regards to you and Mrs. Hafsa.
Firstly, is there a mental barrier within the laws of the United Nations?
The intellectual obstacle means that a healthy person became a result of what turned into a pressure factor leading to an intellectual obstacle.
The torture and imprisonment caused my son to develop a physical disability, as he suffered from a psychological disorder and still receives treatment to this day, six years later.
I know that there are around four hundred people, including children and the disabled, in the prison.
Is there a law in the United Nations?
In fact, I
Because they live as their children live.
And the full meaning without making for themselves
And there are values in the West.
Agreed upon, but people...
Some of them are disbelievers or do not follow the wisdom of Islam, so it is not extracted from them.
Many thanks, Naif Saeed from Kuwait
We go back to our guest for comment.
In the calls, Suleiman wondered if there was any intellectual disability.
Yes, it's included in global rankings.
Certainly, regarding disabilities, there is mental and intellectual disability, as they are called.
Among these disabilities are sensory disabilities, meaning visual or auditory impairments.
Certainly, as mentioned, disability is...
Action and reaction occur in a social context.
In the Arab world or any other regions
Certainly, it has taken a long time to address the issue of disability.
Even at the United Nations level
For example, during my experience and work as a Special Rapporteur, these were among the issues I tried to address and work on.
In other words, it's everyone's right.
Until they provide it.
and various qualifying aspects to ensure their ability to join schools as well as the labor organization.
Working on vocational rehabilitation that includes people with disabilities
It has seen some improvements.
Especially after the reform
Generally, these international committees exist in ...
Me too, I mean as a special rapporteur.
The fact that my work was not directly related to this was positive for me.
That supported this position.
I saw him at many meetings, for example the international convention.
Rights of persons with disabilities
Hindered by these constraints or this deficiency
For example, with regard to legal capacity.
This is one of the main points in the world of disability.
Unfortunately, the United Nations delayed the matter slightly during preparation and drafting.
For organizations and agencies
For example, and I'll conclude with this.
From the governments of the world and civil society organizations based in the United States of America.
We administered another survey.
In United Nations organizations and agencies in various regions
Knowing the extent to which they have programs for people with disabilities on their agendas.
If it requires budgets, if there is involvement of people with disabilities.
Human rights
And not just development issues.
We're getting more calls. We have with us now Meshri Naji from Algeria. Welcome, Naji.
So do you.
I wanted to ask my sister who exactly should be blamed.
I wanted to ask, I am originally physically disabled.
Alright, we'll direct this question to her. Naji Machri from Algeria. Thank you very much, Ahmed.
Hello, Halabi from Greece.
Good evening, ma'am, and good evening to your guest.
Healthcare, housing, seasonal clothing, and even involving them in seasonal tourism, this is what happens in Europe.
And will a mental patient be counted as disabled?
Especially those who can harm themselves or others.
Everything we're discussing falls into the realm of unproductive debate. Thank you.
Sister Hassa mentioned the financial shortage.
In poor countries, especially in Africa, Latin America, and Asia, I demand...
Establishing an international fund to support people with disabilities and allocating one percent of the net profit of each organization in the world.
This must be mandatory and without exception for any institution or company.
This will conflict with the disabilities of many people, victims of wars, etc.
Many thanks to Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
The survivor, Al-Mishri, wondered, having clarified his problem that he was disabled.
At the local or national level, which means across Algeria.
Needs must be met within the community within this society.
Are these the same rights that should be granted to anyone else?
In other words, the right to life first, then the right to housing, the right to health, and the right to education.
Therefore, I appeal from here, from this platform, to governments, especially Arab governments.
In the interest of the citizen and the individual
To ensure
Those needs and rights are on current agendas.
No, there is no need to create any new devices.
To meet the needs of the disabled person or not to meet them if the state does not need to.
They may already be committed to performing.
I advise him first to return and refer to the competent authorities at the government level, if possible.
Because it's at a national level and should be within this scope.
You mentioned the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, but many countries have signed it without being committed to it.
And here we have a question from a caller: Why are there no laws?
It is certain that we are in a human society, which means there are a lot of mistakes and a lot of truths.
Certainly, many agreements and certainly many treaties do not contain a literal obligation in them.
Or an ideal commitment from many countries that have joined many of its likes such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and others.
But there are breaches and violations, and we know it.
But the question of adopting an agreement and its organization
First, we will ensure at least the existence of awareness.
This awareness starts at the top of this pyramid with the decision-makers.
The impact gradually evolves until it reaches the whole society.
As a matter of our commitment to reporting and submitting these reports to the United Nations.
The issue of knowledge, understanding, and a high degree of consciousness.
To the reports I worked on as a rapporteur at the United Nations.
Yes, from what I've seen and observed, there is interest.
So there is a relative advantage to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
For I give advice, encourage, and call out.
It is also important that people with disabilities
And we will listen to what Ali Obeid Al-Sanari, president of the Qatari Association for the Deaf and Mute, has to say.
Mr. Naji Sagrna will speak about it. Welcome, Mr. Naji and Mr. Ali.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
With me is Mr. Ali Obeid Al-Sanar, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Qatari Cultural and Social Center for the Deaf.
led by Her Excellency Sheikhaha Hessa
Former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
As a deaf person from Qatar
In fact, President Sheikhessa Hessa had a long history.
The international agreement you are referring to now is in fact
Great benefit for all people with disabilities around the world.
And especially the Arab world.
And I wish as a deaf person
These countries should implement the international convention.
That would be beneficial for people with disabilities, it is essential that
Indeed, having someone who can activate this agreement in all countries.
Abd Alsenary, President of the Qatar Association for the Deaf and Mute
Let's stop.
Here we continue our discussion after a short break, stay with us.
Share your opinions on important issues in economics, politics, sports, and a variety of other topics.
Al Jazeera Live Text Messaging Service.
Dear viewers, welcome again and to our guest today, Sheikhah Hessa Khalifa Al Thani, in today's episode.
Disability is an international fund for support.
Disability, and all countries should be obligated to provide funding. What do you think of this proposal?
The United Nations has a fund called the Disability Fund.
And, unfortunately, those contributions are very weak.
Regulatory Compliance Monitoring Mission
After working for six years, there was no meaningful support.
Only from China and Austria
And I always thank this country for its support.
The main supporter of the country is my own, Qatar.
Who established the office, through which we were able to carry out many activities and projects, praise be to God.
Yes, this lack of support indicates that...
I mean like what was raised initially and what is always repeated, this point.
Circumstances of ordinary people
So how is the care of people with disabilities or the care of the disabled called?
That means that if there's a realistic, genuine, and serious commitment.
Under all circumstances and in all categories
People with disabilities, refugees, and displaced children and women
All this we may indeed bring to a point called
Equal opportunities, participation, and equality
There are voices that always demand and never feel bored or tired.
In the Islamic and Arab region, why isn't a part dedicated, sorry.
In favor of these programs and projects
As presented by him (and I truly thank him for this).
Islamic Development Bank
Within the allocated budget
Failure to comply with what you told me regarding the payment of financial dues.
Funding assistance for people with disabilities, does it only include developing countries and Arab states or what?
Even developed countries do not provide.
I mean, the person before me, the Swede, yes.
Also some countries in the European Union.
And certainly, there are many countries, especially in the Arab region, that may not
Even if we know about this special curriculum
In my case, I mean what happened.
In Sweden and China
And in the Arab region, unfortunately, there were many promises, but unfortunately there was only one state.
We will talk about the Arab region, but
We have more calls with us Hamad Al-Marri from Qatar. Hamad, hello.
Peace be upon you
And you too
Hello Dr. Shaikha Hessa
Almost ten.
We noticed that this girl has a psychological disability.
What is your role towards a girl who suffers like her?
With her colleagues
I mean, sometimes even when we try
What is your role towards Qatari girls' children?
Many thanks to Hamad Al-Marri from Qatar, Karwan Behjat from Kuwait, welcome.
As they say, Sheikhah Hessa.
Why don't we leave our oil in its mysterious place?
Those with special needs can be counted.
And we can help them.
We have massive financial components.
We can break down the psychological barrier between us and them.
Boosting individual morale
And spend it on this noble cause.
If we are truly believers
Gratitude and appreciation to Sheikhah Hessa for all her efforts and everything she has done during her tenure as a Special Rapporteur.
With profound gratitude and appreciation to her, and thank you to the State of Qatar for all it has provided to those in need with special needs.
Thank you very much, Aisah Mohammed from Qatar.
Hello, Professor Wasila.
Peace be upon you too.
And your noble guest
Her Highness Sheikh Hessa
My question is about prevention.
As they say, prevention is better than cure.
There is another level of disability, apart from wars and traffic accidents.
On a genetic level, this may result in inbreeding within families.
I think it's a large percentage.
Leading to disability
Many thanks to the noble standard-bearer from Tunisia, now I return to our guest.
The first caller was Hamad Al-Marri, he was wondering.
Where can a girl with a mental disability go?
And to whom should he go?
In every country
Certainly, there are services that cater to all types of disabilities in the State of Qatar.
For these disabilities, whether they are mental disabilities such as we mentioned or any psychological disabilities
Schools
It existed previously.
Or I don't mean private education in the Ministry of Education, which is now the Supreme Council.
The honorary standard-bearer from Tunisia pointed to something truly important.
And scientific papers and the like.
Organizational programs work only on disability, but even within campaigns.
Programs for women
Attracting all this has led to many campaigns and programs on reproductive health.
I talked about this aspect.
Adopting healthy strategies
Based on awareness.
To demonstrate the risks of consanguineous marriage
and genetic factors
I believe it was implemented in the State of Qatar.
Habits and traditions, but it certainly takes time.
Especially in tribal societies
But over time, there will be a reaction against it, but some kind of legal commitment is necessary.
Yes, Karwan Bejt proposed and endorsed allocating one percent of the budget of Arab states.
To help the disabled, let me start first.
Yes, there is a statistical estimate carried out by the World Health Organization for the whole world.
There are forty or nearly forty million people with disabilities.
Half of them are women.
But these numbers double.
Like studying in South Africa where they observed and proved.
Certainly, the statistics that emerged from the Iraq War and the Gaza War.
For every person killed, three people are disabled.
And since the Arab region has become a zone of undisputed conflicts.
Even Karwan Behjat's suggestion
One percent won't be enough.
Assisting people with disabilities in the Arab region
The issue of percentages of people with disabilities or other marginalized groups.
Honestly and sincerely, I don't think it fits.
Addressing their problems and needs
Make sure that disabled people are the most neglected.
Conducted by governments and generally do not count people with disabilities.
This is corrected and sometimes aligned with societal culture and societal constraints.
When the census is conducted by
Relevant agencies
There is a disabled person in the house.
The only question asked was whether there was a disabled person or not.
The relevant department and the concerned individuals therein
We cooperated in preparing the model.
We recommend providing more details.
First, specify the gender of the disabled person, male or female.
Did he get help or not?
In fact, even if the numbers are correct, we haven't reached an accurate conclusion.
Attention and care must be in constant development. Fatima Al-Dossari is with us from Qatar. We welcome Fatima.
And peace be upon you too.
I am a Qatari citizen and I have a disabled child.
And I thank His Highness the Amir of our country, Sheikh Hamad.
And his wife, Sheikh Moza, for her adoption of this classification.
I am truly proud to receive all this attention and care.
For her important role
Latifa Al-Masri hello
Because they represent major disturbances in society without education, without treatment.
Thank you very much, Latifa Al-Messafer from Qatar, for joining us today with Naseem.
Abdul Karim is from Jordan. Hello, Naseem.
Continue, Karim. We can hear you.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
May God bless you, to be honest, I have an intervention.
First, I am an audio specialist and I worked in the State of Qatar for almost four years.
We had a month to raise awareness about speech and hearing problems.
We held conferences, lectures, and awareness-raising seminars on hearing impairment.
Now I want to talk about Jordan, I lived there for almost three years.
Frankly, he provides new and good services.
Frankly, he provides new services, whether they are material, non-material, or moral.
Even the Jordanian Ministry of Education, resources
Ministry of Education in public schools
As with our private institutions
They receive good support.
Alright, Kareem, do you have a direct question? It's just because of time constraints, I apologize.
Do you have a direct question?
In Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan, there are excellent services, and I think they are outstanding.
Can you comment on viewers' questions?
A person working in this field.
Regarding the subject.
I will also return to the issue of agreement.
Which are binding once the ratifications are obtained and the accession is made.
As a duty of the state or these organizations
Because it is based on the issue of rights for these people, regardless of
And frankly, what?
What can be done during that period for people with disabilities and why?
And you wish now that it would happen.
Certainly, I hope so.
I hope that this will be measured in this research or survey and that more high-quality research will be conducted in this area.
As became clear to me through this experience
Six years of experience
And coordination between Arab countries as well.
They also have roles, it's not just about rights, they get the rights.
Sheikha Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani, former UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, thank you.
We are now with the presenter of Al Dawri Channel and the Qatari Channel, Lana is on the line, good morning Lana.
I am also happy to welcome the shining captain in Umm Salal, Captain Ali Kasem.
Hello there! Ali
Hello %pw
Good morning
I want to open the door for congratulations. Anyone can congratulate publicly, Lana, please.
I had a five-hour open studio and a two-hour one the day before.
I congratulate Qatar, the land, the government, and the citizens; they deserve this international achievement.
I may be able to congratulate Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.
And his heir apparent, Sheikh Tamim
Yes, of course, Lana. You are in the field of sports and one of the experts in this area, and you are very familiar with these lines and this field.
Because even our file
Competitive, meaning we deserve the six-vote margin between us and the United States, fourteen votes for Qatar and eight for the United States.
That was because our file was rich and comprehensive and enjoyed the support of many ambassadors, very good support, for example, from the fields.
Perhaps some people were afraid, perhaps there were some countries, like the United States.
And perhaps there are countries that are ready, do not need to provide venues, and prepare some projects specifically for this event.
Because they are already prepared.
But they were concerned about this point.
Captain Ali, as athletes, I think this is a very significant achievement for sportsmen.
It will have an impact on the economic, political, and health sectors, I think.
But, as athletes
What does this achievement mean to you?
Certainly it's a huge achievement especially for us, even if you saw how the non-athletes were very happy.
If God wills, Ali, tell me about the moment of victory announcement.
I was leaving the training and they were listening to the radio station.
A friend and I were waiting for the announcement.
While I was driving and listening to the radio
In the moment they announced that Qatar and...
We shouted, and of course the skylight was open.
So my friend ejected his body from the roof of the car.
We were screaming, everyone was looking at us, we turned on our hazard lights and continued our party alone.
We started the celebration from the beginning.
Thank God, it was a very special day, I think all the channels focused on this event to a large extent.
Lana, of course you were involved in this event.
Especially sports channels
How did they celebrate this event and what was their reaction?
There were many media outlets and channels from all over the world.
He became a major teacher, very clear on the map, Qatar became known.
Certainly, the presence of the player in the team is very important.
And I suppose it's a responsibility that should be taken seriously.
What do you think about that particular point?
Alright Ali, do they mention the required attributes to be in the league?
Now there are more upcoming sports events.
We must prepare a strong generation.
that have fundamental principles and well-thought-out strategies in the sport of football
So, what are the rules and foundations that a player should excel in?
I believe professionalism encompasses everything from
Rigorous, continuous training and discipline
All these are basic things that help direct all his efforts in games or in training.
I believe each stage has a unique trait.
He has a unique taste and sensitivity.
Talk shows and sports programs, which do you prefer, where do you find yourself?
Wonderful
That keeps you fit and teaches you how to maintain your health through exercise, which is the important aspect.
Everyone also follows football matches, and you will automatically love them when you enter the stadium.
Does that constrain people working in the media to one side?
Doesn't it confine you to one part?
It's an open field, not just football.
It's all sport, but sport is great.
Ali, there are also some other important issues we'd like to discuss.
Didn't you wish you could go back to being ten years old to get to twenty-twenty?
Yes, haven't you wished for that?
Certainly, one dreams of such a thing now especially as it's the World Cup, now any player
Anyone who watches just a World Cup match will be happy, what if he were playing in the World Cup?
I hope they meet the expectations, it's their chance.
What do you want to say as a professional player, as a leader like Ali, what do you want to tell them from the bottom of your heart?
We love having you with us.
As I just said, I'm currently on vacation, but
His return to the leagues after a 12-year absence from the Gulf Cup championship.
You had a beautiful comment from the Qatar TV channel and good memories.
Insha'Allah, Qatar TV channel will transform into a university that graduates a large group of media professionals.
Our patrol is brave and we hope it will win many different awards.
Let's discuss an important point regarding Umm Salal Club.
How are you there, how are you, we hope you are well.
Certainly, praise be to God, honestly.
Certainly, we talked about many players in the studio yesterday.
So, I think some of the young men who were watching us think that you are...
is needed
It is very common in the Qatari league for players to move to other clubs.
I think I have a good chance in Umm Salal, *as an exhibition*.
I managed to secure a spot in the Asian Cup with the team, praise be to God.
And my situation is very good with the team.
How can we make sports a social issue?
Besides Qatar, how can we engage women, children, and youth in sports?
It connects everything, everything is complementary to sport.
Women play a role in all fields of sports.
And more broadly, every individual in this society, whether young or adult, realizes the importance of sport.
Approximately eleven or twelve years, until we reach this event, is enough.
We have newer generations.
Generations evolve, but we must raise a generation aware of sports from a young age.
We get ambition, ambition is a productive building.
Fundamental to generating new generations of athletes
We just need to be decisive and move forward.
And football in particular.
How can we engage the audience to interact in all the various club competition games?
Frankly, the lack of audience is a problem we face in the Qatari league.
But the problem is attendance; the Qatar Football Association has not yet found a way to attract the public.
What method should we use to attract them to attend those football matches?
It depends on the person themselves; some people don't like attending classes.
"Madia" plays a key role, by the way, in public abstention.
And now they use a ticket or collect points here.
No, no, the Football Association has many plans and steps to attract the audience.
Some clubs have ways to attract the audience, like the Banner Club, for the Banner Club is a famous club and does not need to attract the audience.
Some clubs, the management of some clubs, organize some activities and events.
For viewers, to motivate them, I think these are the only ways.
The players, I mean the new generation.
To love what they do and believe in their abilities, and as I said, they don't just need financial support, but moral support is needed much more.
Thank you very much for this wonderful interview, God willing.
So, we'd like to hear your final thoughts on Qatar's win to host 2022, Lana, please.
I would like to reiterate that Qatar is always supportive, and
Hopefully, Captain Ali, your final word you'd like to say in this interview.
Congratulations and I wish you continued success.
Thank you, Captain and wise brother. I ask God to bless you in your athletic pursuits and in your life, and to bestow His blessings upon you.
Their love for sports increases.
The episode will be about young talents.
Some young people argue that these songs are popular nowadays, but they have a very deep and great history.
A group of young people singing Arabic or English words.
Today we'll discuss this with a group of rap enthusiasts.
We will get to know them better through the interview that will bring us together directly.
Welcome to our program, dear viewers, wherever you are.
For years, a new style of singing has dominated the Arab and Gulf scenes.
He came from the west, especially from America, which is the rap.
Before we start talking about rap singing,
There is boldness in using any word without reservation.
Anyone can rap.
For writing lyrical words.
Almost all rappers write their own lyrics.
So, we will learn all these many and crucial details from two people who are highly specialized in this field.
They made a beautiful team.
Yousef Al-Nuaimi and Salman Abdullah, good morning Yousef.
Hello with us, good morning Salem.
Good morning, hello.
I'm very happy to have you with us through this program.
And of course, through the topic of rap singing.
Yusuf, how did you get into this?
We discover that rap did not exist in Qatar.
In a better way.
Speaking on behalf of the citizen.
Including funny, sad, and political topics.
Yes, I can say that rap,
And these words, I believe, are among what inspires the artist to paint a picture and the poet to write a poem.
A singer can sing and a musician can play any instrument.
Do you think there is acceptance from Qatari society, and from Gulf society, for this type of speech?
Two thousand and ten.
Do you think people like buying CDs for rap music?
Different ages.
There are families and many people listening more than ever before.
There was something like a website.
How many of you are in this band so far?
That means you can all say words, write poetry, and perform rap.
You could also say that the singer is the rap.
He is the one who sometimes plays, writes the words,
Ahhaa!
I request to hear and tell him that I recorded this song.
Alright, all these songs you produced are from Salem, and Youssef, and anyone in the same band.
You didn't think about putting it on a CD and making it available in stores.
But you know, if someone is alone, it means I'll have to produce the album and put it on the market, so it's difficult in terms of commercial recording and procedures.
Well, why didn't you think? You're 25 years old, and one hand can't always clap.
There must be two, God willing you have twenty-five hands, God protect you, all as young men and brothers.
You can create a CD and market this disc through multiple websites online.
He has Facebook, YouTube, and also local newspapers.
I think he has thirteen songs.
Registration is not like today.
It's a bit old, but it was clear.
It's of poor quality, not like now, but it's clear.
He has produced about fifty CDs.
There is rap, I can't say it didn't exist because there were young people who might have known this art ten years ago.
It's not the strength of the recording, and I think the distribution during this time, now is different.
Especially since there is a diversity in music, and a wide range of techno music now.
That group of men and artists produce a collection of wonderful songs.
We would also like to talk about the concerts you participated in.
Look, the party we participated in Doha is one.
Organized by Al Sadd Club, they were very cooperative.
We sneaked a peek at the audience.
We were surprised; we didn't expect such a huge number.
We were also surprised by the presence of more civilized families.
More than the youth
The organization was amazing.
We were a bit tense because it was happening for the first time in Doha.
We didn't expect this large attendance.
The audience interaction was wonderful.
It took a long time, so there were many songs.
Alright, let's listen to something, or the lyrics of a song I composed, dedicated to the listeners, especially the young ones.
Let's hear some words, to show them to the audience.
Can we listen to it directly?
Take your time.
Continue, Salem
The problem is that it's random.
Let's listen.
I don't know.
We are here in the Morning Wisdom program.
One is happy to come to the program in the morning.
Salman is an expert; this is his fifth year practicing rap.
Even if people don't like it.
They have no clue about it.
The words are random.
Alright, for the songs you've presented, give me some of your previous lyrics.
Look, not all songs are random, or what they call in English "freestyle".
They are in sync.
But when we sing, some words are carefully chosen.
Thank you, let's see.
We can say, good morning my country, good morning Eldawa program.
We are live on television, for the public.
To know what one two one will offer
Together from dawn till dusk.
The beautiful song I just heard
I insisted that the youth distribute it everywhere and online.
I really appreciate that. When will you release it?
Teamwork
Everyone writes for themselves.
He won't find it easy to do that.
So each of them will write.
Certainly, I believe that every artist, whether a painter or a poet, always...
He can also write it out of his love for sports.
Love of country or homeland
I'm sure you participated in the National Day.
Through beautiful songs, you represent the youth of Qatar.
The Arabs are waiting for the Asian Cup to be held in Doha, and there will be a celebration on the beach.
To celebrate this event
We are streaming this video live.
"Welcome to the Asian Cup, Doha"
From Doha Airport until now
Let's watch this live footage together.
Reception, audience, our children, students
The Asian Cup arrived at Doha Airport this morning to continue...
Preparations for hosting the major continental event
Let's go back to our guests Youssef and Salman, whose presence we are delighted to have with us.
They are from an Arab Gulf rap group, aren't they?
Can we call it that?
Currently, honestly, we
They are preparing a party, but it's not confirmed.
But, you're working on a party that will announce, God willing, Youssef.
If God wills, but this is not yet confirmed, we are still beginners.
You are still at the beginning of your career, I wish you all the best, and be assured that our program will support you with all its heart.
Also, Salem, where do you all meet, twenty-five people?
Where do you meet and how do you gather all the ideas together?
Certainly, there are some shared songs.
It is not necessary for any of you to love Salim or Yusuf, or for anyone to sing an entire song.
There must be joint cooperation among you all.
Frankly, it's difficult to get the twenty-five together in one place.
Start contacting Youssef and the other men and ask them to gather in one place.
Consider the song and the lyrics.
And there's another way.
I register my spot.
And continue.
He recorded it and sent it to me.
And look at the other experiments.
Collect some CDs of famous artists.
Do you benefit from their experiences and techniques?
Certainly, we always
Artists who have been doing this for years and have experience in this field.
We listen to them, learn techniques, and try to create a unique speech.
Because if we do the same thing, with the same tone, and the same phrasing,
We don't produce anything new, we want to do something that is
We benefit little from them.
Yes, there is also a large group of Gulf youth, in the Gulf.
In a primitive way, let's follow the report together for benefit and enjoyment, let's follow it together.
This talent that some people possess is mysterious.

Abu Ibrahim Abdullah al-Diyali
This is one hundred and fifty kilometers.
I am from the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
He has good experience and ability.

Determining the appropriate location to dig the well, but with the expert, can.
Discover or locate
Groundwater sites
Since ancient times
Our parents found us.
He used to ask for help from experts to locate the wells.
Dig
Abu Ibrahim's techniques in searching for groundwater
These are not modern techniques.
Soil analysis in laboratories
He relies on God's grace in his work.
And they are rivers beneath the earth.
Pomegranate seeds
Pomegranate branches or palm branches
Now, the process of detecting water flow is scientifically applied.
To close, this is the end of the river.
Come back again.
Go back
So, from here, we start marking.
And here the stream ends
Requires a lot of experience and patience.
To understand the sensitivity of the movement of the ta' letter.
I went to many places.
95% success rate
Of course, this way and using copper bars.
And there is no precise scientific explanation for
This curriculum
What really surprises is the success rate of those who practice this primitive profession.
Exceeds ninety-five percent
In the search for Earth's surface water reserves
Glory to Allah, who taught man what he did not know. This report is from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
The one who has his own band and more than one CD album.
Whether online or by phone
Sometimes there are rivalries between Gulf countries, such as Qatar vs. Bahrain and Qatar vs. Kuwait.
They produce a stronger song about a stronger subject.
When dealing with a problem, etc., there are many issues.
Look to me as a role model.
Will of God
And at the same time, we want
Broadcast a wide range of songs
To the greatest extent possible
From time to time, let's stay in touch with you.
So we can keep up with the band's latest news.
But let's emphasize the band's name.
They are rappers.
Let's go back to our guests at the corniche and the beautiful weather.
We are live with you through this direct link.
Wherever you are in Konrich, you welcome the Asian Cup.
We are proud of them and their wonderful arts.
It addresses various social and psychological issues of youth.
But he only has two with us in the studio.
I'm sure they'll represent the rest.
Yusuf and Salman, welcome back.
Sometimes socialism ends.
We tried to reach the company, but no one answered.
As a team, you need to develop yourselves, people in
Facebook and YouTube
and similar sites
Band name
You will find us among the first search results.
Organize and work together on this great production.
You're matching and aligning images with songs, are these personal photos?
Or you can download it from YouTube and other video sites and follow along.
There are some, we've done it before.
There are many songs.
The obstacles you face, such as the lack of a company to adopt you and no website.
You really need a place where you can all meet as a band.
What are your wishes that you want to fulfill and achieve?
Who cares for us?
And arrange an album for us.
I hope it becomes official.
Because we spent five years.
As a leap, no more.
Yes, we participated in some things, in some series.
We hope it improves.
And to have someone who supports us and stays with us.
Yes, Salim too, we want to know what are your wishes.
My only wish is to produce a video clip.

Good luck, I wish you all the success.
Say hello to the group, and we wish you success.
We conclude with the song they produced especially for the show.
This is KD and DJ Mary's program in Doha.

We can say, good morning my country, good morning Eldawa program.
We are live on television, for the public.

To know what one two one will offer
Together from dawn till dusk.
Produced by Hassan Namma, presented by Shaima'a Al-Hamdi
The manager is Nasser Al-Maliki, and the guests are Qatari rappers, of course.
They can be reused and used at home again.
Like a shopping cart or a trolley.
While shopping at the supermarket
When you put any item, or anything you want to buy in
A large screen will appear displaying the components of this item.
That was also a bright and feasible idea.
Just a barcode, a scanner in the cart detects the item.
And facilitate the shopping process for the buyer.
He can get all the details on the screen.
I suppose it raises health awareness.
When the device is with you or in the cart.
Ingredients
Any warnings and side effects?
Full details.
Or ambition, for example, there are a number of projects, about four or five.
Dealing with traffic issues.
The text addresses traffic congestion and other issues such as parking problems, and it was very creative and beautiful.
Insha'Allah, the Children's Cultural Center
Mr. Abdullah, let's discuss the various activities that will take place in the coming days.
Yes, there are also surprises, but we will discuss them briefly.
Ideas, I don't know if you want me to mention some of the submitted projects or
For example, for underground transport, the genius idea is
When the man leaves his house, he finds an elevator.
And converge at a single point.
I assume that all viewers are enjoying the images displayed now.
Children's Creations
Exactly, it's like an ATM, for example.
For lawyers, for example, I have a card.
I go in and say I need a T-shirt.
This is an example of some shops, or if you lose things at home, like a key.
What was lost, like the office key.
We have a fundamental goal set by Her Highness Sheikh Moza.
His Highness's wife
At an early age, this is of great importance in project design.
Three hundred selected children
We also invited speakers.
Yes, it was she who hosted the closing ceremony.
To showcase their programs, we really need to open the doors to interested children.
And then they can start.
We need them to be there and support us, that's our priority.
This program and the activities that serve that main idea.
Diverse skills of children vary.
Self-development
Okay, do you have any collaboration with youth clubs in Qatar?
There are also scientific clubs in Qatar.
Certainly, all our programs are built on the exchange of ideas.
It's all a professional partnership.
With other community service institutions specialized in developing these talents
Involvement of all concerned institutions
Photography Society
The Creativity Center for Girls, and the Secretariat of the Council of Ministers also played a crucial role.
Yes, they played a crucial role in explaining Qatar's vision.
And training children on them.
Engaging and encouraging children, with each program based on institutional partnerships.
According to the Head of Projects and Establishments
And what changes do you make?
Our presence here in Qatar gives us a strong boost and great support.
And faster.
We are now, in partnership with Katara, preparing projects that will be ready for launch in the next two months.
Certainly, there is collaboration in many programs.
Especially when it comes to reading.
Head of the Supreme Council for Family Affairs
We're managing, especially since we're in the preparation stage.
To build a promising future for all children, the next generation, and youth.
What is your final word you would like to say to the parents and children watching us now and interested in joining the center?
More than we provide them with now.
Sometimes our children come up with ideas that we should not underestimate.
We must take their ideas into consideration, no matter what.
Because when we take it seriously, it will develop, at least we will encourage the child to think.
So it is important to provide care and attention to the child.
And spiritually as well, our problem is that most parents
Support him.
Encourage him, and we parents will encourage too.
To pay more attention to the child's imagination, today's children are the roots of the future.
We toured the exhibition, looking at their projects.
We lived the dream.
Dreams and thoughts were the product of a vivid imagination.
And dreams turn into reality; many of them have been achieved and have become tangible reality.
Thank God, we wish success to our children who were there.
Our hearts are with you.
Will of God
From various ages and nationalities
Up to seventy projects
That is considered very innovative and worthy of implementation.
To talk more about this national exhibition
And the culture center for children as well.
Mr. Abdullah, briefly tell us about the exhibition.
There were a lot of activities, indeed. What can you say about them?
The children introduced a new style of expressing nationalism and loyalty to their country.
He was under the auspices of the Minister of Education.
On the tour of the exhibition
He will be thirty years old.
We started training children on Qatar's Vision 2030 across all three themes.
Human development, economic development, sustainable development, environmental development
First, to know Qatar's position in 2030.
Then, to start thinking about
Creative ideas, and how to innovate
I suppose they already have a broad mind.
But when we help him
I suppose their minds will develop more and more.
Sir, I have inaugurated the exhibition under the slogan "Dreams of a Generation, Facts or the Nation of Tomorrow."
The slogan says "Dreams of the Generation"
It will be part of Qatar's future, Qatar's tomorrow.
We felt when we were strolling with the children, when the child says to the minister,
I want you to open my project, I invite you to visit my project for 2030.
A child thinking about twenty years ahead.
They express their love for their countries in the field they are interested in.
There should be some activities, events, and competitions.
One of them won the Science Stars award.
As there were first-prize winners in the Arab League tournament.
Certainly, all children.
On the sidelines, there were various performances according to a specific schedule.
To showcase the projects they have done
There is a large attendance, a very unique presence.
Stars of science
Some of the winners of the projects that participated in the exhibition.
Who won one of the major prizes?
The forest or the creative/innovative garden
We also want to talk about the colored ball.
The colorful ball is also part of children's dreams and visions for the future of Qatar.
An idea for twenty to thirty
How can a child contribute with a creative idea for 2030?
The main idea is that there is a chip in the ball.
The referee is given a colored warning for that.
For example, the referee can monitor the ball's movements.
Or the playground for children is changed by this electronic chip.
What's fixed in the ball?
There are creative ideas, of course, the main idea, some people might ask.
And projects
We always say, we've reached this stage.
Developing skills and broadening their horizons
Giving them an idea of how to express nationalism through these projects.
Giving them confidence in how to present the project, engage with the audience, and explain its idea.
In a field he loves, being attached to something he loves, that's an achievement.
Offer support, and we thank him for it.
Which is now in the development stage.
The public, the committee, and some responsible individuals also supported the projects.
No, the first one, it was the second one, because this girl
Pipes, underground service ducts, and spectator access routes require arrangements.
An enormous reserve forest
Where visitors can wander and see animals and reptiles.
There are also sensors attached to some animals to monitor their condition.
There is also the marine environment, the way of entry is also creative.
Also among the reasons that made her win were her vast and detailed imagination.
All this qualified them for victory.
There is also a person who talked about an underwater tourist city.
Butterfly City
A forest on Earth.
And many ideas of tourism.
Very interesting
Perhaps this is what their minds need at this time, perhaps in 2030.
And in the future, it will be achieved.
Three projects.
When adopted by the science club, they said these are the projects we need to work on.
There is a project regarding unused air conditioning water.
Let's look at the Arab newspaper.
The article says, Qatar University celebrates the graduation of students.
The presence of His Excellency Mr. Saad bin Ibrahim Al-Mohammed
Minister of Education and Higher Education, Secretary General of the Supreme Education Council
Dr. Shaikha bint Abdullah Al-Missnad, President
A new record for the university indeed.
Qatar University and Calgary University
There are also great news about our students.
It is an educational achievement, and we wish them success, God willing, in all specialties.
He is considered one of the young actors who are making a strong presence in the Qatari drama scene.
How long, also sorting and colored threads.
Actor Abdel Hamid Sharshani is considered one of the actors who built themselves up.
If it's not convincing.
He will not be chosen for projects executed within Qatar.
Currently, actor Abdelhamid Charshani is participating in the series "A Killer Feeling" and "Tasnif Part Two."
We are happy to have him as our guest this morning.
So that we can talk to him about his participation in these two operations and about his experience in general.
Hello and good morning.
We are happy to have you on the Doha Morning Show. This is the first time I meet you and it's your first time on Doha Morning.
With people who work hard for the program
And you, Ms. Lisa.
Welcome! It's great to have you with us. Before we start our conversation,
Alright, let's watch.
I am a responsible man and an executive manager.
I enforce the laws.
The only thing I can tell you.
Give me the bisht.
Listen, why are you asking me?
Go and ask them if anyone agrees not to bring the bisht.
Of course, I have another question as an introduction, but since we've seen this part of the series "Classification Part 1".
He pointed out that Khalid ibn al-Walid...
Some historians link the famous poet Imru' al-Qais to the city of Marid.
A lot of things and information related to that city in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
For more information, we will watch with you this excellent report by our colleague Abdurrahman Marshud.
Let's watch it together.
Certainly, it is a testimony from people who know about appreciation and do not favor anyone.
And as proof of the history of this city or that.
To the extent that we see its effects and hear about it from its storytellers and poets.
It is both classical and contemporary, making it an important addition to the city's record.
The city of Marrat is one of the cities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Historically, it is an ancient city founded in the pre-Islamic era.
There was a debate among historians about how to name it?
Some believe it was named after the famous poet Imru' al-Qais al-Kindi.
And the valley which is named after him.
The date of its foundation is unknown.
In the Age of Ignorance.
The most famous thing in the city of Marrat is Mount Comet, which has been the subject of many proverbs.
Because it's in the city and close by.
Dry up. These are historical places.
This sight is considered a tourist landmark in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
The municipalities have made a Herculean effort to achieve this.
A garden on this mountain.
And seating areas for locals and everyone in the kingdom.
It was named after the Prophet's companion Khalid ibn al-Walid (may Allah be pleased with him).
To fight against apostates and Muslim writers.
And among her effects is the Valley of the Comets.
It's a place where spring water gathers and is stored for a long time.
It was one of the most important sources of water in the past.
One of her works is also the Al-Duwahi Heritage House.
Marat is a city with a history dating back to pre-Islamic times.
It is renowned for its poets who were influenced.
With its beauty, its ruins, and its famous mountain, Jebel Akhdar.
Abdulrahman Al-Marshed is the host of the Doha Morning program.
Marat City, north of Riyadh.
We return once again to our dear guests.
I hope you can tell us and the viewers about those methods and techniques.
Initially, you stated that our infrastructure is very special.
We open an account for him and he registers through having a private record in our system.
Email guardian.
This report covers the range of increased attention, faster typing, faster reading, and overall distraction.
The guardian receives a full report.
Alright, this report will be added to the student's record.
Logs into his son's online account.
He watches his son's progress.
He can see his grades and his attention with teachers.
Let's truly enjoy the intelligence of this beautiful girl.
So that we can bring most of the children in the center and send them our best regards.
I registered at this center with a professor there.
To know her intelligence and the level she has reached since joining the center.
Certainly, this year.
Focus on one task at a time, and after Ramadan.
But of course this affects the account of other works, always.
Some people only watch TV during Ramadan.
He stays awake watching TV as people change the months of worship with the TV.
Minimize, minimize, a chain of minimization, minimize, let them do one thing every two years, is that better?
Certainly.
I hope they love me in Ramadan.
But I would like to send you all my warmest regards.
"Insha'Allah" (God willing)
And also with plays.
From drama to fashion.
A fashion show was held at Katara Cultural Village.
Certainly, we continue with you with great love and loyalty.
And to further develop the children's abilities and skills.
Unlike various schools in this blessed country.
We have a template, and we spoke with our guest whom we had spoken with previously.
Now with us is Mr. Ibrahim Hussein Abdel Salam. Welcome. Good morning.
How are you, Oumnia?
I'm fine.
Which grade are you in now?
Professor Ibrahim, to start, could you introduce us to the course offered by the center?
And Omnia is an example of that.
We will also try with her the technique or method that Ms. Nesma talked about.
Do you feel there's a difference in his thinking?
Do you feel that these skills and methods,
Things will change regarding his mental skills or even his educational level.
Scientific methods
Including initially testing the child with an international test called the TONI test before starting anything in the program.
I also start the second part of Tony's test.
We can measure a student's level or the change in their level through it.
Now a test or something like that will be conducted.
Omniah will count and answer immediately.
Certainly, Omnia doesn't know anything about the questions.
We surprised them with this thing.
Certainly, I have another question as a starting point.
We would like to ask you about your participation in the second part this year.
What is your contribution, can you tell us about it?
Certainly, after our presentation of the series "Classification" Part 1,
Thank God, I've been lucky in several roles.
Mr. Ghanem,
Distribute roles with CEO Ashraf Shohata as well as Mr.
This is an opportunity from Tara to produce arts.
For the youth.
Mr. Ghanem nominated me this year for
Certainly every episode is different.
In more than one episode, I will be performing different characters.
On the contrary, it's a wonderful experience. In this work, we
One of Kuwait's pyramids, Mr. Saad Al-Faraj.
We have representatives from Bahrain, Abdullah Malik, Ali Al Gharair.
Like Ali Mirza, we
They also have a group of young actors like Abdullah Adnan.
Yes, among our young actors we have Abdullah Al-Asam.
This happened a year ago, and last year we did two works a year.
Maybe that's why I asked you before the broadcast. You've been acting since 1997.
But you couldn't achieve anything, or your ambition to act.
Thank God for everything.
Did you study acting, or was it just a hobby?
No, I consider it a hobby.
I considered acting a talent. The person who took care of me at the beginning of my career was the actor Abdulaziz Jassim.
He is one of the actors who consider me their son.
If you need anything, I'll call him.
We were in all of his shows.
We worked hard, praise be to God.
Now, without Tara, a very special thank you to Mr. Abdulrahman Al-Sulaiti, a very special thank you to Mr. Abdurrahman.
If we compare ourselves to Kuwait. In Kuwait, every year twelve to sixteen new representatives come. Why?
They have.
Certainly, thank him a lot because he provides many opportunities.
But, let's say,
Let's talk about the other series, we had an idea about "Tsanif".
We need to know about the killer feeling.
And also the foot.
We have a sample, and with us is the processor Mr. Abdulaziz Al-Muyouf Al-Tameemi.
Until this procedure is aired.
And we can see how we can treat the person. Let me first say good morning to Mr. Sabhi bin Hamza, welcome.
Welcome, and peace be upon you.
Let's start with you, sir, please.
Insha'Allah.
In the name of God.
We hold his hand.
We see the nerves.
It's like a painting or a message from God Almighty, glorified and exalted, showing all the organs in your body.
From the inside and its problems.
You feel dizzy sometimes.
I have a headache and feel dizzy.
Open your hand, open it. Let your nerves calm down, yes.
By doing this, Mr. Abdulaziz, you will discover something special about his hand that indicates he suffers from a particular illness.
On his left side. He has a mild infection in his middle ear.
There is pain! What does that mean, Mr. Abdulaziz?
Ear. Do you have an ear problem?
Since my birth and since I was a child.
Do you have pain here as well?
They are the sinuses surrounding the nose!
Do you have a nose ache and a headache here?
I have a headache here.
He has a problem with the sinuses surrounding the nose.
It gives him a headache between the eyes.
Weight increases without food.
Her thyroid gland is not functioning properly; she feels sluggish and lethargic all the time and feels her body is heavy.
I sleep a lot.
Either oversleeping or laziness, you always feel sluggish.
You always have an infection in your tonsils.
There. Look at the vibration, you notice the vibration.
He's stressed and doesn't walk barefoot, maybe for the last time.
Are you from Tunisia?
Oh my God, I've said things about him.
Is this massage also beneficial for children?
The mother's middle finger, thank God, is about the size of an infant's palm.
Most children don't sleep, why?
When you carry him, he doesn't like being carried, but people think he does. He has gas in his belly, oh God, heal us.
When the mother puts her index finger, she extends her index finger.
In the child's palm.
The hands are parallel and the girl is parallel with them.
Let's watch her until every mother can learn this move.
You'll start by pushing like this. Right and left, and right and left.
This thing is about the child, is about, is about the child and it's beautiful.
Well, as for discoveries, you have discoveries specific to women.
As we said, in every house, ninety percent of women are protected by their lords.
First of all, the first warning comes from the ceramics and level floors.
When we walk barefoot on ceramic, it's good to walk barefoot, but walking on uneven ground is dangerous.
Walk barefoot! There is evidence that when ceramics are used in homes, health problems increase.
Because it's cold and flat.
When they had a carpet, there were problems, they suffered from asthma.
It has increased.
A woman should be careful to focus on walking barefoot on the ankle.
This is the foot and ankle region located at the back, the ankle.
From here, this is the heel and now under the leg.
This is the first discovery, and the second discovery is a way to facilitate delivery.
Just focus with me for a moment.
In her seventh or ninth month.
Generally, just being in the delivery month.
That means, they don't come on the eighth, the eighth is dangerous, and the most dangerous thing is walking barefoot.
Pregnant women should be cautious when walking barefoot.
If she is in her natural term of pregnancy,
I seek refuge in Allah from the outcast Satan, "then shake the trunk of the palm tree towards you, and it will let fall fresh dates upon you."
We already know that Mary, we know that her provision comes to her.
I even discussed this with scholars, and they told me: Why has the interpretation of Ibn Kathir changed?
I told them, "I give you the idea that God has placed in this science and inspires me."
Shake the palm trunk towards you, when the palm tree sways, how does it look?
It's sharp like nails or thorns.
When you shake the palm tree, it gives an order to the sprouts, and it's the area of the sprouts, right here in the middle.
It's the internal organs. It issues commands to facilitate childbirth and the resitting of the fetus.
Elevation or re-positioning of the fetal head naturally.
"I seek Allah's help; this is one of the benefits of this fruit."
And take the hand and start taming it.
Some take it as a practice, and some know it as a science.
Therefore, they are afraid to tell you and you don't believe them.
Yes, Mr. Abdulaziz, your discoveries are important.
But I'd like to ask you one last question because time has flown by.
If anyone wants to get in touch with you, or if anyone wants to contact you, or any specific email address or you.
Alright, the mobile phone number is in the control room. If anyone wants to reach Mr. Abdulaziz, they can call us after the program.
Certainly, emphasize the numbers for Qatar TV so that they can contact us and get this number.
I was created solely to serve people.
If we believe in this faith, God will bless your work and guide the people.
I have sins like the rest of the people and do everything you can imagine, I am an ordinary person.
Nevertheless, we aspire to more good.
We always think of good.
Dear viewers, I hope you enjoyed this segment on reflexology and hand massage.
Also through the foot.
We saw a live demonstration of how the model detected the diseases this person was suffering from.
And what he suffers. I hope we can benefit from you, and if anyone wants to communicate with him, they can read about him online.
How it will be implemented in the coming days or years or whether it will include more schools.
Good morning
How do you rate this experience?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
The fact that obesity in Gulf countries has become a big problem.
So, we feared that Qatar would become the fifth country with them.
This program, frankly, happened to be the first lady in New York.
She visited Doha and they had a program for this.
They offered it to us, we embraced it, and said "Alright."
Our students alongside students from New York, Spain, and England,
Therefore, we can observe the level of our students in Qatar among the countries of the world, and this is what we want to achieve in the future.
Because we encourage students to eat fruit.
He stops exercising.
Certainly, the fifth week is your family's meal with your family.
We kill two birds with one stone (figuratively).
In the sixth week, he tells us what he has gained from this experience. Praise be to God, we are now in the closure stage.
We are happy with the students.
You know they were three independent schools, for boys Abu Obeida.
"Independent for girls, protective"
And with a high spirit.
The family was more aware, and their brothers were enthusiastic at home and started eating this food just like them.
It becomes a cultural transfer between the student and this culture is transferred to the home and the family.
He goes and tells them, "Give it to me or teach me how to do it."
Training staff or those who provided this information to the students,
How did you select her and how was the communication with the student established? Who initiated the communication?
Yes, there were many authorities who helped us, may God reward them.
We have brothers in the diet center who teach them about food, healthy food of course.
And learn the etiquette of eating with Lady A'isha Al-Tamimi.
How they organize themselves, how they prioritize!
To learn to cook, exercise, or educate others about the value of healthy food.
It was in the form of separate lessons, curricula, or
How were these ideas conveyed to the students?
In various ways, some within the school.
We organized a day at the beginning of the program in the Aspire zone, gathering all the students, boys and girls.
These matters are not linked to a specific person, but we are all responsible, responsible, because these are our children.
How these students behave at first!
I said initially that the results were satisfactory.
Are three classrooms or designated rooms sufficient for those schools?
Now, when an experiment begins in the world, it doesn't begin on a large scale.
It starts from a reasonable range that includes all the amenities; boys, girls, independent, and private.
Because it is not suitable in our culture, environment, and family circumstances, such as accepting things for their children and not accepting other things.
They mainly want to participate in it, and it's actually very important.
The student who is twelve or thirteen years old, this is the right time for him to know about his health condition.
This is a struggle for many people who want to lose weight, but they imagine it to be impossible.
He says that some actors we see in the cinema with a slim build, this is impossible, no!
We talked in detail, but there were many weeks we couldn't cover.
And through Sabah al-Doha, we can remind them of that.
And vitamin B-rich fruits that you can get from fruits and vegetables.
For one must know the benefits of fruits and understand that if they eat them, their health will improve, thus they will be in a good mood.
As for fruits, they went to the supermarket and picked out their fruits.
So this is a point.
It is diverse and certainly competitive; each school was creative with the different ideas of its teachers.
Spirit of competition
We provide them with guidelines and everyone must innovate.
Did the teachers train the students, or do you have special staff for that?
I built them, I built them.
But teachers were adding, for example, some schools like Abu Obeida said they would dedicate Saturday to student activities.
This is a day outside of school hours, they decide and adopt it, Rokaya School said they will hold a parade.
She said she would have a healthy cooking day for the girls, but we didn't force the boys to do healthy cooking themselves, as the girls are more skilled
I would also like to thank the Rayyan Water Company for providing water free of charge to schools, the Rayyan Water Company for this initiative.
Certainly, water is much healthier because it needs to cleanse its body of all these toxic substances that enter its body daily through water.
We said the third week.
That means his body is moving.
He might be playing soccer or basketball and not know that this is the game I love.
True, true, exactly, and perhaps some of them want another game, maybe they don't like team games.
Hello, join us live.
Welcome Mr. Abdul Aziz Al-Jaber, founder and director of the Qatar Multiple Sclerosis Association.
Of course, we strive to focus on important topics as much as possible.
We would like to introduce and inform our dear viewers about Multiple Sclerosis.
Because this name, too, may be unfamiliar to us,
The number of women was greater than the number of men.
All the treatments available now are preventive treatments.
The white blood cells that are supposed to protect us start to
Kills us by striking the nerve cell.
Let me simplify it for the audience, it's like a wire.
Covered with a layer known as "myelin," we could say it's a layer of nylon.
Certainly, this usually leads to dizziness and visual distortion, double vision.
That also led to problems in the digestive and respiratory systems.
Leads to madness in the worst cases, and leads to quadriplegia or paralysis.
Certainly treatments.
The most important functions of the body will be very badly affected.
Or from this disease, a disease called multiple sclerosis.
Some theories say it is transmitted by a virus.
The disease is a non-epidemic disease.
Doesn't pass to children
Some people consider it a context-dependent disease.
For example, the equator was spared from this disease.
Currently, we have some cases of this disease in the equatorial region.
So far, there is no cure for this disease due to the unknown cause.
So far, scientists cannot find the cause of the disease, in order to be able to find a cure for it.
Currently, the process has been reversed.
They try to avoid the impact of the disease itself on the human body.
In other words, they start working from the back.
We might be a little afraid of this subject, which we can say that this disease comes suddenly.
Is there a specific group, a group you think this disease spreads particularly among?
Internationally, it was ranked between the twenties and forties.
Currently, the international community related to the disease itself has reduced the number from twenty to fifteen.
Because it has started affecting young people up to the age of forty.
However, humans do not recover from it.
Certainly, as a society, we are open to alternative medicine and Prophetic medicine.
Yes, through the association, the Qatar Multiple Sclerosis Association.
Why do we have this society?
There was a large group, so I thought about forming an association for this subject.
Certainly, I'll give you some random numbers.
In Kuwait, it is said that there are sixteen thousand cases.
Case A.
The rest of the Gulf countries range between one hundred and three hundred.
When I was diagnosed five to six years ago.
My number was sixty or forty-four.
Are there any symptoms indicating that the patient is actually suffering from this disease?
We are not certain it's a virus, hence we don't want to adopt a specific theory, that's the point.
The other point is how do I know that I have it or not.
This is very difficult.
I'm confused, oh! Mr. Abdulaziz is trying to figure out a specific point.
