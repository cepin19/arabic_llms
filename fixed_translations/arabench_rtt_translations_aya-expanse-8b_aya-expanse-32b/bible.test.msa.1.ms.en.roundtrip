첮e most important person in the kingdom?
첵n that time, Jesus' disciples came to him and asked, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Jesus called a little child to him. He put the child among them.
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
Whoever is humble like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
Whoever welcomes a little child in my name welcomes me.
But what if someone were to lead one of these little ones who believe in me into sin? If that were to happen, it would be better for that person to have a large millstone tied around their neck and be thrown into the depths of the sea.
How terrible it is for the world because of the things that lead people to sin! Such things must come. But how terrible for those who cause them!
"If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or foot than to be thrown into the eternal fire of hell with two hands or two feet."
If your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. The Parable of the Lost Sheep
Make sure you don't underestimate any of these little ones. That's what I'm telling you. Their angels in heaven may go at any time to visit my Father in heaven.
(No
What do you think? Imagine that a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them gets lost. Won't he leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go look for the one that's lost?
What I am telling you is true. If that sheep is found, there will be more joy over it than over the ninety-nine that did not wander off.
Thus your Father in heaven is; He does not want any of these little ones to be lost. When someone does you wrong
If your brother wrongs you, go to him. Tell him what he did wrong. Keep it between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won him back.
But what if they do not listen to you? In that case take one or two others along with you. The writing says: "Every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses." (Exodus 19:15)
But what if he refuses to listen to the witnesses? Tell it to the church. And what if he refuses to listen even to the church? Treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
What I am about to tell you is true. What you bind on earth will be bound in heaven. What you loosen on earth will be loosened in heaven.
Again, I say to you, whatever two of you agree on earth will be done for you by my Father in heaven.
"Where two or three are gathered in my name, I am among them." The merciless servant.
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy times seven."
The Kingdom of Heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
And as the king began to do so, a man with millions of dollars in debts was brought to him.
The man was unable to pay. So his master issued an order. The man, his wife, children, and all his possessions were to be sold to pay off his debt.
The servant knelt before him. "Give me time," he pleaded. "I'll pay everything back."
The lady felt sorry for him. She forgave his debts and set him free.
But that servant went out and found one of the other servants who owed him some dollars. He seized him and began to choke him, saying, "Pay me what you owe!"
The other servant knelt. "Give me time," he begged. "I will repay you."
But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and threw the man into prison until he could pay back what he owed.
The other servants saw what happened and were very disturbed by it. They went and told their master everything that had occurred.
Then the master called the first servant and said, "O wicked servant, I forgave you all that you owed me because you begged me.
Shouldn't you have shown mercy to the other servant as you had mercy on me?
In his anger, his master handed him over to the guards. He will be punished until he pays back everything he owes.
Thus will your heavenly Father treat you all if you do not forgive your brother or sister from your heart.
Jesus teaches about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Large crowds followed him. He healed them there.
Some Pharisees came to test Jesus, asking, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator made them male and female?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife, and they become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
They are no longer two but one. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.
They asked, "Why then did Moses command to give a woman a bill of divorce and send her away?"
Jesus replied, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of heart, but it was not this way from the beginning.
Here's what I'm telling you: A man who divorces his wife and marries another is an adulterer. A man has no right to divorce his wife unless she has been unfaithful to him.
The students said to him, "If this is the case between husband and wife, it is better not to marry."
Jesus answered, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining single. Only those can accept it who have been helped to live without marriage.
"Some men cannot be fathers because they were born that way. Some were made that way by others. Others have made themselves that way for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever can accept living that way, must do so." The little children were brought to Jesus.
Some people brought little children to Jesus, wanting him to place his hands on them and pray over them. But the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he departed from there. Jesus and the rich young man.
A man approached Jesus and asked him, "Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
"Why do you ask Me what is good?" Jesus answered. "There is only one God who is good. If you want to enter the kingdom, keep the commandments."
"Which?" asked the man. Jesus answered, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness."
Honor your father and your mother. (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) And "Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
The young man said, "I have kept all those commandments. What shall I do next?"
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell all you have, give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me."
When the young man heard this, he went away sorrowful. For he was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
And again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When the disciples heard this, they were astonished. And they asked, "Then who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter answered and said, "We have left all and followed you. What then shall we have?"
Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, and you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
"Those who leave their homes, their families, or their fields for my sake will receive a hundred times more, and will also have eternal life."
But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.
The Story of the Workers in the Vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a man who is a landowner. He went out early in the morning to hire laborers to work in his vineyard.
He agreed to give them their usual wage for a day's work. Then he sent them to his vineyard.
At around nine o'clock in the morning, he went out again. He saw others standing in the market square doing nothing.
And he said to them, "Go you also into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you."
He went. "He went out again around noon and at three o'clock and did the same thing.
Around five o'clock he went out and saw others still standing around the place. He asked them, "Why are you standing here all day doing nothing?"
"Because no one has hired us," they answered. He said to them, "You also go into the vineyard and work."
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, "Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last and going to the first."
The hired workers came around five o'clock and each received their usual daily wage.
So when the first of those who had been hired came, he expected to receive more. But he also received his daily wage.
When they received it, they started complaining about the landlord.
They said, "These people who were recently hired only worked for one hour." "You paid them the same as you paid us." "We did most of the work and stayed in the scorching sun all day."
The owner answered one of them, "Friend, I am dealing with you fairly. Didn't you agree to work for the usual daily wage?"
Take your money and go. I want to give those I recently employed the same salary I gave you.
Don't I have the right to do as I please with my own money? Do you feel cheated because I gave others so generously?
"But many who are last will be first, and the first last." Jesus speaks again of his impending death.
Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. Along the way, he took the twelve disciples aside to speak to them.
He said, "We are going up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death."
"Then they will hand him over to people who are not Jews. They will mock him and beat him. They will nail him to a cross. And on the third day, he will rise from the dead!" A mother asks Jesus for a favor.
The mother of Zebedes sons came to Jesus with her sons. Falling at his feet, she asked him for a favor.
"What do you want?" asked Jesus. She said, "Grant that one of my two sons may sit at your right hand in your kingdom, and the other at your left."
Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I am about to drink?" They answered, "We can."
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The other ten pupils heard about it and were angry with the brothers.
Jesus called his disciples and said to them, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise power over them."
Do not be like this. Instead, whoever among you wishes to be great must be your servant.
And whoever desires to be first among you shall be your slave.
"Be like the Son of Man, who did not come to be served, but to serve others. He came to give his life as a ransom for many." Two blind men regain their sight.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, and a large crowd followed them.
Two blind men sat by the roadside. They heard that Jesus was passing by. So they cried out, saying, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The crowd ordered them to stop. He asked them to be quiet. But the two men cried out even louder, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stopped and called them, saying, "What do you want me to do for you?"
"Sir," they answered, "we want to be seen."
Jesus felt deep compassion for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately they could see, and they followed him.
Jesus' Entry into Jerusalem
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,
He said to them, "Go to the village ahead of you. As soon as you enter it, you will find a donkey tied up, with a colt by her. Untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone says anything to you, say that the Lord needs them. Their owner will send them immediately.
This happened so that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled. He said:
Say to the daughter of Zion, "Behold, your King is coming to you, humble, and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey." (Zechariah 9:9)
The disciples went and did what Jesus commanded them.
Bring the donkey and the colt. Place their cloaks on them. Then Jesus sat on the cloaks.
A very large crowd gathered and spread their coats on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
Some people went ahead of him, and some followed. They all shouted: "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred. The people asked, "Who is this?"
The crowd answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus cleanses the temple.
Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations' (Isaiah 56:7). But you have made it a den of robbers" (Jeremiah 7:11).
The blind and the lame came to Jesus in the temple, and He healed them there.
The priests, the chief priests, and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he was doing, and they also saw the children in the temple area shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" But when they saw all this, they were indignant.
"Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," answered Jesus. "Have you never read in the Scriptures? 'From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise'." (Psalm 8:2)
Then Jesus left the people and went outside the city to Bethany. He spent the night there, and the fig tree withered.
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the roadside. He approached it and found only leaves on it. He said to it, "Never bear fruit!" Suddenly the tree withered.
When the pupils saw this, they were amazed. They asked, "How did the tree dry up so quickly?"
Jesus answered and said to him, "Assuredly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be removed and be cast into the sea,' it will be done."
"If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer." "Jesus' authority is questioned."
Jesus entered the temple courts, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and asked, "By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered and said unto him, "I will ask thee one question. If thou tellest me that, I will tell thee by what authority I do these things."
Where did the baptism of John come from? Was it from heaven, or from men? They reasoned among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'"
But what if we say "of men"? We are afraid of people. Everyone thought John was a prophet.
So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." And Jesus said to them, "Then I will not tell you by what authority I do these things. The Parable of the Two Sons
What do you think about this? A man had two sons; he went to the first and said, "Son, go and work today in the vineyard."
"I won't do it," the son replied. But then he changed his mind and went.
Then the father went to the other son. He said the same thing. The son answered, "I will, sir." But he did not go.
"Which of the two sons did what his father wanted?" "The first one," they answered. Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John came to tell you how to live rightly. You didn't believe him. But the tax collectors and prostitutes believed him. I saw that. But even then you did not turn away from your sins and believe him. The story of the tenants.
Listen to another story. There was a man who owned some land, so he planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it. He dug a winepress inside it. He also built a watchtower. He leased the vineyard to some farmers. Then he went on a journey.
When the time of harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants, and commanded them to gather his share of the fruits.
But the tenants seized his slaves, beat one of them, killed another, and stoned the third to death.
Then the man sent other servants to the tenants. He sent more than he had sent the first time. The tenants treated the servants the same way.
In the end, he sent his son to them. He said, "They will treat my son with respect."
But the tenants saw the son coming. They said to each other, "This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours."
So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
When the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do to those tenants?
"Those wicked people will be destroyed," they answered. "Then the vineyard will be let out to other farmers. They will give him his share of the produce at harvest time."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
Here is what I say to you: The kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to people who will produce its fruit.
Anyone who falls on that stone will be dashed to pieces. But the stone will crush whoever falls on it.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' stories. They knew he was talking about them.
So they looked for a way to arrest him. But they feared the crowds. The people thought Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Story
Jesus told them other parables, saying:
Here is how the kingdom of heaven is like. A king prepared a wedding feast for his son.
He sent his servant to the dinner guests. The servants told them to come, but they refused.
Then he sent some more servants, saying, "Tell those invited, 'My banquet is ready. My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is prepared. Come to the wedding feast.'"
But people didn't care. One went to his field, and another to his work.
The others seized his slaves, treating them cruelly and eventually killing them.
The king was furious. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed the murderers and burned their city.
So the king said to his servant, "The wedding feast is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy to come.
Go to the street corners. Invite to dinner anyone you can find.
So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, good and bad. Soon the wedding hall was filled with guests.
The king entered to visit the guests. He noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.
My friend, how did you enter here without a wedding suit? The man couldn't think of anything to say.
Then the king said to his servant, "Bind his hands and feet. Cast him outside into the darkness. There he will weep and gnash his teeth."
"Many are called, but few are chosen." Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went out. They devised a plan to entrap Jesus in His words.
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. They said, "Teacher, we know that you are a man of integrity. You teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You don't let anyone influence you, and you don't care about anyone's status.
So tell us, then, what do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
But Jesus knew their evil intentions. He said, "Hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the currency that people use to pay taxes. "Bring him a silver coin."
He asked them, "Whose image is this? And whose words are these?"
"Caesar," they replied. Then he said to them, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's."
When they heard this, they were amazed. They left him and went away. "Marriage is when the dead rise."
On that very day, the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question, for they do not believe in the resurrection of the dead.
They said, "Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must take the wife and raise up offspring for his brother."
There were seven brothers among us. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened to the second and third brothers. It continued until it reached the seventh brother.
Finally, the woman died.
Well, when the dead rise, who will be his wife? She was married to all seven of them.
Jesus answered, "You are mistaken, because you do not know the Scriptures, nor the power of God.
When the dead rise, they will not marry. Nor will they be given in marriage by their fathers. They will be like the angels in heaven.
What about the resurrection of the dead? Didn't you read what God told you?
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." (Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
When the crowd heard this, they were amazed at his teaching. The most important commandment.
When the Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus, they gathered together.
One of them, a lawyer, tested him with a question.
"Teacher," he asked, "which is the most important commandment in the law?"
Jesus answered, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind" (Deuteronomy 6:5).
This is the first and most important commandment.
Equality is: "Love your neighbor as yourself" (Leviticus 19:18)
"All that is written in the Law and the Prophets depends on these two commandments." "Who is the Son of Christ?"
The Pharisees gathered together. Jesus asked them, saying,
"What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?" "The son of David," they answered.
He said to them, "Why then does David call him 'my Lord'? The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. David said,
"The LORD said to my Lord, 'Sit at My right hand, until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.'" (Psalm 110:1)
So if David calls him "Lord," how can he be the son of David?
No one could answer him in a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him another question.
Jesus condemns the Pharisees and the teachers of the law.
Jesus spoke to the crowds and his disciples.
He said, "The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat."
So you must obey them. Do everything they tell you to do. But don't do what they do. They don't practice what they preach.
They burden themselves with heavy loads and place them on others' shoulders, but they are unwilling to exert any effort to carry them themselves.
All that they do is done to be seen by others. On their foreheads and arms they wear small boxes containing verses from the Bible. They make the boxes very wide. And they make the fringes on their coats very long.
They love to sit in the places of honor at feasts. They also love to get the most important seats in temples.
They love being welcomed in the city's markets. They love it when people call them "Rabbi."
But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers.
Do not call anyone on earth your father; for One is your Father, He who is in heaven.
No one should call you 'Teacher.' You have only one Teacher, the Christ.
The greatest among you shall be your servant.
He who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.
How terrible it will be for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. You do not enter yourselves, and you do not allow those who are entering to go in.
(No
"Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You travel everywhere to make one convert to your faith. Then you make him twice as much a child of hell as you are."
Alas for you, blind guides! You say, "If anyone swears by the temple, it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath."
You are blind and naive! What matters more? Is it the gold? Or is it the temple that makes the gold sacred?
You also say, "If anyone swears by the name of the altar, it means nothing. But if anyone swears by the name of the gift that is on it, he must keep his oath."
O blind one! What is more important? Is it the gift? Or is it the altar that makes the gift sacred?
So whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.
And everyone who swears by the temple swears by the temple and by the one who dwells in it.
And whoever swears by the name of the sky, has sworn by the name of the throne of Allah and by He who sits upon it.
How terrible it will be for you teachers of the law and for the Pharisees! You hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin—but you have neglected the more important aspects of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former.
O you blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!
Alas for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed. You only want to please yourselves.
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside will be clean also.
How terrible it is for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness.
This applies to you as well. From the outside, you appear to be doing the right thing. But on the inside, you're full of what's wrong. You pretend to be something you're not.
Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You build the tombs of the prophets. You adorn the graves of the righteous.
And they say, "If we had lived in the days of our predecessors, we would not have done as they did. We would not have been accomplices in the killing of the prophets."
For you bear witness against yourselves. You acknowledge that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
So complete the sins of those who came before you who lived before you!
You are a nest of venomous snakes! How will you escape being sentenced to hell?
Therefore I send you prophets and wise men and teachers. You will kill some of them, and crucify some, and scourge some in your synagogues, and chase them from city to city.
You shall pay the penalty for the blood of every innocent person who has been murdered on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
What I'm going to tell you is true. All of this will happen to those who are alive now.
"Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I have wanted to gather your children as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!"
Look, your house is abandoned.
I say to you, you will not see me again until you say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord." (Psalm 118:26)
End marks
Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came to him. They pointed out the temple buildings to him.
"Do you see all these things?" asked Jesus. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. There his disciples came to him privately and said, "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end of the world?"
Jesus answered, "Be on your guard! Beware of all false prophets.
Many will come in my name, saying, "I am the Christ!" and will deceive many.
You will hear about wars. You will also hear people talking about wars in the future. Don't worry. Those things have to happen. But the end is not yet.
Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in many places.
All this is the beginning of the pains of childbirth.
Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations because of my name.
At that time, many will turn away from their faith. They will exchange hatred. They will betray one another.
Many false prophets will arise. They will mislead many people.
For the abundance of wickedness will cause the love of many to grow cold.
But whoever endures to the end will be saved.
This good news of the kingdom will be preached throughout the world, to all nations, and then the end will come.
The prophet Daniel spoke of the "abomination that desolates" (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11). One day you will see it standing in the holy place. The reader must understand this.
Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains.
No one on the roof should go down to their house to get anything.
No one in the field should come back to take their coat.
How terrible it would be for pregnant women in those days! And how frightening for nursing mothers!
Pray that you may not have to flee in winter or on the Sabbath.
There will be terrible suffering in those days, worse than at any time since the beginning of the world until now, and never to be matched again.
If time were not shortened, no one would survive. But for the sake of God's chosen people, it will be.
At that time, someone may say to you, "Look! Here is the Christ!" or "There he is!" Do not believe them.
False Christs and prophets will appear. They will perform great signs and wonders. They will try to deceive the chosen people of God, if possible.
See, I told you before.
If it is said to you, "He is very far in the desert," do not go towards him. Or if it is said to you, "He is far inside the house," do not believe it.
The lightning comes from the east and is seen in the west. So will it be when the Son of Man comes.
Ostriches will gather wherever they find a corpse.
"Immediately after the terrible suffering of those days, 'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will be shaken.' (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
At that time, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory.
He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet. They will gather together His chosen people from the four directions. They will bring them from the ends of the heavens to the other ends.
Learn a lesson from the fig tree. When its branches become tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.
Similarly, when you see all these things happening, you know that the end is near. It's right at the door.
What I am telling you is the truth. People who are living at that time will certainly not die until all these things happen.
"Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. No one knows about that day or hour."
No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
Remember how it was in the days of Noah. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark.
They had no idea what was going to happen until the flood came and took them all. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
There will be two men in the field. One will be taken and the other left.
Two women will grind using a manual grinding stone. One will be taken and the other left.
So be among those who are ready. You do not know on what day your Lord will come.
You must understand something. Imagine if the homeowner knew at what time of night the thief would come. He would have been watching. He wouldn't have allowed his home to be broken into.
Therefore you also must be ready; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
Imagine a master who puts one of his servants in charge of the other servants in his house. The servant's task is to give food to the others at the right time. The master wants a faithful and wise servant to perform this task.
It would be beneficial for the worker if his master found him doing his job upon his return.
What I am telling you is true. The master will give this slave authority over all that he possesses.
But what if the slave is evil? What if he says to himself, "My master is gone for a long time"?
What if he starts beating other servants? And what if he eats and drinks with those who drink a lot?
The master of that servant will return on a day when the servant does not expect him, and at an hour when the servant does not know.
Then the master cuts it into pieces. He sends it to the place where the protesters go. There, people cry and dig with their teeth.
"A Tale of Ten Brides"
Here is how the kingdom of heaven will be at that time. Five of the bridesmaids took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were ignorant. Five were wise.
The fools took their lamps but they didn't bring any olive oil with them.
The wise men took oil in their flasks with their lamps.
The groom didn't come for a long time. So, all the bride's friends got tired and slept.
At midnight someone shouted: "Here comes the bridegroom! Go out to meet him!"
Then the bride's companions awoke and found their lamps.
The fools said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil. Our lamps are going out."
"No," they replied. "There may not be enough for all of us. Instead, go to those who sell oil. Buy some for yourselves."
So they went to buy oil. But as they were going, the bridegroom arrived. The brides who were ready went in with the bridegroom to the wedding dinner. Then the door was shut.
The other bridesmaids came later, too. They said, "Sir! Sir! Open the door for us!"
But he answered, "What I will tell you is the truth. I do not know you."
"Therefore you must be ready also, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect." - The Parable of the Three Servants
Again, it will be like the kingdom of heaven. There was a man who went on a journey. He called his servants and entrusted them with his property.
He gave two thousand dollars to one. He gave four thousand dollars to another. And he gave two thousand dollars to the third. The man gave each servant an amount of money that he knew the servant could take care of. Then he continued on his journey.
The servant who received $10,000 immediately went and invested his money, earning another $10,000.
He who makes $4000 makes $4000 more.
But the man who received two thousand dollars went and dug a hole in the ground. He hid his master's money there.
After a long time, the master of these servants returned. He wanted to collect all the money they had earned.
The man who received $10,000 brought another $10,000. He said, "Sir, you trusted me with $10,000. Look, I've made another $10,000."
His master answered, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master!"
The man who had four thousand dollars also came. He said, "Sir, you trusted me with four thousand dollars. Look, I have made another four thousand dollars."
His master answered, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master!"
Then the man who received two thousand dollars spoke up and said, "Sir, I knew you were a tough man. You reap where you did not sow. You gather crops where you did not plant seeds.
So I was afraid. I went out and buried the $2000 I had in the ground. Look, here's your money.
His master answered, "You wicked and lazy slave! Did you not know that I reap where I did not sow? Do you not know that I gather where I did not scatter seed?
Well, you should have deposited my money in the bank. When I return, I'll get it back with interest.
Then his master ordered the other servants, saying, "Take two thousand dollars from him and give it to the one who has twenty thousand."
To whom much is given, much will be required; and to whom much is entrusted, even more will be given. What about the one who has nothing? Even what he has will be taken from him.
Throw that worthless slave out. Out there in the dark, people will groan and gnash their teeth. "Sheep and oxen"
The Son of Man will come in all his glory, and all the angels with him. He will sit on his glorious throne.
All the nations will be gathered before him. People will be separated into two groups, like a shepherd separating the sheep from the goats.
He will put the sheep on his right hand and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right, "Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world.
I was hungry. And you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty. And you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger. And you invited me in.
I needed clothes. And you gave them to me. I was sick. And you took care of me. I was in prison. And you visited me.
Then the righteous will answer him, saying: 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink?'
When did we see you a stranger and invite you into our home? And when did we see you in need of clothes and give them to you?
When have we seen you sick or in prison and gone to visit you?
The king will answer: "What I am about to tell you is true. Whatever I have done for any of my least important brothers, I have done for me."
Then he will say to those on his left, "Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
I was hungry. But you gave me nothing to eat. I was thirsty. But you gave me nothing to drink.
I was a stranger. But you did not let me in. I needed clothes. But you gave me none. I was sick in prison. But you did not take care of me.
They will also say, "Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty and not help you? And when did we see you a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and not help you?"
He will answer, "What I tell you is true. If you do nothing for anyone least significant, you won't do it for me."
Then they will be punished forever. But those who did right will have eternal life.
The plan to kill Jesus
Jesus finished saying all these things. Then he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified.
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, Caiaphas.
They plotted to arrest Jesus in a clever way. They wanted to kill him.
But not during the feast, they said. "It might provoke people." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in the town of Bethany, in the home of a man named Simon, who had a serious skin disease.
A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head as he was reclining at the table.
When the disciples saw this, they were indignant. They asked, "Why this waste?"
The perfume could have been sold at a high price. The money could have been given to the poor.
Jesus was aware of this. He said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a good deed to me."
There will always be poor people with you. But I will not always be with you.
She poured perfume over my body to prepare me for burial.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. What you have done will be proclaimed in every place where this good news is preached throughout the world. It will be told in remembrance of her." Judas agrees to hand over Jesus.
One of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests.
He asked them, "What will you give me, and I will deliver Jesus to you?" They counted out thirty pieces of silver to him.
From that time on, Judas watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. The Last Supper
This was the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked him, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover meal?"
He replied, "Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, 'The Teacher says, My time is near. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.'"
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them. They prepared the Passover.
When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve.
As they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me and hand me over to my enemies."
The pupils became very sad. They began to say to him, one after another, "It isn't you, Lord, is it?"
Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand with me in the dish, he will betray me.
The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for him if he had not been born.
It was Judas who would betray him. He said, "Surely not I, Rabbi?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is you."
And Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take, eat; this is my body."
Then he took the cup, gave thanks, and offered it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you."
This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
This is what I'm telling you: From now on, I won't drink wine with you again until the day I drink it with you in my father's kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus says Peter will fail.
Jesus said to them, "This very night, you will all deny me. For it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)"
But after I am raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.
Peter answered, "Everyone else might leave because of you. But I never will."
"What I am about to tell you is true," Jesus answered. "This very night, before the cock crows, you will deny me three times that you know me."
But Peter said, "I may have to die with you. But I will never say that I don't know you." The other disciples said the same thing. Jesus prays in Gethsemane.
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here, while I go over there to pray."
Peter took the sons of Zebedee with him. And he began to be sorrowful and very distressed.
Then he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and watch with me."
He went a little farther. Then he fell on his face and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter, "Why did you not watch with me for one hour?"
"Be careful and pray. Thus you will not fall into sin when tempted. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
Jesus went away for the second time and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned. He found them sleeping again. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
So he left them and went away again. And for the third time he prayed the same prayer.
Then he returned to his disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand. The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners."
"Rise! Let us go! Behold, he who will deliver me to them is coming!" Jesus is arrested.
While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Joseph, who had been agreed with them for the betrayal of Jesus, signaled to them, saying, "Whomever I kiss, he is the one. Seize him."
So Judas went to Jesus and said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you have come for." Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
Jesus said to him, "Put your sword away; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you think I can't ask my father for help? He would instantly send an army of over 70,000 angels.
But how then are sacred texts verified? They say that it must happen in the same way.
At that time, Jesus said to the multitudes, "Do you think that I am leading an armed band against you? Why do you come with swords and clubs to arrest me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you did not arrest me."
"But all this has happened so that the words of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left him and fled. Jesus was taken to the Sanhedrin.
Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
Not far away, Peter followed Jesus. He approached the high priest's courtyard, entered, and sat down with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.
But they found no evidence, though many false witnesses appeared. Finally, two other witnesses came forward.
They said, "This man claimed, 'I can destroy the temple of God, and I can rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Do you not answer? What is it that these men testify against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God."
Yes, it is, said Jesus. "But I tell you all: In the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One. And you will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? You have heard the blasphemy with your own ears."
"What do you think?" they asked. "He must die!" they answered.
Then they sprayed his face with mace. Some punched him with their fists. Others slapped him.
They said, "Prophesy to us, Christ! Who hit you?" Peter said, "I do not know Jesus."
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A servant girl came to him and said, "You were also with Jesus of Galilee."
But before them all, Peter said that he was not. "I do not know what you are talking about," he said.
Then he went out to the gate of the house leading to the courtyard. And there another woman saw him. She said to the people, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
Again he said it wasn't so. Under oath he said, "I don't know the man!"
After a short while, the people who had been standing there approached Peter. "You must be one of them," they said. "The way you speak tells us that."
Then Peter began to curse and swear, "I do not know the man!" And immediately a rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." Jesus said to him, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." Peter went outside. He broke down and wept.
Judas hangs himself.
It was early in the morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to kill Jesus.
They bound him, led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate.
The one who had betrayed him, Judas, saw that Jesus was condemned to death. He felt deep shame and remorse for his actions. So he went and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
He said, "I made a mistake. I released an innocent man." They said, "What does that have to do with us? It's your problem."
So Judas threw the money into the temple and left, and went away and hanged himself.
The chief priests took the money. They said, "It is not lawful to put this money into the treasury, for it is the price of blood. It was paid for the death of a man."
So they decided to use the money to buy a cemetery plot. People from other countries will be buried there.
That's why it's still called "Field of Blood" to this day.
So the words of the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled: "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him who was priced, whom they priced from the children of Israel."
"They paid me thirty pieces of silver, as the Lord commanded me. So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the house of the Lord to th
Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "You say so."
But when the chief priests and elders accused him, he answered nothing.
Then Pilate asked Jesus, "Do you not hear the charges they are bringing against you?"
But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge. The governor was quite amazed.
It was the governor's custom at the Passover feast to release one prisoner to the crowd's will. The people could choose the prisoner they wanted released.
At that time they had a well-known prisoner called Barabbas.
So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Whom do you want me to release? Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Pilate learned that the leaders were jealous. He knew that was why they had handed Jesus over to him.
While Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message: "Have nothing to do with that innocent man. I have suffered a great deal in a dream today because of him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed.
The governor asked, "Which one do you want me to release?" They answered, "Barabbas."
"What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" asked Pilate. And they all answered, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What has he done wrong?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood. It is your responsibility!"
All the people answered: "We and our children will bear the responsibility for his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas, but ordered Jesus to be flogged. Then he handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
The governor's soldiers took Jesus to the palace, which was called the Praetorium. They gathered the rest of the soldiers around him.
They removed his clothes and put a purple robe on him.
Then they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!"
They sprayed him with the hose. They hit him on the head with the stick repeatedly.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him and put his clothes on him again. Then they led him away to crucify him. Jesus was crucified on the cross.
On their way out of the city, they met a man from Carthage named Simon. They forced him to carry the cross.
They came to a place called Golgotha, which means Place of the Skull.
There they mixed wine with bitter spices and offered it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it.
When they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots.
They sat and guarded him there.
They placed above his head the sign that read "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews."
Two thieves were crucified with him, one on his right and the other on his left.
They passed by Jesus, shouting and showing him contempt, and shaking their heads.
He said, "So you would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days? Save yourself! Come down from the cross if you are the Son of God!"
Likewise, the priests, the scribes, and the elders mocked him.
They said, "Save others, but he cannot save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
He trusts in God, for God to save him now if He wills it. He is the one who said, "I am the Son of God."
Likewise, the robbers who were crucified with Jesus also mocked him. Jesus died.
From noon until three, darkness covered the whole earth.
Around the ninth hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of those who stood there, when they heard Jesus cry out, said, "He is calling Elijah."
Immediately someone ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
The others said, "Leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah will come to save him."
After Jesus cried out loudly again, he died.
At that moment, the curtain of the temple was torn from top to bottom. The earth shook. The rocks split.
The graves were opened, and many of the saints who had died were raised to life.
They came out of the tombs. After the resurrection of Jesus, they entered the holy city. There they appeared to many people.
The Roman commander and the guards who were with Jesus saw the earthquake and everything that had happened, and they were terrified. They cried out, "Certainly this man was the Son of God!"
Not far away, many women were watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for him.
Mary Magdalene was among them. There was also Mary, the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebed's sons. Jesus was buried.
As evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came. He had become a disciple of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Yusuf took the body and wrapped it in a clean cloth.
He placed her in his new tomb carved out of the rock. He rolled a large stone in front of the tomb's entrance. Then he departed.
Mary Magdalene and the other woman sat opposite the tomb. The tomb guards.
The next day was the day after the preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
They said, "Master, we remember something that liar said while he was still alive. He claimed, 'In three days I will rise again.'"
So give orders for the tomb to be made secure until the third day; otherwise his disciples may go there and steal the body, and then tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first."
"Take some guards with you," Pilate answered. "Go. Make the tomb as secure as you can."
So they went and made the tomb secure, and placed a seal on the stone, and set a guard.
Jesus rose from the dead.
Now the Sabbath had ended. At dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.
A great earthquake occurred. An angel of the Lord descended from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled away the stone and sat on it.
His body shone like lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so frightened of him that they trembled and became like the dead.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified."
Not here! He has risen, just as he said! Come and see the place where he was lying.
Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you."
The women fled from the tomb. They were afraid but full of joy. They ran to tell the disciples.
Suddenly Jesus met them and said, "Peace be with you." They came near to him, seized his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me." And the guards went and told the chief priests.
And as the women were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city, and told the chief priests all that had happened.
When the chief priests met with the elders, they devised a plan. They offered the soldiers a large sum of money.
She told them, "We want you to say, 'His disciples came at night. They stole his body while we were sleeping.'"
If the governor hears this report, we'll be in trouble. This will keep you out of trouble.
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus' last commands to his disciples.
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they bowed down to him. Yet some still had doubts.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
"Teach them to obey everything I command you. And you can rest assured that I will be with you until the end."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Long ago the prophet Isaiah wrote, "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
"A voice cries out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight his paths!' (Isaiah 40:3)"
And so John came. He baptized people in the desert. He also preached that people should be baptized and repent of their sins, for God would forgive them.
All the people of Judea and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem went out to him, and on confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
John wore clothes made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
This is what John taught: "After me comes one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals.
"I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." Jesus is baptized and tempted.
At that time, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee. He was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
Jesus came up from the water. At that moment, he saw the heavens split open. He saw the Holy Spirit descend on him like a dove.
He heard a voice calling him from heaven, saying, "My son, I love you, and I am very pleased with you."
Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.
He was in the desert for forty days. There the devil assassinated him. The wild animals did not harm him. The angels watched over him. Jesus chose his first disciples.
After John was imprisoned, Jesus went to Galilee. He began preaching the good news of God.
He said, "The time is fulfilled. The kingdom of God is at hand. Repent of your sins and believe the gospel!"
One day, Jesus was walking by the edge of Lake Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting their net into the lake. They were fishermen.
"Come, follow me," said Jesus, "and I will make you fishers of men."
So they immediately left their nets and followed him.
Then Jesus walked a little further. As he walked, he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat preparing their nets.
Immediately he called them. And they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men, and went after Jesus. Jesus casts out an evil demon.
Jesus and those with him went to Capernaum. On the Sabbath day, he entered the synagogue and began to teach.
The people were amazed at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, not as their scribes.
At that moment, a man in their synagogue shouted. He was under the control of an evil spirit. He said:
What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!
Jesus said with authority: "Be silent!" "Come out of him!"
The devil shook the man violently. Then he emerged from him with a scream.
Everyone was amazed. They wondered among themselves, "What is this? It's a new teaching! And with great authority! He even commands evil spirits, and they obey his orders."
The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout all the region of Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left the temple and went directly with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed with a fever. They told Jesus about her.
So he went to her, took her hand, and helped her up. The fever left her body. Then she began to serve them.
That evening after sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who were sick or demon-possessed.
All the people in the city gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many of them. They were afflicted with various diseases. He also cast out many demons. But he would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prayed in a solitary place.
It was still early in the morning, and darkness reigned. Jesus got up and left the house. He went to a place where he could be alone. There, he prayed.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
When they found her, they shouted: "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus answered, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages. I must preach there also. That is why I have come."
So he traveled through every city and village, teaching in their synagogues, and casting out demons as well. Jesus heals a man with leprosy
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus. He knelt down and begged Jesus, saying, "If you choose to, you can make me clean."
Jesus was filled with deep compassion. He reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing to do it," he said. "Be made clean!"
Immediately the disease left him. He was healed.
Jesus sent the man away immediately. He gave him a stern warning.
"Don't tell anyone about this," he said. "Go and show yourself to the priest. Offer the sacrifices as Moses commanded. This will be evidence for the priest and the people that you are 'clean'."
But the man went out and began to proclaim it freely, and to spread the news so widely that Jesus could no longer enter a town openly. He remained outside in deserted places, but people kept coming to him from all quarters.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk.
After a few days, Jesus returned to Capernaum. The people heard that he had returned to his hometown.
A large crowd gathered, until there was no longer any room. There wasn't even room outside the door. And Jesus was teaching them.
Four of those who came were carrying a man who could not walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, letting down their mat, they lowered the man.
Jesus saw their faith, and he said to the man, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
There were some law professors sitting there. They were thinking.
Why is this man talking like this? He's saying something very evil! Only God can forgive sins!
Immediately Jesus knew what they were thinking in their minds. He said to them, "Why do you think this way?"
Is it easier to say to this man, "Your sins are forgiven," or to say, "Rise, take up your bed and walk"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus spoke to the man who couldn't walk.
He said to me, "Get up. Take your mat and go home."
The man rose, took his mat, and walked away, while everyone watched in amazement. They were all astounded and praised God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!" Jesus chooses Levi.
And at that time Jesus went out to the edge of the Sea of Galilee. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them.
As Jesus walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector’s booth. “Follow me,” he told him, and Levi got up and followed him.
Later, Jesus was dining at the home of Levi. Many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples. They were part of the large crowd that followed Jesus.
There were some teachers of the law who were Pharisees. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. So they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
Jesus heard this and said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners." Jesus is asked about fasting.
The disciples of John and the Pharisees fast often. So people came to Jesus and said to him, "John's disciples and the Pharisees fast often. But your disciples do not fast. Why do they not fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them. On that day they will fast.
People do not patch a new piece of cloth onto old clothes. If they do, the new piece will pull away from the old one. This will make the holes worse.
People do not pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the wine will burst the wineskins and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins." Jesusmersmersmersmersmersmersmersmers
On one of the sabbath days, Jesus was walking through grainfields with his disciples. The disciples began to pluck some of the heads of grain.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! Your disciples are breaking the Sabbath law. Why do they do that?"
He replied, "Have you never read what David did? He and his men were hungry. They needed food."
This was when Abiathar was high priest. David went into the house of God and ate the showbread, which was lawful only for the priests to eat. He also gave some to his men.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
"The Son of Man is Lord, even on the Sabbath."
Healing on Saturday
At another time, Jesus entered the temple, and there was a man with a withered and paralyzed hand.
Some of the Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus' words. They were watching him closely. They wanted to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus spoke to the man with the weak and withered hand. "Stand up in front of everyone," he said.
Then Jesus asked them, "What does the law say about what should be done on the Sabbath? Is it right to do good or to do evil? To save life or to kill?" But no one answered.
Jesus looked at them with anger. He was very angry because their hearts were hard. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as new.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with Herod against Jesus, wanting to kill him. The crowds followed Jesus.
Jesus went with his disciples to the Sea of Galilee, and a large crowd from Galilee followed them.
The people heard about all that Jesus was doing, and many came to him. They came from Judea, Jerusalem, and Idumea. They came from the regions east of the Jordan River. And they came from the那那那那那那那那那那那那那那那那那那那那那那
Because of the crowd, Jesus told his disciples to prepare a small boat for him. This would prevent people from crowding around him.
Jesus healed many people. So, the sick were pushing toward him to touch him.
When the evil spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone who he was. Jesus appoints the twelve apostles.
Jesus went up a mountain. He called some people to come to him, and they came.
And he chose ten of them and appointed them as apostles, and said to them, "From now on, you will be with me. And I will also send you to teach."
They will have authority to cast out demons.
Then Jesus appointed twelve, and among them was Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter.
There were Jacob, son of Zebedee, and his brother John. Jesus gave them the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder.
And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot.
Judas Iscariot was also among them. He was the one who later betrayed Jesus to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebul.
Jesus entered a house. Again a crowd gathered. It was so large that Jesus and his disciples could not even eat.
His family heard about it. They went to take charge of him. They said, "He has lost his mind."
There were some scribes. They came from Jerusalem. They said, "He is under the authority of Beelzebul! He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons."
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said to them, "Truly I tell you, it is not possible for

If a family is divided, it cannot stand.
