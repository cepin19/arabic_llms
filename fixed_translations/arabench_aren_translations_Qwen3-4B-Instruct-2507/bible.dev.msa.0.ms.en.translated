As for the birth of Jesus Christ, it took place as follows: His mother, Mary, was engaged to a man named Joseph. But before they were married, she became pregnant by the power of the Holy Spirit.
But Joseph found her to be a good woman, and he did not wish to reveal her secret, so he decided to leave her in peace.
While Joseph was thinking about this, an angel appeared to him in a dream and said to him: "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child she carries is of the Holy Spirit."
And she will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."
This happened so that what the Lord said through the Prophet might be fulfilled:
"Behold, the virgin will conceive and bear a son, and his name will be Emmanuel, which means 'God with us.'"
And when Joseph woke up from his sleep, he did everything as commanded by the angel of the Lord, and took his wife to his house.
But he did not know her until the child whom he named 'Jesus' was born.
Wise men from the East
And when Jesus was born in Bethlehem in the region of Judea during the reign of King Herod, some wise men from the East came to Jerusalem,
And they asked, "Where is the child who has been born recently, who is to be the king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east, and have come to worship him."
The king Herod was disturbed when he heard this, as were all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Herod gathered all the chief priests and scribes, and asked them where the Messiah was born.
They said to him: "In the city of Bethlehem in the region of Judea, for this is written by the prophet:"
«You, Bethlehem of Judea, are not insignificant among the rulers of Judah, for from you a ruler will come who will shepherd My people, Israel.»
And Herod called the scribes and the experts, and he honored them, and they informed him precisely of the time when the star appeared.
Then they sent them to the city of Bethlehem and said: "Go and look for the child. And when you find him, tell me, so that I too may go and prostrate myself before him."
So the wise men listened to the king and then departed. And behold, the star they had seen in the east was moving ahead of them until it reached and stood above the place where the child was.
Be exceedingly joyful when they saw the star.
They entered the house and saw the child with Mary his mother, and they prostrated themselves on the ground, worshipping him. Then they opened the chests containing their treasures and offered him gifts: gold, incense, and myrrh.
Then God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod, so they traveled to their homeland by another route. The flight to Egypt
And when the wise men had traveled, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said to him: "Rise, take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod will search for the child to destroy him."
Then Joseph rose, took the child and his mother at night, and went to Egypt.
And this continued until Herod's death. This happened to fulfill what the Lord said through the prophet: "I have called my son from Egypt." #From... my son. 15:2 From the book of Hosea 11:1. Herod kills the children of Bethlehem
When Herod learned that the wise men had deceived him, he became extremely angry and ordered the killing of all children in Bethlehem and its surrounding area who were two years of age or younger, according to the time the wise men had told him.
At that time, what was said on the lips of the Prophet Jeremiah:
"A voice was heard in Ramah—a loud cry of Noach. It was Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to mourn because they were dead." Return from Egypt
After the death of Herod, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt.
He said to him: "Get up, take the child and his mother, and return to the land of Israel, because those who tried to kill the child are dead."
Then Joseph rose, took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus had become king in the region of Judea instead of his father Herod, he feared to go there. After God warned him in a dream, he went to the region of Galilee.
And he lived in a town called Nazareth. This event fulfilled the prophets' statement that the Messiah would be called a Nazarene. #Nazarene. 23:2 Named after the city of Nazareth. Also, it is a word similar to the Hebrew word meaning "branch," mentioned in Isaiah 11:1, pointing to the promise of the Messiah coming from the line of David.
John the Baptist
At that time John the Baptist came to preach in the Judean wilderness,
And he said: "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
And John says this is the one about whom the prophet Isaiah spoke when he said: "A voice of one man crying in the wilderness, saying: 'Make the way ready for the Lord. Straighten out the path for him.'"
John was dressed in garments made of camel's hair, and a belt of leather around his waist; and he ate locusts and wild honey.
At that time, people began coming from Jerusalem and from all of the Jewish region, and from the area around the Jordan River, to hear him.
And he would lead them to the Jordan River after they had confessed their sins.
And when John saw that many of the Pharisees and Sadducees were coming to be baptized by him, he said to them: "O children of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the coming wrath?"
Make a tree that proves your repentance.
And do not boast when you say: "Ibrahim is our father." For I say to you that Allah is capable of creating children for Ibrahim from these stones.
Here is the axe placed on the roots of the tree trunks. It will cut down every tree that does not bear good fruit, and it will cast it into the fire.
I am sending you forth in water to proclaim your repentance; but he who comes after me is greater than I am, and I am not worthy to stoop and unlace his sandals. He will send you forth in the Holy Spirit and fire.
He will carry his grains in his hand and cleanse them with his own hand, gathering his grains into the storehouse, and burning the chaff with a fire that never goes out. — The Lordship of Jesus
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River, because He wished to be baptized by John.
But John tried to stop him and said: "I need you to come to me, so why are you coming here?"
Then Jesus replied, "Allow this to happen now, for it is proper to complete all that God requires." At that time John permitted him to proceed.
Jesus was baptized in the water. And as he came up from the water, heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest upon him.
A voice came from heaven saying: "You are my beloved's son. I am satisfied with you in every way."
Jesus' experience
And the Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness to test him against Satan.
After Jesus had refrained from eating for forty days and forty nights, he became hungry.
A tested one came to him #The Tested One. 3:4 That is, Satan. And he said to him: "If you are the son of God, say to these stones that they become loaves of bread."
But Jesus answered him, "The Scripture says, 'Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"
Then Iblis took him to the Holy City and placed him on the summit of the Temple.
He said to him: "If you are truly the Son of God, come down from here yourself. The Book says: 'God commands His angels to take you.' And: 'They will carry you on their hands so that your foot may not touch the stone.'"
And Jesus answered him: "The Book also says: 'The Lord your God will not test you.'"
Then Satan took him to a high mountain and showed before his eyes the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
Then he said to him: "I will give you all of this if you prostrate yourself before me."
Then Jesus said to him, "Get away, Satan! For the Scripture says: 'You shall worship the Lord your God and serve Him only.'"
At that time Satan left him, and angels came to serve him. Jesus begins his ministry in Galilee.
And when Jesus heard that John had been imprisoned, he returned to Galilee.
But he did not stay in Nablus, rather he went and settled in the city of Kfar Nahum, near the Sea of Galilee, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphthalim.
This happened so that what God said through the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:
The land of Zebulun and Naphtali, by the way of the sea, across the river, the land of Galilee, where the strangers dwell.
The people dwelling in darkness saw a great light; those sitting upon the earth of death's shadows saw light.
From that time on, Jesus began to teach and say: "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near." Jesus chose some disciples.
While Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon, who was also called Peter, and Andrew, casting a net into the sea; they were fishermen.
He said to them: "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
Then they closed their windows and followed him.
Then Jesus departed from there and saw two other brothers, Jacob son of Zebedee and his brother John. He saw them in the boat with their father Zebedee repairing the nets for fishing, and called them.
They left the boat and went ashore, following him. Jesus knows and heals.
And Jesus traveled throughout every region of Galilee, teaching people in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom of God. And He healed every disease and affliction among people.
And news of him spread throughout all parts of Syria, so that they brought to him all the sick with various diseases and pains, the possessed by evil spirits, the epileptics, and the paralyzed, and Jesus healed them.
And large crowds followed him, coming from the Galilean region, from the ten cities, from Jerusalem, from the Judaean region, and from the eastern bank of the Jordan River.
Teaching of Jesus
And when Jesus saw the crowd, he went up onto a hill and sat down. Then his disciples came to him,
And he began to speak and teach them and said:
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
O joy to the believers, for God will strengthen them.
Blessed are the humble, for they shall inherit the earth. #Inherit the earth. 5:5 See Psalm 37:11. Here it may mean a future spiritual inheritance.
Blessed are the hungry and the thirsty for the kingdom of God, #to do God's will. 6:5 Literally: "Blessed are the hungry." Because God will satisfy them.
O joy to the merciful, for Allah will show them mercy.
O believers, rejoice, for they will see God.
Hallelujah to those working for peace, for they are calling the children of God.
Blessed are the persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for the kingdom of heaven is theirs.
"Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and falsely accuse you of committing evil, because you are righteous."
Rejoice and be glad, for your rewards will be great in heaven. For they treated the prophets who lived before you in the same way. Salt and light
"You are salt for all people. But if salt loses its flavor, what do we do with it to make it good again? It is no longer fit for anything except to be cast outside the house, where feet may tread upon it."
"You are the light of the world. It is impossible to hide a city built on a mountain,"
People do not light a lamp and place it under a vessel! Rather, they place it on a stand so that it can illuminate everyone in the house.
In this way also, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works and praise your Father in heaven." Jesus and the Law of Moses
Do not think that I have come to abolish the law of Moses or the teachings of the prophets. I have not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them.
I tell you the truth: until the heavens and the earth disappear, not a single letter or dot of the Law will vanish, until everything written in it is fulfilled.
Therefore, he who breaks the smallest of these commandments and teaches people to do the same will be considered the least in the kingdom of heaven. But he who observes these commandments and teaches others to observe them will be considered the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
For I tell you that unless you increase your obedience to God over the obedience of the scholars of the law and the Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. Anger
You know that it was said to your fathers: "Do not kill. #Do not kill. 21:5 From the Book of Exodus 20:13 and the Book of Deuteronomy 5:17. Whoever kills deserves judgment."
As for me, I say to you that whoever is angry with another person deserves to be tried, and whoever insults another person should stand before the judicial council. And anyone who says to another person, "You fool!" deserves hell.
Therefore, if you are offering a sacrifice at the altar, and then you remember that someone else has something against you,
Leave your offering there in front of the altar, go and first make peace with that person, then return and present your offering.
Salem, get rid of him quickly as you walk with him to court. Otherwise, he will hand you over to the judge, and the judge will hand you over to the jailer, who will send you to prison.
I tell you the truth, you will not leave until the last of your sins is sealed. Adultery
"We heard that it was said: 'Do not weigh.' #Do not weigh. 27:5 From the Book of Exodus 20:14, and the Book of Deuteronomy 5:18."
As for me, I say to you: whoever looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
Therefore, if your right eye causes you to commit sin, pluck it out and cast it far from you. It is better to lose one member of your body than to have your entire body cast into hell.
And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and cast it far from you. It is better to lose one member of your body than to have your entire body cast into hell. Divorce
It was also said: "If a man divorces his wife, let him give her a document to prove it." #If a man divorces ... that. 31:5 From the Book of Deuteronomy 24:1.
As for me, I say to you that whoever divorces his wife except for immorality, does so to lead her into immorality. And whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. Oath.
"We heard that it was also said to your fathers: 'Do not swear by falsehood, but fulfill what you have sworn to do for the Lord.' #Do not make vows... for the Lord. 33:5 See Leviticus 19:12, Numbers 30:2, and Deuteronomy 23:21."
As for me, I say to you: never swear at all.
Do not swear by the heavens, for they are Allah's throne, nor by the earth, for it is beneath his feet, #beneath his feet. 35:5 meaning "under his authority." Nor by the city of Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King.
Do not claim your hair, because you cannot make a strand of it black or white.
Say, "Yes," if you intend to say "Yes," and say, "No," if you intend to say "No." All that goes beyond this is evil. #Evil. 37:5 The Devil. Resistance to evil
"We heard that it was said: 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.' #An eye... for a tooth. 38:5 from the Book of Exodus 21:24, and the Book of Leviticus 24:20."
As for me, I say: do not resist evil. But if someone strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the left also.
And if anyone wants to accuse you to take your shirt, let him also take your coat.
And if anyone compels you to walk with him one mile, walk with him two miles.
And if anyone asks you for something, give it to him. Do not refuse to lend to anyone who asks you for a loan. Love for all.
"We heard that it was said: 'Love your friend, and hate your enemy.' #Love... your enemy. 43:5 From the book of Leviticus 19:18."
As for me, I say to you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.
Thus you will become children of your father who is in heaven. For God causes the sun to rise upon the sinners and the righteous, and sends rain upon the pious and the wicked.
If you only love those who love you, what reward do you deserve? Shouldn't tax collectors do the same?
And if you only cherish your brothers, what sets you apart from others? Do they not also commit such acts as worshipping idols?
Therefore, be complete as your heavenly Father is complete.
The gift
"Be careful not to give your alms in front of people expecting them to be praised; otherwise, your Father in heaven will not reward you."
When you give to the needy, do not announce it as if you were blowing a horn like the hypocrites do in gatherings and streets, seeking people's praise. I tell you the truth, they have received their full reward for that.
But when giving to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand does.
So that your offering may be made in secret. And your father, who sees what happens in secret, will reward you. Prayer
"And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray in assemblies and corners of streets so that people may see them. I tell you the truth, they have already received their full reward for that."
But when you pray, go into your room and close the door, and pray to your father in secret. And your father who sees what happens in secret will reward you.
And when you pray, do not recite words without understanding, as do the worshippers of idols, who think that their prayers will be accepted because of the volume of their speech.
Therefore, do not be like them, because your fathers know what you need even before you ask them for it.
Therefore, pray as follows: "Our Father who is in heaven, hallowed be your name,"
Let your kingdom come, and let your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Today we were given bread to fill our day.
And forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us.
Do not let us enter into trial, but deliver us from the evil one. #TheEvilOne. 13:6 The Devil (Iblis). For you have the kingdom and power and glory, forever and ever. Amen.
For if you forgive the people's sins, your heavenly father will also forgive you.
But if you do not forgive others their sins, neither will your father forgive your sins. Fasting
"And when you fast, do not become like the hypocrites who display sorrow on their faces. Indeed, they change their countenances so that people will clearly see that they are fasting. I tell you the truth, they have already received their full reward."
But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face.
So that people won't notice you are fasting. Your father, whom you don't see, will see this. Then your father, who sees what happens in secret, will reward you. God, not money.
Do not store your treasures on earth, where rust and mold will destroy them, and where thieves may break in and steal them.
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither rust nor corrosion spoils them, nor can thieves enter to steal them.
Because your heart will be where your treasure is.
"The soul of the body is the eye. If your eyes are pure, then your entire body will be filled with light."
But if your eyes are evil, your body will also be filled with darkness. If the light within you is truly darkness, how can the darkness within you be any different?
No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate one and love the other, or he will hold fast to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth. #Wealth. 24:6 Literally, "Mamonah." This is an Aramaic word meaning "wealth," in its negative sense, representing here a god people serve instead of God. The kingdom of God comes first.
Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your livelihood, that is, about what you will eat or drink. Nor do not worry about your body, that is, about what you will wear. For life is more important than food, and the body is more important than clothing.
Look at the birds; they do not sow or reap, nor do they store grain in granaries, yet your Lord provides for them. Are you not far more valuable in the sight of God than the birds?
Who among you can add a minute to his life when he worries?
"And why are you worried about what you will wear? Look at how field flowers grow. They don't tire nor do they spin."
But I say to you, not even one of them has been like one of them, nor even Solomon in all his glory.
If Allah were to wear the grass of the fields that you see here today and throw it into the oven tomorrow, would He not care for you more than that, O people of little faith?
Therefore, do not be worried nor ask yourselves: "What shall we eat?" or "What shall we drink?" or "What shall we wear?"
These are things others in the world are striving for, and your heavenly father knows that you need all of them.
But attend first to the kingdom of God and to righteousness, and all these things will also be given to you.
Do not worry about tomorrow, for each day has enough worries of its own, and tomorrow will have its own concerns.
Judging others
Do not judge others, lest God judge you.
For he will judge you according to the way you judge others. And as you measure out to others, so will others measure out to you.
"Why do you see the straw in your brother's eye, but do not notice the large piece of wood in your own eye?"
How can you tell your friend: "Let me pull out the straw from your eye, and there's a large piece of wood in your eye?"
O hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will be able to clearly see how to remove the speck from your brother's eye.
"Do not give what is sacred to dogs, nor throw your treasures in front of pigs! Pigs will trample them with their feet, and dogs will turn to you and tear you apart. Persist in your demand"
Ask and it will be given to you, seek and you will find, knock and the door will be opened for you.
For whoever asks shall receive, and whoever seeks shall find, and to whoever knocks, the door shall be opened for him.
Of you, if a son asks for a loaf of bread, will you give him a stone?
Or if he asks for a fish, will you give him one?
You, despite your own shortcomings, know how to give your children good gifts. Isn't the Father in heaven much more qualified to give good gifts to those who ask Him? The Golden Rule
"Treat others as you would like to be treated. This is the essence of Moses' law and the teachings of the prophets. The path of heaven and the path of hell."
"Enter through the narrow gate that leads to heaven, for the gate leading to destruction is wide, and the road to it is easy, and many enter it."
The gate leading to life is very narrow, and the path to it is full of difficulties; only a few find this way. Warning against false teachings
Beware of the false prophets who come to you in the form of mythical beasts and fables, but within them are fierce wolves.
You will know them by their deeds. No one gathers grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles!
Similarly, every healthy tree bears a healthy fruit, and every unhealthy tree bears an unhealthy fruit.
A healthy tree cannot produce a bad fruit, nor can a bad tree produce good fruit.
And every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
Thus, you will know the false prophets by their fruits.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father who is in heaven.
Many will say to me on that last day: "O Lord, O Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name? Did we not drive out evil spirits in Your name? Did we not perform many miracles in Your name?"
At that time I will say to them plainly: I have never known you. Depart from me, you doers of evil. The wise man and the fool
"Everyone who listens to my teachings and puts them into practice is like a wise man who builds his house on rock."
Rain fell, floods rose, the wind blew and struck that house, but it did not collapse, because its foundation was on rock.
And whoever hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who builds his house on sand.
Then it rained, the floodwaters rose, the wind blew and struck that house, and it collapsed in a terrible fall!
And when Jesus finished this teaching, the people were amazed at his teaching.
Because he taught them by authority, not like my teachers of the law.
Jesus heals the leper
Then Jesus descended from the mountain, and many followed him.
A man came to him, prostrated before him, and said: "O Lord, you are able to make me pure, if you wish."
And Jesus stretched out His hand and touched him, and said, "I will; be made clean." And immediately he was cleansed.
Then Jesus said to him, "Do not tell anyone what happened to you, but go and present yourself to the priest, #go... to the priest. 4:8 The priest was the one who, according to the Law, decided when leprosy was considered clean. He will present the offering Moses commanded, so that people will know you have been healed." Roman officer of faith
And Jesus entered the city of Capernaum, and a Roman officer came to him. #Roman officer. 5:8 Literally "commander of a hundred." Repeated in the numbers 8, 13.
He said: "O master, my servant is very ill and lying in bed at home. He is motionless and suffering from severe pain."
Then Jesus said to him, "I will go and heal him."
Then the officer replied: "O sir, I do not deserve for you to enter my home; all you need to do is say a word and my servant will be healed."
And I myself am a man under authority, and I have soldiers who act according to my commands. I tell one soldier: "Go!" and he goes. I tell another: "Come!" and he comes. I tell my servant: "Do this!" and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those who were following him: "Truly I tell you, I have never found such faith even among the children of Israel."
I tell you that many will come from the east and west, and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
As for those who were meant to inherit the kingdom, they will go into darkness outside. There, people will weep and gnash their teeth!
Then Jesus said to the officer, "Go, and let it be as you believed." At that very moment the officer's servant was healed. "Bear our diseases"
And when Jesus came to Peter's house, he saw Peter's wife lying on the bed, with a high fever.
And Jesus took her hand, and the fever left her; she rose and began to serve him.
That evening, people brought to him many individuals possessed by evil spirits; he expelled the spirits at his command, and healed all the sick.
This happened so that what God said through the Prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled: "He took our infirmities and bore our diseases." – Jesus
And seeing a large crowd around Him, Jesus commanded His disciples to go across the lake to the other side.
A student of his jurisprudence came to him and said to him: "O teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Then Jesus said to him, "The foxes have their dens, and the birds of the sky their nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
Another of his disciples said to him: "O Lord, allow me to wait until I bury my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their dead." Jesus calms the storm
And Jesus took the boat and entered it, and his disciples followed him.
Then a violent storm arose in the lake, and the boat was being swallowed by the waves. Jesus was asleep.
They approached him and woke him up, saying: "O Lord, we have reached our limit; indeed, we are drowning."
Then Jesus said to them, "Why are you afraid, you of little faith?" And he got up and commanded the wind and the sea; and there was an overwhelming silence.
But they were amazed and said, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the sea obey him!" Jesus casts out demons from two men.
Then Jesus went to the region of the Gerasenes, on the other side of the lake. Two men from the tombs came to Him, possessed by unclean spirits. The two men were dangerous, so no one dared to pass that way.
The evil spirits screamed: "What do you want from us, son of God? Have you come here to torture us before the designated time?"
There was a large herd of pigs being herded at a distance from them.
The evil spirits approached him and said: "If you expel us, we will send ourselves to the pig herd."
Then Jesus said to them, "Go!" And the unclean spirits left the two men and entered the pigs. At that moment, the entire herd rushed down from the hilltop into the lake, and the pigs sank into the water.
The shepherds fled to the town and told the people what had happened to the possessed people with evil spirits.
All the people of the town came out to see Jesus. When they saw him, they asked him to leave their area.
Jesus heals a paralytic
Then Jesus got into a boat and crossed to the other side of the lake; and he arrived at his town.
So some people brought to him a paralyzed man lying on his bed. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
Some of my Sharia scholars say: "This man disrespects God with his words."
Jesus knew what they were thinking, and said to them: "Why do evil thoughts dwell in your hearts?"
Which is easier: to say "your sins are forgiven," or to say "get up and walk"?
But I will show you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. And He said to the paralytic man, "Arise, take up your mat and go to your house!"
He rose and went to his house.
And when people saw this, they were filled with fear, and they praised God for having given such power to people. When will Jesus follow?
While Jesus was walking, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at a tax collector's booth. Jesus said to him, "Follow me," and he got up and followed him.
While Jesus was eating in the house of Matthew, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with him and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said: "The healthy do not need a physician, but the sick."
Go then and understand what the Book means when it says: "I desire mercy for people, not animal sacrifices." #I desire... animal sacrifices. 13:9 From the Book of Hosea 6:6. "I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners." Question on Fasting
Then John's disciples came near him and asked: "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?"
Then Jesus said to them: "How can Noah be a guest of the bridegroom, and the bridegroom among them? But a day will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
No one patches an old garment with a piece of new cloth, because the new cloth will shrink and tear the old garment, making the hole worse.
People do not put new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst, the wine will spill, and the skins will be ruined. Therefore, new wine is placed in new wineskins, so that both the wine and the skins may be preserved. Jesus raises a dead girl and heals a woman with a flow of blood.
As Jesus was speaking, a man from the council came to him and bowed down before him, saying, "My daughter has died; but come, lay your hand on her, and she will live."
Then Jesus rose and went with the leader of the assembly, and his disciples followed him.
There was a woman who had suffered from severe bleeding for twelve years. She came behind Jesus and touched the edge of his cloak.
She said within herself: "Only if I touch her cloak, will I be healed."
Then Jesus turned around and saw her, and said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you." And at that moment the woman was completely healed.
And when Jesus arrived at the house of the leader of the synagogue, he saw people singing dirges and the crowd in disorder.
He said: "Go out. The child is not dead, but asleep." They laughed at him.
And when people were leaving the house, Jesus went into the room of the young girls and took hold of her hand, and she rose up.
News of Jesus spread throughout that entire region. Jesus heals two blind men // and expels a demon.
And after Jesus had left that place, two blind men followed him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David."
And when Jesus entered the house, the blind came to Him. He said to them, "Do you believe that I can heal you?" And they answered, "Yes, Lord."
At that time they looked at each other and said: "Let it be as you have believed."
And the blind regained their sight. Then Jesus warned them severely and said: "Do not tell anyone what happened to you."
But both of them went and spread the news throughout that area.
As they were leaving, some people brought to Jesus a man possessed by unclean spirits.
Then Jesus cast out the evil spirit, and the demon began to speak. The people were amazed and said: "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel before."
But the Pharisees began to say: "He drives out demons powerfully by Beelzebul, #Beelzebul. 34:9 From the names of the devil. The head of those demons." The harvest is abundant.
And Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom. He healed every disease and every affliction among people.
And when Jesus saw the crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples: "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few."
Divide for the Lord of harvest that He sends two harvests to the harvest.
Jesus sends his disciples
And Jesus called His twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to drive them out and to heal all diseases and afflictions.
These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon, also called Peter, and his brother Andrew, Jacob son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
Philips and Berthelmaus, Thomas and Matthew, collectors of taxes, Jacob son of Chalfe and Tadaws,
Simeon, also called "The Zealot," #The Zealot. 4:10 From a Jewish political party resisting Roman rule, known as "The Zealots." Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus.
And Jesus sent these twelve and gave them this instruction: "Do not go into a foreign region, nor enter a Samaritan city,"
But go to the calf of the deceitful children of Israel,
And declare that the kingdom of heaven is near.
Heal the sick, raise the dead, heal lepers, expel evil spirits. You took the power to do this for free, and you gave it to others for free as well.
Do not carry with you in your bags gold, silver, or copper money.
Do not bring any extra bag, extra garment, extra shoe, or walking stick. The employee deserves his meal.
And when you enter any city or village, seek out someone worthy of receiving you, and stay with him until you leave the city.
And when you enter a house, you should greet its inhabitants.
If the family of the House are deserving, then your peace will come upon them. But if they are not deserving, then your peace will return to you.
If anyone does not receive you in a house or in a city, and does not listen to your message, then go away from that house or that city, and shake the dust from your feet.
I tell you the truth, on the Day of Judgment, the fate of the people of Sodom and Gomorrah will be worse than that of that city. Jesus warns of narrow places.
"Behold, I send you forth like sheep among wolves. Be wise as serpents, and innocent as doves."
Beware of people, for they will deliver you over to their courts to be tried and flogged in their courts.
And you will be delivered over to rulers and kings for your testimony, for you are My witnesses. This will be your opportunity to bear witness on my behalf to the Jews and to the Gentiles.
And when they seize you, do not worry about what you will say, because you will give the appropriate words at that time.
Remember that it is not you who will speak, but the Spirit of your father who will speak through you.
The elder brother will deliver his younger brother to be killed, and the father will deliver his son. The children will turn against their parents and kill them.
And I will cause all of you to suffer because of my name, but whoever remains faithful until the end—this one will be saved.
And when they persecute you in one city, flee to another city. I tell you the truth, you will not cease going from city to city throughout Israel until the Son of Man comes a second time.
No student is better than his teacher, and no servant is greater than his master.
Let the student imitate his teacher, and let the servant imitate his master. If they call the head of the household "Baalzephon," #Baalzephon, 25:10, a name of the devil, referring to Matthew 9:34. Then what will they call the other members of the household? Fear of God, not fear of men.
"Do not fear them, for nothing hidden will remain concealed, and nothing concealed will remain hidden."
Whatever I say to you in the darkness, say it in the light; and whatever I whisper in the ears, proclaim it from the rooftops.
"Do not fear those who kill the body, for they are unable to kill the soul; but fear rather that One who is able to destroy both body and soul in Hell."
"Isn't a pair of birds sold for one dinar? Yet neither of them will fall to the ground except by permission from your Father."
As for you, even the entire hair on your heads is counted.
If you do not fear, you are more valuable than many birds. Acknowledging Christ before people
"Everyone who acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven."
And whoever disbelieves in me before men, I will disbelieve in him before my Father who is in heaven. Christ first
"Do not think I have come to establish peace on earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword!"
It was said: "A man inherits from his father, a woman from her mother, and a child from his grandmother."
Then man's enemies are his own family!
Because anyone who loves his father and mother more than me does not deserve to be among mine. Anyone who loves his son or daughter more than me does not deserve to be among mine.
And he who does not take my sword and follow me is not worthy of me.
He who tries to win his life will lose it; but he who loses his life for me will win it.
"He who welcomes you welcomes me, and he who welcomes me welcomes him who sent me."
He who receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a reward as a prophet. He who receives a righteous person because he is righteous will receive a reward as a righteous person.
And whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of my humble disciples, because he is my disciple, truly I tell you, he will by no means be deprived of his reward.»
John the Baptist and Jesus
And when Jesus had finished teaching his twelve disciples, he left that place and went to teach and proclaim his message in the region of Galilee. Jesus and John the Baptist
While John the Baptist was in prison, he heard about all that Christ was doing, and sent a message along with some of his disciples.
And he asked him: "Are you the one we are waiting for, or should we be waiting for another?"
And Jesus answered them and said: "Go and tell John what you have heard and seen:"
Behold, the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor hear the gospel.
And rejoice for those who do not hesitate in believing in me.
And as John's disciples had left that place, Jesus began to speak to the people about John, saying: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?"
Why did you leave? To see a man wearing soft clothes? Those who wear soft clothes live in royal palaces.
Why did you leave then? To see a prophet? He is one. Indeed, I say to you that you have seen someone greater than a prophet!
This is what was written about him: «Behold, I send my messenger before you to prepare the way for you.»
I say to you truthfully, no one born of women is greater than John the Baptist. Yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the time of John the Baptist until now, the Kingdom has faced violent attacks, and the powerful are attempting to take it by force.
Because the law of Moses and all the prophets foretold until the time of John.
If you wish to accept what the prophets and the religion teach, John is Elijah whom they prophesied would come. #Elijah … his coming. 14:11 Elijah was one of God's prophets around 850 B.C. The Jews expected his coming based on Malachi 4:5-6.
He who has two ears, let him hear.
"What does this generation resemble? It resembles children sitting in markets, calling out to their friends and saying:"
‹We have given you music, yet you did not dance. We have sung you funeral songs, yet you did not weep!›
John came, who did not eat like the others and did not drink wine like the others, and people said about him: "He has a bad spirit."
Then came the Son of Man who eats and drinks wine like the others, and people said about him: "Look at this man! He is a drunkard and a glutton, and he is a friend of tax collectors and sinners!" But the fruits of wisdom are what prove that it is true wisdom." Jesus warns the wrong cities
Then Jesus began to rebuke the cities where He had performed most of His miracles, because their inhabitants had not repented of their sins.
He said: "Woe to you, O Korzun! Woe to you, O Beit Saida! For if the miracles that occurred in you both in Phero and Saida had taken place, you would have repented long ago, and the inhabitants would have worn straw, sitting upon ashes."
But I tell you that the condition of the people of Sura and Sidra will be easier than yours on the Day of Judgment.
And you, O Kafir Nuh, do you think that you will be raised up to heaven? No, rather you will be cast down into the abyss! If the miracles that occurred to you had occurred to Sodom, it would still be with us today.
But I tell you this: the condition of the people of Sodom will be more likely than that of your family on the day of judgment. Jesus is the source of peace.
At that time, Jesus spoke and said: "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and the learned, and revealed them to the simple, like children."
Yes, father, because you are pleased with this work.
"The Father has given me everything. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son, and to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him."
Come here, O weary ones, and O those bearing heavy burdens, I will give you relief.
Carry the staff #Neri. 29:11 The staff is a wooden implement placed on animals to help them carry heavy loads; it is a Jewish symbol of the Law. Take it, and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble of heart, so that you may find peace in your souls.
For the burden I give you is light, and the yoke I place upon you is easy.
Jesus: Lord, the Sabbath
At that time, Jesus went out to walk in the fields on one of the days of the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry, and they began to pick the sheaves of grain and eat them.
But when the Pharisees saw this, they said to him: "Behold, your disciples are doing what is not permitted on the Sabbath."
Then Jesus said to them, "Did you not read in the Book what David did when he was hungry and so was his companions?"
He entered the house of God and ate from the bread offered to God, although it is not permitted for him or for anyone with him to eat this bread, but only the priests are allowed to do so.
Did you not read, in the law of Moses, how the priests on the Sabbath day do not observe the laws concerning the Sabbath? Yet they are not held accountable for this action?
But I tell you that there is something greater than this structure here.
If you knew what the Book meant when it says: "I desire mercy for people, not animal sacrifices." #I desire... animal sacrifices. 7:12 From the Book of Hosea 6:6. When you judged those the innocent.
For the son of man is the Lord of Saturday.» Healing on Saturday
Then he left that place and went to their gathering.
There was a man with a disabled hand. The people asked Jesus, "Is it permitted by the Law to heal this man's hand on the Sabbath?" They asked Him this so that they might have a basis to complain against Him.
He said to them: "Suppose one of you has a goat that falls into a pit on Saturday—would he not take it out and rescue it?"
And man is more important than the ox. If one does good on Saturday, it conforms to the religion.
Then Jesus said to the man with the withered hand, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out, and it was restored completely, just as the other.
The Pharisees went out and began to plot how to kill Jesus. Jesus said: "The Chosen Servant of God."
Jesus knew their plan, and left that place. A large crowd followed him, and he healed them all.
And he ordered them not to reveal who he was.
This happened so that what God said through the Prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:
Behold, the servant whom I have chosen, my beloved in whom I have delighted; I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations.
No one will challenge him, no one will shout, and no one will hear his voice in their streets.
It will not be broken even by the curved bastion, nor extinguished even by the smoldering fuse. It will continue until justice prevails.
And all nations will place their hope in it.» Sultan Jesus
Then they brought to him a man who was blind and deaf, because he was possessed by a bad spirit, and healed him. And the deaf man began to speak and see.
They said, "Could this man be the son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said: "This man casts out demons with the power of Belzobob #Belzobob. 24:12 From the names of the devil. Also in number 27. Head of the evil spirits."
And since Jesus knew their thoughts, He said to them: "The fate of every kingdom is that its people will be divided and fight among themselves, leading to destruction. Likewise, every city or house that is at war with its people will not last."
If the devil drives out spirits and fights against himself, how can his kingdom stand?
If I drive out evil spirits with the strength of El-Zubul, why do your disciples drive them out? They are the ones who rule over you.
But if you drive out evil spirits by the Spirit of God, it has become clear that the kingdom of God has come to you.
How can someone enter the house of a strong man and plunder his possessions, except if the strong man first ties himself up? Only then would he be able to plunder his own house.
"He who is not with me is against me. And he who does not gather with me scatters."
Therefore I say to you: every sin and offense can be forgiven people, but an offense against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
He who speaks against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but he who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven—neither in this world nor in the world to come. The fruit reveals the truth.
"To get a good harvest, plant a good tree. A bad tree yields a bad harvest, because a tree is known by its fruit."
O children of vipers, how can you speak good things and yet be evil? For the mouth speaks what the heart contains.
The righteous person draws forth what is good from his good treasure, while the wicked person draws forth what is evil from the evil stored within him.
But I tell you that on the Day of Judgment, people will be questioned about every word they uttered.
Your words will either exonerate or convict you." Jewish leaders demand evidence
Then some of my Sharia scholars and Frezis asked him and said: "O teacher, we wish to see from you a miraculous sign."
And they replied: "This corrupt, wicked generation seeks a sign so that they may believe. And a sign will be given only for the Prophet Jonah."
As Jonah remained three days and three nights in the large fish's belly, so will the Son of Man remain three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
The people of Nineveh on the Day of Judgment will stand against this generation and condemn them, for they repented when they heard Jonah's warning. Now here before you is someone greater than Jonah.
And the Queen of the South will stand, #QueenOfTheSouth. 42:12 The Queen of Sheba. She traveled nearly two thousand kilometers so that she might hear God's wisdom spoken at the mouth of King Solomon. See 1 Kings 10:1-13. On the Day of Judgment, she will confront this generation and will be taught. She came from the farthest corners of the earth to hear Solomon's wisdom. Now here before you is someone greater than Solomon. The empty soul
When an impure spirit leaves a human being, it passes through dry places, seeking a place of rest, but finds none,
At that moment he says: "I will return to my home from which I came." He goes back and finds the house empty, swept, and neatly arranged.
At that time he goes away and brings with him seven evil spirits worse than himself, and they enter and dwell there. Thus the condition of that last person becomes worse than his original condition. So it will be with this present evil generation. The disciples of Jesus are his family.
While Jesus was speaking to the crowd, his mother and brothers came and stood outside, asking that he speak to them.
One of the people said to Jesus: "Your mother and brothers are standing outside and want to speak to you."
Then Jesus answered him: "Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?"
Then, pointing to his students, he said: "These are my mother and my siblings,"
Because the one who acts according to my father's will, who is in heaven, is my brother, my sister, and my mother.
Like seeds
On that day, Jesus left the house and sat by the lake shore.
A large crowd gathered around him. He climbed onto a boat and sat in it, while the people stood on the shore.
He told them many things using parables. Then he said to them: "A farmer went out to sow."
While he was sowing, some of the seeds fell by the roadside, and birds came and ate them.
Some grains were sown on rocky land, where there was no sufficient soil, so the grains grew quickly because the soil was not deep.
But when the sun rose, it burned, and since it had no roots, it withered.
And some seeds took root in the thorns. Thus the thorns grew and choked the growth.
And other seeds fell on good soil, and some of them yielded a hundredfold, some sixtyfold, and some thirtyfold.
He who has two ears, let him listen.» Hearing and Understanding
The disciples came to him and asked him: "Why do you speak to them in metaphors?"
Then Jesus replied to them: "God has given you the privilege of knowing the secret of the kingdom of heaven, but He has not given it to them."
Because whoever possesses #has possession. 12:13 Perhaps the intended meaning is "whoever possesses understanding." He will increase in it and overflow with it, but whoever does not possess it will lose what he has.
For this I speak to them in parables, for though they see, they do not perceive; though they hear, they do not understand.
Thus they will fulfill the prophecy of Isaiah: "You will hear and you will hear, yet you will not understand. You will see and you will see, yet you will not perceive."
The mind of this people has grown dull, and their hearing heavy. They have closed their eyes, so that they cannot see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, nor understand with their hearts, lest they return to the one who will heal them.
As for you, be glad in your eyes because they see, and in your ears because they hear.
I tell you the truth, many kings and prophets longed to see what you see and did not see, and to hear what you hear and did not hear. The meaning of the parable of the sower
"Then listen to the explanation of a seed like this:"
When a person hears the message of the Kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes #the evil one. 19:13 That is, the devil. (Also in number 38) And he takes the seeds that were sown in his heart. This is the meaning of the seeds that fell by the wayside.
As for those who fell on rocky ground, they are like people who hear the word and immediately accept it with joy,
But since he has no roots within himself, he can only stand for a short time, and when difficulties and persecution arise due to the previous words, he quickly loses his faith.
As for those that fell among the thorns, they resemble those who hear the word, but the worries of life and the allure of wealth choke the word, so it bears no fruit.
"He who sows on good land is he who hears the word, understands it, and brings it to action. He reaps a hundredfold, sixtyfold, and thirtyfold." Like wheat and weeds.
For example, he said to them: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seeds in his field."
But while people were asleep, the man's enemy came and sowed harmful weeds among the wheat, then left.
And when wheat germinated and formed ears, noxious weeds also grew.
His servants came to him and said to him: "O Lord, did you not sow good seeds in your field? Then from where have these harmful weeds come?"
Then the man replied: "I did that." He then asked his servants: "Do you want us to go and cut it off?"
The man replied: "No, because when you uproot the harmful weeds, you might also uproot the wheat along with them."
Let them grow together until harvest time; then I will say to the harvesters: 'Collect the harmful plants first and bundle them for burning. As for the wheat, gather it and store it in my granaries.' For example, datura and yeast.
Then Jesus said to them a further parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field."
It is the smallest seed. But when it grows, it becomes the largest garden plant, growing into a large tree, even attracting sky birds that build their nests in its branches.
For example, He said to them: "The kingdom of heaven is like leaven taken by a woman and mixed in three measures of flour, until the whole lump had leavened."
Jesus said all these things using parables. And He never spoke to people except in parables.
This is what God said through the Prophet: "I will open my mouth with examples, and speak about hidden matters since the creation of the world."
Then Jesus sent the crowd away and entered the house. His disciples came to him and said: "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
He said to them: "The one who sowed good seeds is the son of man,"
The field is the world, and the good seeds are those who have the kingdom. As for the harmful weeds, they are those who belong to evil.
The enemy who sowed them is Iblis. The harvest is the end of the world. The harvesters are the angels.
As harmful herbs gather and burn in fire, so too will be the end of the world.
Then the Son of Man will send his angels, who will gather from his kingdom all the wicked and the evil.
Then they throw them into the burning oven. There people weep and clamp their teeth.
At that time the pious will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear. For example, the treasure and the pearl
The kingdom of heaven is like a hidden treasure in a field. A man found it and buried it again. Overcome by joy, he went and sold everything he had to buy that field.
And the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking beautiful jewels.
And when he found a very valuable pearl, he went and sold everything he owned to buy it. Like a fishing net
And the kingdom of heaven is like a net cast into the sea, and it caught different kinds of fish.
When the net was full, the fishers pulled it ashore. Then they sat down and selected the good fish, placing them in baskets, while the poor ones they threw back out.
This is what will happen at the end of the world, when the angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous.
Then the wicked are cast into the burning furnace. There people weep and clutch their teeth.
And Jesus asked his disciples, "Do you understand all these things?" They replied, "Yes."
He said to them: "Therefore every teacher of the law learns about the kingdom of heaven, just as a master of a house takes out new things and old things from his storehouse." Jesus goes to his hometown
And when Jesus had finished telling those parables, He left that place.
And when he went to his hometown, he began to teach in their assembly. Everyone was amazed and said: "Where did this man come from with such wisdom and miracles?"
Is he not the son of the carpenter? Is not his mother Mary? Are not his brothers Jacob, Joseph, Simon, and Judah?
Didn't all his sisters come among us? From where did he acquire everything he has?
That was an obstacle preventing them from accepting it. But Jesus said to them: "A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and among his own people!"
He did not perform many miracles there due to their disbelief.
Herod hears about Jesus
At that time, Herod, the governor of Galilee, 1:14 literally "the governor of the quarter." The Romans had divided Palestine into four provinces, so the ruler of each province was called the governor of the quarter or the governor of the fourth. See Luke 3:1. about Jesus.
He said to his attendants: "John the Baptist has risen from the dead, and through him miracles are taking place!" The murder of John the Baptist
Herod is the one who arrested John and put him in prison, because of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.
For John said to Herod: "You have no right to take your brother's wife."
For this reason Herod wanted to kill him, but he was afraid of the people, because they considered John to be a prophet.
But when the day of Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before him and before his guests, and greatly pleased Herod.
Even so, he promised and swore that he would give her whatever she asked for, no matter what.
But her mother had already taught her what was needed, and she said: "Give me John the Baptist's head here on a plate."
The king was grieved, but he ordered her request to be granted due to his oath and as a sign of respect to his guests.
So he sent someone to cut off John's head from prison.
Then he brought his head on a plate and gave it to her, and gave it to her mother.
At that time, John's disciples came and took his body and buried him. Then they went and told Jesus what had happened. Jesus fed more than five thousand.
And when Jesus heard this, he got into a boat and went off to a desolate place. The crowd realized this, and they came out of their towns on foot to follow him.
And when he came down to the shore, he saw a large crowd, and he showed them compassion, healing the sick among them.
In the evening, his disciples came to him and said: "This place is isolated and it is already very late; send the people away to the villages so they can buy food for themselves."
But Jesus said to them: "Let them go; give them something to eat yourselves."
His disciples said to him, "Here we have nothing but five loaves of bread and two fish."
Then Jesus said to them, "Bring her here."
He told the people to sit down on the grass. Then Jesus took the five loaves and two fish, gave thanks, lifting his eyes toward heaven, and broke them, giving the pieces to his disciples, who distributed them to the people.
So they ate and were filled. They gathered up what was left, and it amounted to twelve baskets full of fragments.
And the number who ate was five thousand men, excluding women and children. Jesus walks on the water
Then Jesus asked his disciples to get into the boat and go ahead to the other side, while he sent the crowd away.
After sending them away, he went up to the mountain alone to pray. And when evening came, he was alone.
The boat had reached the center of the lake, and the waves were hitting it strongly, because the wind was blowing in the opposite direction to the boat's movement.
A little before dawn, Jesus came to them walking on the lake.
When his disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified and said, "It is a ghost!" and they cried out in fear.
Jesus said to them immediately, "Be courageous, I am here, do not be afraid."
And Peter answered him, "Lord, if you are indeed the one, command me to come to you on the water."
He said to him, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Peter noticed the strong wind, he feared and began to sink, and cried out: "Lord, save me."
And immediately Jesus laid his hand on him and took him, saying to him, "You of little faith, why did you doubt?"
And when Jesus and Peter got into the boat, the wind ceased.
And those who were in the boat bowed down to Jesus and said: "You are the Son of God, truly." Jesus healed many.
And when they crossed the lake, they arrived at the area of Jenisart.
And since the people of that area knew Jesus, they proclaimed His coming throughout the surrounding region, and brought all the sick to Him.
And they appealed to him, asking him to allow them to touch only the edge of his garment. And all those who touched him were healed.
God's Sharia and people's customs
At that time some Pharisees and teachers of the law from Jerusalem came to Jesus and asked him:
"Why do your students break the traditions we inherited from our ancestors? They don't wash their hands before eating."
Then Jesus answered them: "Why do you break down God's commandment because of your traditions?"
And God commanded and said: "Honor your father and your mother," #Honor... your mother. 4:15 Exodus 20:12, Deuteronomy 5:16. He also said: "Whoever insults his father or mother shall be put to death." #Whoever insults... shall be put to death. 4:15 Exodus 21:17.
But you say: "Who said to his father or mother: 'I cannot help you, because everything I have has already been given to God. He is not obligated to honor his father or mother.'"
Thus, you have ignored God's command due to your traditions.
O the hypocrites, verify Isaiah's prophecy about you, who said:
This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
Their worship is useless, because they know that what they are taught is nothing but human commands.
And Jesus called the people to Him and said to them: "Listen to me and understand what I say:"
What enters the human mouth is not what he cleanses, but what comes out of it; this is what he cleanses.
At that time the disciples came to him and said: "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard you speak?"
Then Jesus answered: "Every plant that my Father did not sow will wither from its roots."
Leave them, for both are blind leaders of blind men. If one blind man leads another blind man, then both will fall into the pit.
And Peter said to him: "Explain to us the meaning of this simile."
Then Jesus said to them, "Did you not understand?"
Do you not understand that everything that enters a person's mouth goes into the stomach, and then exits the body?
But what comes out of the mouth of a person originates in the heart. This is what makes a person unclean.
For it comes from the heart, evil thoughts, murder, immorality, adultery, theft, false witness, and insult.
These are the things that make a person unclean; eating with unwashed hands does not make a person unclean." Jesus helps a stranger woman
And Jesus left that place and went to the region of Syro-Phoenicia and to the area of Padra.
A Canaanite woman came to him, living in that area, and began to cry out: "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David. My daughter is possessed by a demon and is suffering greatly."
Jesus said nothing to her. Then his disciples came to him and asked him, "Drive her away, for she is following us and is making a noise."
He said: "I have not sent except to the wild cattle of the lost tribe of Israel."
But the woman approached him and prostrated herself before him, saying: "O Lord, help me."
Then Jesus answered her: "It is not proper to take the children's food and throw it to the dogs."
She said: "That's true, sir, but even dogs eat from what falls from their owners' table."
At that time Jesus replied to her, "Woman, your faith is great; let it be done for you." And at that moment her daughter was healed. Jesus healed many.
And Jesus left that place and went to a region near the Sea of Galilee. He climbed a hill and sat there.
A large crowd came to him, and with them were a man with a withered hand, a blind man, a lame man, and many others who were suffering from various illnesses. They placed them at Jesus' feet, and he healed them.
The crowd was amazed when they saw the mute speak, the lame walk, the disabled move, and the blind see. They glorified God of Israel. Jesus fed more than four thousand.
Jesus then said to his disciples, "I have compassion on these people; they have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint along the way."
His disciples said to him: "Where will we get enough bread to feed this crowd in such a remote place?"
Then Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" They replied, "Seven loaves and a few small fish."
Then Jesus commanded the people to sit down on the ground.
And he took the seven loaves and the fish, gave thanks, broke the loaves, and gave them to the disciples to distribute to all.
So everyone ate and was filled. Then they gathered the excess barley, and there were seven full baskets.
The number of the eaters was four thousand men, excluding women and children.
And when Jesus had sent the multitudes away, He got into a boat and went to the region of Gadara.
Jewish leaders are testing Jesus
The Friscians and the Sadoonites came to Jesus to test him, and asked him to give them a sign of God's support for him.
Then Jesus replied: "When evening comes, people say, 'The weather will be fine, for the sky is red.'"
In the early morning, you say: "Today will be stormy, because the sky is reddish and overcast." You improve your interpretation of weather signs, but you do not improve your understanding of the times in which you live!
This wicked, corrupt generation seeks a sign to believe. And a sign will only be given them—Jonah's. Then Jesus left them and withdrew from them. Lack of understanding
And as the disciples crossed to the other side of the lake, they forgot to bring bread.
Jesus said to them: "Be on your guard and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees."
Then the students began to speak and say to each other: "But we didn't bring any bread!"
Jesus knew what they were saying, and He said to them: "You of little faith, why are you arguing among yourselves about the lack of bread?"
Did you not realize afterwards? Don't you remember the five loaves for five thousand, and how many baskets of broken bread did you gather?
Do you not remember the seven loaves for four thousand, and how much flour did you gather?
Why do you not understand that I was not speaking to you about ordinary bread, but warning you to protect yourselves from the leaven of the Pharisaeans and the Sadducees?"
At that time his disciples understood that he had not meant to warn them about leaven, but about the teaching of the Pharisaeans and the Sadducees. Peter declares that Jesus is the Christ.
And when Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, "Who do people say that I am, the Son of Man?"
So his disciples said: "Some say you are John the Baptist, others say you are Elijah, and others say you are Jeremiah, or one of the other prophets."
He said to them: "And you, who do I think I am in your opinion?"
And Simon Peter answered him: "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Then Jesus replied: "Blessed are you, Simon son of John, because the one who revealed this to you is not a man, but my Father in heaven."
And I say to you, Peter, #Peter. 18:16 From Greek "Petros," meaning "rock." On this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades #gates of Hades. 18:16 That is, the power of death. They will not be able to overcome it.
And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, for whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Then he strongly warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he is the Christ. Jesus speaks about the inevitability of his death.
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he should go to the city of Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, the chief priests, and the teachers of the law. He should be killed and rise again on the third day.
As for Peter, Jesus took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, "By no means, Lord! This shall never happen to you!"
And Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You do not have in mind the concerns of God, but those of men."
Then Jesus said to his disciples: "If anyone wishes to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow me."
He who wishes to save his life will lose it. He who loses his life for me will find it.
What would a person gain if he won the entire world yet lost himself? What can a person regain to restore his life?
Because the Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and will reward each person according to their deeds.
I tell you the truth, among those standing here are some who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.
Jesus, with him Moses and Elijah
After six days, Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, and led them up a high mountain where they were alone.
While they were there, Jesus' appearance changed and he shone like the sun; his clothes became white as light.
And suddenly Moses and Elijah appeared before the disciples, and they were talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus: "Lord, how beautiful it is to be here! If you wish, let us set up three tabernacles here—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
While Peter was speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came from it saying: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him."
When the students heard this, they were terrified and fell to the ground on their faces.
Jesus approached them and touched them, saying, "Rise up, do not be afraid."
And when they looked around them, they saw no one but Jesus.
As they were descending from the mountain, Jesus warned them and said: "Do not tell anyone what you have seen, until the Son of Man rises from the dead."
And his students asked him: "Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah should come first?" #Elijah... first. 10:17 Elijah was one of God's prophets around 850 B.C. The Jews expected his coming based on Malachi 4:5-6.
Then Jesus answered them: "Yes, Elijah will come and restore all things to their origin."
But I tell you that Elijah has come, and the people did not recognize him, but treated him the way they wanted. And the son of man will also suffer the same treatment from them."
At that time his disciples understood that he was speaking about John the Baptist. Jesus casts a demon out of a boy.
And when they returned to the gathering, a man came to Jesus and bowed before him.
Say: "Have mercy on my son, O Lord, for he is suffering from epilepsy and experiences severe pain. He often falls into fire or water."
And he brought him to your disciples, but they were unable to heal him.
Then Jesus said to them, "O unbeliefful and wayward generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you?" And He said to the man, "Bring your son here."
Then Jesus commanded the unclean spirit to leave him, and the boy was healed immediately.
Then his disciples came to him privately and asked him: "Why could we not expel him?"
Then Jesus answered them, "Because of your lack of faith. I tell you the truth, if you had only faith the size of a mustard seed, you would say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it would move; nothing would be impossible to you."
But this kind only comes out through prayer and fasting. Jesus announces the approach of His death.
While they were traveling together in Galilee, Jesus said to them: "The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men."
And they will kill him. But on the third day he will rise from the dead." The disciples were greatly distressed. The Temple tax
And when Jesus entered Caphernates, He came to Peter, who was collecting the half-shekel tax for the temple, and asked him: "Doesn't your teacher pay the half-shekel tax?"
And Peter answered them, "Yes, he will do so." Then Peter went to the house. Jesus immediately began to speak and said to him, "Simon, tell me: From whom do the kings collect the tribute and taxes? Do they collect them from their own people, or from other nations?"
And Peter replied, "They gather them from the other nations." Jesus said, "Then the children will be exempt from them."
But so that we may not cause them trouble, go to the lake, cast a fishing line, and take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth, and you will find a coin worth four dirhams inside. Take it and give it to them on my behalf and on your own.
