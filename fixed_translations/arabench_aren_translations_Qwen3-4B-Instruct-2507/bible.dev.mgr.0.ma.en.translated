And this was the birth of Jesus Christ: Mary was engaged to Joseph, and before they were married, she was found to be with the power of the Holy Spirit. Luke
And Yusuf was her guardian, a man God-fearing, who would never expose her, and he decided to separate from her to keep the secret.
And Meli said, "How could you have told him, in his sleep, one of the angels of the Lord, saying: 'O Yusuf, son of Dawud, do not fear to marry Mary, for the one who is with her is empowered by the Holy Spirit,' "
And she gave birth to a son and named him Jesus, for she thought that the Messiah would come from her. Luke

And Melchizedek fell asleep, and was buried as his Lord's angels had commanded, and he married Mary.
But nothing of it entered into her until the birth of her first child, and she named him Jesus. Luke 2:21
Chapter Two: The Knowledge of the Stars, How Jesus Saw
And Jesus went to Bethlehem in the region of Judea, during the reign of King Herod, and went from Galilee to Jerusalem, being guided by a star.
Kisulo: "Who is the king of the Jews who has risen? Because we saw his star in the east and came to worship him."
And when the king Herod heard of this, he was greatly afraid, and all the people of Jerusalem were also afraid.
And they gathered together all the scholars and religious experts, and asked them: "Where is Christ's true body?"
And he replied: "Bethlehem in the land of the Jews, where the prophet Malachi wrote:"
And Netanya, Beit Lakhem, in the land of Judea, is the small town in Judea, where from there the leader of the people of Israel will emerge.
And after the birth of Herod the king, when the star appeared, the sign was fulfilled at the time the star appeared.
And after they had taken them to Bethlehem and shown them: "Their heart will be filled with sorrow over the boy. And when they met him, they told me that even I should go and prostrate myself before him."
And Mili heard the king's words, "No." And the star they had seen in the east appeared to them, and the remaining guidance stood before them until it reached the place where the boy was and where he stood.
And besides the star, they scattered wildly.
And Malik entered the house, saw the boy and Maryam, who were prostrating and bowing before him, and their beautiful gifts, and the gold, frankincense, and myrrh offered to him.
And the Lord caused them to sleep; so they did not return to Herod, but took a different route and returned to their own country. The family of Jesus fled to Egypt.
After the magi had seen the star, an angel appeared to Joseph in a dream and said to him: "Take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt; remain there until a time comes when you can return, because Herod will rise up and kill the child."
And Naadu Yousuf, Khada al-Walad, and Mahb al-Layl, and Mushaw to Egypt.
And it came to pass until Herod died, that the word of the Lord through the prophet said: "From Egypt my people have been delivered." Herod killed the infants.
And Mili saw Herod playing with the stars' knowledge, he got very worried and ordered that the guards in Bethlehem and its surrounding areas be killed, for this was the period that had passed since the time known from the stars' knowledge.
And thus the word of the Lord through the prophet Jeremiah is fulfilled:
"From Ramah, you hear Gwath, weeping and wailing, Rachel writing on her children and not mourning those who comfort her, because her children have died." The family of Jesus returns from Egypt.
And Mary died while Herod was alive, the Lord's angel appeared to Joseph in a dream, and he was in Egypt.
And it came to pass that: "They took the boy and brought him back to the land of Israel, for the men who had intended to kill the boy had died."
And Nahshon, Uzziel, and the sons of Rechab returned to the land of Israel.
But Malchus heard that Herod had appointed Pilate to govern the Jewish lands. He feared returning to Jerusalem. And God warned him in a dream, so he went to Galilee.
And in one of the cities, they named it Nasser and he lived there, so that the word of God, spoken through the prophets, might be fulfilled: "He shall be called Nazarene." Mark 1:24; Luke 2:39; John 1:45
Chapter Three: John the Baptist testifies that the Way is Jesus.
And you baptized Liam, Jaa John the baptizer in the desert of the land of the Jews to proclaim to the people,
And they said to him: "Tubu, the time of the kingdom of the heavens is near." When?
And this is the man about whom the Prophet Isaiah, chapter 54, says: "A voice shall cry in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight His paths."
John's clothing was made of fine hair, his belt of leather, and he lived on honey and wild honey.
And people came from Jerusalem and from all the lands of Judea, and from the regions around the Jordan Valley,
They follow Fawad of Jordan under his leadership, and they acknowledge their debts.
And Maliki saw John, who was so full of the people from the Pharisees and Sadducees, that he would curse them and exalt them. He said to them: "O you hypocrites, who have warned you to flee from the anger of God coming?" When?
Ewa Bino, repentance for you due to your excellent deeds,
And what you begin to say with us: "He is Abraham." We say to you: "God is able to make from this stone a son for Abraham." John
And the waste of Fas is piled up against the trunk of the tree, and every tree does not produce a harvest sufficient to cut and throw away in the open. When?
I am going to send you the blessing of the Ma Ba, so that you may prosper, but the one who will come after me is stronger than me, and we do not deserve to deviate until September. He will send you the blessing of the Holy Spirit and health,
And the man who was blind from birth was healed by Jesus. "I was blind all my life," said the man. "I was healed by Jesus." John said to Jesus:
And after that, Jesus went from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.
But John said to him: "I need you to command me, and you go to me to command me?"
And Jesus answered, "Let it be done, for this is what is required of us to fulfill God's will." He allowed John to continue.
And Jesus, deliberately, went out from the sea, and they were adorned with the heavens, and the Spirit of God descended upon him in the form of a dove and settled upon him.
You hear a voice from heaven saying: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." Matthew 12:18; 17:5; Mark 1:11; Luke 9:35
Chapter Four: Satan Tempts Jesus
And after that, the Spirit of God led Jesus into the desert to be tempted by the devil. Hebrews
He fasted for twenty days and twenty nights, and after that, until hunger set in.
And Satan said to him: "Unless you are a son of God, why should the stone give you bread?"
And Jesus replied to him: "It is written in the Law of God: 'One does not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from God.'"
And afterwards, Satan came to the holy city of Jerusalem, and stood on a high platform above the house of God,
And the saying is: "Unless You were born of God, I would have thrown you down, and it would have been written in the Book of God: 'God will warn His angels against you, and they will protect you so that your foot does not strike the stone.'"
And Jesus answered him: "It is also written in the Law of God: You shall not have other gods besides Me."
And after Satan cast him down from one of the mountains high and far, he saw the kingdoms of the world and their greatness.
And he said: "I will give you only my prostration to you and my two hands."
And Jesus replies to him: "You are like that devil! It is written in the book of God: 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve.'"
And after this, Satan was cast out, and the angels cast down upon him. Jesus came into Galilee
And John heard that Jesus had been arrested, so he returned to Galilee. Matthew
And the Nazarethite went out, and walked through the region of the Sea of Galilee into the lands of Zebulun and Naphtali. John
And thus is fulfilled the prophecy of the prophet Isaiah:
"The lands of Zebulun and Naphtali, which are on the seacoast, across the Jordan Valley, the Galilee of the nations that are not Jews!"
The people who dwell in darkness have seen a great light, and those who live in countries of death, especially in its midst, will see one light.
And at that time Jesus began to proclaim to people and to say: "Repent! The time of the kingdom of heaven has come near." Matthew 3:2 Jesus chose John as his disciple.
And Jesus was walking on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, seeing James and John, who were with Peter and Andrew, casting their net into the sea, and they were fishermen.
And Jesus said to them: "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
And you know the time they have at the counter and follow them.
And afterwards, they went from Teman and Shaveh, the two of them, Jacob son of Zabdi and Johanan, with Zabdi, to the one of the fig trees, to reach their gate. And no one opposed them.
And they cast out the fig tree and followed Jesus. Jesus to know and to save
And Jesus went throughout every place in Galilee, teaching the people to pray and proclaim the gospel of the kingdom of God, and to heal the people of every illness and every weakness. Matthew
He bid farewell to all the news about Syria, and he brought the patients suffering from the disease: the afflicted, those with the wind, the goats, and he healed them.
It was followed by numerous groups from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, and the land of the Jews, as well as from the other side of the Jordan Valley.
Chapter Five The Sermon on the Mount
And Malik saw Jesus gathering the people to the mountain, and Malik sat down beside him with his disciples.
And it appeared to him that he knew them and recognized:
"Successes of the poor are in the spirit, for they will inherit the heavens."
Saddat li kebikyo, hait Allah gadi yuasihim.
The humble ones' blessings, as they tread upon the earth.
Sadeet Hadiok, who are all eager and thirsty to obey God, will be satisfied.
Saidat Hadiok the ones you have forgiven, may God forgive them.
Saidat Hadiok whose hearts are pure, because they will see God.
Saidat Hadiok, who are helping people to live here, will be called children of God.
Sadducees who follow the way of truth, for they have a kingdom in heaven. 1 Peter 3:14
And your sufferings are only because people have persecuted you and treated you badly, and the Holy Spirit has been grieved in you, beloved. 1 Peter 4:14
They rejoiced and shouted with joy, "Your reward is great indeed, in the heavens, for you have followed this path, as the prophets before you have done." Acts 7:52. The pressure on the earth and the light of the world.
"Salt of the earth, or else what use is salt if it has lost its saltiness? It is no longer good for anything, nor can it be used by people. Mark 9:50; Luke 14:34, 35"
We are the light of the world. It is impossible for a city above a mountain to be destroyed. John
And there was not one candlestick that was set up and placed under the eaves of the house, but it was placed in its place so that it might shine upon all who were in the house. Mark
And let the light of your lives shine before people, so that they may see your good deeds and give glory to God in heaven. 1 Peter 2:12 The Law
"What they calculate for you is not that they will abolish the religion of Moses or the scriptures of the prophets, but rather that they will not abolish them, but rather complete them."
And we will surely bring about justice: the heavens and the earth will remain steadfast, and not a single letter or point of the law will be altered until all that is within it is fulfilled. Luke
The one who did not do anything with these small commands and taught people how to manage them may be the small one in the kingdom of heavens. The one who did so and taught it to people may be the great one in the kingdom of heavens.
And be warned: except for what you obey is more than what the scholars and the Fuqaha have ordained, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven." - The Tradition
"Racem heard that the first people: don't kill, and those who kill are controlled by them."
But I tell you this: the one who worries about a person's private life controls that person, and the one who doesn't care about a person's private life—such a person is controlled by the big court. And the one who doesn't care about a person's private life—such a fool deserves the fire of hell.
Otherwise, I will take your gift and place it on the altar, and I will think about the truth concerning you from your side.
Leave your gift in front of the judge and go on until you reconcile with your own self, the fool, returned with your gift.
Make peace with those who are accusing you before any of you remain on the road to the court, before you reach the judge, and the judge puts you in the custody of the prison official, and the prison official sends you to jail.
We told you the truth: "You will not leave this place until you pay the last real you owe." Corruption
And you heard them say: "It will not corrupt."
But I tell you this: whoever has seen something once and desires it, will be corrupted by it in his heart.
Otherwise, your right eye would be like the one that struck you, its wound and its blood spilled upon you. O Allah, let not a part of what you inflicted upon me be lost, nor let you cast all of it upon me, for Hell. When?
Otherwise, your right hand would have been cut off and thrown away from you, for the sake of the thorn, and you would have lost only a part of your body, not all of it, and thus you would be cast into hell. Matthew 18:8; Mark 9:43. Divorce
And the second point: The one who has fired once, especially gives it to his brother. When
But I say to you: Whoever divorces his wife for any reason other than immorality commits adultery. And whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery." Matthew 19:9; Mark 10:11, 12; Luke 16:18; 1 Corinthians 7:10, 11.
And you heard from your ancestors: "My covenant will not be broken, but you died for the Lord through your covenants."
As for me, I say to you: your lives are not long; not even by the heavens, for they are the throne of God, Jacob.
Nor is the earth his place, for it is the place of his feet, nor is Jerusalem his place, for it is the city of the great king.
And you can't even find one single hair from him, either white or yellow.
But if your words were 'yes,' then 'yes.' If not, then 'no.' And any additional speech beyond this is from the devil." Vengeance
And you heard them say: "Eye for eye, tooth for tooth."
But I tell you this: you do not reject justice, but the one who has made you suffer on your own, has caused you pain until the end.
The one who wants to take your jacket to court, let him take even your buttons.
Otherwise, one thing will happen to you so that you walk with it a thousand steps, then two thousand.
The one who asked you for something give it to him, and the one who wants to borrow from you, don't let him have it. "Ghio 'Adiyam"
And you heard it yourself: you desire what is near to you and hate your enemy.
But I say to you: Beware of your brothers, and let them be with the ones who are against you.
So that you may be children of those in the heavens. Indeed, He sets the sun rising over the land and the sea, and He causes the night to descend upon those who do good and those who do evil.
Unless you wrote something other than what was written to you, what reward do you have? And what about the tax that they took from you?
Otherwise, how could you have accepted them except as your own gods? What goodness is there in two? And what about those who reject idols—would they not be like this too?
Ewa Konu, as well as the sky, is complete.
Chapter Six: Al-Sadaqah
"Doing good deeds for people to see you, or thinking you will earn reward from Allah in the heavens. When?"
Otherwise, my desire is to give a charity, and I will not leave it with them, for the call before people is like that of the hypocrites who during prayer and adultery seek to be thanked by people. I warn you to speak the truth: they will be granted by God a reward from people.
But I haven't received any charity from you, and your right hand is not easy to know, as you don't know what your right hand does.
So that your charity remains a secret, and the one in the sky who does not hide from it will be your recompense." - Prayer
"And when they pray, they do not act like the hypocrites, who are proud of praying standing up in the prayer position, so that people can see them and observe them. Tell them the truth: Allah has granted them reward from people. Later..."
As for me, go to your home, enter it, close the door on you, and pray for the one in the secret, the one who does not hide anything from him—this is the one who will save you.
And they will say, "What do you mean by starting up so much talk, when you are the ones who disbelieve in the idols, who are not even given any reward except from the talk, which will not be answered by God."
Ewa, they won't be in the same condition, follow those in the sky to know what you need before you ask for it.
And say: "Our Lord, raise up this prayer (for us): make our Lord holy, and sanctify His name."
Your kingdom will come, and your will will be done, just as the heavens are above, so too will it be on earth.
The bread that suffices for our daily livelihood,
And forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who have sinned against us.
And we preserved us from the trial, and saved us from the devil.
Unless You forgive the mistakes of people, You will not forgive the mistakes committed by them.
But unless they forgive the mistakes of people, we will not achieve what they have not forgiven you for the mistakes you have committed. Fasting
"Except for those who remain silent, how can they be considered hypocrites like those who cover their faces to show people that they are fasting? We say the truth: Allah will grant them reward from among people."
But Nettles oil, moisturizes your hair and washes your face.
As long as people don't see you fasting, but for those in the secret, and for those who don't hide anything from you, it is they who will forgive you. Treasures in the sky
"What have you gathered for yourselves on earth, that you would covet the snares and pitfalls, and that you would dig into them and go through them? Jacob"
But they gathered for you treasures in the sky, neither did they take them with the hands, nor did they dig for them, nor did they sail upon them.
Whatever your wealth, what matters is your heart. Nur Datt
"The eye is the lamp of the body. But your eye is a balance; all of your body will be illuminated."
But if your eyes are ugly, everything within you will become corrupt. And if the light within you is darkness, what a difficult darkness that would be! God and money.
Even one of them could become a servant of Gog's power, either one of them will be hidden and the other will not, nor will one of them be loyal to one another. Thus, until you become servants of God and wealth. You will not be able to achieve this.
And on this he said to them: "Do you not see that your livelihood, whether you eat or drink, and your clothing, whether you wear it or not, is not more important than food and clothing?" Is life not more important than food, and clothing more important than clothing?
See birds in the sky, they are not cultivated, not harvested, not gathered in storage houses; rather, the birds in the sky feed them. O you who have no good to show, what is there to be satisfied with?
How can this be among you, except that the fear has increased and the life span has been extended by an hour?
And why do they care so much about clothes? Look at the rose weight in the fedan—how can it grow bigger, if it's not allowed to develop?
But let them have the truth: even Solomon had his power, and his life was not marked by any flaw among them.
Ewaa a qalalin al-imaan! Except for the spring in the field, which we see today and will see tomorrow, why is it that Allah has not clothed it with beauty, how come you are not dressed in beauty too?
On that basis, they would not stop being hungry and thirsty: Shall we eat? Or shall we drink? Or shall we be clothed?
The path even for those who don't know God asks for this, and for those in the sky who know, we all need this.
But their hearts are hardened against the kingdom of God, and what is meant by that, it has all been taken away from them.
And what benefit have you gained from today's day, make tomorrow's day better than today. Every day will be better than the previous one.
Chapter Seven: What you decide regarding a matter of doubt
"What you judge in one case, won't control you."
Let the rulers decide, but don't let them control you, and let the words speak, but don't let them speak for you. Mark
See the mold on the bread you have in your cupboard, and don't you see the rot on the wood in your house?
And how can you say to me, "Let me see the fear in your eye, and your eye contains a twig?"
Ah, those hypocrites, after all, the return from your eye, when the hour comes, will be like a false dawn, so that you will not be able to see the fear of the day from your own eye.
What you give the sacred need of dogs will not harm you nor cut you off, and what you take from your essence in oaths will not be forgiven by their feet. Seek, your hearts and your wills.
"Come in and take it. Put your heart into it. Open the door and it will be yours."
The path that was requested is not given to him, the one whose heart is closed, and the one whose door is not opened to him.
I suspect among you that whoever asked his son for bread, gave him a room.
Nor could he ask from him a goat that he would give for a cause?
Ewa, unless you're the ones who don't provide your children with balanced meals, how is it fair that the things in the sky don't give balanced meals to those who need them?
As it is written, "Do to others as you would have them do to you." This is your special commandment so that you may follow them, for on this depends the teaching of the Law and the Prophets." Luke 6:31 The Narrow Gate
They entered through the narrow gate, for the gate leading to death is wide and the path is easy, and those who enter through it.
Shahal, the passage of al-Bab, and Shahal, and al-‘A’ira, the road leading to life, and Qalal, those they meet. The tree knows from its growth.
Rudaw al-kamum from the prophets of the Kadabim, who are found among you wearing the clothes of the hyenas, but they are from within Diab al-Hitfa.
Know them by the path they took. And can you gather grapes from thorns, or oil from the olive tree?
And every fruitful tree yields a fruitful harvest, and every barren tree yields a barren harvest.
The balanced tree cannot yield a barren harvest, and the barren tree cannot yield a balanced harvest.
Every tree, if it does not yield a balanced harvest, is cut down and uprooted. When?
And from their blindness they see them." Matthew 12:33. We are guided by God's intention.
"What is the matter with you, O Master, O Master! He will enter the kingdom of heaven, but it is the one who enters it who will guide the will of those in heaven."
O day, how many will say to you: "My Lord, my Lord!" And yet, did we not prophesy by your name? Did we not go mad by your name? Did we not perform miracles by your name?
You betrayed me, Gadi, tell them: "I didn't know you!" My enemies are the ones from among you!. The metal of Gogo Diour
The path of the one who hears my words and understands them, resembles a man with a mind who builds a house upon rock.
And from where the summer breeze blew and the waters spread, a strong wind came with the beating of the house's roof, it couldn't reach, since its foundation was built on rock.
And the one who hears this talk from me and doesn't understand it, looks like a man named Dara on the sand dune.
And from where the rains fell and the rivers overflowed, a strong wind blew and the house's roof beams struck, and its thunder was powerful.
And Matthew reported Jesus' words, and the people were amazed at his teaching, Mark
Yet he knew that they were not in a state where one of them had power, but rather in a state where their religious knowledge was lacking.
The final chapter: Jesus as a manly warrior
And Jesus descended from the mountain, and large crowds followed him.
And near him was a man named Al-Majdum, who prostrated himself and said: "O my Lord, except what I desire, I cannot make myself pure."
And He stretched out Jesus' hand and touched him, saying: "I have made you clean!" Then the leprosy left him and he became clean.
And Jesus said to him: "Reply with this, so that you may not give them any further instruction; but you shall teach them the commandment of the Law, and give them the gift that Moses commanded, so that they may have a witness for them." The servants of the commander of the army observed.
And Milah went in with Jesus to Kfar Nahum, and saw one of the soldiers' guards.
And she said to him: "My lord, my servants in the house are lying on the beds, and they are all exhausted."
And he tells Jesus: "Hani Gadi, let's go, so we can rest."
And the soldier replied: "I don't deserve for my lord to enter under my roof, but I will not say a single word or mention anything about you."
Yet even I, who am the one judging and who have an army to rule over, said this: "Move! Go ahead, and then said: "Come! Come here, and then said to my slave: "Go there! Go there!"

And Malai saw that the crowd was troubled, and he told his disciples to cross over to the other side of the sea.
He is close to one of the scholars of Islamic law and said to him: "O my master, I will follow you wherever you go."
And Jesus answered and said to them: "The wild birds have their nests, and the wild animals have their dens, but a man's child has nothing even to rest his head upon."
And one last thing to the disciple: "Master, let me go with you and bury with you."
But Jesus replied to him: "Follow me, and I will make the dead rise again!" Jesus then took one step forward.
And Jesus was alone on the boat, and his disciples followed him.
A strong wind blew over the sea, even reaching Amr al-Maj al-Fulka, and Jesus was sleeping.
And near him was a disciple, who fell and was wounded: "We have escaped, my lord, the path ahead of us is clear!"
He said to them: "What ails you, fearing this, when you have the faith?" Then he stood firm against the wind and the sea, which calmed the world.
And they were amazed at the men and the crowd: "How can wind and sea obey them?" Jesus cast out the demon from the men suffering from the fever.
And Jesus went to the other side of the sea, to the land of the Gergesenes. There he saw a number of men possessed by demons, living outside the tombs, and they were extremely dangerous, so that no one was able to pass by that way.
And it was not clear to Kiguto and Kigolo: "Are you and I both children of God? And have you come here to deceive us before time?"

And he put on his shoes and went to his house.
And the people saw the groups of people He had gathered, they were afraid and gave glory to God, who had given authority to people in this way. Jesus then chose Matthew.

Ewa Siro learned the meaning of this statement: "I wanted mercy, not punishment, because I saw that we do not give punishment to those who fear God, but to the disobedient." The Question on Fasting
And after John the Baptist had baptized Jesus and Saul, they said to him: "How do you and the Pharisees keep the law so strictly, yet your disciples do not fast at all?"
And Jesus answered them and said to them: "How can the bridegroom grieve with the bridegroom's companions? Indeed, the time is coming when the bridegroom will be taken away from among them, and they will grieve."
Even one person who wears an old shirt at the edge of a new trousers will cause the patch to shrink and the wear to increase.

And a woman who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years came up behind Him and touched the edge of His garment, for she said, "If I only touch His clothes, I will be healed."
As for their risks: "Unless I have their needs, we won't proceed."
And Jesus turned and saw her, saying to her: "Daughter, have faith, and your illness will depart." And at that very moment the woman was healed.
And Milly brought Jesus to the president's house, where people were gathering, suffering from headaches, and complaining about the money.
They said to him: "Get out of here! The girl isn't dead, she's just not sleepy!" and they laughed at him.
And Jesus took them out, entered in, and grasped the girl by her hand as she was writhing.
Goodbye, news, you've taken away all their illusions. Jesus, show the blind the way.
And Milly was Jesus' day, followed by Gog of the blind, Kiguto and Kigolo: "Our Lord, son of David!"
And Milu entered the house, approaching the blind men. He asked them Jesus: "Are you sure you trust me? I am able to heal you," and they replied: "Oh, Lord!"
And Jesus looked at them and said: "Because of your faith, it will be granted to you."
And they had eyes, yet did not see; Jesus and the disciples said to them: "You have eyes, yet you do not see!"
But they left and spread the news throughout the entire area. Zizon Kichavi
And no one expelled the blind, until Jabu brought forth one of the walking Zizon, possessed by madness.

and Philip and Bertolmaus, and Thomas, and Matthew the Tax Collector, and James son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus,
And the nation of the Samaritans, and the Jews of the Essene sect who had seen Jesus.

The chapter tells how John the Baptist sent his disciples to Jesus.
And Matthew, who recorded Jesus' teachings given to his disciples, went forth to proclaim the gospel to the Jews.
And Milly heard John, who was in prison, being held by Dacxi, the one who would bring Christ, and he sent his disciples to ask him.
And he said: "What about us, the ones who came, or shall we take another?"
And Jesus answered them, saying to them: "Go and tell John what you have heard and seen:
The Omieens shall see, the Arjins shall be made whole, the Majdamin shall be clean, the Samkines shall see, the dead shall live, and the poor shall hear the gospel.
And the blessings upon you, which you never received.
And now, John is not teaching them as they were taught by John and the others: "Where did you go and see in the desert? What kind of house does the wind give you?"
And don't you see? What kind of man is wearing fine clothes? Those who wear fine clothes, they are staying in the royal palaces!
Why did you leave without telling me? What's going on? We're in for something worse than that.
By this path, Allah has made it clear in His book: "O Prophet, I have shown you the way before you, there is no path for you."
And we say to you the truth: none of those who have increased among the relatives is better than John the Baptist, but the younger one is better than him in the kingdom of heaven.
And behold, John the Baptist until today, the kingdom of heaven has increased in strength, and the powerful have labored with their strength to seize it. Luke
And the prophets, including Moses, predicted until the time when John the Baptist came.
Except that you were Elijah, who came to him, John the Baptist. Matthew
Ewa, who has something and friends, hears!
But what about this generation? They're in a bad state, young people in the streets are acting out and causing trouble:
We blew for you the dinar and you did not stretch it, and we will provide for you and you will not weep!
The way of John, and what he ate and what he drank, and the man said: This way is the dwelling of John.
And man was created to eat and to drink, and they are saying: "This is our share and our provision, and we are not subject to taxes or tributes!" But Allah's wisdom has written a valid provision from it. Oh woe to the one who does not follow it!
And at that hour, Jesus appeared to them as a teacher who had performed more miracles than any other teacher, because the people among them did not believe.
O Wailak, a Korzin! O Wailak, a Beita Saida! Let the miracles you manage be managed in the images of Wafid and Saida, let the shahal be their guide, and let them wear straw and sit on ashes # 11:21 wear straw and sit on ashes: so that they may show their repentance.
But let me tell you: the consequence of posting photos and videos on your account will be much lighter than yours.

Chapter Tanash teaches Jesus on Saturday
And they fed him Liam, on a Saturday, Daz Jesus between the feedings of the seed, and the disciples were hungry, and they began to cut the spoils and to eat.
And Mili saw the Freycinetians: "Look at your kids, they're doing something that doesn't concern them on Saturday!"
They said to them: "What did you bring from David's house, when the hunger came, and the one with him?"
How could he enter the house of God, and the bread they offer to God, which is not for anyone to eat except the priests alone?
What have the scholars of the Torah done, who serve in the house of God on Saturday, and yet they count the Sabbath, and what is their excuse?
But I say to you: He is here who is greater than the house of God.
And understanding the meaning of the verse which says: "I wanted mercy, not punishment, because you have not judged those who are not accountable to you."
For man was created on the sixth day. Jesus appeared in the sixth hour.
And he went out from there and came to their place of prayer.
And they found a man with a disabled hand. They asked him: "What is the price of the market on Saturday?" So he could avoid being accused.
And they answered: "Indeed, there is no one among you who has a goat, and if he had one, would he not have dug a hole during the Saturday day, and not left it unattended, and not disturbed it and removed it?" Luke
Ewa Rah value Banadom keter bzaaf min al-kharouf! Wa haddishi elash amal al-khair halal nahar as-Sabt.
And Jesus said to the man with the crippled hand: "Stretch out your hand!" and he stretched it out, and it was restored properly, like the other hand.

And the people's groups were amazed: "Is this David's son?"
And Mila heard the Frisians saying this: "This path leads to madness, except for B'elzabub, the leader of madness." Matthew 9:34; 10:25
And Jesus knew that they were going to betray him and that they would all be divided among themselves: "A kingdom will split and be destroyed, and so will every city and every family."
Iowa except the devil would come out, the devil would divide and turn against his head; otherwise, how would it remain divided and turn against his head?
Otherwise, I would have been in B'elzabul, going insane—why would you have sent your children to do this? Because of this, your children who are going to judge you.
But unless you are in the Spirit of God, you will go mad; the kingdom of God has come among you.

"After all, you'll be controlled by you, either by Barri or by Mdnab." The scholars of Sharia and the Freycinetians are looking for a sign.
And you, at that moment, replied to him: "O my master, let us see from you some sign." When?
And he says to them: "A corrupt and wicked generation asking for a sign! Never will I give them any sign except the sign of the Prophet Jonah. When?"
As Jonah stayed in the whale for three days and three nights, so too will the son of man remain in the earth for three days and three nights.
The people of Nineveh will follow the day of judgment with this generation and witness it; after that, they will be warned by Jonah, and behold, here is one favor from Jonah.

And Mili used to talk with people's groups; he came with his brother and stood by the side, listening to what they had to say. [
And he said to one of the present: "Look, here are your father and your mother standing by, talking to you."] # 12.47 This verse is not found in any of the early manuscripts.
And Jesus answered him, saying: "What is she like? And what is her husband like?"
And I am accused by him, on the side of his opposition and resistance: "Here they are, my brothers and sisters,"
While those who are in the sky, my brothers and sisters, are my father, my mother, and my children.
Chapter: The Metal of the Farmer
Your noon party, you left Jesus go out of the house and sit by the sea.
And great multitudes gathered upon him from all the groups of people; and because of the crowd, the boats were driven onto the shore, and they all stood beside the sea. Luke 5:1-3
And they kept coming to me with all sorts of problems and complaints: "This man went out to plant crops,"
And Milly was a kizrec, a stone grinder, who scattered seeds along the road and called the birds to them.
And two buckets of sand were poured into one earth pit, which contained very little soil, and the sand was not submerged.
And when the sun's rays reach them, they burn, and they will not be able to reach the wall, they will perish.
And the two grains were crushed in the middle of the stalk, and the large part of the stalk choked them.
And the two measures of grain were poured out, and the land of Mizpah yielded a harvest; there was one who gave a measure, and one who gave sixty, and one who gave thirty.
Ewa, who has something and a friend, hears! The purpose of the head
And Qarbo said to him, "Why are you talking to people with the leader?"
He answers them and says: "We will give you so that you may understand the secrets of the heavens, but we will not give them so that they may understand them."
As for those who have, they will not be given, and they will gain more than the measure. As for those who have nothing, even those who have will not take from them. When?
And I was talking to them about the leader, saying, "Look what you're missing, and listen to what you're not hearing, and understand what you're not grasping."
And thus the prophets' verification in Isaiah: You heard what you heard, yet did not understand; you saw what you saw, yet did not perceive.
When this people turned away from the truth, their hearing failed, their eyes closed, so that they could not see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, and could not understand with their hearts, and returned to me so that I might heal them.
But our eyes have seen, and our ears have heard. Luke
And We will surely show them the truth: those who see will see what they see and what they do not see, and those who hear will hear what they hear and what they do not hear. This is the meaning of the farmer.
"Ewa smou ntem el maa3 el matal dial el ra7il li kizar7:
The devil will come and steal away what is sown in their hearts; this is what we compare it to, the seed that sprouts on the path.
Those who plant in the stony land—these are the ones who hear the word of God and accept it with joy.
But the word of God will not be weakened in his heart, and his faith will remain unshaken for a short time; and if disputes and conflicts arise, they will damage his faith.
The one planted in the middle of the thorn bush is the one who hears the word of God, but they are worldly desires and love of money that choke the word of God and do not give any fruit.
As for that which is sown in the balanced land, it is the one that hears the word of God and understands it, the one that produces harvest; some dangers on one, some on sixty, and some on thirty. The statement of the Zawain in the middle of the region.
And Jesus gave them a parable about the kingdom of heaven, saying: "It is like a man who sowed good seed in his field."
And the people were asleep, the enemy came to him, planted the sown in the middle of the field, and went about his business.
And Milu planted the crops and went out with the spoils, until he reached the Zawwan.
And they said to the servant of the house: "Master, what about the middle row that you planted in your field? From where did you get that seed?"
He replies to them: "That's the enemy of this one who's been doing this." And they ask him why the servants of his: "What do you want us to do to him?"
And they replied, "No! We will not let the people of Zawwan go."
Leave the harvest to grow until it's time to harvest; right now, we gather the harvest and bring it to the storage barn, where we bundle it to burn it. As for the harvest, we collect it and take it to the family's storage room. The amount of poppy seed and the amount of yeast
And he repeated to them a similar parable: "It is like a king who planted a single date palm in his field and cultivated it."
And Waka is the small one, love is all, Mila, grow big like a tree planted in the soil, even the birds in the sky will come to live in its branches."
And they added another and a third: "Like the kingdom of heaven, they mixed the flour of their women with the three kilograms of wheat until the dough was fully fermented." Jesus spoke to the leader
And he taught them all the things that Jesus taught the crowds of people, and without any addition, he gave them nothing until they needed it.
So that the words of the Prophet may be fulfilled: "By the one who is in control, we speak and inform about everything that was hidden during the day when the world was created." The meaning is the one of the Zawwān.
And Jesus went home that day, and when they came to him, his disciples and the others, they said to him: "Explain to us the meaning of the parable about the sower and the fields!"
And they replied, "The one who sows the mixed seed is a son of man,"
The faden is the world, the balance of the scales is the birth of the kingdom of God, and the zawan is the birth of the devil.
The enemy who sowed the corruption is Iblis, and the harvest is the end of times, and the harvesters are the angels.
As the sun gathers and burns with health, thus comes the end of time:
Ghadai will send angels to humans, and will gather from his kingdom the things that cause disasters and the ones that bring them.
And they will be given a false promise of health; then they will become weak and fall into despair.
But those who obey God are like the sun, a great kingdom. He who has something and is still in need, listen!» The treasure, the jewel, the network
And like a kingdom of heavens, he found a treasure hidden in one dunam, met one man, and buried it again. From great joy, he sold everything he owned and gave away that dunam.
And as his kingdom resembles the heavens, O Awtaani, for one trader to turn upon the pure essence,
And Mili met one expensive gem, sold everything he had and went with her».
And they resembled the kingdom of the heavens, casting them into the sea as prey for fishermen, and the schools of every kind of whale.
And when the years passed, the fishermen took them by the sea, and scattered them, those who were fit to live in the villages and those who were not fit to live with their fathers.
And thus will come the end of time: the angels will be sent, and the disbelievers will be separated from among those who fear God.
And the Muddinbān are the Zobīya of al-ʿIffā, it was in the presence of Gādī that the weeping and the spreading of the Sannā occurred. The New and Old Treasure
And Jesus turned to his disciples and asked: "Have you understood all this?" They replied: "Ah!"
He told them: "Ewa rah on haddishi, each of the scholars of the religion knows the kingdom of the heavens, as something resembling a house that emerges from its treasure, bringing forth both new and old things." Nasserat before Jesus
And Jesus called the twelve, and they went out from there.
And he returned to his hometown Nasser, so that people might know about the prayers and be amazed, and they would say: "Where did he get this wisdom and these miracles?"
Who is this man? Who is the one that named him Mary? And who are his brothers Jacob, Joseph, Shechem, and Judah?
Who is that man whose daughters live in our city? From where did he come to have all of this?»
And they were not surprised by the situation, but Jesus said to them: "A prophet is not without honor except in his own country or in his own family." John 4:44.
And if they had faith, they would have been given countless miracles, since they do not have faith.
The fourth chapter of John the Baptist's death
And your time has come; Herod the ruler heard news about Jesus,
And he said to his disciples: "This is John the Baptist, the one who came from the dead, who will perform miracles at his hands."
While Herod was king, John the Baptist and his disciples entered into prison before Herodias, the wife of Philip. Luke
The elders said to John: "You can't marry her."
Bagi would have killed him, but he feared the people, for they believed him to be a prophet.
And at the birthday party of Herod, the daughters of Herodias danced at the party, and Herod was amazed.
And how could he swear until he gives it to Dackshi who made the requests?
She was given her instructions by her mother, Hagar the Herod: "Get for me the head of John the Baptist from Bethsaida!"
And the king was grieved, but before the oaths he had taken and the people present, he ordered that they should be given the dakshi that they desired.
And the one who cut John's head off in prison,
Jabah wa fawaid al-tabsil wa 'atahahu lil banat, wa dathahu limaha.
And John's disciples left him, and they buried his body, and afterwards they went to Jesus. Jesus said, "Five thousand."
And Jesus heard these things, and went from there by boat to a place alone. And He recognized the crowds of people, and followed them from the shore on their feet.
And the Messiah descended from the Fuloqah, and saw a large group of people, and he comforted them and healed the sick among them.
And in the evening, they approached him and asked: "The road is going through the center, and we are in the middle of the city, and people are walking around to buy food for their families."
But Jesus said to them: "Let them go; give them something to eat so that they may eat."
And the man said: "We don't have here anything but five loaves and two fish."
And he said to them: "Let us go and see the feast!"
He commands the people's groups to share the bread during spring. He raised his hands toward the five loaves and the fish from the sea, lifted his eyes to heaven, and thanked God. And he broke the loaves, gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people's groups.
And all of them, even Shabu, and after Jumma, Tnashir gathered a full feast filled with breads they had baked.
And they were five thousand men, without women or children. Jesus walked upon the water
And Jesus commanded his disciples to get into a boat and to go ahead of him to the other side, as the crowds were gathering around them.
And Mili left them, went up to the mountain alone to pray. He stayed alone until evening came.
And the winds of the southern sea, which are abundant in the middle of the sea and dominate it, are opposed by the wind.
And at dawn, Jesus was found with his disciples, walking on the water.
And Milly saw the teacher walking above the wall, she took off and said: "This idea is crazy," and she felt overwhelmed with fear.
And you will be with me, Jesus spoke to them and said: "Be courageous, I am He, do not be afraid!"
And he said to Peter: "Lord, unless you are with me, I will not follow you while walking on water."
And Jesus called out to him, "You are Peter!" and Peter came down from the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
But Mili felt the wind was strong, it was pulling him down and he began to sink, struggling and gasping: "Free me, my lord!"
And Jesus took the man by the hand, spat on him, and touched him, saying: "Little faith, why do you doubt?"
And the wind carried it away, scattering the flowers.
And those in the boat bowed down to him and said: "Truly, you are the Son of God." Jesus healed many people suffering from diseases.
And Jesus and his disciples crossed to the other side of the sea, and they came to the country of Gadara.
And they knew him as a man of the land, and they conveyed to him all the news of the people, and he took care of the sick among them.
And they asked him to touch them, besides Jairus. And the one who touched him was healed.
Chapter Five: Discussions on the Practices of the Scholars
And afterwards, John came to Jesus, bringing with him two of the Pharisees and legal scholars from Jerusalem, and they asked Him:
"Are you not following the custom of the elders? Because they do not wash their hands before eating."
But he replied to them and said: "Why do you follow your custom instead of obeying God's command?"

He replies to him: "Wait until we finish, haven't you understood yet?"

And there was one woman, a Canaanite from Hadduk the Jauhah, Gootat and Ghat: "Have mercy upon me, my Lord, son of David! Let my daughter dwell in your house, and let her be with you abundantly."
But none of them replied with a word. They approached him, challenged him, and demanded: "Leave her be, as she is; we won't follow you and get involved!"
And Jesus answered them and said: "Has God ever sent me except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel?"
But the woman fell down and prostrated herself: "Help me, my lord!"
And he replied, "It's not reasonable to eat children's bread and then throw it to dogs."
And the woman said to him: "Oh sir! But even the dogs eat from the water that the men of the village drink."
And Jesus answered and said to her: "Your faith is great! Let it be done for you according to what you have asked." At that very moment the girl was healed. And many people saw it.
And afterwards, Jesus went from there by the shore of Galilee, and ascended the mountain and sat down.
And he gathered groups of people among the people, with them camels, oxen, goats, sheep, and other people, and placed them at his feet and healed them.

Chapter Satashi: Signs of the Times
And the Jews came to Jesus, two of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees, to test him, and they asked him to show them a sign from heaven. Matthew
But he answered them and said: "When the sun sets behind the horizon, the sky will become clear, and the sky will turn red."
And in the morning, Bekri said: "Today it will be winter, the sky will be red and cloudy. You may understand the weather conditions, but you cannot understand the signs of time!"

And Mili brought the students to the shore of the sea, and we will take bread with them.
And Jesus said to them: "Repent, and turn back from the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees!" Luke
And they said with their heads: "We didn't get any bread with us, this talk is a lie."
And Jesus knew that they were hungry, and said to them: "Why do you keep looking at me as if I have no bread?"
Wait, did you understand? Why did you divide five loaves among five thousand one people? How did you gather the ingredients for the bread? When?
And what about the seven loaves they distributed among half a thousand people? When?
How could you not understand? Because I didn't mean to say that you should make bread? You've got your heads full of French and Syrian yeast!
And now, they have come to understand their struggle, not from the leaven of the Franks and the Pelagians, but from the leaven of bread. Peter will bear witness that Jesus is Christ.

And say to them: "Shall I, then, be your protector while you are not protecting yourselves?"
And Simon Peter and James answered: "You are the Christ, the Son of God!" John

And after this, Jesus appointed his disciples, saying, "Until the time comes when the Son of Man is raised from the dead." Jesus foretold his death and resurrection.
And from that hour, Jesus began to teach his disciples, especially as he walked to Jerusalem, and was openly criticized by the elders and leaders of the religious establishment, especially the scribes and Pharisees, and particularly by those who killed him. On the third day, he rose from the dead.
And Peter struck his cheek, and it seemed as if he were arguing with him, and he said: "Alas, my lord, won't you let me have this one!"
And he turned to Peter and said: "After me, the devil! You will be my stumbling block, and you will not think about the matters of men, but about the matters of God."
And he said to his disciples: "Unless someone carries their cross and follows me, they cannot be my disciple."

It is shown to them Moses and Elijah talking with Jesus.
And Peter said to Jesus: "Master, we have labored all night and have caught nothing. But according to your word, we will cast the net once more; it will yield three baskets of fish, and we will have unity with you, with Moses, and with Elijah."
And at that time a voice was heard from the cloud, saying: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; listen to him!" 2 Peter 1:17,18
And they heard the messenger recite it, their faces turned pale, and they were terrified.
And Jesus came near to them, touched them, and said to them: "Be not afraid!"
And their eyes were opened, and they saw him alone.
And at that time, they were descending from the mountain, and Jesus and the disciples said to them: "What did you say until you saw the man who was raised from the dead, and followed the Son of Man from the dead?"
And Wosoloh asked him: "Ewa, how can the religious law be applied when the specific prophet Elijah is not present?"
And they replied, "The truth is, Elia Gigi is the one and he's settled everything."

And the disciples of Jesus and Saul were not apart from them and him, and they said: "How could we have been able to cast out demons?"
And We will say to them: "Because of your lack of faith! And We will grant you the truth: except that you had a faith as weak as a little bit of thistle, you would have said to this mountain: 'I will move from here to there,' and it would have moved. And even something impossible would have been possible to you." [
This type is madness, unless it emerges through prayer and fasting.] # 17.21 This verse is not found in early manuscripts at Matthew 21:21; Mark 11:23; 1 Corinthians 13:2; Jesus once prophesied about his death and suffering.

And Jesus returned with his disciples to Capernaum. At Peter's house, James and John asked him: "Shouldn't we pay the tax to God's house?"

And Peter replied: "I am a tax collector." And he said to Jesus: "Let the tax collectors and sinners come to me, for I have forgiven their sins."
