Who is the greatest?
At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked him: "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
At that time Jesus took a child to himself and placed him among them.
I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
Therefore, he who humbles himself like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
"He who accepts such a child by my name has actually accepted me." Warning against mistakes
As for anyone who encounters one of these little believers with me, it would be better for him if a stone from the well had been placed around his neck and thrown into the sea, so that he drowned!
Misery for the world from these misfortunes, which must inevitably come, but woe to those who cause them!
Therefore, if your hand or your foot tends you to sin, cut it off and cast it far from you! It is better to enter eternal life with one hand or one foot cut off than to have two hands or two feet and to be cast into eternal fire.
And if your eye leads you toward sin, pluck it out and cast it far from you! For it is better to enter life with one eye than to have two and end up in the fire of Hell. — The Wayward Ox
Jesus said: "Be careful not to despise any of your simple disciples. For I tell you that the angels entrusted with their care continually see the face of my Father in heaven."
Because the Son of Man came to save the lost.
"What do you say about a man who has a hundred goats, one of which is superior? Should he not leave the ninety-nine goats on the mountain and go to find the one that has strayed?"
I tell you the truth, when he finds it, he will be happier with it than with the ninety-nine camels that never went astray.
In the same way, your father in heaven does not want to destroy one of your simple disciples. Saalih, your brother.
If your brother sins against you, go to him privately and speak to him alone. If he listens to you, you have won your brother.
But if they do not listen to you, take with you one or two more, so that the matter may be established by the testimony of two or three. #Two or three. 16:18 See Deuteronomy 19:15.
If he refuses to listen to them, inform the Church. If he refuses to listen to the Church, then treat him as you would treat a worshipper of idols and a collector of taxes.
I say to you the truth, everything you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and everything you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
I tell you the truth, if two of you agree on any matter, the Father who is in heaven will accomplish it for them.
For indeed, if two or three gather in my name, I am among them.» Forgiveness without limits
Then Peter came to Jesus and said to him: "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister when they sin against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus said to him, "Not just seventy times, but seventy times seven!'" #Seventy... times. 22:18 That is, without limit.
Therefore, the kingdom of heaven can be compared to a king who decided to settle his accounts with his servants.
And when he began to settle his accounts, a man who owed him a huge amount came to him. #huge amount. 24:18 Literally: "Ten thousand zin or qin, equivalent to about 300,000 kilograms of the currency in use at that time."
And since he had nothing to pay his debts, the lord decided to sell his debts together with his wife, his children, and all his possessions, and to use the proceeds to pay off his debts.
At that time, the servant prostrated himself on his knees before the king and appealed to him, saying: "Delay with me, and I will pay you all the debt."
I pity him, and forgive him completely of his debt, letting him go.
As he was going, he encountered one of his slave companions who owed him a small amount. He grabbed his neck and began suffocating him, saying to him: "Pay off what you owe me."
The slave prostrated himself on his knees before him and supplicated him, saying: "Delay me, and I will pay what is due."
"But he rejected that, rather took it and sent him to prison until he paid all his debts."
And when the other slaves saw what had happened, they were very grieved and went to inform their master of everything that had occurred.
"Call her and said to her: 'O wicked servant, have you not forgiven me all the religion you are responsible for because you prayed to me."
Should you forgive your servant, your companion, as I have forgiven you?
And her anger was great, and she sent him to be punished so that he would pay all his debts.
"So your Lord, the Most High, will treat you likewise, unless each of you forgives his brother from his heart."
Union in marriage
And after Jesus had finished speaking about these things, He left the region of Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan River.
And a large crowd of people followed him, and there they were healed.
Some Pharisees came to Jesus trying to test him, and they said: "Is it permissible for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
And Jesus replied: "Did you not read in the book that God created humanity in the beginning, 'male and female'? #creation ... male and female. 4:19 Genesis 1:27, 5:2."
Then he said: "Therefore a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife; and the two become one flesh." #He leaves... one. 5:19 From the Book of Genesis 2:24.
And thus they will not be two thereafter, but one. No one should separate those whom God has joined together.»
They said to him: "Why, if Moses commanded that a wife be given a divorce document, #divorce document. 7:19 See Deuteronomy 24:1, does she get divorced?"
Then Jesus replied: "Moses allowed this because of your hardened hearts, but it was not so from the beginning."
Therefore I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another commits adultery.
His disciples said to him: "If this is how a husband and wife relate to each other, then it is better never to marry!"
Jesus said to them: "Not everyone can accept this teaching except those whom God gives the ability to do so."
There are men who cannot marry because they were born without the ability to marry. There are men who cannot marry because people have deprived them of the ability to marry. There are men who have chosen not to marry in order to serve the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept this teaching, let them accept it. Jesus welcomes the children.
At that time, they brought him children so that he might place his hands on them and pray, but his disciples rebuked them.
At that time Jesus said: "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
Then Jesus laid his hands on them and left that place. Obstacle of Wealth
A man came to Jesus and asked him: "Teacher, what good deed must I do to inherit eternal life?"
Then Jesus answered him, "Why do you ask me about what is good? Do you not know that only God is good? But if you want to enter life, keep the commandments."
The man said, "What commands?" Jesus said, "Do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal."
Do not bear false witness against your father or your mother. #Do not kill... and your mother. 19:19 Exodus 20:12-16 and Deuteronomy 5:16-20. And love your neighbor as yourself. #Love your neighbor. 19:19 By referring to Luke 10:25-37, we understand that "neighbor" refers to every person in need of help. Likewise, love yourself.› #Love... yourself. 19:19 Leviticus 19:18.
The young man said to him: "I am obeying all these commands, what do I still lack?"
Jesus said to him, "If you want to be complete, go, sell everything you have, give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
When the young man heard that, he went sad because he was very rich.
At that time Jesus said to his disciples: "Truly I tell you, it is difficult for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven."
I tell you again that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.
When his disciples heard this, they were astonished and said: "Then who can be saved?"
Then Jesus looked at them and said to them: "This is impossible for people, but everything is possible with God."
At that time Peter said to him: "We have left everything to follow you! What then will we have?"
Then Jesus said to them: "Truly I tell you, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne in the new age, you will sit on twelve thrones, to rule over the twelve tribes of Israel."
And whoever leaves his house or brother or sister or father or mother or children or fields, he will receive a hundredfold, and will inherit the life to come with God forever."
Many will be among the first to become the last, and many will be among the last to become the first.
Like the workers of kindness
And the kingdom of heaven is like a man of noble status who, early in the morning, goes out to hire workers for his vineyard.
He agreed with the workers to pay them one dinar for each day, then sent them to work in his field.
And the generous man went out at nine o'clock and saw some men standing in the market area doing nothing.
He said to them: "Go too and work in my field, and I will give you the reward you deserve."
They went to work at Al-Karm. "He left again around noon and also at three o'clock, hiring additional workers."
And around five o'clock he went out again and found others standing in the market area, so he asked them: "Why have you stood here all day without doing any work?"
So they said to him: "No one has hired us." He replied to them: "Go you too and work in my field."
At the end of the day, the generous master told his agent: "Summon the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with those who came last, and ending with those who came first."
Those who had rented the fifth hour each took a dinar.
Then those who had rented came, and they thought they would get more, so each of them also took a dinar.
So they took them, and began to complain against the generous owner.
They say: "The ones who hired the last group worked only one hour, and they have paid us as much as we paid for ourselves, even though we worked the entire day under the scorching sun!"
Then the generous man said to one of them: "I have not wronged you, my friend! Didn't we agree to work in exchange for one dinar?"
Your pay, take it and go. For I want to give you the payment I received yesterday, the very payment I gave you.
Is it not my right to do with what I have as I please? Or have you been deceived because I am good with others?
"In this way, the first will become last, and the last will become first." Jesus announces His death and resurrection.
While Jesus was on his way to the city of Jerusalem, he took the twelve apart and said to them:
"Here we are going to Jerusalem, where the Son of Man will be delivered over to the elders of the priests and the teachers of the law, and they will condemn him to death."
And they will deliver him over to the disbelievers to mock him, flog him, and crucify him. But on the third day he will rise again from the dead. The Greatest is the one who serves.
Then came to him the mother of Zabdi's son with her son, and she prostrated herself before him to ask him for something.
Then Jesus said to her, "What do you want?" She replied, "Return them to my kingdom, and let my two sons sit, one at your right hand and the other at your left."
Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I am going to drink?" They said to him, "Yes, we can."
He said to them: "As for my cup, you will drink from it; but as for sitting at my right or at my left, I cannot give it to anyone except as the Father has allotted it to them."
When the remaining ten heard this request, they became extremely angry with the two brothers.
At that time Jesus called them to him and said: "You know that the rulers of the nations exercise absolute authority over their peoples, and their leaders exercise power over them.
But this should not be among you; rather, he who desires to be great among you must become your servant.
And whoever desires to be first among you, let him be your servant.
Likewise, the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many. Jesus heals two blind men
While they were leaving the city of Arich, a large crowd followed them.
There were blind men sitting by the roadside. When they heard that Jesus was coming near the road, they cried out: "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us."
People silenced them and told them to be quiet, but they raised their voices even more: "O Lord, O David's son, have mercy on us."
Then Jesus stopped and called them, saying, "What do you want me to do for you?"
They said: "O Lord, open our eyes."
Jesus opened their eyes, touched their eyes, and immediately they saw and followed him.
The king lives
And as they approached the city of Jerusalem, and came to the village of Bethphage near the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples,
He said to them: "Go to the village in front of you. You will find a small donkey beside its mother, tied up; unfasten it and bring it to me."
And if anyone tells you both, saying: "Your Lord needs them, and will soon restore them,"—
This happened so that what the Prophet said might be fulfilled.
Say to the beloved city of Jerusalem: "O beloved Jerusalem. 5:21 Literally, 'Daughter, Jerusalem.' See, your king is coming to you, humble and riding on a donkey, a small donkey, the colt prepared for labor."
Then the two disciples went and did just as Jesus had said.
Then they brought the little donkey and its mother, and placed their garments on them, and Jesus sat upon the garments.
Most people laid their mats on the road. But others cut branches from trees and laid them on the road.
And the crowds walking ahead of him and behind him were shouting: "The king lives! #The king lives. 9:21 Literally: 'Yeshu'na.' In Hebrew, this means 'Deliver us now.' Most likely, this is a shout of praise to God and His king, Messiah. Repeated in verse 15. The son of David lives. 'Blessed is the one coming in the name of the Lord.' The king lives in his throne."
And when Jesus entered the city of Jerusalem, the whole city trembled. And people were asking: "Who is this man?"
And the crowd following him said: "This is Jesus of Nazareth, from Galilee." Jesus in the Temple
Then Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling doves.
He said to them: "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer' #MyHouse... prayer. 13:21 from the Book of Isaiah 56:7. But you are turning it into 'a den of thieves!' #den of thieves. 13:21 from the Book of Jeremiah 7:11."
Some blind and lame people came to him in the courtyard of the Temple, and he healed them.
And the senior priests and teachers of the law saw the wonders that had been done, and they saw the children shouting in the courtyard of the Temple: "The king lives! The son of David lives!" and they were greatly angered, saying to him: "Do you not hear what these children are saying?"
Then Jesus answered, "Yes, but did you not read in the book: 'By the lips of infants and of breast-fed children, you have made a song'?"
Then Jesus left them and went out of the city to the town of Bethany, and spent the night there. Power of faith
While Jesus was going early in the morning to the city, he was hungry.
He saw a date tree by the roadside, so he went to it, but found on it only leaves, and said to it: "You will not bear fruit anymore." And immediately the date tree withered.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed and asked him, "How did the fig tree dry up like this?"
And He replied to them: "Truly, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not be able to perform even what I have performed with a date-palm tree; but if you say to this mountain, 'Throw yourself down from your place into the sea,' your words will come true."
And whatever you ask for when you approach, you will receive, if you believe." Doubt concerning Jesus' authority
And Jesus went to the Temple courts, and the elders of the priests and the teachers of the people came to him while he was teaching, and said to him: "Tell us by what authority you are doing these things, and who gave you this authority?"
Then Jesus replied to them: "I will also ask you, so that I may ask you back: By what authority do I perform these deeds?"
Where did John's baptism come from? From God or from people? So they began to debate this among themselves and said: "If we say it came from God, then they would ask us: 'Why didn't you believe in Him?'"
And if we say that they are among the people, then we fear the people, because they all consider John a prophet.
Therefore they answered Jesus and said, "We do not know." Then Jesus said to them, "Nor do I tell you by what authority I perform these deeds." Like the two sons
Jesus said to them: "What do you think about this story: A man had two sons. He went to the first and said to him: 'My son, go today and work in my vineyard.'"
Then the son replied: "I don't want to go." But he changed his mind and went.
Then the father went to his other son and asked him to do the same. The son replied: "Yes, sir, I will go." But he did not go.
So which of the two sons did what his father wanted? They said, "The first one." He said to them, "Truly, I tell you, the tax collectors and the sinners will precede you into the kingdom of God."
For John the Baptist came to show you the way of truth, and yet you did not believe in him; but those who collected taxes and served in the temple believed in him. Even when you saw what they did, you did not repent or believe in him. It is like the son of the rich man.
And they heard another parable: There was a man who had land, so he planted a vineyard, surrounded it with a fence, dug a wine press in it, and built a watchtower. Then he leased it out to some farmers and went away far away.
And when the time for harvesting grapes came, he sent his servants to the farmers to get his share of grapes.
But the farmers seized their servants, beat one of them, killed another, and threw the third into the well.
Then the owner sent more slaves than he had sent the first time. The farmers treated them in the same way.
Finally, he sent his son, and said to himself: "They will respect my son."
"But when the peasants saw that this was the son of the ruler, they consulted among themselves and said: 'This is the heir; let us kill him so that we may seize his inheritance.'"
They seized him, threw him outside the al-Karm, and killed him.
"What do you think the generous one will do with those farmers when he returns?"
They said to him: "They will be dealt with in a terrible way because they are evil, and then kindness will be shown to other farmers who will give him the harvest in the season of harvest."
Jesus said to them, "Did you not read in the Scriptures: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone'? The Lord has done this, and it is a great thing in our eyes?"
Therefore I tell you: the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a people that bears fruit appropriate to the kingdom.
Everyone who falls on this stone will break, and everyone who falls on the stone will be crushed!
And when the elders and the Pharisees heard things said by Jesus, they realized that He was speaking about them.
Therefore they tried to arrest him, but they were afraid of the people who regarded Jesus as a prophet.
Like a wedding feast
And Jesus once again spoke to them in parables, saying:
The kingdom of heaven is like a king giving a wedding banquet for his son.
And the king sent his servants to call the guests to the wedding banquet, but they would not come.
Then the king sent out two more servants and said to them: "Tell those who have been invited that the banquet is ready. My fattened oxen have been slaughtered. Everything is prepared. Come to the wedding banquet."
But the invited guests did not care about it, and each one continued on his way. One went to work in his field, and another to his trade.
As for the rest, they seized the king's slaves and beat them and killed them.
At that time, the king was angry and sent his army to kill those murderers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants: "The wedding feast is ready, but those invited do not deserve it."
Therefore, they went to the corners of the streets and invited everyone they found to attend the wedding feast.
They went out into the streets, gathering everyone they found—sinners or the righteous—until the banquet hall was filled with guests.
And when the king entered to see the guests, he saw a man there who was not wearing wedding garments.
The king said to him: "My friend, how did you enter here without wearing wedding garments, yet the man remained silent?"
The king said to his attendants: "Bind his hands and feet, and throw him outside into the darkness, where people weep and bite their teeth."
For many call, but few are chosen. The Pharisees try to trap Jesus.
The Pharisees went off and gathered together to discuss how they might trap Jesus with something he said.
So they sent to him some of their disciples together with men from the group of Herod, and said to him: "Teacher, we know that you are truthful and that you teach the way of God with sincerity. And that you do not show favor to anyone, because you do not regard people's positions.
Then he told us your opinion: is it permissible to pay taxes to the emperor or not?
But Jesus knew their evil intent, and said to them: "You hypocrites, why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the currency you use. So they brought him a dinar.
He said to them: "Whose image and inscription on the dinar is this?"
They said to him, "It belongs to the Caesar." He said to them, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and give to God what is God's."
When they heard this reply, they were greatly astonished and abandoned it, going on their way. The Al-Saduqis are trying to mislead Jesus.
On that day, some of the Al-Saduqis came to him, those who say that there is no resurrection, and they asked him:
"O teacher," Moses said. 24:22 See Deuteronomy 25:5, 6. "If a man dies without children, his brother shall marry his widow and have a child who will be considered his brother's son."
Between us there were seven brothers; the first one married and died without children, so his brother married his widow.
And this happened to the brother and the second and the third until the seventh.
And after they all died, the woman also died.
So, from among the seven, who will be the wife on the Day of Resurrection? For they have all married them.»
Then Jesus answered them: "You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures, nor do you know the power of God."
So understand that in the eternal life after the resurrection of the dead, people will neither marry nor be married, but will be like the angels in heaven.
As for the resurrection of the dead, didn't you read what Allah has said?
‹I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.› #I am … Jacob. 32:22 Exodus 3:6. "God is not the God of the dead, but of the living."
When people heard this teaching, they were greatly astonished. The greatest of all warnings
When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had answered the Sadducees, they silenced each other and gathered together.
And a Sharia expert asked him, trying to provoke him, saying:
"O teacher, what is the greatest advice in the religion?"
Then Jesus said to him: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.” #Love the Lord... your mind. 37:22 From Deuteronomy 6:5.
This is the first and greatest commandment.
The second commandment is similar to the first: "Love your neighbor as yourself." From Luke 10:25–37, we understand that "neighbor" refers to every person in need of help. "Love your neighbor as yourself." Leviticus 19:18.
The entire Sharia and the books of the prophets revolve around these two commands: "Christ is the Lord David."
And as the Pharisees were gathering around him, Jesus asked them:
"What do you think about Jesus? Who is his father?" The Pharisees replied: "He is the son of David."
He said to them: "How did David call him 'Sida' when he said, while under the influence of the Spirit:"
«Said the Lord to my master: Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies beneath your feet»?
If David calls Christ Lord, how can he be his son?"
No one could answer him with anything, and no one dared to ask him further questions thereafter.
Jesus criticizes the religious leaders
Then Jesus spoke to the crowd and to his disciples.
He said: "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees followed Moses in interpreting the law."
Keep and practice everything they tell you, but do not carry out their deeds. For they speak, yet do not act according to what they say.
They burden people with difficult obligations, while they themselves show no willingness to make any effort to comply with them.
"All the good deeds they do are done so that people may see them and witness their piety, thereby increasing the burdens they carry. #Their burdens. 5:23 Some Jews would write specific passages from the Scriptures and place them in small leather pouches, then tie them with strings of cloth to their foreheads or left arms, thereby demonstrating the strength of their faith, and they would also lengthen the sleeves of their garments."
They love sitting in the best seats at banquets, and in the front seats in meetings.
They love to be greeted specially in the markets, and to be called: "O teacher."
"As for you, do not let people call you 'Teacher,' for you have one Teacher, and all of you are brothers."
Do not call anyone on earth "My father," for you have one Father, who is the heavenly Father.
Do not call people to you, "Master!" for you have one Master, Christ.
The greatest among you is he who is kindliest to his brother.
Whoever exalts himself will have his pride removed by Allah, and whoever humbles himself will have his status raised by Allah.
"O you hypocrites and teachers of the religion who are deceitful! You are closing the gates of heaven's kingdom to people, so that you yourselves do not enter, nor do you allow those who try to enter to enter."
"O you hypocrites and teachers of the religion who are deceitful! For you deceive widows and steal their homes. You perform long prayers merely to draw attention, so you will suffer a heavier punishment."
"O you hypocrites and those who are the most prominent among the scholars! Indeed, you travel by sea and land in order to gain a single follower for you. And when you have gained it, you make him deserve Hell, only half of what you yourselves deserve."
"O blind guides! Those who say: 'If someone swears by the Sacred Structure, he is not bound to uphold his oath; but if he swears by the gold in the Sacred Structure, he is bound to uphold it!' "
O blind fool! Which is greater: the gold in the temple, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?
And they say: "Oath taken upon the altar is not binding in regard to its preservation, but if someone takes an oath upon the offering placed on the altar, then he is bound to preserve it!"
O the blind one! Which is greater: the offering upon the altar, or the altar that makes the offering holy?
For if anyone swears by the altar, he swears by it and by all that is upon it.
And if anyone swears by the Holy Place, he swears by it and by that which dwells in it.
And if anyone swears by the heavens, he swears by the Throne of God and by those who are seated upon it.
"O you hypocrites and those who are the showy teachers of the religion! You impose a tenth of everything, even of the dill and the fennel #fennel. 23:23 The fennel was used in cooking as a spice, and it also has some medicinal uses. The coriander too. Yet you have neglected justice, mercy, and honesty. It was your duty to do these things, without neglecting the rest."
O blind guides, you lift the mosquito from your cup, but you drink the camel!
"O you hypocrites and teachers of the religion who appear pious! While you clean the outside of the cup or plate, greed and corruption fill your inner selves."
O blind Pharisees, wash first the inside of the cup, so that the outside may also be clean.
"O you hypocrites and those who are the teachers of the religion, you are like white-coated graves. They appear beautiful from the outside, but within them are full of bones and all kinds of impurity."
Like this, you too appear pious outwardly, but within yourselves you are full of show and evil.
"O you hypocrites and teachers of the religion who are showy! For you build tombs for the prophets and adorn the graves of the pious."
And you say: "If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have participated in killing the prophets."
Thus, you affirm that you are descendants of those who killed the prophets.
So complete what your ancestors began.
'O you who live and offspring of snakes! How can you escape the punishment of Hell?'
Therefore, I inform you that I will send to you prophets and wise men and teachers. You will kill some of them, crucify others, and flog others in your synagogues, and you will drive them from city to city.
Therefore, you will be held accountable for the blood of every innocent person killed on the earth: from the blood of Abel the innocent to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah. #Abel … Zechariah. 35:23 The first and last who were killed according to time and according to the text of the Old Testament scriptures. (See Genesis 4:8, and 2 Chronicles 24:20) The one who killed between the sanctuary and the altar.
"I tell you the truth, the punishment for all these crimes will fall on this generation. Jesus warns the people of Jerusalem city."
'O Holy One, O Holy One, O You who kill the prophets and bring the messengers of God to you! I have often longed to gather your children together, like a hen gathering her chicks under her wings! But you refused.'
See, your house will be left empty and abandoned!
For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say: "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord." #Blessed... the Lord. 39:23 From Psalm 118:26.»
Jesus announces the destruction of the Temple
And Jesus went out from the temple courts. While he was walking, his disciples came to him, because they wanted to show him the buildings of the temple.
Then Jesus said to them, "Look at all these buildings! I tell you the truth, not one stone will be left upon another; everything will be destroyed!"
While Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came to him privately and said to him: "Tell us when these events will take place, and what are the signs of your return and the end of the age?"
Then Jesus replied: "Be on your guard lest you be deceived."
Many will come and claim my name, saying, "I am Christ," and they will deceive many.
You will hear about wars and revolutions; do not be afraid. Such things must happen, but they will not mark the end of the world."
For a nation will rise against a nation, and a kingdom against a kingdom. Earthquakes and famines will occur.
But all of this will be the first signs of labor.
"So they will deliver you over to punishment and kill some of you. And all peoples will hate you because of my name."
At that time, many will abandon their faith, one will hand another over to the authorities, and some will hate others.
And false prophets will appear, and they will deceive many.
Due to the increase in enmity, the love of many believers will cool down.
But he who remains faithful until the end—this one will be saved.
And the good news of God's kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the world as a witness to the Gentiles, and then comes the end.
When you see "the corrupted impurity" #the corrupted impurity. 15:24 Look at Daniel 9:27, 12:11, and also Matthew 11:31. The one Daniel the prophet referred to, standing in the Holy Place—so that the reader may understand this statement.
Let them go up at that time all the people of the Jewish region to the mountains,
Nor will the one on the surface take his possessions from the house.
The worker in the field does not go home to take his cloak.
And what hardship was faced by pregnant women and nursing mothers during those days!
But pray that you may not flee in winter or on a Saturday day.
Because at that time there will be an immense shortage never seen since the beginning of the world, and never to be seen again.
If Allah had not decided to shorten those days, no one would have remained alive. But for His chosen people, Allah will shorten those days.
If any one of you says to you: "Here is Christ!" or "There he is!" do not believe him.
Because more false messiahs will appear, and more false prophets. And they will perform miracles and wonders to deceive those whom God has chosen, if they are able.
Here I have told you everything before it happened.
"Someone might say: 'Behold, Christ is in the wilderness!' Do not go there. Or he might say: 'Behold, he is in one of the rooms!' Do not believe him."
For just as lightning comes from the east and shines to the west, so will the Son of Man appear.
Whenever you find a corpse, you will also find vultures.
Immediately after the distress that will occur in those days, <the sun will grow dark, and the moon will not give its light. The stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.>
At that time, the Sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and the tribes of the earth will be scattered, and they will see the Son of Man coming upon the clouds with great power and majesty.
And his angels will send forth with a loud trumpet call, gathering those whom he has chosen from the four directions, from the farthest part of the sky to its utmost edge.
Learn from the date palm tree. As soon as its branches become flexible and its leaves appear, you will know that summer is near.
In the same way, when you see all these things, you will know that the time is near. 33:24 Compare with Luke 21:31. It is at the door.
I tell you the truth: this generation will not pass away until all of these things happen.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. Only the Father knows.
"But no one knows when that day and that hour will come, neither do the angels in heaven know it, nor I Himself; but only the Father knows."
"As was the case in the days of Noah, so it will be when the Son of Man comes."
Before the flood, people used to eat, drink, marry, and give their daughters in marriage until the day Noah entered the boat.
And they did not know what would happen until the flood came and took them away. So it will also be at the coming of the Son of Man.
At that time, two men are working in a field, one is taken and the other is left behind.
Two women grind the grains on the millstone, one takes one and leaves the other.
"Wake up, for you do not know when your Lord will come."
Make sure that if the homeowner knew any hour of the night the thief intended to come, he would have woken up and prevented the thief from breaking into his house.
Therefore, also be ready, for the Son of Man will come at a time when you do not expect. The righteous servant and the wicked servant
Who is the trustworthy, wise servant whom the master appoints to be in charge of his servants, to give them their food at the proper time?
O joy to that servant who, when his master comes, finds him fulfilling his duty.
I tell you the truth, he will entrust it to all of his possessions.
But the evil servant says to himself: "My lord will be delayed."
He starts by beating his servants, and begins eating and drinking with the drunkards.
Then the master of that servant comes on a day not expected, at a moment not known.
He will punish him and put him among the hypocrites, where people weep and persist in their teeth.
Like the ten girls
At that time, the kingdom of heaven resembles ten young girls who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them are foolish, and five are intelligent.
The fools took their lamps, but they did not take any extra oil with them.
As for the smart ones, they take an extra oil in their lamps along with the candles.
Then the groom delayed, and all the girls fell asleep and dozed off.
"But at midnight someone cried out: 'The groom is coming, let us get ready to meet him.'"
At that time, the girls woke up and lit their lamps.
The foolish told the wise: "Give us a little of your oil, for our lamps are about to go out."
The wise ones replied: "We cannot, for it is not enough for us. Go then to the sellers and buy oil for yourselves."
While they were going out to buy oil, the groom arrived. The clever ones were ready, so they entered with him to the wedding banquet. Then the door was closed.
And finally the other girls arrived and said: "O master, O master, open for us the door."
But he said: "I say, but the truth is, I do not know you!"
Therefore, wake up, for you do not know either the day or the hour when the Son of Man will come. Like the three servants
Similarly, the kingdom of heaven is like a man who was about to set out on a journey. So he called his servants and entrusted to them all his possessions.
So he gave one of them five sacks. 15:25 Literally "measures or jars"; a measure is equivalent to about 27 to 36 kilograms of gold, silver, or copper. From the money, he gave two sacks to the second, and one sack to the third. Each gave according to his ability. Then they all set off immediately.
The one who took the five sacks immediately invested them in trade and thus earned five more sacks.
And he acted in the same way as before, taking two sacks and gaining two more.
As for the one who took only one sack, he went and dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master's money in it.
After a long time, Master returned and began to punish them.
The man who took the five sacks then gained five more and said: "My lord, I was given five sacks, and these are five more sacks that I have earned."
His mistress said to him: "Well done, O faithful and trustworthy servant. You have been trustworthy with little, so I will entrust you with much. Enter and share in the joy of your master."
Then came the one who took the two sacks, and said: "My Lord, I was given two sacks, and I have earned two more."
His mistress said to him: "Well done, O faithful and trustworthy servant. You have been trustworthy with little, so I will entrust you with much. Enter and share in the joy of your master."
Then came the one who took one sack, and said: "Lord, I know you are a hard man; you reap from a field you did not plant, and harvest from fields you did not sow."
And I was afraid of you, so I went and hid your bag in the ground. Take your money.›
Then his master replied: "You are a wicked and dishonest man. As long as you know that I reap from a harvest I did not plant, and I harvest from fields I did not sow,"
Why didn't you deposit my money in the bank, and when I returned, was I taking my money with interest?
Therefore, take from it the sack and give it to the owner of the ten sacks.
For he will give more to those who have, and will take away from those who have nothing.
As for that servant who is not beneficial to anything, cast him outside, into darkness, where people weep and sharpen their teeth. The son of man is religion.
And when the Son of Man comes in His glory with all His angels, He will sit on His glorious throne.
Then all nations will gather before him. He will separate some of them from others, just as a shepherd separates the goats from the sheep in his flock.
Then he will place the rhinoceros on his right side, and the giraffe on his left side.
Then the King will say to those on his right: "Come, O those whom my father favored! Take the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world."
For I was hungry and you fed me. I was thirsty and you gave me drink. I was a stranger and you welcomed me.
I was naked, so you clothed me. I was sick, so you cared for me. I was imprisoned, so you visited me.
"O the pious ones: 'O Lord, when did I see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and quench Your thirst?'”
And when you saw me strange, did you take me in? Or when I was naked, did you clothe me?
And whenever we saw you ill or imprisoned, we visited you.
The king says: "I tell you the truth, whatever you have done for one of my weak brothers has been done for me."
Then the king says to those standing on his left: "Depart from me, you accursed ones, and go to the eternal fire prepared for Satan and his angels."
For I was hungry and you did not feed me. I was thirsty and you did not give me drink.
I was stranger, and you did not bring me. I was naked, and you did not clothe me. I was sick and imprisoned, and you did not visit me.›
"Regarding the wicked: 'O Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or imprisoned, and did not we provide for Your needs?'"
"The king says: 'I tell you the truth, when you neglected to do it for one of my weak brothers, you neglected to do it for me.'"
And thus the wicked go to eternal punishment, while the righteous go to eternal life.
Jewish leaders are plotting to kill Jesus
After finishing this saying, Jesus said to his disciples:
"You know that Easter's tomorrow, and the son of man will be delivered into the hands of his enemies to be crucified."
The high priests and elders of the people had gathered in the palace of the High Priest, Qayfa.
And they plotted to arrest Jesus by deception and kill him.
And they said: "We should not do this during the festival, lest we cause a disturbance among the people." A woman poured perfume on Jesus
And Jesus was in the town of Bethany, in the house of Simon the Leper,
A woman came to him, and with her was a valuable perfume in a marble bottle; she poured it on his head while he was eating.
And when they saw this, their students became angry and said: "Is this extravagance?"
This perfume could have been sold for a large sum of money given to the poor.
Jesus knew what they were saying, and He said to them: "Why are you disturbing this woman? She has done a wonderful thing for Me."
The poor will always be with you, #ThePoor... always. 11:26 See Deuteronomy 15:11. As for me, I will not always be with you.
I poured the perfume on my body to prepare for burial.
I tell you the truth: wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the world, something similar to what this woman did will also take place, and everyone will remember it. Judas Iscariot betrays Jesus
At that time one of the twelve, whose name was Judas Iscariot, went to the elders of the priests,
He said to them, "What will you give me if Jesus is delivered to you?" So they brought him thirty pieces of silver.
From that moment, Judas began to look for an appropriate opportunity to deliver Jesus to them. At the Passover meal
On the first days of the unleavened bread festival, the disciples came to him and said to him: "Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal for you?"
Then Jesus said to him: "Go to Falan in the village and tell him: 'The Teacher says: My time has come, and I will celebrate the Feast with my disciples in your house.'"
The disciples did what Jesus had told them, and prepared the Passover meal.
And when evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with his twelve disciples.
While they were eating, he said to them: "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."
They grieved and began to ask him one after another: "Are you indeed I, O Lord?"
Then Jesus answered: "The one who dips his hand with me in the dish is the one who will betray me."
The Son of Man is coming according to what is written about Him, but woe to the man who betrays the Son of Man! It would have been better for him if he had never been born at all!»
Then Judas, who was about to betray him, asked him, "Is it I, Teacher?" Jesus replied to him, "You are, as you have said!" The Lord's Supper
While they were eating, He took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to the disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is my body."
Then he took a cup of wine, gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying: "Drink from it, all of you."
For this is my blood, the blood of the covenant which is shed for many, to forgive their sins.
And I say to you, I will not drink this wine until the day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of my father.
Then they sang some songs, and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus foretells Peter's denial.
Then Jesus said to them: "All of you will lose your faith in me this night, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'"
But after I rise from the dead, I will precede you to Galilee."
And Peter replied: "Even if all others lose their faith in you, I will never lose my faith in you."
Then Jesus said to him, "Truly, I tell you, tonight, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times."
Peter said to him, "Even if I have to die with you, I will not deny you!" All the disciples said the same thing. Jesus prayed alone.
At that time Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples, "Sit here while I go over there to pray."
And with him were Peter and the sons of Zabdi; and he began to feel sorrow and anxiety.
Then he said to them: "My sorrow is so great that it almost kills me! Stay here and keep watch with me."
And Jesus withdrew a little from them, and he bowed his head to the ground and began to pray: "Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me—this cup. 39:26 That is, the cup of suffering and pain. Repeated in verse 42. But not as I will, but as you will."
He came to his disciples and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, "Did you not manage to stay awake with me for one hour?"
Be alert and pray so that you may not experience it. Your spirit longs for it, but your body is weak.
And he stepped back a little to pray, and said: "O Father, if it is not possible for me to pass over this cup, yet I must drink it; then let Your will be done."
Then he returned again and found them asleep, because drowsiness had weighed down their eyes.
Then he left them and went a third time to pray, and said the same words he had said first.
Then He returned to His disciples and said to them: "Are you still sleeping and resting? See, the hour has come, and the Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of sinners."
Stand up, and let us go. Here comes the man who has betrayed me.» The Arrest of Jesus
While he was still speaking, Judas one of the twelve appeared, together with a large group carrying swords and spears, whom the chief priests and elders of the people had sent.
The traitor gave them a sign and said: "The one approaching is the man we are looking for, seize him."
Now Jesus was near, and said to him, "Rise, teacher!" and touched him.
Then Jesus said to him, "Friend, do what you came for." At that moment they came near, took hold of Jesus, and seized him.
And one of those who were with Jesus took his sword and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back in its place, for whoever kills with the sword will die by the sword."
Do you not realize that I am able to call upon the Father, who will send me more than twelve bands of angels right now?
But if it did happen, how would the books that predicted such events come true?
At that moment Jesus said to the crowd: "Have you come out with swords and clubs, as you came out against a criminal? I was sitting every day in the temple courts teaching, and you never laid a hand on me!"
But this event took place as the prophets had written. Then all the disciples abandoned him and fled! Jesus before the Jewish leaders
Then those who had seized him took him to the house of Qayfa, the high priest, where the religious scholars and elders gathered.
But Peter followed him from a distance and went into the courtyard of the high priest's house. He entered and sat with the guards to see what would happen in the end.
The high priests and all the members of the Jewish council were searching for false witness against Jesus in order to put him to death.
But they found nothing, although many false witnesses came forward and testified against him with lies. Finally, two men came forward,
They said: "This man, this man. 61:26 That is Jesus; even his enemies avoided speaking his name! He said: 'I can destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"
The high priest stood up and said: "Shall not you defend yourselves against all the accusations made against you by these two men?"
But Jesus remained silent. Then the high priest said to him, "I urge you in the name of the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."
And Jesus answered him, "Yes, I am he, as you said. I tell you: from now on, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of God's throne, and coming with the clouds of heaven."
At that time, the high priest tore his garments and said: "God has wronged us; what need is there for witnesses anymore? You have just heard him blaspheme against God."
By what are you judging? They replied: "He deserves death."
At that time, they spat at him, struck him with their fists, and beat him.
And they said to him, "Tell us, O Christ, who struck you?" Peter denied Jesus
Meanwhile, Peter was sitting in the courtyard outside. A servant of the high priest came to him and said, "You too were with Jesus of Nazareth."
But Peter denied it in front of everyone and said, "I do not understand what you are saying!"
Then he went out to the square's gate, and another servant said to those present: "This man was with Jesus the Nazarene."
Then Peter denied it again, and swore, saying: "I do not know this man."
A short while later, those standing there approached him and said to him: "Indeed, you are one of them; your accent reveals that you are from Gilali."
At that time he began to curse #curses. 74:26 That is, he swears upon himself to curse if he is lying! He takes an oath and says, "I do not know this man." And immediately the duck cries out.
At that moment Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him: "You will deny me three times before the rooster crows," and he went out and wept bitterly.
Jesus before Pontius Pilate
The next day in the morning, the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered and consulted together to put Jesus to death.
They took him away and delivered him to the governor Pilate. Judas commits suicide.
When Judas saw that they had decided to condemn Jesus to death, he regretted what he had done. So he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the elders and the high priests.
He said to them: "I have erred in delivering an innocent person over to be killed." They replied to him: "What does this have to do with us? Consider this matter yourself."
Judah cast the coins into the temple, then left, and went and hanged himself.
The senior priests took pieces of coin and said: "It is not permitted to place this money in the temple treasury because it is the price of a human life."
They decided to buy it from him to make it a cemetery for the homeless.
And for this reason, the field is known as the "Blood Field" to this day.
Thus, what God said through the prophet Jeremiah: "Take thirty shekels of silver, which the children of Israel agreed to pay as the price."
And they bought the field of Aceldama, as the Lord commanded me. #Take … the Lord. 10:27 See the book of Zechariah 11:12-13, and the book of Jeremiah 32:6-9. Jesus before Pilate
And Jesus stood before the governor, and asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" To which Jesus replied, "You have said so yourself."
And when the senior priests and elders complained about it, he said nothing.
Then Pilate asked him: "Do you not hear all the serious charges brought against you?"
But Jesus did not give Pilate any reply to any of the accusations brought against him. Pilate was amazed by his silence. Pilate failed to release Jesus.
The governor was accustomed, on Holy Week, to release a prisoner chosen by the people.
There was a prisoner well known for his appearance, named Barabas. #Barabas. 16:27 Or "Jesus Barabas" as in some Greek manuscripts.
When the people gathered, Pilate asked them: "Whom do you want me to release to you: Jesus the Messiah, or Barabbas?"
Pilate knew that they had delivered Jesus to him out of envy.
While Pilate was seated on his judgment seat, his wife sent him a message saying: "Do not act against this innocent man, for I have been disturbed all night by a dream about him."
But the elders and the priests convinced the crowd to demand the release of Barabbas and the crucifixion of Jesus.
The governor said: "Which of the two do you want me to release?" They replied: "Barabas."
Pilate asked them, "What should I do with Jesus, the Messiah?" And they all answered, "Crucify him."
Then Pilate said to them, "Why? What is his crime?" But they shouted even louder: "Crucify him."
And when Pilate saw that his efforts were futile, and that chaos had already begun, he took some water, washed his hands in front of the crowd, and said: "I am not responsible for the death of this man; it is your responsibility."
So the entire people said: "His blood is on us and on our children."
At that time, Pilate released Barabbas to them, and ordered that Jesus be flogged and handed over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
Then the officials' soldiers took Jesus to the governor's palace and gathered a guard around him.
They took off his clothes and put a purple robe on him. #Put on him … the color. 28:27 Or indigo, as a mockery, for this is the color of royal robes.
They placed a crown of thorns on his head, put a reed in his right hand, and bowed before him mockingly, saying, "The king of the Jews lives!"
Then they spat on him, took the fortress from his hand, and began to beat him on the head.
And when they had finished mocking him, they removed his garment and put on his own clothes, and led him out to crucify him. Jesus on the cross
When they went out, they found a man from the city of Kerion named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross.
And when they reached a place known as "The Cranium," meaning "the place of the skull,"
Give Jesus a drink mixed with wine. But when he tasted it, he refused to drink.
And when they crucified Jesus, they divided his garments among themselves and cast lots for them.
Then they sat there guarding him.
And they put a sign above his head saying, "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews," as a charge.
And two robbers were brought to Jesus, one on his right and the other on his left.
The Maronites disdained them and shook their heads.
They say: "You who are to destroy the Temple and build a new one in three days, if you are the Son of God, prove it by descending from the cross!"
And he mocked the senior priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders, and they said:
"He has delivered others, but he cannot deliver himself! He is the king of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him!"
Placed his trust in God; let God deliver him now if He wills. Didn't He say, "I am the Son of God"?
Similarly, the two criminals crucified with him were cursing him with similar words. The death of Jesus
From noon until three in the afternoon, darkness covered the entire earth.
And around three o'clock, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying: "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?" #Eli... my God, why have you forsaken me? 46:27 From Psalm 22:1. That is: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
And when some of those standing there heard it, they said, "He is calling out Elijah!" #Calling out Elijah. 47:27 The Hebrew word "Eli" and the Aramaic "Elo" resemble the name "Elijah," a well-known prophet who lived around 850 B.C.
Then one of the standing there rushed forward, took a sponge, soaked it in vinegar, placed it on a long stick, and offered it to him to drink.
As for the rest, they said: "Let us wait and see if Elijah will come to rescue him!"
Then Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded the spirit.
The sanctuary curtain parted #Sanctuary Curtain. 51:27 The curtain that separated the Most Holy Place from the rest of the Jewish Temple. The Most Holy Place represented the divine presence. It split in two from top to bottom, and the earth trembled, and the rocks split apart.
The tombs opened, and the bodies of many of the holy believers who had died rose up.
And after Jesus had risen, those bodies came out of their tombs, entered the Holy City, and appeared to many.
As for the Roman officer, #Roman officer. 54:27 Literally, "commander of a hundred." The guards who were guarding Jesus' body, when they saw the earthquake and the other events, were greatly frightened and said, "This was truly the Son of God!"
There were women standing at a distance, having followed Jesus from Galilee to serve him.
From them are Mary of Migdal, Mary mother of Jacob and Joseph, and also the mother of the sons of Zabdi. #son of Zabdi. 56:27 Jacob and John. Jesus' burial
And when evening came, a rich man named Joseph from the town of Ramah came to Jerusalem. He was also one of Jesus' disciples.
He went to Pilate and asked him for the body of Jesus. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Then Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a new linen cloth,
Then he placed it in his new tomb, which he had dug out of the rock, and rolled a large stone over the entrance to the tomb before leaving.
Mary of Magdala, and the other Mary, stood beside the tomb. The guards of Jesus' tomb
The next day, after the Sabbath had ended, the chief priests and Pharisees met with Pilate,
They said to him: "O Lord, we remember that this deceiver said before he died: 'I will rise from death after three days.'"
He issued a command to guard the tomb until the third day, so that his disciples would not come and steal the body, then say to the people: "He has risen from the dead." And this deception would be worse than the first deception.
Pilate said to them: "Take some soldiers from the cohort and go and verify everything according to your knowledge."
They went and secured the tomb. They placed a seal on the stone, as they had stationed soldiers to guard it.
Rise of Jesus
And on the first day of the week, after the Sabbath was over, Mary of Magdala and Mary the other came to the tomb.
At that moment a strong earthquake occurred, because the angels of the Lord descended from heaven, went to the tomb, pushed aside the stone from the door, and sat upon it.
His appearance was bright as lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.
The guards were very afraid of him and became like dead people.
The angel said to the two women: "Do not fear, I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified."
He is not here; he rose from the dead as previously stated. Come, and look at the place where he was.
Then go quickly to your disciples and say to them: "The one who has risen from the dead will precede you to Galilee, and there you will see him." Hear, I have told you.
At that time the two women quickly left the tomb, their fear mixed with great joy, and ran to tell Jesus' disciples what had happened.
And suddenly Jesus met them and said, "Peace." So they came near to him, took hold of his feet, and bowed down to him.
Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there I will see them." False Report
While the two women were on their way, some guards went to the city and informed the senior priests of everything that had happened.
The high priests gathered with the elders, consulted among themselves, and then gave the soldiers a large amount of money.
They said to them: "Spread among people the idea that Jesus' disciples came at night and stole his body while you were sleeping."
And if this news reaches the governor, we will convince him, and you will remain safe."
The soldiers took the money and acted as they had been told. Thus, this story has spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus spoke to his disciples.
And the twelve disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had told them to go.
And when they saw him, they prostrated themselves to him, though some of them had doubts.
Then Jesus came to them and said to them: "Give me authority over all power in heaven and on earth."
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
And teach them to obey everything I have instructed you about. And remember that I will be with you always, until the end of time.
John the Baptist
This is the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
As it is written in the Book of the Prophet Isaiah: "Behold, I send my messenger before you, to prepare the way."
A human voice calling in the wilderness and saying: "Prepare the way for God. Make His paths straight."
John the Baptist came to the wilderness to baptize, calling people to be baptized as a sign of their repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
And all the inhabitants of the Jewish villages and the city of Jerusalem came to him. He baptized them in the Jordan River after they had repented of their sins.
His clothes were made of camel hair, and he had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
And he would declare and say: "After me will come a man greater than I, and I am not worthy to unloose the strap of his sandals."
I will be your baptism in water, but he will be your baptism in the Holy Spirit." Baptism of Jesus
At that time, Jesus came from Nazareth in the region of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
And as he came out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and he saw the Holy Spirit descending upon him in the form of a dove.
A voice came from heaven: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." The Experience of Jesus
And Jesus took the Spirit alone into the wilderness.
And there were forty days facing experiences of the devil. There were wild animals, and angels serving him. Jesus chose some of his disciples.
And after John was imprisoned, Jesus came to the region of Galilee and began to proclaim the good news of God.
And he says: "The time has come, and the kingdom of God is near; turn away and believe this message."
While Simon was walking along the shore of Lake Galilee, he saw his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
Then Jesus said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
Then they closed their windows and followed him.
Then he walked a little further and saw Jacob son of Zabdi and his brother John preparing the boats.
Jesus called them, and they left their father Zabdi in the boat with the workers and followed him. Jesus casts out a demon.
Then they went to Kfar Nahum, and on the Sabbath Jesus entered the synagogue and began to teach.
They were astounded by his teaching, for he taught them as one having authority, not like my teachers of the religion.
And there was a man in the assembly who had an unclean spirit. Then the spirit cried out:
"What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are; you are the Holy One of God."
Pharisee said to Jesus: "Get out of here!"
So the unclean spirit entered the man and he convulsed, then cried out a loud cry and came out of him.
They were all disturbed, and began to say to one another: "What is this new teaching? It commands unclean spirits with power, and they obey it."
The news about him spread quickly throughout the Galilean region. Jesus healed many.
Then they left the compound and went with Jacob and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
And Samson was feverish in his bed. So they told Jesus about it.
He drew near to her, took her hand, and seated her. The fever left her, and she began to serve them.
That evening, at sunset, they brought to him many patients, among whom were those with evil spirits.
The inhabitants of the city gathered at the door of the house.
Jesus healed many who were suffering from various illnesses and cast out many demons. But Jesus did not allow the demons to speak, for they knew who He was. Preparation to proclaim the gospel
In the early morning, before sunrise, Jesus went alone to a secluded place to pray.
Samson and those with him went out to look for him.
And when they found him, they said to him: "Everyone is looking for you!"
Then Jesus answered them: "Let us go to the neighboring villages and also proclaim the message there, for I came for this."
He went throughout the region of Galilee, preaching in the synagogues and driving out demons. Jesus healed a leper.
A man from Bethsaida came to Jesus, fell on his knees, and pleaded with him, saying: "You have power to make me clean; if you wish."
Jesus opened his eyes, stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, "Yes, I want it; be healed."
The hardness left from the man, and he became pure.
Then Jesus warned him severely before sending him away.
He said to him, "Do not tell anyone what happened to you. Go and present yourself to the priest, #go... to the priest. 44:1 The priest was the one who, according to the law, decided when leprosy was considered clean. He will provide you with a report of your cleansing as commanded by Moses, #what Moses commanded. 44:1 See Leviticus 14:1-32. Thus the people will know that you have been healed."
But the man started spreading news of his healing everywhere, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter any city, but had to stay in remote places, and people came to him from all over.
Jesus heals a paralytic
After several days, Jesus returned to Capernaum, and news of his return spread.
Many people gathered until there was no room even outside the door. And Jesus was teaching them with the words of God.
They came to him with a man who was disabled and carried by four men.
But they could not bring him to Jesus due to the crowd. So they uncovered the roof where Jesus was, opened it, and lowered the mat on which the paralytic lay.
When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
Some of the Sharia scholars would sit there, and they would begin to reflect within themselves:
"Why does this man speak like this? He insults God with his words! Who besides God can forgive sins?"
Jesus knew their thoughts in their hearts, and said to them: "Why do you think these things in your hearts?"
So which is easier: to tell the disabled person, "Your sins are forgiven," or to tell them, "Get up, take your blanket, and walk"?
But I will show you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." And He said to the paralyzed man:
I tell you, get up and take your bags and go to your house!
He rose up and took the blanket immediately and walked openly in front of everyone. Everyone was astonished and praised God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this before!" When did Jesus follow?
And Jesus went back again to the lake. And He knew the crowd that had followed Him there.
As he walked, Lauy saw someone sitting at the tax collection point. He said to him, "Follow me!" and the man got up and followed him.
While Jesus was sitting in the house of Levi having dinner, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples. For many had come when Jesus called Levi, and they followed him.
When the Pharisees and the teachers of the law saw him eating with tax collectors and sinners, they asked their disciples: "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard them, he said to them: "The healthy do not need a physician, but the sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners." A question about fasting
Fasting was observed by the disciples of John and the Pharisees, so some people came to Jesus and asked him: "Why do the disciples of John and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not?"
Then Jesus said to them: "Can the bridegroom be mourning while the bridegroom is among them? As long as the bridegroom is with them, they will not be able to fast."
But there will come a time when the groom will be taken from them, and then they will fast.
No one patches an old cloth with a new piece of fabric, because the new fabric will shrink and tear the old cloth, making the hole worse.
No one puts new wine into old wineskins, for the wine will burst the skins and the wine will be spilled and the skins will be ruined. Therefore, new wine must be put into new wineskins." Jesus: Lord Sabbath
On one of the Saturdays, Jesus was walking in some fields, and his disciples began to harvest the sheaves while walking with him.
The Pharisees said to Jesus: "Look! Your disciples are doing what is not permitted on the Sabbath!"
He said to them: "Did you not read in the Book about what David did when he was in need and hungry, along with those with him?"
He entered the house of God in the time of the priest Abiathar, ate of the bread offered to God, and also gave some to those with him. Although it is not permitted for anyone else to eat this bread except the priests. #26:2 See 1 Samuel 21:1-6.
Then Jesus said to them: "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
Thus, the son of man is also the Lord of Saturday.
Jesus heals on a Saturday
And Jesus went back again to the synagogue, and there was a man with a disabled hand.
Some people watched him closely to see if he would heal him, in order to find a reason to accuse him.
He said to the man with the crippled hand: "Get up and come!"
Then he said to them: "Is it permissible to do good or harm on Saturday? Is it permissible to save a human life or to kill him?" And they remained silent.
Jesus looked around at them with anger and sorrow over their hardness of heart. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand," and he stretched it out; and it was restored to health.
The Pharisees went out and began to plot with the followers of Herod on how to kill Jesus. Many follow Jesus.
And Jesus went with his disciples to the Sea of Galilee, and a large crowd followed them from Galilee and from Judea as well.
From Jerusalem and Adom, and from the east of the Jordan River, as well as the areas surrounding Phero and Sdud, they came in great numbers. They all came to him because of what they had heard about his deeds.
Then Jesus asked his disciples to prepare a boat for him so that the crowd would not crowd him.
Since Jesus had healed many, everyone suffering from a disease would try to reach him to touch him.
And the impure spirits fell before him, crying out: "You are the Son of God!"
He strongly warns her not to reveal who they are. The Choice of the Twelve
Then Jesus went up to the mountain and called those whom He wanted, and they came with Him.
And Jesus chose twelve men and named them apostles, that they might be with him and send them out to different places.
And he gives them authority to drive out evil spirits.
And the one who was named Simon, whom Peter called Peter,
Jacob son of Zabdi and his brother John, and Jesus named them "Boanerges," meaning "sons of thunder."

And Judas Iscariot who betrayed him. The strength of Jesus from God, and Jesus returned to the house.
People gathered around him and his disciples again, until they had no time to eat.
And when Jesus' family heard about his coming, they went to take him with them, because people were saying that he was mad!
As for the scholars of the religion who came from Jerusalem, they said: "There is Belzulbo, #Belzulbo. 22:3, a name of the devil. He casts out evil spirits with the power of the chief of evil spirits."
Then Jesus came and spoke to them in parables, saying: "How can Satan cast out a demon?"
For if a kingdom divides and its people go to war, it will not last.
And if a house divides against itself, it will not last.
