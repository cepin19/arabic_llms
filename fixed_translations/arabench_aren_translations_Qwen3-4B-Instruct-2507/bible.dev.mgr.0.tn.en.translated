The genealogy of Jesus Christ (Luke 3:23-38)
This is the genealogy of Jesus Christ, who was David's son, who was Abraham's son:
Ibrahim begat Isaac. Isaac begat Jacob. Jacob begat Judah and his brothers.
And Judah took Paran and Zerah from Thamar. And Paran took Heshbon. And Heshbon took Aram.
And Aram gave Carmel. And Carmel gave Nahshon. And Nahshon gave Salmon.
Salmon Jabesh Gilead. Gilead gave Obadiah from Raaath. Obadiah gave Jeshurun.
And David died. After this, David gave Solomon the throne from the one who had taken it, Uriah.
Solomon fathered Rehoboam. Rehoboam fathered Abia. Abia fathered Asa.
And Josiah became king. And Josiah became king over Judah. And Judah became king over Jerusalem.
Zachariah fathered Joatham. Joatham fathered Ahaz. Ahaz fathered Hezekiah.
Jehozah, son of Mansi. Mansi, son of Ammon. Ammon, son of Josiah.
And Josiah took Jehoahaz and his brothers, who were the Jews exiled in Babylon.
And after the period of exile had ended among them in Babylon, Jechoniah was carried to Shealtiel. And Shealtiel was carried to Zerubbabel.
Zaribabel son of Abiud. Abiud son of Eliakim. Eliakim son of Azor.
Wa'azur jab Saaduq. Wa Saaduq jab Akhim. Wa Akhim jab Aluid.
And Iudah gave to Leah. And Leah gave to Reuven. And Reuven gave to Jacob.
Jacob gave Joseph the wife Mary, who gave Jesus, whom they called Christ.
And thus we see four generations from Abraham to David, four generations from David to the exile of the Jews in Babylon, and four generations from the exile in Babylon until the coming of Christ. The birth of Jesus Christ (Luke 2:1-7).
And how Jesus Christ was born: Mary was betrothed to a man named Joseph, and before they were married, she became pregnant by the Holy Spirit.
O Yaqi, Yusuf decided to remove her without exposing her, because a man feared God.
And he is still lingering in the story, a messenger from my Lord appeared to me in a dream, and they said: "O Joseph, son of David, do not fear to marry Mary. She will be with the power of the Holy Spirit,"
And you will get a child, and you will call him Jesus, so that he may save his people from their sins."
And this very thing has become the speech which they said "My Lord" on the tongue of the Prophet, who said:
# 7:14 The young women conceive and bear a son; and he shall be called Emmanuel. (Which means God with us.)
And when I killed Yusuf, I was overcome with sleep, and I acted as the angel from my Lord had said, and I went to his house.
And she lay down with him until the child was born, and Jesus named her.
The Wisdom of the Philosophers
At the time when Jesus was born in Bethlehem in the region of Judea, during the reign of the king Herod, magi from the east came to Jerusalem.
They said: "And who is the king of the Jews who has been born? We saw a star in the east, and now we are going to bow down."
And when the king Herod heard this, he was greatly troubled, and all of Jerusalem was also in turmoil.
The priests and scribes had no knowledge of the Jews' possessions, nor did they understand the place where the Messiah would be born.
Gavoh: "In Bethlehem, in the Jewish area, regarding this, they wrote the Prophet in the Book:"
# 5:2 "Hear, O Bethlehem of Judah, the smallest among the towns of Judah, from you shall come forth for me a ruler, who will shepherd my people, Israel."
And Herod the ruler heard the sages, without hearing of the time when the star appeared, and he followed them.
And they went to Bethlehem and said to them: "Go and see the child. And when you have seen him, tell me so that we may go and worship him."
After hearing the king's words, they saw the star that they had seen before in the east, and walked forward until they reached the platform where the child was.
And when I killed him, they saw the star, they were pleased with the stroke,
And they entered the house and met the child with Amo Maryam. Ya'ki, they descended upon their raqibahs and prostrated themselves, and they laid out their shakair, and they offered him incense and myrrh.
And your Lord warned them in a dream that they should not return to Herod, nor take another route and go back to their homeland. Their escape to Egypt
And after they had gone, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said: "Rise, take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt, and remain there until Herod has died, so that the child will not be killed by Herod."
Oayyak, Yusuf stood up, shook the child, and placed him in the night, and went to Egypt.
# He was 11:1; killed in 4:22 and lived there until Herod died, so that what the Lord said through the prophet: "I called my son from Egypt," might be fulfilled. He killed the infants in Bethlehem.
And when I killed Herod the wise men were astounded, they were deceived, and ordered the killing of all the children in Bethlehem and in the region where they were two years old or younger, according to what the wise men had said.
O Ya'ki, the matter which the Prophet Jeremiah said:
# 31:15 "In Ramah, they heard a cry, wailing and lamenting; Rachel wept over her children, and would not accept consolation, for they were not here." Return from Egypt to Nablus
And when Herod died, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and go into Egypt, and remain there until I tell you to return."
They said: "O people! Shake the child, kill him, and return to the land of Israel, out of fear that you loved him and would kill him."
Yahya stood up, shook the child, and died, and returned to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Herod had made Antipas ruler over the Jews in Perea, he feared for himself. The Lord revealed to him in a dream, and he went to the region of Galilee.
And he went to a city named Nasserah and settled there so that they would say, "He is named Nasser."
John the Baptist (Mark 1:1-8; Luke 3:1-18; John 1:19-28)
And in the book of Acts, John the Baptist preached in the region of Judea, proclaiming the coming of salvation.
He says: "Repent, my kingdom is near!"
# 40:3 And John says: "This is the one about whom the prophet Isaiah spoke, as he said: 'A voice cries out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord; make straight in the desert a highway for our God!'"
John was dressed in garments made of camel's hair, and he had a leather belt around his waist. His diet consisted of locusts and wild honey.
People were coming from Jerusalem and all Judea and the areas surrounding the Jordan River.
And they acknowledge their sins, and their transgressions in the Valley of the Jordan
And when I was killed, Faresi and Saduqiyin took him away deliberately, they said to them: "O children of Al-Fa'iq! What made you flee from the anger coming from God?"
Do things that will bring you to Antoma and you will see.
What you say in your hearts: "We are the children of Abraham." I have seen you, Allah is capable of making this stone the offspring of Abraham.
Fas trees are cut down and planted on tree trunks; the tree will not produce a good harvest and will be burned.
We will lead you with water so that you may reach it; but as for the one who comes after me, he will be stronger than I am. We do not deserve that the sandals of the Lord should be taken from us. He will lead you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
And the reed of the boat is shaken in his hand, he polishes the sandals in the hall, he stores the wheat in the warehouse, as for the wine, they burn it with fire that will not go out. John prepares Jesus (Mark 1:9-11; Luke 3:21-22).
And Jesus went from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.
What about John? They said: "We need to rely on your hands. How can you get me?"
And Jesus answered: "Let this thing happen, so that we may fulfill all our righteous needs." Awake, John.
And when Jesus commanded, water came out, and at that moment heaven opened, and the Spirit of God descended upon him.
And the voice of Malasama says: "This is my son whom we have desired, and I am pleased with him."
Jesus is tempted (Mark 1:12-13; Luke 4:1-13)
And the Holy Spirit moved Jesus into the wilderness to avoid temptation.
O Xai, he fasted forty days and forty nights until he became hungry.
Qabilu ya bash yajtibou wa qalou: "If you are the son of God, tell the stone here to bake bread."
# 8:3 Jacobo answers Jesus: "The Scripture says: 'Man lives by bread, and by every word that comes from God.'"
And this is for the Holy City, and they stood on the outer edge of the structure,

# 6:16 Japho replies to Jesus: "It is written in Zada: 'You have experienced the Lord as your God.'"

They said: "We will give you this klou, if it lands on your boats and you prostrate yourself."
# 6:13; Matt 8:33. Jesus said to him: "Get away from me, Satan! For it is written in the Holy Scripture: 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve.'"
And it was so that he went and walked, and the angels came and began to serve there. Jesus preached in Galilee (Mark 1:14-15; Luke 4:14-15).
And when Jesus heard John, he went back to the region of Galilee.
And Malna'asir went out and walked and settled in Kfar Nahum, on the sea coast, in the border of the Zebulun and Nativale region,
So that the thing which the Prophet Isaiah said:
# 9:1-2 The land of Naphtali and the land of Zebulun, on the sea, along the way of Jordan, Galilee, the lands of the other peoples!
The people who were seated in darkness saw a great light; upon the land of death, where they were seated, the light shone upon them.
And at that time Jesus began to preach and say: "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near." Jesus called his disciples (Mark 1:16-20; Luke 5:1-11).
And as Jesus was walking on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, He saw James and John, sons of Zebedee, fishing, and Peter and Andrew, who were also fishing.
He said to them: "Follow me, and we will send you a fisherman to supply people."
And at that time, their belongings and those following them.
And he was with Malgadi, Shaf Zouz, brothers of others: Jacob, son of Zabdi, and Khoh John, in the Flokka with Bohum Zabdi, they settled in the shacks, and left their names.
And at that time He was in the region of the Galilee, and He went throughout the region. Jesus taught, proclaimed the gospel, and healed the sick (Luke 6:17-19).
And Jesus' teaching in all the synagogues of Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom of God, and healing all diseases and infirmities among people.
And the news spreads throughout Syria. And the suffering people, exceeding in number the various kinds of diseases, wounds, and afflictions, and the citizens, the disabled, and the crippled, are healed.
And he was followed by people from Galilee and the region known as the Ten Cities, Jerusalem, Judea, and the region on the other side of the Jordan.
The Sermon on the Mount (Luke 6:20-23)
And Jesus, lifting up His eyes to heaven, said, "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
And it became apparent to them, and he said:
May health be upon the poor in spirit! Cover them with the kingdom of heaven so that it may take them.
May they have peace! May they not be proud.
May they be healthy! Protect them from the earth so they may inherit it.
May they be filled with hunger and thirst for the truth! May they never be satisfied.
May they be healthy, those who show mercy! Let them be granted mercy.
May it please them that their hearts are pure! Cover their faces with the face of God so they may see.
May it be well with them, may they reconcile people! Protect their children so that they may not be corrupted.
Their health! They will be tortured for the sake of truth! The kingdom of heavens will take them.
My health, the time I have killed people, they treat you, torture you, and say to you lies, falsehoods, against my conscience!
Rejoice and share your joy, your reward will be great in heaven. Rejoice, for you too have been blessed as the prophets before you. "Salt and Light" (Mark 9:50; Luke 14:34-35)
"Entoma is the salt of the earth, but if salt no longer has a restaurant, how can it go back to restaurants? It's no longer fit for anything, even something that would throw away the brine and people would get rid of it."
Antoma nor the world. What city built on a mountain and not visible,
And what difference does it make if one lights a lamp and places it under a dish, rather than placing it on a high shelf and letting it shine throughout the house?
Let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works and praise you before God.» The Sharia
What is in your minds that I went to abolish the religion and the prophets—no, I did not go to abolish them, but to complete them.
Your truth: Heaven and Earth will not cease until even a single letter or dot is removed from the Sharia, until everything is completed.
Whoever does not obey one of the smallest of these commands and teaches people how to behave so that they may be called small in the kingdom of heaven, while whoever obeys them and teaches people how to be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
O you who believe! If you do not uphold righteousness more than the books of the Jews and the hypocrites, then indeed, your years will be wasted in this life. Dishonesty
# Ex 20:13; Deut 5:17; 16:18 "They heard it said to their ancestors: 'You shall not kill, but the state shall kill, and it shall have authority over them.'"
Ama Anna Rani nqelakum: He who covers his face must be judged by the court, and he must say to his face: "O fool, they must have the Jewish council judge him," and he must say to his face: "O beast, they must send him to hell."
I'm saying, when you offer your sacrifices at the altar, remember the problem you have with him.
Put your offering before the altar and first make peace with yourself, then with your enemy, and then present your offering.
And if someone complains about you, you and him agree to postpone your trial to the court, so that he won't complain to the judge and the judge will talk to you with the police officer and you'll end up in jail.
Your truth: Macsh will not leave Gadi until he gets the last mil. "Adultery"
# 20:14; 5:18 "They heard it said to their ancestors: 'You have not committed adultery.'"
Ama Ana Rani nalkum il-kebda li yakhzir li-mara wa yishthaha, rahou zanu ma'aha fi qalbuhum.
If your eye is making you err, pluck it out and throw it away. Rather lose a part of your body than have your entire body end up in hell.
"And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose a part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell." (Matthew 19:9; Mark 10:11-12; Luke 16:18)
# 24:1-4 "Zadda said: 'A man may divorce his wife, giving her a bill of divorce.'"
Ama Ana Rani nqalikum: "He who divorces a woman for a cause other than adultery makes her commit adultery, and he who marries a divorced woman allows her to commit adultery." The oaths.
# No 19:12; 30:2; Tha 23:21 "And you heard Zada say to your ancestors: 'Do not lie, for indeed I am truthful, and my Lord has promised it to me.'"
Ama Anna Rani nqalikum ma tahtalafush bi al-kul, la bi al-sama' 3ala khatairha 3arsh Allah.
# Exod 6:1; Num 7:49; Ezek 48:2, neither shall the land be in the heart of those who set their feet upon it, nor shall Jerusalem be in the heart of the great king's city.
And you won't even complain about your situation, in your mind you won't even notice a single feather of an egg or a single speck of dirt
Let your words be what they are, and any extra thing on this I'll take as evil. "Retaliation (Luke 6:29-30)"
# 21:24; 24:20; 19:21 "They heard it said: 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.'"
O you who believe! Do not let the wrongdoers work with you in wrongdoing. And if one of you strikes you on your right cheek, turn the other cheek.
A man who loves you will argue with you so as to betray you, let him take your belongings and add to them.
And if one forces you to walk a kilometer with him, walk with him a kilometer.
"Let him ask you for something, and you give it to him; let him borrow from you, and you refuse it." Love your enemies (Luke 6:27–28, 32–36).
You heard it said: "Love your neighbor and hate your enemy."
Amma Anna nqalikum: love your enemies and pray for those who oppress you.
So that you may be children of those in the heavens. Let them make the sun shine upon the successful and the unsuccessful, and give rain to the righteous and the wrongdoers.
What reward do you expect if you want people to love you? My friend, those who don't know the ropes—what are they doing with this?
And what will be the verdict for you besides you if what you received was upon your shoulders? O people, do you not know that your Lord does not do this thing by chance?
You must be complete, just as you are complete in heaven.
Alms
Do good in front of people so they can see you. If you don't do that, you will not receive reward from Allah in the Hereafter.
When you give to one person, don't call them "brother" as the hypocrites did in gatherings and streets so people would praise them. You are telling the truth: let them take their reward.
But you, when I kill you, let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
"Let your alms be done in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you." (Luke 11:2-4)
And when they are killed, pray for them, just as the hypocrites do, who love to stand and pray in congregations so that people may see them. You have taken their truth: let them take their reward.
Ama ent, wakti tasil, tadin le beitik al-dakhilani, sakkar al-bab, wa tasil le bok el ma yatsafah. Wa bok el yasawf fi al-sir ba3d yajazik.
And you keep praying that you don't revert to empty talk, how the other peoples in their minds don't think that God will hear them to say a single word.
How could you possibly know how they are, on the basis of what you know about what they need before they ask for it.
Amaa Saliu said this: "O Bona in the sky, make your name holy."
Let your kingdom come, let your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Every day we gave our bread, which was enough for us.
Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us.
We didn't get involved in an experiment, and we escaped from evil.
And if people show forgiveness to their wrongdoings, Allah will increase forgiveness for you in the heavens.
"But if you have compromised yourselves with the sins of others, even if you are in the heavens, your sins will not be forgiven." - Fasting
"And they fast, concealing their sorrow from their faces, like the hypocrites. They turn their faces away, disheartened, so that they may appear to the people who are fasting. Indeed, We have granted them their reward."
Oh you, when I kill you, you'll comb your hair and wash your face,
"Your fasting is not visible to others, but it is visible to you, to those who do not see with their eyes, and to those who see the things you do in secret, so that they may hold you accountable." (Luke 12:33-34)
"What will become of your lands, which are treasures on earth, if they are ruined by locusts and mud, if thieves dig into them and carry them off."
O indeed, We have made for you treasures in the heavens, which neither corruption nor decay will reach, nor will thieves be able to plunder or destroy.
Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. "Nour the Body (Luke 11:34–36)"
"The eye is the light of the body. If your eye is healthy, the entire body will be filled with light."
"Yet if your eye is diseased, your whole body will be filled with darkness. If the light within you is darkness, how great will that darkness be!" God, not money (Luke 12:22–31; 16:13).
Even one of the stars serves the masters, right? Either you hate one and love the other, or you follow one and scorn the other. You won't serve God and money.
Amina, we are bringing you what you lack in your lives—whether it's for eating or drinking, or for dressing. My friend, isn't life better than food, and isn't the body better than clothing?
Look at the birds in the sky, how they neither sow nor reap, nor store their food in granaries, yet God provides for them. Which of you would be better off than these birds?
And what about you, the one who is sleeping, increasing by one unit in Amr's hour?
And why do they mix in clothing? They left for the Nwar the belongings of Wuercon, how they grow: neither tired nor woven.
Ama Anna nalkum: Even King Solomon, in all his glory, did not wear anything like it!
If God wears marijuana like this, then today marijuana grows and tomorrow it will be thrown into the fire, like the trash in the bin! How can you, who have weak faith, be among those who wear it?
This is crazy, how can you say: "No problem, let's eat?" or "No problem, let's drink?" or "No problem, let's wear clothes?"
People come to these matters, those who are not yet believers, and those in heaven will know that you are the one who needs to deal with them.
Ama Intoma Logua first at the Kingdom of God and the blessings are yours, and these needs have increased so that they may consume you.
This guy, what's wrong with you, you're acting like today, you're going to act like today's going to be a day of suffering. Every day is enough suffering for him.»
Do not judge people (Luke 6:37–38, 41–42)
Don't judge people because they don't control you.
The rule by which you rule people, so that they rule you with it, and the measure by which you measure things, so that they measure you with it.
See the thread in your eye, and what are you missing in the board in your eye?
And how can you say to your friend: "Let me remove the thread that's in your eye" when you're killing your eye, which is already a canvas for you?
O hypocrite! You remove the painting from your eye first, and then you distance yourself from the truth, seeing only the falsehood and removing the truth from your own eye.
You do not give sacred things to dogs, nor do you pour your essence before pigs, so that they won't turn against you and attack you. Ask and you will receive (Luke 11:9-13).
"Ask and it will be given to you, seek and you will find, knock and the door will be opened to you."
Every seeker finds, every one who strives succeeds, and every one who knocks is granted.
Suspect those among you who ask for bread and give them a stone.
And will they not seek in a cave that gives them shelter?
If you, the evil ones, know how to give your children nice things, why don't you in heaven give nice things to those who ask for them?
Ema la, we work with people on things they desire, and we do them together with you. See, this is what the religion and the prophets have said. "The Narrow Gate" (Luke 13:24)
"Enter through the narrow gate. Beyond the wide and smooth gate of destruction, let them enter with a brush."
"Am I the narrow and difficult path leading to life, and a source of trouble to all who meet me?" The Tree and its Branches (Luke 6:43-44)
Return to them the money of the false prophets, who led you astray while wearing the clothes of the hypocrites, and they are from among the hypocrites, and you will not find any mercy from them.
Their wealth will make them known. O, the thorn bears the grape, and the olive tree bears the oil?
Every fruitful tree bears a fruitful harvest, and every barren tree bears a barren harvest.
Neither the flourishing tree bears a barren fruit, nor the barren tree bears a fruitful fruit.
Every tree will not yield a valuable harvest and will be chopped down and thrown into the fire.
"See them not by their outward appearance." Words and Deeds (Luke 13:25-27)
"Rahou mosh, every one who says: 'My Lord, my Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven; but as for the one who does the will of Papa in heaven, he is the one who will enter."
On the Day of Accounting, people will say: "O Lord, O Lord, O my brother, didn't You reveal Yourself to us by Your Name? Didn't we leave our homes in Your Name? Didn't we perform great miracles in Your Name?"
And I say to them: "I never knew you. Depart from me, you who practice evil!" Just as the sower sowed (Luke 6:47-49).
"Let him hear my words and act upon them, so that he becomes like a man wise enough to build a house on stone."
Rain fell, floods surged, and the wind blew strongly upon this house; this is what struck it, on the basis of its material, built upon stone.
And whoever hears my words and does not act upon them, will be like a man from a people who built a house on sand.
Rain fell, floods came, and the wind swept over the house—this very thing, O my beloved, destroyed it, and not a single thing remained of it.
And as Jesus finished speaking, the people were amazed at his teaching.
Among them, he knew who had power, but not how their books were written.
The man with the leprosy is healed (Mark 1:40–45; Luke 5:12–16).
At that time Jesus descended from the mountain, and a large crowd followed him.
And near me was one of the Burs, and he prostrated himself and said: "O Lord, if you love me, let me be healed."
And he stretched out his hand and wiped, and they said: "We love you, get well!" And at that moment Malbres got well.
# 14:2 And they said to Jesus, "Wait until I have gone to the priest, so he may examine you. And as Moses commanded regarding the offering of the near-covenant, it is a witness to me." The servant of the man who was healed is restored (Luke 7:1-10; John 4:43-54).
And Jesus entered into Caphernus, and there he saw a man with a water pot, and said to him:
"O my Lord, my servant lies at rest in the house, helpless and lying still, suffering torment with a stick, and does not move at all."
They said to Jesus: "Anas, let us save and heal him."
Amal al-Qa'id of the Mia Jaiwou said: "My lord, we do not deserve for you to come and enter under my roof. What about saying a prayer of blessing for my servant so that he may recover."
"Rani, I have a servant who governs over me, and I have an army that governs over them. We say to one, 'Go!' and he goes. To another, 'Come!' and he comes. To my servant, 'Do this thing!' and he does it."
At that time, Jesus was amazed and said to those who followed him: "I tell you the truth, not one in Israel has ever seen such great faith as this."
Your people, a few individuals, will possess wealth from the East and the West, sitting at the table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven,
"My children, the kingdom will fall into darkness, and the Gadi will weep, weeping for the years."
Jesus said to the centurion, "Go; your faith has made you well." The servant was healed at that very moment. Peter's mother-in-law was healed (Mark 1:29–34; Luke 4:38–41).
And when Jesus went into the house of Peter, he saw Peter's wife sitting by the hearth.
She took it from her hand, oh, the kettle is boiling. She stood up and began to serve there.
In the afternoon, at the time of sunset, Jabolo brushed the people living in their villages, and the spirits departed with a word of unity, and all the sick were healed.
# 53:4 And this thing has come about so that what the Prophet Isaiah said may be fulfilled: "Behold, we are afflicted, and our diseases are severe. Jesus and the world" (Luke 9:57–62).
And when Jesus saw a crowd gathering, he told his disciples to go across to the other side.
And there was one of the books belonging to the Jews who said: "O teacher, let us follow you to any place you go."
Jesus said to them: "The foxes have their dens, and the birds of the sky their nests; but I, the Son of Man, where shall I go that I may have a place to rest my head?"
One of the disciples said: "O our master, let's walk first and bury the father."
And Jesus said to them: "Follow me, and let the dead bury their dead!" Jesus guides the storm (Mark 4:35-41; Luke 8:22-25)
At that time Jesus went out to the countryside, and his disciples followed him.
A strong wind blew over the lake, and the waves rose and covered the boat. Jesus was asleep.
And the disciples saw him and praised him, saying: "Lord, keep us, for we do not want to lose you!"
And Jesus said to them, "Are you afraid of a little storm? Is your faith weak?" Then Peter got up and commanded the wind and the sea, and the sea was calm.
The people were amazed and said: "Never have we seen such a man, even the winds and the sea obey him!" They were driven from their homes and drowned in the unlawful (Mark 5:1–20; Luke 8:26–39).
And as Jesus went to the other side of the region of the Gadarenes, He saw there two men with unclean spirits, living among the tombs, and they were possessed with a great evil, so that not even a single step could be taken without them coming to the path.
They shouted: "Ash between you and him, son of God? Why did you come here to punish us before time?"
And there were some shepherds tending their flocks far from them.
And the people covered him and said: "If we are to leave, we will send envoys to the allies!"
They said to them: "Go forth!" O you, go out and enter the lawful things, and all of them descended from the mountain's edge into the sea and submerged in the water.
They fled safely and entered the city, saying about everything, and about the corrupt men who dwell among their citizens.
Come out, people in the city, all of you, to meet Jesus. And cover them so they can leave their area.
Jesus heals a man with a disability (Mark 2:1-12; Luke 5:17-26)
And Jesus went into a boat and crossed the sea to the other side of the country.
And Jesus saw a man sitting on a bed, paralyzed. He said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
There is a group of Jewish scholars who said in their hearts: "This man has disbelieved!"
But Jesus knew their thoughts, and He said: "Are you reading evil in your hearts?"
Is she the easiest? It is said: "Your sins have been forgiven," but not: "Go and come!"
"O you who believe! Know that I, the son of Adam, have authority over the earth to forgive sins." And turning to the blind man, he said: "Get up! Shake off your dust and go to your home."
O Xai, rise and go to your house.
And when I killed people, they saw it and were afraid, and they praised God for having given power as He did to humans. Jesus gave it to Matthew (Mark 2:13-17; Luke 5:27-32).
And Jesus went out from Gadi Shaf, and saw a man named Esmo, Matthew, sitting at the desk. They said to him: "Follow me." And James rose up and followed him.
At that time Jesus was sitting in Matthew's house eating, and the tax collectors and sinners were coming to sit with him and his disciples.
And when they saw the Frisians, they said to their disciples: "How can your teacher eat with the sinners and the corrupt?"
When Jesus heard this, he said: "The healthy do not need a physician, but the sick do."
# He is 6:6 Teach us what this verse means: "We love mercy more than sacrifice." And we will not claim the sinners to be the righteous." Fasting (Mark 2:18-22; Luke 5:33-39)
And the disciples of John came to Jesus and said: "How can we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"
Jesus said to them: "You who have been called to the wedding, prepare yourselves, put on your wedding garments, and where is the bridegroom among you? He will be absent from them, and the night will come, and the bridegroom will be far from them. This very hour, therefore, let them fast."
What a shame that someone would replace an old garment with new fabric, thinking the fabric will drink and eat the old one, and the cut will take over.
And there is no way that a new wine can be poured into old wineskins; otherwise, the skins would burst and the wine would spill out. But if new wine is poured into new wineskins, it will be properly preserved. The little girl, Haya, and the woman who had been healed by Jesus are healed (Mark 5:21–43; Luke 8:40–56).
While Jesus was speaking to them, one of the leaders of the Jews came forward and bowed down and said: "My daughter, you are still suffering. Touch her with your hand, and she will be healed."
And Jesus arose and went, and so did his disciples.
There was a case of a woman suffering from bleeding from the nose for a year, coming from the back of the head, the side of the skull.
In her mind, she said: "Manselou dabsou birk to netshifa."
Jesus' house and its revelation said to her: "Trust, my daughter, have faith in yourself." And at that moment there was no more need for fear.
And when I killed, Jesus came to the house of the Jewish chief and saw the congregation singing in the courtyard, and the people were working in the field.
He said: "Get away! The structure is still standing; as for me, I'm lying down."
And when I killed them, the servants went out, he entered and pulled the structure from her hand, Ya'xi stood up.
The news of this matter is being reported in this place. Jesus heals Zoz, the blind man.
And as Jesus was passing by from Gadara, there were two men with blindness following him, who cried out: "Son of David, have mercy on us!"
When I entered the house, I saw men who were blind. Jesus said to them: "What do you wish me to do so that I may perform this deed?" They replied: "Yes, Lord!"
And Jesus looked at them and said: "Let your faith be strong."
And their eyes were opened. Jesus warned them: "Return to me, and let no one know!"
Ama Homa left and spread the news throughout the area. Jesus healed a man with leprosy.
And when I killed the Zuz, the blind ones were exiting, there was a group of Jabolo one in Kosh, dwellers of Satan.
Jesus cast out the demon and the leper, and then spoke. "Behold, the people were amazed and said: 'We have never seen anything like this in Israel!' "
The Pharisees said: "The ruler of the synagogue goes out with power." Jesus had compassion on people.
And Jesus walked through all the towns and villages, teaching in the synagogues, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom of God, and healing all diseases and afflictions among people.
When I saw people complaining about their worries, they were asking and questioning how the sheep without a shepherd could wander.
He said to his disciples: "The sowing is a brushstroke, while the harvest is a little bit"
Emla, they asked the slave of al-Saba' to send servants to al-Saba' for their belongings.
The Twelve Apostles (Mark 3:13–19; Luke 6:12–16)
And he called upon the two sons, students, and gave them authority over the spirits imprisoned, so that they could release them and heal people of all diseases and afflictions.
And thus the names of the Twelve Apostles are: the first is Simon, who is called Peter; and Andrew, James, son of Zebedee, and John.
and Philip and Bartholomew, and Thomas and Matthew the Zealot, and James son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus,
And Simon will change the lands of Judah, and the Essene will betray Jesus. Jesus sends the Twelve disciples (Mark 6:7-13; Luke 9:1-6).
Jesus sent the two disciples and instructed them: "Do not go into the villages of the Gentiles nor enter the towns of the Samaritans, until the time comes for you to enter."
Go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
And they said, "O mankind, say to the kingdom of the heavens has come near."

Your truth: The condition of Sodom and Gomorrah on the Day of Judgment will be better than the condition of this city! The persecution that will take place (Mark 13:9-13; Luke 21:12-17).
"Hani nab3akum kif al-ghanam fi wathth al-udhba 2amala kuna fa2i2in kif al-2a2i, wa ba2in kif al-hammam."
They told you that the people of the land would deliver you to the council of the Jews, and beat you with rods in their assemblies,
They mock judges and kings in my presence, thinking that when they see me, they will see the same as the other peoples.
Wait, they're giving you what you didn't agree to, so you can't talk or say anything. In this very hour, they're going to stop you from saying what you want to say.
In your minds, what you speak is not you, but the spirit within you speaks along your path.
The father dies, the son dies, and the children turn against their parents and kill them.
The people in general will hate you because of my name. As for those who will stand by the other, they will be able to forgive.
And when they persecute you in a city, flee to another city. My truth: they will not move the cities of Israel before I come, the son of man.
The student Moses is greater than the teacher, and the servant Moses is greater than his master.
Is it not enough for a student to know how the teacher treats his master, and how the servant treats his master? If the master of the house is called Salzabul, what should they call their father? Fear of the Lord (Luke 12:2-7)
"Nothing to fear from them. Nothing hidden will ever be revealed, and nothing concealed will ever be uncovered."
And let us say it to you in darkness, say it in light. Let it be proclaimed to you from the heights of your hearts; call it from the rooftops.
And what fear do you have that they will kill the body, and what fear do you have that they will kill the soul? Have you not feared that He, who is capable, will destroy both body and soul for two in Hell.
O my brother, don't you see birds following each other in a line? What they do on the ground is not what you do in the sky, they know it well.
Go on, until you feel the Russian clove is accounted for.
What are you afraid of? You're better than a sparrow's feather!
I am not acknowledged before people, but I am acknowledged before the one who is in the sky.
"Those who deny me before men, I will deny before the men in heaven." Jesus and the World (Luke 12:51–53; 14:26–27)
What is in your minds that you went to achieve peace for the earth, not to achieve peace or to achieve a sword.
Let's not distinguish between the boy and his father, the girl and her mother, the grandson and his grandmother.
And the enemies of man are his own weaknesses.
He loves me more than anyone else deserves. And he loves his son or daughter more than anyone else deserves.

Whoever gains life will lose it, and whoever loses life will gain it.» The Reward (Mark 9:36–41)
"He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me."
A prophet will not accept the responsibility of another prophet in order to take another prophet's reward. A man will not accept the responsibility of another man in order to take another man's reward.
A leader will give a student a small amount of money, even just a cold glass of water to his students' thoughts, you are right, go ahead and do what you think will not be lost.
The disciples of John the Baptist (Luke 7:18-35)
And when Jesus had finished teaching his disciples, he went throughout the towns and villages of that region, to preach and to teach.
And John, who was in prison, heard about the deeds of Christ, and said to his disciples:
They said: "Are you the one who came, or shall we consider someone else?"
Jesus replied to them: "Go and tell John what you have seen and heard:
# 35:5-6; 61:1; Luke 4:18-19 The blind see, the lame walk, those with leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor rejoice in the gospel.
And why isn't he scratching then?!
When my brother John began to preach, Jesus spoke to the people through John and said: "Where did you go to see him in the wilderness? A dwelling where the wind moves?"
Amaala shanwa el khurjat ba3sh tashoufou? Ba3sh tashoufou ragel labis labsa ghaliya? Ra3am el yilbisou el labsa ghaliya fi qusur al-muluk!
Ema la shenou el kherratou bacha tsee7ouh? Bacha tsee7ou nabi? Ei, yes, and let me tell you: greater than a prophet.
# Mal 3:1; Matt 1:2 Here is what is written in the Holy Scriptures: "Hani, I send before you my messenger, who will prepare your way."
Your truth has not yet appeared, even one of those women taken in, is greater than John the Baptist; shall not one of the kingdom of heaven be greater than him?
From the days of John the Baptist to today, the kingdom of heaven advances with strength, and the strong prevail in it.
The Prophets and the Law predicted even until John the Baptist.
And if you love to believe, then go, he's Elijah who's coming.
He's got two ears, let him hear!
Do we resemble this generation? How are they sitting in the market, talking to each other:?
We will protect you and what you have, and we will never let you suffer.
Jah John neither eats nor drinks. You said: "He is possessed by a demon."
See, Anna, daughter of man, eats the food and drinks the drink. They said: "Is this a man who is wild and unruly, who walks among the sinners and the lawless?" As for the wisdom, it will bear its children. The cities that do not repent (Luke 10:13-15).
And as Jesus was leaving, he rebuked the cities where he had performed miracles, saying, "You have neither repented nor changed your ways."
He said: "Alas, O Korzun! Alas, O Beit Sahdah! If the great miracles performed among you were performed in Saida and Baalbek, they would have immediately repented, put on garments of repentance, and sat upon ashes."
Ama Anna nalkum: The situation in the city of Safed and Haifa will be better than your situation on the Day of Judgment.
And you, our scoffers! Brother, are you going to look up to the sky? You're going to descend into the abyss. If the great miracles you've witnessed were performed in Sodom, then I would have no reason to stay here today.
Amma, Anna, tell you: the condition of the earth of Sodom would have been better than yours on the day of accounting. Jesus rejoices (Luke 10:21-22).
At this time Jesus spoke and said: "Thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for your thought of these needs, which you have revealed to the wise and the understanding, and have made known to the little children."
Yes, dad, that was your intention.
Baba Etani, everything. Even one who didn't know the son was the Bo, and even one who didn't know the Bo was the son; everyone chooses the son so he can show him around.
Ejoli yli entoma taa bin ekkhoulm tawil, wana baa shirik.
Play with my belongings and learn from me a gentle man with a humble heart, and you will find peace within yourselves.
My load is light, my belongings are few, and my burden is light.
Saturday (Mark 2:23-28; Luke 6:1-5)
At this time, Jesus stood in the midst of the wheat on the Sabbath day, and his disciples were hungry. They began to pluck the heads of grain and eat.
My time, I saw the Frères doing this thing. They said: "Look! Your disciples are working on something unlawful during the Saturday day. "
# I 21:1-6; 24:9 Jesus said to them, "How can you say that David, when he was eating and drinking with his companions, did not eat and drink?"
How could he have entered my house, and eaten the sacrificial bread that I did not prepare for him and those with him? Shouldn't the priests have eaten it, as it was lawful for them to do so?
# 28:9-10 O you who have not read the Sharia, how do the priests break the Sabbath commandment and even break the Sabbath in the Temple on Saturday, and yet they are not blamed?
As you say: There's one person here who is the richest in the organization.
# He is 6:6; met 9:13. If only they understood the meaning of this verse: "We love with mercy of sacrifice." Then they would not have judged what does not concern them.
"Rani, Anna, the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath." The man with a withered hand is healed (Mark 3:1-6; Luke 6:6-11).
And Jesus went through the midst of the crowd and entered the synagogue.
And there was a man with a disabled leg. People asked him: "Hey, is it allowed for someone to heal during Saturday day?" So he could encounter something they could accuse him of.
Jesus said to them: "Shall we not have one among you who will go to the pool of Bethesda on the Sabbath and not be healed?"
And man has a greater value than money! So why is good work only done on Saturday mornings?
And Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand!" And the man stretched it out, and his whole body was restored, as the other hand.
The Pharisees went out and discussed among themselves how they might kill Jesus. Jesus is the servant who gives Himself to God.
And Jesus knew this thing, and went to this place. And followed him a crowd of people, and healed them all.
And he ordered them not to mention it until a certain limit was reached.
And this thing has happened so that what was said by the Prophet Isaiah:
# 42:1-4 The servant is mine, my beloved, whose heart is pleased; let my spirit be in him, that he may proclaim my justice to the peoples.
He doesn't speak or make a sound, and even in the streets, no one hears his voice.
Merzouk will not break it, and a cigarette will not go out. Until truth prevails.
And the people will have hope in their names. Jesus and Belzopoulos (Mark 3:20-30; Luke 11:14-23; 12:10).
And at this time, Jacob is blind and Bashan is dwelling with a demon. But Jesus' mouth and eyes are speaking and seeing.
And all people were astonished and said: "Is this man the son of David?"
The Frisians, when they heard of my death, said: "He is going out in the cities with Baelzabul, the chief of the cities."
And Jesus knew that they were thinking, and He said to them: "Every kingdom will be divided against itself, and it will be destroyed; and every city or house will be divided against itself, and it will not be able to stand."
If the devil sends out the devil, how can the kingdoms stand, considering they are divided among spirits?
And if we, Anna, go out in the streets with B'alzabul, won't your students also go out with us? This is how you will govern us.
But if we go out into the streets with the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God will have taken hold of you.
And how can one enter a strong man's house and take away his belongings, except if the strong man's shoulder is at the beginning, and then the one who comes in takes the things that are in his house?
My side isn't with me, and he won't gather with me; he'll divide.
This is what you say, the sins of people and their disbelief will be forgiven, but disbelief in the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
And whoever says, "Lord, I am the son of man," will be forgiven; but whoever says, "Lord, I am the spirit of God," will not be forgiven—neither in this world nor in the world to come." The Tree and its Fruit (Luke 6:43–45)
"O, let the tree be flourishing and its harvest be flourishing. Let the tree not be barren and its harvest not be barren. Let the tree know its harvest."
O children of al-Faleh, how can you speak beautiful words and yet be evil? The tongue speaks, but the heart holds the truth.
The optimistic person brings forth their optimistic needs from the optimistic part of their heart, while the disappointed person brings forth their disappointed needs from the disappointed part of their heart.
Your translation: Every empty word people say in order to be held accountable for it on the Day of Accounting.
With your words you make him innocent, and with your words you control him. The Pharisees ask in the miracle (Mark 8:11-12; Luke 11:29-32).
At this time, a group of the Jewish and Pharisee scholars said to Jesus: "Teacher, do you want to perform a miracle for us?"
He replied to them: "How can a miracle be harmful? Even a miracle can fail, as the miracle of Prophet Yunus."
# Jonah 1:17 How Jonah remained three days and three nights in the whale's belly—so also shall the Son of Man remain three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
# Yun 3:5 The people of Ninive shall join with this generation on the Day of Judgment and judge them, because of their own actions, they obeyed Yunus' warning; yet there is something greater here than Yunus.
# I Ml 10:1-10; II Ak 9:1-12, the Queen of the South came to hear Solomon's wisdom, and she said, "I was not greater than Solomon!" (Luke 11:24-26)
"My death extracts the bound soul from a human being; it surpasses the dryness of the place where there is no water to quench thirst, whereas what one encounters in the place itself."
Right now, he says: "Let's go back to my house where I left it." And when he returns, he finds it empty, cleaned, and organized.
He walks and responds with seven other spirits, casting out the one who was inside, and they enter into the person. These spirits were previously upon him. And thus, these added spirits will spread throughout the evil generation. Jesus and His brothers (Mark 3:31–35; Luke 8:19–21).
And when Jesus was killed, he was still speaking to people, Jao, Aimo, and his brothers stood by, loving to talk with him.
There was one who said: "Your mother and your siblings are standing by the side, loving and talking with you."
But how can he reply to the man who said: "Shall I blame my mother, or my brothers?"
He corrected his disciples and said: "Ah, my mother and my brothers."
O my brother, whoever works the will of Boa in the sky is my brother, my sister, and my mother.
Like the farmer (Mark 4:1-9; Luke 8:4-8)
And Jesus went out to the sea in the daytime, and sat by the lake.
They followed him with a crowd, until he came out into the open, and the people all stood on the shore.
And they express it with a proverb: "The farmer leaves home to plant."
And my death is sowing; a seed has fallen in the thicket, and birds have come with their young.
There is another seed that fell upon land filled with stone, not a single grain of dust, yet it grew at the time of its dust, not a single grain.
When my time came, the sun rose and burned upon her mind, having no veins.
Another plant fell in the middle of the thistle, and the thistle rose up and suffocated it.
There is another seed that fell in fertile soil and grew, one that grew in a single watering, one that grew in sixty, and one that grew in thirty.
"Those have ears to hear!" Why does Jesus speak in parables (Mark 4:10-12; Luke 8:9-10)?
Now, the time has come for the disciples of Jesus to ask: "Why do you speak to them in parables?"
And they replied: "You are depriving yourselves of knowing the secrets of the kingdom of the heavens; as for us, we are not depriving ourselves of them."
Go to him, so they can get more drunk and leave him with a bottle. As for those who don't have anything, even what they have is not enough for them to cope with.
This is how we talk to them with metaphors in their minds, what they hide, what they see and hear, and what they understand.
# Isa 6:9-10; Mer 8:18; Yoh 12:39-41; Ac 28:26-27 The prophecy of Isaiah was fulfilled, saying: "You will not hear, for you will not understand; you will not see, for you will not perceive."
O people, blind your hearts, plug your ears, and close your eyes, so that you may not see with your eyes, nor hear with your ears, nor understand with your hearts, and return so that we may heal you.
Ama Intoma, health to your eyes on her matter, see, and to your ears on her matter, hear.
Your truth: The prophets and the righteous were given a brush to see what they saw and hear what they heard, yet they saw nothing and heard nothing. Interpretation of the parable of the sower (Mark 4:13–20; Luke 8:11–15).
"Emala, listen: what is meant by the analogy of the farmer:"
When anyone hears the word of God's kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and steals what you have sown in their heart; this is what you have sown in the heart.
And he who plants in the earth where there is stone, is the one who hears the word, accepts it at the right time, and is joyful:
But there are no arteries inside them, they will wait a while and then, at some point, difficulties or persecution will arise due to the word, and then it will happen.
And in the midst of thorns, there is one who hears the word; whereas the cares of this world and the love of wealth choke the word and neglect what is sown.
And whoever plants in fertile soil is he who hears the word and understands it, and responds with a small seed, and another with a measure, and another with thirty. Like the sowing.
And Jesus said to them, "It is like a man who sowed good seed in his field."
When I was young, people were sitting, the enemy came and planted wheat in the middle of the barley and walked away.
And when the female barley sprouted and the wheat grew, the Zawwan emerged with them.
And the servants of the earth said: "O our Lord! Did you not plant a noble crop in your land? From where did it come?"
He said to them: "One of my actions has done this." Then the servants said: "Would you like us to walk and meet the guests?"
But he said: "No, we won't uproot the wheat at my time; you will wait until the Zawin."
Wheat and spelt grow together until harvest time, and at this very time we say to the harvest: "First gather the spelt, and stack it so it won't catch fire; as for the wheat, store it in my granaries." — Like the mustard seed and leaven (Mark 4:30–32; Luke 13:18–19).
And they were given something similar to the former. He said: "The kingdom of the heavens is like a small date palm shoot shaken by a man and planted in a garden."
It is the smallest of all the melons, while my own grew larger and became the largest of all the green vegetables, to the point that even birds from the sky come to live in it.
He said similarly: "The kingdom of the heavens is like a leaven that was shaken by a hand and placed in three measures of fine flour until the dough becomes soft and pliable."
This is what the scribes said: "Jesus taught the people in parables, and never told them anything without using a simile."
# 78:2 This is the matter which was said by the Prophet: "Let me speak by metaphors, and inform you of hidden secrets, for thus was the world created." Explanation of the metaphor of the Zawān
At that time Jesus took the people with Him and entered the house, and He went to His disciples and said: "Let us interpret the parable of the sower."
Reply to them: "The noble female offspring is Ana, the daughter of Adam,"
The seed is the world, the bright sprout is the birth of God's kingdom, and the root is the birth of evil.
The enemy who planted them is Belzebub, and the harvest is the end of time, and the harvesters are the angels.
Exactly how the Zawan burns with fire, thus he will fall in the end times.
I am the son of man, so send your angels, and let them reach the corruptors, so that they may continue to work evil, unless My kingdom comes.
And they will be thrown into the midst of the fire, weeping and wailing for generations.
Now, these pious people, they're going to show you how the sun in the kingdom is just a delusion. There's got to be two witnesses, let them hear!» Like the treasure and the diamond and the network
"The kingdom of the heavens is like the buried mound in Sa'ina, he met a man named Ya'ki, who took his wealth, and in despair he sold everything he had and followed the Sa'ina path."
Zada, the kingdom of the heavens, is like a merchant who seeks the precious essence.
He found a valuable piece of gold, walked around, and sold everything he had to get it.
Zada, the kingdom of the heavens, resembles a net cast into the sea, and it was filled with various kinds of sea creatures.
When I was young, the fishermen took them to the shore, sat down, and placed the magnificent whale in boxes and threw away the one that was weak.
And thus will it be in the last days: the angels will separate the evil from the righteous.
And they will be thrown into the middle of the fire; the Gadi will weep and lament for many years.» The New and the Old
Jesus said to his disciples: "Have you understood this saying?" They replied: "Yes, we have."
He said to them: "This is like any teacher in a kingdom of heavens, who is similar to a landlord who brings out his belongings, both new and old, for his tenant's needs."
And at that time Jesus uttered this parable: "A man went a long way to a certain place."
And as Cajá saw in the assembly their belongings, he said to them: "How is it that this man has brought you wisdom and miracles?"
Hey brother, is this not the carpenter's son? Hey brother, isn't her name Mary? And aren't his brothers Jacob, Joseph, Samson, and Judah?
And where are all the girls here? What is this man doing with this thing?
And they complained about it. Jesus said to them: "The prophet has honor in his own country, among his own people, and in his own household."
And they never saw the miracles of Ghadi, nor believed in them.
The death of John the Baptist (Mark 6:14-29; Luke 9:7-9)
At that time, the king Herod heard news about Jesus,
He said to the attendants, "This John the Baptist has risen from the dead; this man is doing miracles."
And before Herod, John was imprisoned and executed by Herodias, and Philip was also executed.
On the account of John they said: "It is forbidden for you to take it."
And love kills; what fear did the people have concerning themselves, were they calculating John the prophet.
When my time came for Herod's birthday celebration, a daughter of Herodias danced at the party, and Herod was amazed,
This is how she gets what she wants, her promises and oaths so that she gets anything she asks for.
And his mother said to Herod: "Give me John the Baptist's head on a plate!"
And the king grieved, saying: "What shall I do about the thing he loved, on account of the oath he took and the guests."
And Shimon sent John's head as a prisoner.
Wajawa Raso put in a dish and gave it to the structure, saying, "Yaxi, shake it for your mother."
And James and John's disciples carried the body, laid it out, and buried it; then they went and told Jesus. Jesus assigned five thousand men (Mark 6:30–44; Luke 9:10–17; John 6:1–14).
When Jesus heard of this, he left the place and went to the region of Pella, walking through the countryside until he reached the border. When the people heard of him, they followed him, going on foot from the city.
The money of the fleet was spent on people, may they be blessed and may the patients among them be healed.
In the afternoon, Gaja called his disciples and said: "Today is fine, and this village is empty. I will send people out to the villages to buy food for them to eat."
Jesus said: "Moses commanded that they should go. Give them bread to eat."
Said Walo: "We have five loaves and two fowls."
Jesus said: "Give him that."
He ordered people not to sit on cannabis, gave the five loaves and the two fish, raised his eyes to heaven, blessed and divided the loaves, and gave them to the disciples; and the disciples gave them to the people.
And they were all called Klao and Shub'ua. They mocked, and made a joyful noise, full of favor.
The people who were with him were about five thousand men, excluding women and children. Jesus walks on the water (Mark 6:45–52; John 6:15–21).
Her exact intention was to instruct her disciples so that they would go into the lake and precede the opposite shore of the lake, so that he might send people to go there.
And after the people had sent off their spirits, they went up to the mountain to pray. And when the sun set, only the old man was left alone.
At this very moment, the flokka was far away from the shore, overwhelmed by the waves, and its position was determined by the wind.
And before dawn, Jesus walked on the water.
The students were afraid of my death, saw me walking over water, and said: "This is just imagination!" and began to scream out of fear.
Jesus spoke to them at that moment and said to them: "Be courageous. I am with you; do not be afraid!"
And Peter answered: "Lord, if it is you, command me to walk on the water."
Jesus said, "Eiga." Ema left, and Peter went out with the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
Ama the wind was strong, he was afraid, and his brother began to sink, and he cried out: "Lord, save me!"
At that moment Jesus stretched out his hands and said to them: "Your faith is weak. Why do you doubt?"
And they were scattered by the wind in the fig tree.
In the fig tree, Sajdolo was present and they said: "Truly, you are the son of God!" Jesus healed people of diseases at his place (Mark 6:53-56).
The vows of Jesus and his disciples are here in the region of Gennesaret.
And when I killed the people of the land, these knew Jesus; they spread the news throughout the entire region, and healed all the people who were sick.
And they asked me to let them touch even the edge of their shoe. And all of them were made to touch.
The inheritances of the ancestors (Mark 7:1-13)
And the Pharisees and the scribes said to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying:
"Do your students not respect the elders' traditions? And don't they wash their hands before eating?"
Reply to them: "Why haven't you obeyed God's command and are you truly sincere in your celebrations?"
# Exod 20:12; Deut 5:16; Exod 21:17; Lev 20:9. God said: "Honor your father and your mother, and whoever curses his father or mother shall be put to death."
Ama Intoma says: "If someone says to him, 'I didn't help you, so I didn't give to God, it's not necessary for him to honor God.'"
And they rejected the truth of God's word with the festivities of your own.
O hypocrites, believe Isaiah when he prophesied and said to you:
# 29:13 This people glorify me with their mouths, but their hearts are far from me.
It is wrong to worship in and teach in the commandments of men. "The human being becomes unclean (Mark 7:14-23)"
And Jesus called the people to him and said to them: "Listen and understand."
The thing that enters the mouth is what makes a person unclean; as for what comes out of the mouth, it is what makes a person unclean."
And they said to his disciples: "Behold, the Pharisees have heard this teaching and are amazed!"
Reply to them: "Every tree will not fall unless a wind from heaven blows upon it."
Get away from them! Blind men leading blind men. And if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.
Amos said: "So we have explained this parable."
Jesus said: "My friends, do you still not understand?"
Hey, what do you see entering the mouth that you walk to the belly, and then leave the body?
What comes out of the mouth, comes from the heart, and this is what defiles a person.
The heart produces evil thoughts, killing, adultery, corruption, theft, false witness, and disbelief.
These things which people touch become unclean. As for food eaten with hands, if it is not washed, it does not make a person unclean. Faith is of the Canaanite (Mark 7:24-30).
And Jesus went through Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction.
And Gadad said, "My lord, son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter dwells there, and a demon torments her."
But he answered her with only a word. He addressed his disciples and warned them, saying: "Give her what she desires, let her go away, and let her walk away and shout!"
Jesus replied: "Anna sent to look for the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
But she came down and stood before them, saying: "My lord, help me!"
And he replied: "Mosh baha' won't take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
She said: "Yes, sir! Even dogs eat what falls off the table of their master."
Jesus replied to her, "Mary, your faith is great! Go, do whatever you wish." At that moment her daughter was healed. Jesus healed her with a touch.
And Jesus went from Gadara and crossed over to the other side of the Sea of Galilee; and when he had come up on the mountain, he sat down at Gadara.
And he beat people, took people with them who were blind, lame, foolish, and drunk, and beat others, and put them in front of their legs while they were healing.
And people were amazed: the blind saw, the lame walked, the lepers were healed, and the deaf heard. They glorified God, the God of Israel. Jesus commissioned four thousand men (Mark 8:1-10).
And Jesus said to his disciples: "Pity the people, for they have been with me three days without eating. And we do not want to send them away hungry, for they would fall into the wilderness."
Wolou said to the students: "Where are we going to get bread in the wilderness? Isn't this enough for all of them?"
And Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" They said, "Seven loaves and a few small fish."
And Jesus commanded the people to sit down on the ground,
And the seven gave bread and the whale's fins, thanked God, divided among themselves, and gave to the disciples; and the disciples gave to the people.
And all of them were like Klae Lin, boasting and mocking the favor of seven great, full-bodied Qafaf.
There were four thousand men, excluding women and children.
And after the people had sent out their spirits, they emerged from the flok and walked to the area of Majdal.
Signs of the Times (Mark 8:11-13; Luke 12:54-56)
And the Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus, and asked Him to perform a sign from heaven.
And Jesus answered them: "The hour of my death has come; then you will say, 'The weather is fine, the sky is red.'"
In the morning they say: "There will be rain today, the sky is a dark red." You know how to interpret the condition of the sky, but you don't know how to interpret the signs of time.
The generation of the scribes and Pharisees said, "How can a miracle happen? A miracle did happen to Jonah." Then they went away and walked on. The leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees (Mark 8:14-21).
When they brought the students to the opposite side, they joined them to share bread.
Jesus said to them: "Arise, and take your leaven from the basket of the Pharisees and the Sadducees."
The students discussed with each other and said: "Here is no bread among us."
But Jesus knew this and said: "Your faith is weak. How do you argue with one another and say, 'Do we not have bread?'"
Hey bro, didn't you understand? Hey bro, don't you remember the five loaves that they divided among five thousand, and they didn't even have a big basket to carry them, and they all died with no benefit?
And the seven loaves of the four thousand's provisions, which were taken from a large dish, were they not?
How come you don't understand that we're not talking about bread? Reply with the yeast used by the French and the Catholics!
At this time they understood that He said to them: "Return with a measure of the teaching of the Friscians and the Sadoonites, the leaven of the bread." Peter witnessed that Jesus is the Christ (Mark 8:27-30; Luke 9:18-21).
At that time Jesus went to the house of Philip the son of Cyrenius, and he said to his disciples: "The people say to me, 'Are you the Son of Man?'"
Jawoboh: "Some say, 'You are John the Baptist,' others say, 'You are Elijah,' and others say, 'You are Jeremiah,' but none of the prophets."
They said to them: "Are you telling me lies?"
Simon Peter replied: "You are the Christ, the Son of God the living."
Jesus said to him, "Simon, son of John, you have health! No flesh and blood has revealed this to you, but my Father in heaven."
And I tell you: Peter, the one with us, has a large room, and on that room we will build my church, and the enemy will not be able to overcome it.
"Give them the keys of the kingdom of heaven, so that they may bind on earth what has been bound in heaven, and loose on earth what has been loosed in heaven."
The time has come; Jesus has appointed his disciples not to speak until the time comes when the Christ is revealed. Jesus first announces this at his own ministry and resurrection (Mark 8:31; 9:1; Luke 9:22–27).
And at that time Jesus began to tell his disciples that he was going to Jerusalem, where he would be delivered over to the chief priests and elders and the scribes of the Jews, and suffer persecution and death, and on the third day he would rise again.
And Peter pushed Jesus aside and began to rebuke him, saying, "By no means, Lord! This shall not happen to you!"
But Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You do not have in mind, how God is, how people are."
At this time Jesus said to his disciples: "If anyone loves me, he will remain faithful to my spirit and will bear his cross and follow me."
Go and see who loves and gives up their life to lose it, and who loses their life for me so they can win it.
What is the pleasure of a person who gains all of this world and loses his life? And what is the need that a person sacrifices to save his life?
Rani Anna, son of man, we shall escape with my angels in the glory of Papa, and at this time we shall judge every man on what he has done.
You have the truth: There is suspicion among those standing here who do not want to see death before seeing me, Anna, the son of man, coming into my kingdom.
Jesus appears in his glory to his disciples (Mark 9:2–13; Luke 9:28–36)
And after six days, Jesus took Peter, James, and John aside, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
Their faces changed, and their features shone as the sun shines, and their bodies became white as light.
And the Gadites saw Moses and Elijah talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus: "Lord, how about we set up three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And my killing is still speaking, their cloaks are veiled clouds, and the voice of the cloud said: "This is my son that we have longed for, and I have rejoiced greatly in him; listen to his words!"
When the students heard this, they turned pale and were frightened.
And Jesus came and touched him, and said: "Arise, do not be afraid."
And when they saw me, they mocked their eyes, those who saw Jesus alone.
And when they said to Him, "We saw the Son of Man rising from the dead," Jesus said to them, "Do not tell anyone until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
The students asked him: "Why does the Jewish book say that Elijah must come first?"
Reply to them: "Indeed, Elijah will come, and he will make everything right."
Amma Anna nalkum ilia jaa wahoma ma 'arfoush, amma 7abala feh ya hubou 'ala. Wa anna ibn al-insan zada basha nata3ab 3ala yadihim.
And at this time the disciples understood that He was teaching them about John the Baptist. Jesus healed the son of Sakanu of the demon (Mark 9:14-29; Luke 9:37-43).
And when Jesus and his disciples were going among the people, a man with a disability came and approached Jesus, saying:
'O Lord, have mercy on my son, for he suffers torment and agony at the slightest provocation, and he is thrown into fire and water.'
And I brought them to your disciples, but home, we did not heal them."
And Jesus answered and said: "O generation of vipers! How long shall I endure you? How long shall I put up with you? Have I not been with you all along?"
And Jesus cast out the devil, and the boy was healed at that moment.
Nowadays, the disciples of Jesus are by his side and they said: "Why aren't we staying with him and leaving him?"
They said to them: "Because of your weak faith! If you had a faith as strong as the sprout of the thistle, you would say to the mountain, 'Here is the truth, bring it to Gadi!' and it would move, and you would be able to do everything."
# 17:21 There are ancient texts containing this verse: "As for this kind, it was expelled through prayer and fasting." Jesus tells this again during his ministry and resurrection (Mark 9:30-32; Luke 9:43-45).
At that time the disciples were gathered in Galilee, and Jesus said to them: "The Son of Man will deliver me over to the authorities to be condemned and put to death."
And they will kill me, and in the third day we will rise. Don't worry, brothers. Jesus pushes away the temple goods.
Kjao lekfar naahom meshaw el yelma fi al-dhurayb mta3 al-hikma libtarus wa qala: "Ya khay al-mu'allim mta3kam yadha2 al-dhurayb?"
Reply: "Yes, indeed." And the spirit spoke to the house, preceding Jesus in speech and saying: "What do you think, Simon? Do the kings of the earth take their wealth from the Shunamites or from the people of their own lands, or from the Brazen?"
Peter said, "From the Brainians." Jesus said, "Ema, the children of the land are free."
Ama we don't want to create a problem. Go to the lake, throw the torch, and pull the net that you catch, and when you cut it open, you'll find enough silver jewelry to pay for both of you. Shake it and get rid of all your and your partner's trash.
