The greatest in the kingdom of heaven (Mark 9:33–37; Luke 9:46–48)
At this time, the disciples of Jesus asked: "Is Jesus the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
And Jesus called a little child and stood among them
He said: "You have been guided: if you have not entered the kingdom of heaven, you will not have experienced the small children's upbringing."
He humbles himself and treats this little child thus, for he is the greatest of all in the kingdom of heaven.
Why would a little boy accept me, how could he even think of my name?
What could be the cause of a stumbling block for one of the children of this man who has brought them good, was related to a large stone in his neck that would plunge into the heart of the sea.
Oh world, what needs make people commit sins! These are the needs that must come, what about the human being who satisfies the needs that make people commit sins!
And if your hand or your foot leads you to commit sins, cut them off and cast them far away; yet if your foot or your hand is cut off, you will enter eternal life, and your hand or foot will be intact, but if you enter the fire forever, your hand or foot will remain whole.
"And if your eye causes you to commit sins, pluck it out and cast it far away; for it is better for you to lose sight in one eye and enter eternal life, than to lose both eyes and go into hell." (Luke 15:3-7)
"Return to them what you have received, do not disgrace one single child of theirs. You will see: the angels have their belongings in heaven, always seeing the face of the One in heaven."
# 18:11 There are old texts containing this verse: "Rani ana ibn al-insan jita bash nakhli al-dza'ee'in."
Which one of you would say: if a man has ninety-nine waters and one of them is lost, wouldn't the remaining ninety-nine go up the mountain and search for the one that is lost?
You're right, if he encounters it, he'll be even happier with the ninety-nine, until what was lost.
"Let not one of you say to his brother, 'Go, and do not come back,' for he will surely perish." (Luke 17:3)
"If your heart is wrong toward you, go and say to your mistake between you and Akahu; and if he hears your words, you have won your heart."
If what you heard was that one person witnessed it, and no other witnesses accompanied you, then every word you said would require two witnesses, not just one.
If what has heard their words, say to the church, and if what has not heard the words of the church, consider how one is not a believer nor a member.
Your truth: What you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and what you release on earth will be released in heaven.
You remind me again: if one of you agrees on anything they want on earth, let it happen in the sky so it can be done for them.
And they will gather around me, three or four, and I will say, "Let us be in the midst of them." Like the servant who does not forgive.
At that time, Peter said to Jesus: "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister if they sin against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus said to him: "I will not take you seven times, but seventy times seven."
This is how the kingdom of heavens resembles a king of love accounting with his servants.
As long as they are being judged, one Jabolu asks for money without a record.
As N'Golo says, Sidou will follow him, Mertu, Wadla, and everything he has will be safe in money.
Oxai, ta'ah al-khadiim 3ala rikaybo wa qala: "O my lord, O my lord, be patient with me, and I will save you in everything!"
And they mocked him, Sidu and Sibbu, and they conspired against the religion.
Amah the servant, this one, went out and met another servant, who was asking for some money, saying: "Give me the money we were asking for!"
Ya khay, ta'ah al-khadiim al-ghayr 'ala rikaybo wa tashahato wa qala: "Asbira 'ala, taw nakhliyak."
And what benefit is there in holding fast, walking, or enduring imprisonment until they free themselves from the religion they follow?
They revealed the other servants what had happened, they were worried about a brush and a shoe and informed their mistress that nothing had happened.
This is the time of Nadal, and they said: "O Abd, O villain! I forgave you in religion, this very day, on your account I covered myself."
And you, O master, how can you forgive your servant your friend, how can you forgive him?
And he covered Sidu, and he prayed to the responsible party for imprisonment until Lin would settle the debts of the people of Klu.
Thus, Papa in the sky will work with each one of you if he does not forgive you from his heart.
Marriage and Divorce (Mark 10:1-12)
And Jesus spoke this word, going from the region of Galilee and entering the region of Judea along the way of the Jordan.
And after him came a group, and they were healed.
And Wajah was a member of the Fressien group, and they asked him to try them: "My brother, is it halal for one person to release a goat for any reason?"
Reply to them: "O mankind, indeed, We created you from a single soul, from a male and a female."
# Tek 1:27; 2:24; Af 5:31; I Koo 6:16 said: "How can a man leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and become one flesh with her?"
Ema la Homa ma a3adash thayn, ama badn wad. Hathaaka 3ala shi yajmou Allah ma yafarqush al-insan.
# 24:1-4 The Pharisees asked Jesus: "Is it lawful for Moses to command a man to give his wife a bill of divorce and then to send her away?"
Jesus said to them: "Moses permitted you to release your wives at the whim of your brothers' desire. But this need was not present from the beginning, how could it have been?"
And we say to you: Whoever divorces his wife due to a cause other than adultery and then marries another woman, he will be committing adultery.
Sayoulu to the students: "If this is the state of the man with Marto, it would be better if he were not."
He said to them: "Do people generally accept what is said? Indeed, do people accept what Allah puts forward?"
There is a suspicion that when people marry, they are not able to bear children from their mother's womb; there is a suspicion that people are unable to marry because they have needs that make them unable to do so; and there is a suspicion that people do not want to marry because they are afraid of the kingdom of heaven. Those who are involved in this matter should make it happen. Jesus blesses the little children (Mark 10:13–16; Luke 18:15–17).
And Jesus made little children and laid his hands on them, and blessed them. Master, the disciples, do not let the people who have been blessed by you go.
And Jesus said: "Let the little children come to me, do not hinder them; for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
And he put down his hand and walked along this path. The Rich Man (Mark 10:17–31; Luke 18:18–30)
One said: "O teacher, what are those great burdens that we must bear in order to gain eternal life?"
Jesus said to him: "Why do you ask about the great commandments? Is there one great commandment? If you wish to enter life, keep the commandments."
# Matt 20:12–16; Luke 5:16–20 They said, "Are these the commandments?" And Jesus said, "Do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness,"
# Do not 19:18 honor your father and your mother, but you must love your neighbor as you love yourself.»
The boy said: "Needs are destroying them all, we're working on them, but what about the deficiency still remaining?"
Jesus said to him: "If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions, give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Come, follow me!"
As the boy heard the thing, this went sad in their thoughts, and he had a brush of things.
Jesus said to his disciples: "It is impossible for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven!"
And once again, let us say: It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for one rich man to enter the kingdom of God.
The students heard this and said: "How can the sun set with a brush?""
Jesus said to them: "This is impossible for men, but for God all things are possible."
At this moment Peter replied: "Have we not made everything and followed you? Why should we take anything?"
Jesus said to them: "I tell you the truth: when I, the Son of Man, am lifted up, I will sit on the throne of glory in the world to come. But you will be cast down, and you will go and follow me, so that you may sit on thrones judging the thrones of the children of Israel."
And whoever leaves behind no siblings, no brothers, no sisters, no father, no mother, no children, no property in my name, will take water from the well he has dug and inherit eternal life.
People in the first will not want to be in the last, and people in the last will not want to be in the first."
Like the servants, the grapes of Saneen
"Rahy of the kingdom of heavens resembles Moulie Dar who left the morning house, Bakri, to place servants in the grapes' garden of his people."
And an agreement was made with the Khadama to exchange silver goods during the day, and they were sent off with dates.
And he went out with the nine; he saw another group standing in the market, busy and active.
He said to them: "You have increased the amount of dates, and now give us our due, O my brother!"
He left again about half past noon, accompanied by the three evening belongings, and did the same thing.
And he left with the five people at the evening meal, and met some others sitting there, and said to them: "Are your companions sitting here all day long?"
Gallu said: "Even one of us who is disabled will serve." They said to them: "You have increased your service by serving in the vineyard."
As in the evening, the servant of the grape said to the lazy man in the courtyard: "Call the servants and set them free, let them go until they reach the ruler."
And the group began serving with the five of the evening, each of them having a silver spoon.
And when I killed Jau al-Walaa, they all walked in their minds that they would take more money from others; yet each of them took a silver item.
And when I killed Homar, they covered themselves with grapevine.
They said: "The ones who served you served for one hour, and you have finished them! How about us who served the entire day in the furnace!"
One of them replied: "O my friend, I never wronged you. Didn't we agree upon the silver goods?"
Defend your rights and move on. I wanted to give to the other person this, just as we give to you.
"Hey, I don't have the right to spend my money however I want, do I? Or are you envious of my life, Anaa Karem?"
Jesus said, "The two will go to the one, and the one will go to the two." Jesus tells this a third time at the time of his journey and resurrection (Mark 10:32–34; Luke 18:31–34).
And as Jesus was coming up to Jerusalem, He shook the dust of His disciples on their shoulders and said to them on the way:
"Hanna, we are going to Jerusalem, and I, the Son of Man, will be delivered over to the leaders of the priests and the scribes of the Jews, and they will condemn me to death."
And yet I will be delivered over to the Gentiles, so that they may trample on me with their feet and crucify me, and on the third day I will rise again." This was what Jacob and John requested (Mark 10:35–45).
And with her, her daughter, she prostrated herself before them and asked me for something.
Jesus said to her, "Do you want me to give you something?" She replied, "I command that my children, these two, may sit, one at your right hand and the other at your left, in your kingdom."
Jesus replied: "Why are you sitting there asking for something you don't even know? Come, let us drink from the water that I have brought, so that we may drink from it?" They said: "Come!"
He said to them: "You won't drink from my cup, as for what I have decided, who will sit at my right and at my left? As for the one who came to bring people here."
And when I killed them, the ten disciples of the others heard this, covering their brothers with dust.
Then Jesus said to them, "You know that the rulers of the people govern them, and have power to rule over them."
Am a noutoma, lazem ma yekoon shay' haadaka. Am a yihab yekoon fi kum 'azim, khalihi yekoon khadim li kum.
And whoever loves to dominate among you will have his authority become the servant of all people.
Even I, son of man, do not come to be served by people; rather, I come to serve them and to give my life so that I might lose it for their sake. Jesus heals Bartimaeus the blind man (Mark 10:46–52; Luke 18:35–43).
And when Jesus and his disciples were leaving from Arimathea, a crowd followed him.
And there were some blind men sitting by the roadside, and they heard Jesus approaching from Gadah, and they began to shout: "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"
O people, call out to them so they may not remain silent. As for us, we called out more: "O our Lord, O son of David, have mercy upon us!"
And Jesus stood up and said to them: "What do you want me to do for you?"
Sayuloo: "O our master, let us go back and see!"
And Jesus looked upon them, and His disciples also, and they saw nothing, and followed Him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem (Mark 11:1-11; Luke 19:28-40; John 12:12-19)
Jesus and his disciples went to Jerusalem and arrived at a village called Bethphage, near the Mount of Olives. At that time Jesus sent one of his disciples,
And they said to them: "Go to the village opposite you; you will find a herd of animals tied up with a lion beside them, and their bonds and their pouches will be loosened."
And if anyone tells you something, reply: "God has given it to them." And return to them at the same time.
This is what happened, so that it may be said that the Prophet said:
# 62:11; Zak 9:9 Say to the daughter of Shechem: "Your king is like a humble one, riding on a beast and on the back of a wild animal."
The sons of Zuz did the work and carried out what Jesus commanded them.
And they took the beast and the lion, and laid upon them their thrones, and Jesus rode upon them.
Most people scattered their bread crumbs along the road, and others cut branches of trees and laid them along the road.
# Muz 118:26; Lu 2:14; Met 21:15; 23:39 And the people who came before them shall follow them, shouting: We have appointed for David's son! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! We have appointed in the high places!
And as Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked: "Who is this?"
People said, "This is the Prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus drives out the sellers from the temple (Mark 11:15–19; Luke 19:45–48; John 2:13–22).
And Jesus went into the temple courts and drove out those who were buying and selling there, turning over the tables of the sellers and spilling the coins of the money changers, and overturning the seats of those who were selling doves.
# 56:7; 7:11 And they said to them: "It is written in the Holy Book: 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' and you have turned it into a den of thieves!"
And the blindness and the deformity of the structure, and it is their edge.
But the priests and the scribes, the Jews' leaders, covered their eyes and saw the miracles which Jesus performed, and how the little children were calling out in the temple: "Holy, holy, holy, is David's son!"
# 8:2 And he said to them, "See, you are sitting there, hearing them say, 'What?' Jesus said to them, 'Indeed, yes. Have you not read this scripture: "A child's voice of praise to God, and the infants still nursing?"'"
And they separated them; the Berea went out, not to the city of Beena, and the Gadi stayed. Jesus curses the fig tree (Mark 11:12-14, 20-24)
And when I was killed, I was returning to the city in the morning, Jesus was hungry.
Washaf karmat on the side of the road, ya khay, masha'ala, and he didn't find anything but paper, and he said to her: "Your age, you won't get the harvest forever!" And the date tree withered at the time.
The students were curious and discovered what had happened, and they said: "Why does the date palm take so long?"
And Jesus answered them: "You will know the truth if you have faith, and if you do not doubt, you will do the works that the Father has given you to do. If you say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea!' and it does not happen, it will not happen."
Whatever you need in prayer, trust in us and take it. The power belongs to Jesus (Mark 11:27–33; Luke 20:1–8).
And as Jesus was entering the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him and said: "By what authority are you doing these things? And what gives you this authority?"
Jesus replied to them: "Ask me one question, and if I answer it, I will transfer you to any power I have in doing this thing:"
Where did John's baptism come from? From heaven or from people? Listen, they must understand each other: "If we say 'from heaven,' aren't we really asking, 'Why didn't they believe in it?'"
But if they say: "It is from the people," we fear the people's money, and all of them are certain that John is a prophet.
Emała Jabowa said to Jesus: "We don't know." And Jesus said to them: "Even I myself do not have the power to perform any action in this matter." Like the fig tree and the birth
"Shanwe Raykum? There's a man with a son. He went first and said: 'My son, go serve today in the vineyard.'"
Yaxi jawaobo woldo: "Ma nish maashi." Amma mabedad nedom weshi.
And he went to the other one, and they said the same thing they said to the first one: "Answer, master!" "I am not going," he replied. "I am not going."
"Ananah, what about the brothers who do the things they love?" The elders replied, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, those who judge the adulterous and the women who commit sins will enter the kingdom of God before you."
John, how can a man believe in him, seeing that the Pharisees and Sadducees do not believe in him? Even when they saw the miracle, they did not believe. Just as the servants of the owner of the vineyard (Mark 12:1-12; Luke 20:9-19).
"Listen to another example: There was a man who planted a vineyard, built a wall around it, constructed a press within it, and set up winnowing and threshing equipment for a group of five, then traveled to another land."
As the time nears when grapes are sweet, the servants of the fifth bring the wine so that they may drink it.
And they seized the five servants, took their belongings, beat one of them, killed another, and threw a third one with a stone.
Molay al-Intab sent servants again more numerous than those sent in the first time, saying: "Do the same thing with them."
Distances like theirs, and he said: "I will raise my children."
My five sons saw the boy and said to one another: "This is the one who will inherit! Let us kill him and take their inheritance!"
And they took the grapes from the vineyard, brought them out, and killed them.
"Amala, when I killed him, was the owner of the grapes from Sana'a coming to work on the fifth day?!"
The Jewish elders said: "Let HaKa kill the wicked and give Saneh the grapes to five others who will give them the grape juice at the proper time."
# Matt 11:22-23; Acts 4:11; Isa 2:7. Jesus said to them: "How long will you remain in ignorance of the Scriptures? The builders rejected the stone, but it became the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes."
This is how it is with you: the kingdom of God will destroy you and give itself over to a people who produce its fruit.
# 21:44 There are old texts containing this verse: "Rani ana ibn al-insan jait baash nakhlees al-dza'ee'in."
And when I was killed, the priests and Pharisees heard the elders say, "This is it," and they understood that he was speaking to them about himself.
They tried to kill him, they were afraid of people, because in their minds they considered him a prophet.
Like the king's feast (Luke 14:15-24)
And Jesus once again spoke to them in parables, saying:
"The kingdom of the heavens is like a king performing a midnight ceremony at a wedding feast."
The Khadams sent to call the summoned for the wedding party, while Homa had not come.
Then they sent out others again and said: "Say to the summoned: 'Hani has come to the feast, slaughtered the bulls and the fat cows, and everything has been prepared—Ejao for the night party, the wedding supplies!'"
But home, we didn't make an account for the night party and didn't go to their houses, one went to the Saniya people, and one went to the Hanotho.
And the others sent their servants, took their belongings, and killed them.
The king covered himself and sent out the soldiers to attack and killed the criminals, burning their city.
And [he] said to the servants, "The women have arrived, but as for those who were summoned, they will not come."
Ema la emshio lel shawarit, wasta3a qad ma tannajma al-ina3 lel sahria mta3 al-3arz.
And the servants took you out to the road, and brought the sorrowing and the despairing people, all of them. Oh, how the house of celebration is filled with guests.
When I was young, the king would go to see the guests, and he saw a man not wearing any clothes. He said:
How did you get dressed up like that, wearing wedding clothes? Man, the guy stayed silent.
At that time the king said to the eunuchs: "Take their shoulders from my hands, their legs, and place them in the darkness and the sand, so that they may weep and lament the years."
"Rahm, the people summoned, while a few selected ones are chosen." The Sadducees confront the Emperor (Mark 12:13–17; Luke 20:20–26).
Right now, these people are the Pharisees, and they have agreed among themselves how they can obtain Jesus by a word.
Bephalo the disciples' belongings and companions, a group from the party of Herod, and said: "Teacher, we know you are truthful, and you have learned the truth of the way of God; what matters to you is not even your own thoughts, regarding the positions people hold."
Say to us: What's your opinion? Brother, is it permissible to pay the taxes to the Emperor or not?
And Jesus saw their hypocrisy, and said to them: "You hypocrites! How long shall I put up with you?"
"Give me the money from the spoils!""Give me the silver from Jabulolo."
Jesus said to them: "Is this the image and this the name?"
They said: "The Emperor's belongings!" Said Ya'kub to them: "Exchange! Give the Emperor's belongings to the Emperor, and the Lord's belongings to God!"
And they were amazed at my words, hearing this saying: "What about the resurrection of the dead?" (Mark 12:18–27; Luke 20:27–40)
Today, this Bido Jao, the Sadducee, is with Jesus and those who say there is no resurrection after death, and they asked him a question.
# Tath 25:5 They said: "O teacher, Moses said: 'If a man dies without children, his brother shall marry his wife and bear children for him.'"
And there were seven brothers among us, the first brother was married and died without leaving any offspring, and Murto took his place.
The same thing happened to the second and third, until the seventh.
And their entire base has increased; the people have perished.
Amaalaa on the Day of Judgment will say: "This is how you will be treated, and all of them will be punished because of her."
Jesus replied to them: "You are so mistaken, because of your hearts, what you have understood of the Scriptures and of God's power."
On the Day of Judgment, they will not be married, nor will they be married to anyone; as for how they will be, the angels in the heavens.
And you were like the dead on the Day of Resurrection, O people! What made you not fear Allah?
# 3:6 "Is not Abraham's God, Isaac's God, and Jacob's God, the God of the dead, the God of the living?"
When people heard this teaching, they were pleased with it. The greatest commandment (Mark 12:28–34; Luke 10:25–28)
But when they heard the Pharisees, they were silent, and they were ashamed among themselves.
And one of them, a scholar of Islamic law, asked a question to test:
"O teacher, what is the most important obligation in the Sharia?"
# 6:5 Jesus said to Jacob: "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind."
This is the first and greatest of all warnings.
# No 19:18; Met 19:19; Gla 5:14; Ro 13:9; Yc 2:8 The second commandment, how it is to be observed, love your neighbor as you love yourself.
The entire Law and the Prophets are based on the Zuz and the commandments of Haza'um. Christ and David (Mark 12:35-37; Luke 20:41-44).
At that time the Pharisees were gathered together with one another to ask Jesus a question:
"Is Christ a son of Shun?"" He said: "A son of David!"
They said: "How could David, when he was struck down and his spirit was faint, call upon 'The Lord'?" And he said:
# Mz 110:1; 'A' 2:34-35; 'Ab' 1:13; 10:13. My Lord said to His companion: "Sit at My right hand until I cause your enemies to be placed beneath your feet."
If David calls his Lord "Our Lord," how then can Emal be called "Loudo"?
Even one person who used to answer with a word. And today, not a single person encourages anyone to ask any question.
Jesus warns from the Book about the greed of the Jews and the Pharisees (Mark 12:38-40; Luke 11:37-52; 20:45-47).
And Jesus said to the people and to his disciples:
"The book is the property of the Jews and the Pharisees, sitting on the seat of Moses,"
Ema, work and keep everything they tell you about it. As for what you don't do, how they don't do it, it's in their minds, saying it and not doing it:
They place it on the shoulders of people, while their fingers never touch it.
They grow up, becoming taller and broader in their bodies.
And they love to sit in the first rows during evening prayers and in the front seats during gatherings.
They love people who greet them in the markets and call out to them: "O teachers!"
Amma Intoma, you must not let yourselves go so far as to have someone call you: "Teachers," for in your hearts all of you are brothers and you have only one teacher.
And you would not say to even one person on earth, "O Bonah," while having in your mind only one person who is in heaven.
And you didn't leave until someone told you: "O my lord," there is one lord among you who is Christ.
And let one of your big guys serve you
The spirit descends, and the humble one is exalted.
O you who believe! O Book of the Jews and hypocritical Pharisees! Drink from the kingdom of heaven in the faces of the servants; do not enter, nor let those who enter be entered.
# 23:14 There are ancient texts containing this verse: "Woe to you, O books of the Jews! Woe to you, hypocritical Pharisees! You deceive women by pretending they are men who have died, and take their homes, and consider your prayers to be longer than they actually are. This is how your account will be great before my Lord."
O welcome, O book of the Jews and hypocritical Pharisees! You break open the land and the sea so that one may enter your religion; and when he enters, you cast him into hell, twice over!
O welcome, O elders, O blind ones! Those who say: "He who swears by the Temple structure is not required to swear by the right hand, whereas he who swears by the Temple's gold is required to swear by the right hand."
Ana is the one with greater value, O fools and blind ones? Gold or the structure that returns gold is sacred?
They say: "Obligation does not attach to swearing by the altar, but obligation attaches to swearing by the sacrifices placed above the altar."
Ana is the one with greater value, you blind ones? Is the sacrifice or the altar that receives the sacrifice sacred?
Amla the one who swears by the altar, "I swear by it and by that which is above the sky!"
And he shall swear by the structure, he shall swear by it, and by one who dwells in it.
And he shall swear by the heavens, by the Throne, and by God who is seated upon it.
O you Book of the Jews and hypocritical Pharisees! You give the herbs of mint, thyme, and cumin, but neglect the most important things in the religion—justice, mercy, and faith. It was obligatory for you to do these things and not to let yourselves be harmed.
You lead people, you blind ones! You describe water as that of Namosis and drink the camel's milk.
O you Book of the Jews and hypocritical Pharisees! Wash the cup and plates from brine, and from within two full vessels filled with greed and covetousness.
O Faresi, O blind one! First wash the cup and plates from inside with water from the well, so that they become clean.
O you Book of the Jews and hypocritical Pharisees! How about the graves coated with white, from which, from the side, the bones of the dead and all their belongings are clearly visible.
And indeed, among them are those who appear to people as righteous, but within them are hidden hypocrisy and wrongdoing.
O book of the Jews! O hypocritical Pharisees! You build shrines over the tombs of the prophets and adorn the dwellings of the pious righteous.
They say: "Jina was present during the time of our ancestors; we did not participate in killing the prophets."
See how you testify against your own rulers to Antoma, and how you killed the prophets.
Emała Intoma and the balance of your ancestors' belongings
O children of al-Faleh, how can you escape the punishment of Hell's torment?
This is how we sent you prophets and wise people and a scripture; there are among them some who will kill them and crucify them, and there are among them some who will beat them with rods in your gatherings and plunder them from city to city.
# Exod 4:8; Num 11:4; Zak 1:1; II Kings 24:21, blood that is clean shall come upon you from the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous, to the blood of Zechariah, son of Berchiah, who was slain between the sanctuary and the altar.
You have made the truth clear: The grieving ones, all of them, will come to this generation! Jesus' love for Jerusalem (Luke 13:34–35)
"O Jerusalem, O Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone the messengers sent to you—how often have I longed to gather your children together, like a hen gathers her chicks under her wings. How long, O Jerusalem, will you continue?"
Your house will become a ruin.
Rani, you're telling us: "You won't see me again until the time comes when you say: 'Blessed is the one who came in the name of the Lord!'"
Jesus tells them about the destruction of the Temple (Mark 13:1-2; Luke 21:5-6)
