And our desire was all of us
Now at last
The bank is watching me
I'll give it to him with a friend
He does not know what the working hours amount to
Ok ok ya Allah with peace
He didn't agree, right?
Does he mean what can possibly come out?
They are now in a hurry
Before dawn, and I, O you, go to the bank
A learner of the whole of these years, Idaom
For sure he feels the tension
What is best for him
You guys let him rest a bit.
Poor Farhan, he will return home

But I called him and they said the manager, gave me a hand, bound
Give me these trading pairs
Hello, Mrs. Saad.

Welcome, Ellis Yana
Good day, you won't want to miss it
Adabj from ministry to ministry regarding government transactions
Adabj from Wazah to Wazirah
and the transactions of the minors
Treat them all, the great and the small, as equals, for you are their guardian.
The elderly men have important duties related to their appearance.
And at that time Mazhoush Shansawi
Every day I meet with the manager and the responsible person and with the minister.
It means they have nice duties, but they need time to keep them busy and occupied.
And it will spread, and you will get rid of your transactions and customs, and you will take on a second job that will make you a loyal servant after that.
Yaik al-hin jazaka Allah
Come on, buddy, with peace
Alah, forgive us, O Ada, O Boosahin
Alright, they called me up and said, "Alright, it's done."
If you treat your father with disrespect, you will lose the relationship.
I'm sorry, I'm late and I'm tired.
Your Lord is afraid
Bagaar impossible, Bagaar himself cannot manage
From your love towards him
See, are you among the hypocrites and the wrongdoers among you and your actions?
You don't even respect the gray hair on your heads.
I was in the cave, and it became two days for him.
From these streets and from this sun
Oil gives you the treatment
And the spirit of Arkaz delivered him to him
Committee arrived in the morning to stay all day
I heard him say
My foundation is built upon Zain.
As long as Bajr has the last day with the committee
Your transaction is mandatory to be processed by the agent
And indeed, at night, come to me and complain to me from them
Bajir has a team that is required to be able to do it for them
What's up, Papa
His tears in his eyes
Actually, I didn't tell my parents.
The committee is who changed their opinion.
They said, "By the end of the week"
Inzen, you're right, dad.
O Yaba, don't go
I am going to heaven and nothing will stop me.
Mub qaid li atarziz fi al-kaftriya ma3 al-khaisat
Mock him
Inzen Khalas
I'm going to apologize to him
I'm going to him
Thank you, Yabouk
Khaloud ya Yebah
Thank you, Guolan
And it emerged that after arrogance
And what worries you on the day when the committee will not come?
You are the best and the blessing
From today and gone
We'll handle our transactions ourselves.
Tels from the house
And this is your father's head, Abu Sa.
Hello hello hello, oh book

And I will not yield
And you are like what I have given you
I have been dealt a bad hand in this transaction
I truly love her, personally.
They said to me, "Come, let us hasten him."
You have a meeting
With the minister's happiness
Prepare her for the moment Yabouk
To have pride with Halkbar
O my joy, they said, "Your son with the white horse, this is he."
Trust in Allah, the spirit of your longevity is in Him.
Boosaid and Wink
The one who Islamed you, huh?
Aka the situation is quite bad
You just pass by, and I'm already setting up the room with the bed
My love, hey hey
It means what happened
The obvious has been forgotten
because the committee met an hour later
There is no god but Allah, I have submitted to Him.
I have a meeting with the minister today and Awila
Just give me the transaction
My situation is work at home and home at work.
No, Win Magoff had limit
Peace be upon you
And upon you, O mercy, be mercy.

Returned the people to their homes
Waiyibun has a journey and they tell him to speak on the radio and television.
And the one more than a single one
Take him, hold him, brothers, and throw him into prison.
Believe in me, my brothers.
Oh daughter of the lawful, no one is helping anyone these days.
Face the problems
And by God, if I died right now
What made him pretend? Because of his statement, it's all ruined.
Praise God for his safety
The Birkah visited us
With Salamah
Late on work job
Listen, Yebah
I was all night long yesterday
And I warn you
Now, just wanted to remind you, hey Yebah.
Shorten it
Impossible after having contacted
No broadcast, no television, even KiuTel mobile connected
Your sister Ayisha's apartment is now hers for two days.
And Mirah, your wife, wept four times in her pit
It's forbidden for you, Ya Yabah, to spare us and the one who spares your parents.
As you said
But we're in trouble
What's left is your waiting
Look, uncle Bo, aminerah
Yana after what you did to me in prison
said Khalas
Break the silence
After Zoor, O Yabeh, received his gift, a treaty was concluded with him, and he was protected from Iblis, and surely, nothing bad will happen.
The second hand takes your hand and your rightful, lawful hand releases her child.
Shorten it
Bow after I say
If I contact radio and television, I only reach yourself.
Qat lj tobeh
Let me go, I'm going now
Between me and you, just this talk
I am the manager Qali
Who is his prophet with us?
This is Bajir, I'm going to report to the administration

Azin, the current manager, said that
Hey, he has a million excuses and excuses to say
And when I go, it means
But anyway, just forget it.
I miss you
O yes
With Salamah
I gave you
It means you know, Saleh, I've beaten you.
The general interest has compelled us to reduce the number of officials in the ministries.
You're right, I agree with you.
The one who Islamed you, just him, but we are ruined.
Your sweet treat
But we're in trouble
Yes, indeed
You are my beloved
We have a job, if you don't mind.
And what about that guy, ya boy?
Lin andber the matters
Haa ashqit lija ana 'an sahlaḥ
What did he say about the renovation?
And from him, he was standing and heard when I said
Why did you say that?
I hear them with my own eyes, Tony, from the mills
My soul right now, you're inside
And let me agree with Abu J
The prison door, we said it was wrong and stayed silent.
We remain silent after what we have shown
But since we're from
I found out how they do it
Guard against Iblis
God willing, nothing bad will happen but only good.
Remember Allah, may He guide you
I don't want to, make me coffee please
Know me
Mutmell
Wait, uncle, with your permission, two weeks?
And by God, neither will anyone grasp your hand or your rightful authority to release you.
I'm here even if you rise
You're bringing me misfortunes
But take it on yourself
Even if one told you
Listen to yourself, what you hear
He's just a bunch of trash
Ayo ya umm hoh
But they didn't bother me today and yesterday
You made us feel so sad, my friend, we only hear it from you once, just once.
No way, man
So that you become the condition
Lala you don't understand it wrong
And my uncle had a problem when we asked him to speak in Arabic on the radio.
He was hesitant, that's all.
Hussein, we called him at a public place and he hesitated.
Say truthfully, my uncle's son, I have the house, and I spoke to him privately, better.
It means you feel like he has to say something.
Means hesitating and not hesitating
They returned from some place where they had been dwelling
But but but but but but but
I am not your mother, I don't know you, and you will be punished on the Day of Judgment. I heard it, and so will you.
Salih Saad
No Allah, I didn't get this, just thanks a lot, we appreciate it.
You feel a sense of responsibility.
An example of a successful employee
But unfortunately
Although I tried
Hello to you all
You're making yourself suffer and wasting time
I'm Tony, I spoke with the secretary to let you know that he's coming.
Shahin Ashfaq

Afaa in had in Qatar what I know Saleh just nonsense
You're valid, but our system is broken
But we're in trouble
The job
But Mafai's responsibilities mean you have to understand the circumstances.
Zain ya Al-Riyal, why didn't they hire him?
Who is working here with us?
What made you leave this place, God Almighty, O Maynirah, you didn't stay.
Even one person told me before I arrived five minutes ago was at work but once they left, they were gone.
My girl, yesterday he divorced her and took her money and
It means my responsibility has become this huge one.
After one, his responsibility became this huge one
And by God, I don't know what I'm doing, and by God
Is a member of the Minister's office
But honestly, I'm not going to change it.
They think I'm afraid to put him there.
Well, I've been slaughtered
Who told you I play basketball?
But dad, that way is too far from me
Think about how to sacrifice him in that way
Only once
But I'm hungry
I know him

I consider your voice to be the voice of truth.
Hey Boofeh, after you've lifted and thrown it, how about that?
Believe in Aad, O Sa'eed
He says, "From all the time we've heard this, he just says we're messed up."
I'm curious to get to know him.
This is normal, ya Salih.
I'm a tent maker
Forward, forward, forward
And your examples are few
Your words are nice
And your words on the radio were the best.
We heard only that we were ruined
Ambelah Yallah came back just himself so that he could get it now he says it he says "Samaa Samaa Samaa Samaa"
But we broke it
This is the authentic one, may your life be long. This is it.
Your request will continue until it stops
Hard as hell
Later I stood up
Meaning is that it will continue because of people's problems and their mistakes
Listen, Sa'eed
I'm gonna give you one problem only
O Sa'eed, you are the voice of truth.
Your people are my enemies, your people

Oh Minister, dear
The ministry, in its latest project, requested eight thousand ambulances.
Capacity: 30 ml and 20 cm cm

So they can benefit from the price difference
But we're in trouble
What did you miss, what did you miss, brother Salih, in our ruined state?
No God is Islamj
This call is a personal request.
God willing, you will call it well.

It means those who used to grow it brought it to him.
Listen to my words
Because he is afraid
He boasts about it and reveals its vices and flaws
You have seen the flaws and criticize
I fear you
Deceive me, sister, she's got it
You know what, fine.
Baga Biy, your uncle Abu Amineh
Condition worked
And how can they have the precedent that they criticize and point out flaws?
Why do they hate our country?
Do we have flaws?
What we have are intermediaries
I've never heard the word 'mediator' before.
In our government offices, I refer to the role
We don't have any bribery.
And I do not know her
And look at the employee
Do we have foreigners taking more than a local child? Never ever.
We've done everything with our hands
You're a child of your mother, of your father, of nothing we ever had, sir.
A responsible person will be angry with you because you are on duty
We are the best people
Best country
Free from defects
And thank you

I cannot

Susta's dough is processed in a specific way, because as soon as you place the susta, it melts.
Various flavors of flat white, flat white, flat white coffee
Tell me how much I'm investing in this project
Three million dollars with intellectual property rights
Come on, Sami
Ayo Habanaser
Under your orders
Water us, O long-lived river
What are you saying, Sami?
My son Nasser, yesterday morning, so they could play football with the kids that he was working with.
I agree with them
This team has this money that we had with us, but only regarding security and drivers.
And after we consider ourselves deficient since all we have is one guard, lest we get involved
And what is expected is that I will have a connection with fans
And you, on the day you took the employees who said your mother said "seven times I will be happy"
I'll give you something
The key people in the company
Who forms the company's heart?
The baker takes money from hospitals for his dough
And thus he completely lost his mind.
He has a flaw, because you are the son of a well-known family, you will not be able to hide it, and the world will see us.
He who wants to play with them takes the one who doesn't want to.
But he's taking the key people who shape the company's heart
Shasowei has a match with his team and I'm missing four players.
Who is the prophet excusing?
What's become is now become
Hamdi, I didn't go to work today, professor.
Ride with me
Qali al-Bas
And Jabuni and Wafoni stood in the statement
The match seemed
Tell me what you felt
They tell me that the gear is not working but I don't remember
It means you used to play as a goalkeeper before.
But for Nasser's sake
There is no power or strength except through God
Shallah bilaana abhahalkoreh wa abhahalkhurabict
From today, my Nasser
There's nothing called a "korah"
This team you put together yesterday
All the Khubbaz returned the bakeries
And my associates, indeed
The situation is getting worse
I won't hear anything from you
Your turn, brother Nasser
Bro, we hear the kid saying your request is enough
Just you, man, Ahmed
See what you said about Ash-Shu'undak
Baga with us last match in the stage we are playing
Don't break your memory, Boy Nasser, your request is enough.
Zain ya shabab
Congratulations, congratulations
Qod Qod Qod, happy ones
Oh Professor Nasser, I want you to do that
Allah bless you, our team today was ready on time.
Professor Nasser Elazm
You promised us you'd organize the party for us.
He contacted me and booked you a room at the hotel.
And only he made the journalists and the media aware of that.
No, Rashed, we have it at the mills
So that my parents won't be happy, angry, or disappointed, let the team keep going.
Yapu Cup Yapu Cup Yapu Cup Yapu Cup Yapu Cup

Lala showed her face with the lace and others with them for a press meeting
Wakho Jeneh Sami, editor of the Rijaz page, will attend the meeting with him.
What's the situation?
I don't want to be far from me
Alah, the icon image appears distorted
Hey, you're saying I'm not a student?
Fay ta3lqik 3ala fawz ibnāik al-khobāzīn, asdī al-7ālīn bi-hazā al-anqāz al-kubrā

And loyalty to the bakeries
Bo Nasser means, "We saw the bakery team throughout the round, eating in groups of four, four, two."
Loyalty to the Bakers and their trained team
Thank you, Uncle Abu Nasser

God willing, I testify that you will see it in the future.
Yes with the peace
Alhamdulillah your phone won't stop and your photo in the grade, congratulations on your football!
Do you know what was Eiklmeni?
Returned to us in the price of the machine, Qali Tamer Yabo Nasser Al-Korah
Now I'm famous, and the media won't show your pictures unless you write under the supervision of the first director at the international bakeries.
I'm away from the ball
What is this talk?
I am from the day when I was young in high school.
The guy who was playing football was playing football.
You say stay away from the ball
As long as the one who plays football is playing football, I'm close to the football.
It means I'm close to the Rijaz, meaning my Rijaz.
Well, that's it, we're no longer international bakeries, we're now international stadiums.
Yesterday I heard from my brother that he wants to start a sports club.
Of course, today we meet my brother, the head of the international bakeries, Mr. Nasser.
To develop football skills
Of course, before the match we told you your expectations, and before you reach the platform
The match is difficult today
The team in control of the text line will have a high ceiling today
If God wills, currently we are contacting professional player agents to strengthen the international bakery team.
His name is Saud, I mean Allah, Allah, the grandfather and grandfather, Allah, Allah upon him
Mean by that the situation where the players' load we received has been reduced
What did we gain?
When I gave you the prices
Your prices we sell them to the world
It means that the Gulf is not like the world.
Of course for you
Haida from your job
You're just the one who has to inform me about the Gulf buyer coming.
Keep faxak open
Among them, two defenders, one midfielder, and one goalkeeper.
Check, my friend, I'm telling you the players are the fourth last.
Three of them are the leaders.
Mietin al-Fātihī
Dollar took them all, just once.
How much do you want for your item? I'm giving them fifty thousand dollars and the rest in cash.
Nice sometimes regarding this matter, actually at times it's true about the Brazilian
This is the season's player. This one is leaving for one million and two hundred thousand dollars.
Hateen di al-sirr bas 3abih yaanis fax brawik aya wiyen haka hoofa l7a2a jowf yaanis fax allah aislamka min nadi al-umariyat
You are the one with cunning and deceit, your deceit.

Well, Allah willing, Jack will, Jack will, the man.
Ah Ashlon
Knee Knee
Knee complete knee
We haven't yet joined the cross bond, or anything like that.
O Bou Nasser
What is the main muscle here?
Maqsb su feehim mafteh yallah ma qasart
No doubt, we're happy with the players, meaning the Brazilian and the African, in the blessing, in the blessing.
Allah bless you
I say the warehouse, the warehouse, these balls, God, the warehouse
May God have mercy on you, you have another business?

Yeah, why did it come back?
Karem, a hero with one cartoon
This is the garden of Adam
Are you telling me what I didn't hear?
Are you saying this is a general rule?
Sometimes we stay
Why didn't you give us this kind of propaganda with them?
Xala, I say to my father, O Nasser, you are not taking care of him now, and if you nurture him and raise him, it will benefit you.
Then go to the national team, then come here to the stadium

If the coach owns this, he would understand
Fayezin, hana natin einin sifr amsi tareen 3al mabarah
He is a coach in Spain
A gale overwhelmed me
The successful coach
The one who organizes the flow during the match
For example, the North is this line, opposite to the Waker line.
Honestly, this is your coach, don't change his method.
The coach is complaining about having only been with the team for two months.
Need to see a solution to the agreement
If Koreh Jahn understands that the sides attack from the beginning of the match, they will launch an attack from the depth.
Any queue on Ali based on his ambush trap
Oh my god, the ones who converted you don't even look at my head
It is expected that Kaconomalalau Aboi will be withdrawn

According to the plan
And the whirlwind of whirlwinds
A meeting is not necessary between the manager and the team coach
And the match's star and the team's star scored a super hat-trick, God help you, Jackolumandu
How does it mean we don't understand the ball?
Listen, O Sultan
He's going home
Lala, we won't reach him, the bakery people will take a taxi

La mubasah, meaning he said, "Come up, you have divorced me. I said, 'Separate yourselves between you.'"
I said from the very first day I saw him, "Honestly, this Real Madrid didn't appeal to me."
I feel like a wind carrying responsibility
We have become the Zayed of Hajj and the Māzī of speech
The spirit of his father, I know from him, your daughter, why did you get divorced?
And by God, you're making me tired, brother Rashed.
But the reason is that he divorced her and returned.
Lala, it's not allowed, ya bo Abdullah, we have to know why the girl got divorced from our rights, we have to know.
From you, you don't interfere with my property
Ashlon, why are you getting involved? Real Madrid is already in the MLS, how is he supposed to know why they divorced?
I don't know how to treat my husband or respect his feelings
And who is Ziyad Barcelona?
What you feel, you don't know what the Spaniards say
Barcelona is the only one
This is Quardiola's team
It means right now I'm going to the real money that's sitting in the mills to check on me.
If you don't go, I'll go. What's the point of you going if you don't even know the people you're raising your daughters with?
Open the door, I won't shake your head
Hey, isn't it enough that it's Saturday, Barcelona team?
Messi, the football magician who never plays a match without scoring a hat-trick
Maradona, that guy Maradona said Messi will be better than me.
And let your daughter see what you're doing, you're making a mistake here, look at it.
Your daughter is not Barcelona nor from our tribe
We heard you say this.
Hear me, O Allah, guide me
So that you become my child
Go and apologize to her and her family.
You are
After that, thanks to Allah, everything is going well here.
If we did not have a happy child in Al-Fulusna, we would not have lived there.
Wai Biss returned
Condition that if I speak to you alone, you will be at Barcelona
I am not in the mood for arguments
What do you understand, Yemah? Just let them go, they're free now.
Hak Jay Hak ya Yameh
Actually, do you know, Yameh, about the losers?
You are the only one I wish for.
Hak yemeh
Forbidden broke my heart
Poor thing has been without food for two days.
After marriage, he stayed for only one month, O forbidden one.
Heal us, Tounsi, you have involved me in this agreement.
Why don't you go with them?
And you're the one who says about these crooks who don't have a brain
What is left from it?
Do you know, this one is coming out of a boy?
Similar to Zhi
Bless them with it
Are you telling me about the building that I used to buy and turn into a furnished hotel apartments complex?
Who is in the Al-Mansourah?
His father's right means when he had me, he took our daughter and asked for the house
And if I could measure
My brother's brother
Saw me as just
Yaij one abuh millionair
Find out what it means to be a millionaire
I've missed my chance twice.
You know they have a palace in Spain, but only because they use it every year.
Hey, Azin and Salfah Barcelona, this is Ashlon meaning
The family can post this statement to prove their daughter is innocent.
Even if we pretend that the previous one loves Barcelona and has loyalty to Catalonia
It is expected that his wife respects Hale Shi.
And I messed up the team
This is if we boast that the past is bad
Salimjah Allah abuh aismonah bo berrjin lana andha berrjin ala alkarnish
I will bind them with a strange rope, twisted like a cord around the neck.
People, do not separate them, do not consider them as one group.

Ah, I know of Yana.

Thank you darling
But brother, look at my eyes, Abdullah, my son, is waiting for your reply.
No, mother of Abdullah, I won't give in, my gaze is fixed.
I would say if I were to lead the Cooperation Council, I would do better than any of you.
Alah, they said, "We will submit our estimates for constructing the building."
I'm done now with your efforts, Tamer, something that lasts a long time
Any trouble with your family?
Show them their wedding request, I'll prepare the cake and I'm gonna do it.
In the name of God, whatever God wills, in the name of God, whatever God wills. After your efforts, O Fendem, after your own.
After Abdullah's reply to the divorce
May God grant us children and may He grant us wealth.
Allah, bless you, brother.
They dress him against the cold
Anyway, mom, where did I book for us?
Hey, I'm saying, where is my reservation for us?
Mom says she booked our Malaysian visa
And Malaysia is in it, God damn it.

Now I said you're back from your trip
Why does the spinal cord take it to him?
Come up, Shilah the gentle
They are fighting among themselves
Heal my wounds, oh gaze of my eyes
Stop it, and the one who's helping you teach me about your kids first
Heal me, Yameh, shalli amzaik?
I didn't see the shells get depressed
Whoever lived with you, oh Yemah
Leave it to me, just shoot it, shoot it, you don't have to worry about your father's flu, or the girls' flu.
Stay away, the one who healed you is my son, and I know him, down below there's something wrong, and I'm ashamed to live in such conditions.
Spirit, O Yameh, contact her and divorce her.
May God protect her.
Wah wah, say it three times
You're divorced instantly, you don't wait for the other two times after
Divorce divorce
And by God, I'm not going to do it.
But oh my dear, take your soul, take your soul, rest, and never let worry stay in your heart, for girls, who can take away such worries as I say, take your soul, my dear.
Oh problem
But so I can see it in the dance hall
Daki upon him Daki upon him, let me have a chance
Shadak upon him, why did you divorce me? Say, are you the one who divorced me?
He who dares to insult someone without shame, is a person with little manners.
Now only the dancer is at ease, meaning
And when needed, it shakes, and there's nothing in it
What's going on? What does it mean the world has turned upside down?
I found out that I didn't go to his house today and washed his clothes, then after that I don't know which girl you are from
I am I, O Abu Abdullah, my daughter, release her
My daughter is getting married
Bent on top of her hair brush
They sell them and buy them from Taweez Aap stores

And our main goal is just the poor.

This is normal in seventy days, it makes it easy.
And drink from the cup that Allah created
What the soul doesn't want
Do not show him to people.
Know the members of the committee; these were those who had it.
In a strategic location
Just leave it to God.
No way, that price is too low after
Currently standing
Need to get approval from Wafa al-Qasr
Yes, Yabouk, I went to his office and nothing happened.
And last week he came to me and said, "I'm traveling."
No, I don't see it, the action after the action, I am currently standing on the issue, must get approval from Waseem Al-Saqr, must.
He has the inclination of spirit
No no no no this is not an official job
His place in God's Islam is the office, not the house.
After eating
Bo Suqar returned this ashbi shabeh
Listen to each one and he has a key
Say rather, O Bo Fehd
You are who I met
Tell me, I have never been exposed to it except through television, and you never told me that you were familiar with it throughout your life.
But it means we don't have the knowledge between us
Allah cuts off your debts
Allah guide you, and you have not believed in the previous generations and the wise, I ask them for this determination.
And Allah has guided you through this occasion.
The month has thirty days, and it is fifty times combined with 'isha.
I suggest you live long enough to be included in the Guinness Book of World Records.
One of the richest men in the world is wealthy.
No, I'm saying this is the one with you, the one you're with.
Hey, your luck, an hour, God willing
It is our honor that you have lived so long.
Eil ya bo falah
You say that Boushqr eats dinner every day
This one I found
But hey, Bou Fakhour al-Asah, today is a special occasion.
Today God has blessed you and your child with a falcon.
May God grant you long life and blessings.
Tell the son of the lawful one on Tarayh: "Greetings to you, Yabah!"
Peace be upon you
Shanhuo returned
Go to the appropriate place, take the car and choose the one you want.
Year and a half, and I'm still waiting for approval
Current status
But one day I met him
and his brother
Allah guide you, brother Saad
I think the situation is getting worse
Set him free
Emir al-Ma'arish and he chooses the car he likes
We buy three for him
Audek has it
I am sending you Amoudini to him
You're telling me you've been together for the entire duration of your life?
Today his son is little Shahin
Ahoh played his evening games
This is your chance
May he rest in peace and be blessed.
O long-lived one, you deserve peace
Meh Shahin ya Bou Saqer
Allah, Islam you, you salute, O group
Alhamdulillah for his peace, we were born Shahin, long-lived.
Allah preserve you
But the brother
You lived a long life
What made you know me
And indeed, Allah will protect you.
I was with you during the long-lived general's lifetime.
Even to mention, I bought a red fan
By God, I Islam you
I was in the hospital
Azur is one of our relatives
And I am honored to meet you
Now, Qasr Lin is hesitating whether to enter the trading field or not.
Izat ma3a khayok
Why, brother, do you think trade is beautiful?
You start by setting up an office and a living room
Bu Saqer
Long life is not what I desire, and saying it is done.
Shanhuo returned
A hawk's gift from me
Full role
And if traders come to you and warn you, you say to them: "What is needed?"
Like you today, everything is available to him. You took the lesson for Allah, praise be to Him, and the world opened up for you: a beautiful car and the best office on the Karni.
Yesterday, Abu Abdul Aziz said to me: "If your brother says that he wants to join business with me as a partner, fifty thousand EGP."
Yemeh and Ashlun balanced trade and academia.
Yemeh don't bother me with anything, I don't care.
And may Allah protect you, may He keep away from you agencies, offices, and vehicles.
Opportunity, son, right now in this moment he starts his business without any capital
You are the owner of people's love for you.
Be smart and leverage it
Believe me, son, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Yalghal Jazee tomorrow the fastest
What shall I say, he or he or he or he or he reached after the lease and the pepper
What made him do it, what made him do it, after that he feared it would take him, like the samboseh
Ajev Woldj opened himself up to business
This one you've been waiting for, today I'm telling you
He says to me, "My father wants to expand more after the investment"
It's a Caribbean sea and it invests in those islands.
And the eyes of envious people will turn away from him.
Bo Sultan yesterday said to me, "Your father has the business"
He has 20 cars, 6 restaurants, and shares in two banks.
And he gave me the old elbow that he never intended to give as a witness or a name
Apparently, and Allah knows best, until now you have not opened it.
Ah, that's the one from our northern office guy.
No way, I'm not going to do it.
May Allah grant you blessings and peace, O Abbas, congratulations!
In the name of God
God bless you all
Helen, I'm sorry for the regret.
What, dad, a full year of misery and hardship at the supermarket?
What the obvious past is, is every day he comes to the mall
This secretary, whose name is Samir, showed me his face.
He's telling me that Sqr had a son, and that son would enter with you as a partner instead of taking your business?
After IDSH with you, partner
There is no power nor strength except with Allah
But after I see my post, I'll ask it to you.
He is Salni's brother?
Hit him with a zabzab ji
Why do you say you have an Iranian baker?
When we were young, this shop wasn't in a small place, and it had written on it what? What was the name written on it?
Written bakery of Frijeh
I don't have a different name than my father's name
And upon you peace
Ha ashlon shagal wyaakum
I hope your life is long, may Allah grant it. Either before or after, we finalize the workers' housing plan for the Future Company.

Thank you very much for everything
This cooking is based on science and research.
Today Iek one way and he says to me that I work in business with him and he invests in them.
But what we have between us has neither knowledge, expertise, nor study in economics, nor even in trade.
One such
He thinks that if he spends his time that way, he will lose.
I heard, O Bou Nasser
I heard Halablabal on Tuesday say something
Let the talk begin
This is yours, and I have a falcon, may Allah bless it.
Jawwah Maşallah 'alayhi
Jouf today
Long lived, we didn't talk about your son, al-saqr
We are talking about the rule
Your father is Saqr Ma'shalah, upon him be peace, and my eyes consider him a rare exception.
Tell me, what do you mean by "talk about the rule"?
We were a qasr, and his son, son of son, son of himself
Kahu gave him a car as a gift once.
Spend it and invest the money; his advice from it is himself.
May Allah protect him
Hey Bo, we're talking about ordinary people.
And one of them, the one who had done things with him, Abu Nasser, put his hand on the tray.
May Allah bless him with business talents
Economic trends are huge.
We have to ask, who is his father?
Forbidden, I am, and Allah, I'm amazed.
God willing

Does the company say they faxed the father's rights?
They said to him, "Enough"
What shelter can I bear?
Like you think
Are you saying right after hearing the news?
He has the office and fax in his hands
And he was indeed upon him
Indeed, as the one who said, "I taught him archery," when his strength increased, he began to shoot arrows.
Washqal Dr. Al-Hin
Pray for him, Salm.
I'm shocked
A magician in the world of Hik
A man giving a poor person his right hand without knowing his left hand

Sho in sho, now at the store you visited today, every wedding dress comes with a party dress, no after discount of 25%
Alah, let's go, let's go
No way, I'll give you two weeks, they'll return and you'll wear the same wedding suit. Make one wedding suit and get two with a 25% discount.
Now they are fighting us
I'm also thinking of it because if we leave them, they'll destroy our house.

O community, whoever has Islamized Allah, let him say to him: "You are necessary, necessary."
And by God, they will raise my veil and slaughter me, saying, "He has become a nuisance," O Professor Abdullah.

Welcome to our live broadcast and I'm glad to have you with us for a new episode of Beyond Borders.
Oil accounts for more than 35% of total diverse energy sources.
While the rest go to natural gas, coal, and electrical energy
Then oil is considered the primary source of energy in the world.
The Gulf Cooperation Council countries and Iran alone hold 78.6 billion barrels.
Then Iran, according to twelve parts per hundred, then Iraq according to ten parts per hundred, then Kuwait and the UAE according to nine parts per hundred.
For each of them, then comes Venezuela with seven hundred.
Then Russia with a five percent share
The Gulf countries and Iran account for two-thirds of the global reserves.
To unprecedented prices, exceeding hundred and nine dollars, for the first time in its history
In this episode, we try to understand many of the complexities of oil.
The problems facing the producing countries
Despite the huge increase in its prices
As well as the problems experienced by citizens and residents in these countries
Due to inflation and unprecedented rises
Which will appear successively on the screen or by writing to us through our website on the internet network WWW.aljazira.net
Today the market is the main factor.
and the producing countries
And the force that determines the price is the market power.
And it's not OPEC
Of course, the observation and demand have their part too.
but other factors
Other factors include political tensions
in the world
and real estate markets
and markets of the bull and others
And go to the F&F profit margins prices
In the Katemis, for example, oil
And tomorrow the dollar will reach one dollar, and Allah knows best.
Oil in the region jumped from forty-four dollars
And today we see that even oil prices
It fluctuates between one day and another
Oil prices dropped below ninety dollars
and increased in the second quarter
Specifically during the arrival of spring, two major global refineries enter the maintenance period.
Which always comes to mind regarding the second quarter of the year
Seasonal demand for oil is declining.
In winter, it drops below ninety.
All of this indicates that the speculators have power and control over the market now.
RT often means when we go back to the traditional market, the market place
The market is affected by supply and demand.
The seasonal demand
Today we see that there is economic growth.
Either today or yesterday, General Valon, commander of the central region in Afghanistan and Iraq, resigned.
His resignation triggered huge reactions due to its connection with what is known as the impending American war.
Political or geostrategic impacts
It affects the oil market in a very fast way, either negatively or positively.
The effect will surely come and will have its consequences.
And even the traders are also involved in political speculation.
Who might say that the American war against Iran is coming?
Here, what will the market expect the market to be expecting?
Question: What is the situation of the Honorable Minister currently, given the White House's situation?
And this brought the region back into a state of tension.
This is the Qoutz
But perhaps Valon sees this scenario?
Rapid reflections are reflected very quickly on the oil market.
Today we prove with figures that there is no shortage at all.
Let me give you an example within the seven weeks of the sacred months.
The United States has increased its oil inventory to above the average of the past five years.
It means today I'm saying
And not even for the coming war, because today I tell you, even the world has stockpiles that have already been depleted.
Even today's global consumption shows me that in any country around the world, there are long queues ahead of oil stations.
This is another thing
What are the risks this poses?
What number do you expect? I don't know. It might be.
Miten could be three dollars, maybe less but
It might escalate if these tensions reach a point where they become real tensions.
As I said, you represent the Gulf, accounting for 70 percent.
In its country, it means it is far even from oil-producing countries
The impact will have a reverse effect on the oil market.
It can reach three hundred dollars.
And they established and moved from shares and other assets to the oil market today, prices are above one trillion or two trillion dollars.
Today we're seeing the Brent
It is mixed with water in a barrel today, what does that mean?
These ongoing tensions in the region are being watched.
April, as previously said, would be the month to launch this war.
And Allah knows best, I did not mean my generation.
The region because the land of the land
The year is an election year
The current American administration is currently in power for only a few months.
George H. W. Bush launched the war in Somalia and sent 30,000 troops in his final days at the White House.
We see, but we do not anticipate events.
But I don't expect this scenario to happen.
Because this scenario is very costly
You will not incur any cost, you who will pay, along with the Iranians and the consuming countries, and
America today
Now, it relies on African oil and has many alternatives.
Show me what's stopping us from talking plainly
You said in your introduction, seventy percent.
Oil industry precautions
But now they import twenty-two
From their west, from the west of Africa
From West Africa, and wherever they imported from around the world
Oil production
Because this is a difficult number and has strict precautions and safeguards
What is known as deep water or abyssal or deep-sea ocean production
The sea, and therefore the Gulf, will continue to face a difficult situation.
and Qazvin Sea oil
And I consider them as dreams because they are not reality and true.
They will fight in it and destroy it
The important thing is that there is
Today, Qatar is the world's largest energy supplier.
For that reason, this are these countries number difficult
Here and the needs of countries for energy
It definitely means that there is something called security through security supply.
Despite internal opposition within the United States, even at the level of General Valon
but concerns still remain
From the moment the Bush president takes office
You have noticed that political risks did not come from Gulf countries.
It means that we are not like that, we don't show kindness, because we don't have anyone who treats people with kindness.
There's no much in kindness in dealings.
But it's not in my article
We are not part of the charitable work
or the honor of it
But being generous with Westerners is not something I do with anyone else.
with the United States specifically
And the market
And the economic cost to us will be borne by us.
We will not
Like oil and gas
She places them for generosity and
I have the evidence

Does not exceed sixty to seventy dollars
Not the rise in prices
and the dollar's decline which you insist on
You, above all, as Gulf Arabs and Obeidians.
Export in dollars and they refuse
Changing the currency, despite the fact that the currency had collapsed.
Although the return is not in your favor
I am not the first seventy
But experts' words aren't my words, I'm not saying that.
Okay, the dollar dropped 35%, and oil rose above this decline.
That is, if we take the base year as 2004
I think they were saying oil prices would range between 50 to 60 dollars
It means obviously, it means
Oil prices rose
But the increase is slight, he tried the deputy.
It means if we take them
Fahi ahna nata7a laha means now
Until these prices
That is, if we compare it to 2 and 4.
Hey, you've gone beyond the 5% drop in the dollar?
The exciting one
It reacts to the dollar's depreciation
Whenever the dollar drops, oil prices rise.
This also is something the market is beginning to give a sense of
For now, it's just like that, it's just like that.
No, the situation has changed. Perhaps at the beginning of the decline two years ago, people would have said this, but the situation has now changed and there is now...
And the dollar appeared to be losing its value against major currencies such as the euro, yen, and sterling.
The question here is why you insist on linking your work to the dollar?
It weakens, and it has no cover
This is it, this is it, a historical period
Oil and its derivatives in dollars, as well as European production in the North Sea, Russia, and Norway
It states that the United States was in the mid-1970s.
Canceled the golden cover that was for the American project
This is not this is not correct
Is it correct to do primary care?
The OPEC organization comprises
Four Gulf countries
Qatar, Kuwait, UAE, and Saudi Arabia
Today the OPEC lesson on the global market
Forty percent
Today, if we take that the world consumes eighty-five million barrels
And why does it price its oil in dollars?
If you knew of his other work, everyone would know.
You can't you k
Each oil-exporting country must agree
Among the elders
Those who have 78 million of the global reserve are all the big players.

From whom she has been taken: Venezuela, Libya, and Iran
And Cameroon, Angola, and Qatar are organized under the OPEC umbrella.
Today's share does not exceed forty percent of the market.
Are produced and exported by countries outside OPEC
And this cannot be done to the owner of forty million.
You cannot do it by yourself unless
in countries that tried but
A attempt is not a real one
You are rejecting it because of the ties with America.
From Dora to his other work
All oil-producing countries
How much is the import price of one barrel?
He will lose what he has when he starts to produce
And his currency appreciated a lot.
And he sells his share in dollars
Now, for the person who has it, the Rissif takes it, takes his money in dollars, and then converts it or transfers it to local currency.
His currency is not related to the dollar.
True, but he is God
But you're having the same problem; you're selling in dollars and your currency is not linked to the dollar, so you don't have a problem.
And my main question now is
What is the concern and impact caused by your operations being tied to the dollar amidst a dollar decline?
Has been linked for many years
Especially in the 1970s when the dollar was a very strong currency, meaning it had a very powerful value.
This split isn't easy.
Paint is easy
Here is the
Divorce has costs.
In it, there are interests that affect the countries, not against them.
From profit and loss
Dujan announced yesterday in his publication that there are four countries, there is Qatar.
But there is also a report from the Gulf Investment House stating that there are four Gulf countries, as Oman has left the Gulf Cooperation Council.
I read the statement from Dunjons, and I don't think it's a genuine statement.
He is the director of the Qatar Central Bank, denied.
Yes, he said, and that you will carry out a study, but still, all Gulf countries must...
You have to study profit and loss in a way as I said, in a systematic way, without emotions.
Let us leave it for study and research until it arrives.
After jib, for jib, economists say to you in another study
This study reflects
Lobal House is a simple thing, always organized, and they released it in their March report.
Apple four days only
Global House The solution is simple and calls for a political decision
The political decision boils down to two points.
There is no third party to their first need.
Regarding her intention or the fifth, with Kuwait, regarding her intention in the year two thousand and ten, regarding the issuance of currency or the study of the issuance of the Gulf Union currency
The second point is to issue a decision to decouple from the dollar.
Firstly, regarding the single currency
I am in my personal view
Let us see the Gulf common currency
The currency. The currency when this currency will be strong.
will be will be
Perhaps one of the strongest currencies in the world as they say
And what lies behind it in precautions, and what lies before it in revenues enriches it.
Therefore, this is what His Excellency the Prime Minister had in mind when he said
Yeah, Gulf countries, because no country can stand alone
But a stronger economic foundation
And today's economic bloc even the euro today you see it
But you must not forget that the central bank has a very important role.
and the assessment
and and and profit and loss calculation
From all of these news items
and made tense
The hundred and forty-eight, as the observers say, Global House stated that inflation will continue.
A long time in the Gulf countries, but the solution is in the hands of the governments
Some countries raised salaries to 70 percent, such as the UAE
In order to halt the inflation process that
And my question now is, when will you increase the salaries of the majority of people in Qatar?
And after a short break, listen to your response.
On the topic of today's session, oil reserves and daily production of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, the Arab Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
She has a reserve of forty-six billion.
Two out of ten barrels
And it takes nine out of ten every day
One million Kuwaiti dinars, one and a half, and takes one billion and takes seven and two from ten million
Qatar: 10 billion and 210 million, and Oman: 7 billion and 770 million
Bahrain's population is twenty-five million and it has thirty-five thousand inhabitants.
And the total revenue was eighty billion and thirty billion for the year.
From two hundred and three to two hundred and seven
In Europe, hundreds of billions
70 billion in the Middle East and 40 billion
in Asia and other countries
But the gross domestic product of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries was 167.6 billion.
Total output at one hundred seven million seventy-nine thousand seven hundred and seventy in tenths of billion expected
In 2009, seven hundred and ten million and one tenth of a billion
But inflation is devouring the salaries of employees and workers living in this area.
It will increase from twenty to thirty.
Kuwait, 14th of April in the year 2009, 9th of August in the year 2009, from the ten Emirates
It will become ten; previously Saudi Arabia was seven and a half, it will reach seven.
and the seventh from ten
The salaries are being swallowed.
What amounts and percentages will you increase the employee's salary with here?
If we want to solve the problem
With real treatment
Salaries are always increased. Salary increases are always happening.
It is not the solution
I am not advocating for increasing salaries.
Correct me, this is not correct
We are always
In fact, faith
Qasih Ziyadah al-Ziyadah and lack of control will cause the expansion to eat up all these increases.
To address the issue of inflation, a high-level committee composed of all experts and specialists has been established.
Now this committee is here
Because of the increase in salaries around the world
And the Golden Economic Rule says, of course
It will not have an end
and no matter how
Salaries increased and no matter how much they rose
Inflation will rise.
It must be processed and it must
It means that in this academic study, the specialized employment institute bitdotcom conducted a study in collaboration with the University of Liverpool.
They conducted a survey among 15,000 employees working in the Gulf countries across twenty key sectors.
Above all, experts and job seekers find no satisfaction in jobs.
Inflation has become devouring
Lath siema dhu al-akthar al-3arabia
They are thinking about moving to countries where inflation is not so high
Now you will lose
This is the simple idea, meaning this is the simple idea you're thinking of and you're trying to apply it.
The inflation link is the increase in wages.
The parallelism in the statement exists
Exists and
We are careful, and the state and government are equally careful.
This shapes are being processed with real treatment
Temporary solutions never solve the problem; they only make it worse.
It means to increase them
We ask that this committee remain in place for further consideration.
All the applications
Here he stumbled and you were trying to help the deputy
The sorrow will always be
The state has also tried and increased the forty million increases.
There is no particularly important point here regarding the increases.
You people, on the issue of increases, only raise the prices for Qataris, while non-Qataris were working for Burundi and Zambia.
You treat Qataris with care, but you do not treat newcomers with care.
and it is the high status among them
Ahmad, you are living in Qatar, not in Germany.
Speak about this issue and suffer
Higher salaries in the public sector by a large margin
On the contrary, we saw
the governmental cover
On the contrary, the government sector has become
Pan afzal al-ana2i al-kafayat asta2a3a
Also, I read a report and we know in QF oil sector
For women workers
We are when we are like the experts we have
Engineers and staff coming from outside Qatar
and since we are still interacting with the global market
For every shake in things, there is a proportionate increase in salaries.
And hope is with Allah, but I say
There is a plan by the government
I say that controlling inflation is most important.
The temporal aspect
And we will see me and me certain
There will be a situation where
Positive results
It will be around 50 to 100 million.
The sweet one says you have twenty-five billion barrels of oil and forty-three billion cubic meters of gas
No comment, we are the client, not his client.
My process and of course we
It means that economic growth also inevitably affects people.
And naturally, any economic growth today, Qatar has the highest economic growth in the world.
And vice versa
The high mountains in the country are also a part
And if it were not for this massive cable and these massive projects
The country also did not have a share in the inflation.
Also contributed to part of the inflation
And this also led to increased flooding in the market.
First, regarding the dollar's relationship with oil
Oil linked to protection from
In the United States, therefore, this form of governance means stability.
Thank you

Peace be upon you, and may Allah bless you and grant you mercy.
Truth in cycle means successful and a good title
What I would like to address is that the region is currently under America's current policy.
America's policy in its current war, through the cultural campaigns it is conducting to promote Islam, is part of a worldwide economic war.

Mohamed Al-Wasif from Egypt
Hello, is the deputy with you?
The Deputy's argument reminds me of Arab rulers from the Middle East region.
When there is
When there are disputes or requests to modify prices
Salary adjustments based on price ratios, as per your preferences
Biyahid means in Qatar we consider you as you are, you are just a musical group.
And this style is designed not to reveal the increase, this is an Arabic approach.
We want Qatar to be considered as Abu Adreik.
He's from that group, from that group, he says what he wants. Do you have a question? Do you have a question? He has the right to it, of course, he's responsible for that politics.
Question First
The deputy will take into account the situation in the eyes of the consideration
One out of two, to interact with the public opinion
With the majority as you have preferred, the people who want to be cared for.
The Arab rulers who don't have supremacy
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
Hab imsi 'alaykum ithnayn wa imsi 'al al-‘aqil
Want an increase in salary as well
Salaries are great and nice, pretty good.
Well, God bless you, it's about the job, regarding us who need to understand its meaning.
With the majority, and always if God wills, there won't be a majority in Qatar, and we are certain.
And the ruling states that Qatar is like what was said, that wealth is entrusted to the ruling family and the ruler.
That is the important question now
Ahoh let's reply to the brothers
He cannot rule.
What happens to the wealth?
Now there are entirely new cities that are almost like extensions of Dubai, and other places too—even Qatar has started expanding.
He is not the one, it is the one.
A compatible life plan
In short, since only two minutes remain, who will get the ball?
Qatar is now in a phase of Qatar beyond oil and gas
There is obviously a clear policy for the state.

And the mutation in the seventies, everyone today remembers the mutation of the seventies
Today today we see in Qatar a growth
And this also calls upon us to examine a specific aspect of Qatar's post-oil future.
Our vision of oil and its future and wealth in the region, especially in Qatar, concludes with my best wishes to the program team.
And this Ahmed Mansour greets you without bounds. Peace be upon you and blessings and mercy from Allah.
Peace be upon you, and may Allah bless you and grant you mercy.
Greetings to you live this week from Doha, the capital of Qatar
I welcome you to a new episode of the Boundless program.
At a time when Qatar hosts the largest U.S. military base outside the United States, namely the Al Udeid Air Base.
With the enemies of the United States in the region
Like Iran and Syria
Its doors are open to leaders
Moreover, Hamas leaders enjoy special relations with the Qatari leadership.
Qatar's Amir was the only Arab leader
The one who visited the southern district of Beirut, destroyed by Israel during its war on Lebanon in the summer of 2006
And there is still unlimited support for rebuilding what Israel destroyed in Lebanon.
When Qatar reconciled, and when Qatar reconciled
With her elder sister, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, about two years ago
At the same time, tensions with the regime in Egypt
Like Lebanon's case, where success was achieved where others failed.
From where the Lebanese expatriates gathered in Doha, where they signed an agreement that secured their safety.
To the latest elections
As well as stick files
Which cared that it be the driver of these files, not Qatari
Smallest Arab country
And in today's session
We are trying to understand the principles and foundations upon which Qatar's foreign policy is based.
And for the benefit of whom
The small country, geographically and demographically, undertakes great roles.
And what are the qualifications that enable her?
This took place during a direct interview with the Prime Minister and the Qatari Minister of Foreign Affairs

The visit made by Qatar's Amir
Hadeer al-Madfah al-Qanah al-Jazirah wishes to improve relations with Saudi Arabia.

Many of the matters that

The truth is, in more than one conversation here in this program, I've always said
And if we consider it as the backbone
The Gulf Cooperation Council
There was a misunderstanding.
Then, as
Divergent views
We established the borders correctly, and this was the most important consequence thereof.
The historical relations between Saudi Arabia and Qatar are distinguished relations.
If you pay attention to these relationships, you'll notice

And now the relationships in the position, I can confirm that they are excellent.
For the benefit of the Cooperation Council
But how was the relationship with Saudi Arabia settled regarding the Al-Jazirah canal? Was it not this obstacle or the cause that led to the year 2001?
At a key point
And I'll tell you again, if you go back to all the programs, I've always said that
Not only the elder sister, but I was saying that we have relied on in the Cooperation Council on

Until Al-Jazira's coverage of Hajj changes
Praise for the system and what King of the Two Holy Mosques is doing at a time that contradicts it
First of all, why don't you ask the Jazeera administration about this issue instead of asking me?
The union of the two countries
Regional stability
This strategy has continued and strengthened first regional stability
The region you mean is the Gulf region
Gulf Region
There are many issues arising in the Gulf region.
Also, the call of His Majesty the King to Kuwait
He had an impact on all the participants and on the entire Arab world.
He spoke from the depths of his heart about settling Arab disputes, transcending them, and burying them.
It means not only in views
Laws are policies and policies are views
The world considers that this
A kind of war
While the advanced world
It talks about the same interest.
Now you've stayed for several years.
The situation now The situation now
Show me first
A complete difference between this document and that document
The idea that a small state attacks the powerful and makes them feel weak in its presence
Every dispute or every misunderstanding
He had his reasons.
and the causes of it ended
It ended by their decision
Are there guarantees for the future relationship?
There are timeframes between the two parties
Based on love, brotherhood, and mutual benefit that unite the two countries
And the leaders' statements are considered more reliable than documents.
Between Qatar and Saudi Arabia for developing this relationship
And we observe this Qatari-Saudi relationship developing greatly.
For the best, and there would be many areas.
This relationship is similar to what we have with other Arab countries, other Gulf countries.
Regarding Qatar, the country is important.
Saudi Arabia is an important country
Egypt, regarding Qatar, what kind of country is it, especially since you have reached an agreement with Saudi Arabia at the same time?
And three organizations are Hezbollah
He is from Al-Jazeerah channel
He is on the system in Egypt, one of the major Arab countries.
First, let me start with the following beginning
The Egyptian people
We respect the Egyptian people.
and her concern
Numerous Arabic statements and demonstrations by the Egyptian people
And this is a qaziyah
It is believed by some that this situation is a gateway either to an agreement or to a disagreement with the brothers in Egypt.
But this is what you are doing: you are showing disrespect to Egypt and the Egyptian people.
And we think that Ahoh is a good person.
Our disagreement with Egypt revolves around two points.
or point
We told him that we had prepared for the coup in Gaza, and I didn't think so.
And we do not enter
In regard to issues pertaining to other countries
You do not support intervention in any country's affairs unless there is room for reform.
It means that any intervention you have made so far in the coup carried out by Hamas against the authority in Gaza.
Of course, we didn't know about this either—just like what we know about the rest of the media outlets.
Yes, we have relations with Hamas and we have relations with all the parties.
What caused Egypt to differ, or created a dispute between you and her on this point?
This is for me
Le conspiracy of Hezbollah
Le conspiracy of Hezbollah and Ayatollah
But I'm talking about my country
This document astonished us greatly.
If it trembles for Qatar's benefit
The Pyramids of Giza
She said, "Ou7al"
To undermine Egypt and its status
Can I reply?
We are returning to the plot they spoke about it
The days will reveal this document
Started not from a Gaza conference
And I absolve the Egyptian people from it, I absolve President Hosni Mubarak from it.
If we go back a long way to the Minya conference
After the Madrid conference, the Mina remembers the one held in Doha
This was an agreement reached by the conference when it was held here.
They said, "We don't want to hold the conference unless we are required to."
Hey folks, we know you have an arrangement with Israel.
From Qatar and this thing
What do we want to understand?
We sat down, we left, we talked, and the conversation was always good.
She has two apartments.
What are they
in dispute
The political orientation
If we come to the Gaza conference that's now happened
His Highness the Amir spoke with all the presidents, and among them with his brother, the esteemed President Hosni Mubarak.
We have received information from a foreign country.
The Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt has its own perspective on this issue, stating that what is complicating...
And they kill people, while we watch.
If you don't want to meet, we'll hold it in Doha at any place in the Arab University.
And it is wrong that during the Kuwait conference I discuss a matter.
Before Israel and the Western world stands witnessing the crisis
When we arrived, we said, "Okay, now this conflict will continue. There's no power, no strength. We Arabs cannot stop it. No major country has stood against this war."
Egypt announces a call for a ceasefire in Gaza, followed by a cessation of hostilities.
Even we
We must not take the Arab street for granted; our disagreement with the Muslim Brotherhood concerns only one point.
and this is the international conventions
And my hospitals are not sufficient even with doctors standing at the borders.
You and they stood at the borders
There is, and what was the limit to enter
The Brotherhood felt this outrage deeply.
The cause of the sensitivity is that Gaza is adjacent to Egypt and is considered part of state-owned assets.
Whenever we talk about any human tragedy anywhere in the world, we are talking about a human tragedy.
And we respect the sovereignty of Egypt
And I know the position, but this does not seem to reflect the Egyptian position.
We have experienced a lot in Egypt.
It is the largest Arab country.
And we believe we can carry our voice and others' voices throughout the Arab world.
For all the other parties
It means even the rescue operation is a failure.
The Europeans tried to save them
What happened in Gaza from a conference
Whether the donors' conference or I consider it a salvation for the government
We didn't send them to the conference, we sent them for coordination among the GCC countries.
And we convened at the Cooperation Council meeting
These amounts will not be paid to any party.
But it will be spent
For the concerned parties in Gaza
Directly, and this was
So no entry from any side
I am happy for Qatar, and every Qatari citizen is happy for Egypt because Egypt
Supporting Egypt in political matters is important to us.
But you are ahead of them
Give me just give me just two minutes
One minister sensed the fraud and said
And whoever boasts about Egypt will have his pride cut off and his shield broken.
And by God, I believe this official harmed his country.
They did not fail, and they could not speak about anything else but themselves when they came to the truth.
The one who helped them in this, and this is what I said truthfully about our brothers, the Saudis, the Saudis intervened because the king has authority over this matter.
Knowledge of affairs in the Arab world
We are in agreement
The king decides that this is the best interest.
We are willing to accept King Abdullah's decision because we respect him and trust in him.
But if I say one of them prevented them, he would have insulted the one who prevented them.
They were students at a school.
It means I think this
Al-Hadha wa7ala3a'ih
It is believed that Ahoh must be strong in his strength.
We are sorry, we are sorry for this document
If they believe that a small country has a right derived from it
You are inside, with your noses in Darfur
Decision by the Arab University
African and United Nations decision
I think the main problem is
Hezbollah's plot targets Qatar
A plot I don't know what Qatar is involved in
It means that if the virus spreads, after the swine flu, if it appears in a place, its cause would be Qatar, making it possible to spread the outbreak.
Qatar is a peaceful country, it knows its size and its capabilities.
But Qatar has its own perspective.
Qatar has its own policy.
If Qatar manages to resolve any Arab issue, we will consider that a honor for us.
Because there is no Arabic contradiction
Any Arab dispute we believe would weaken our stance on our main issues, namely Palestine and the other issues we have identified.
The Arab world has become a passive recipient.
Even our analyses have become the same as yours.
Western analyses
While Shana, we know him, we don't know what happened in Pakistan.
I mean, by God, I want someone to receive me and lay red rugs for me in Washington.
Has Qatar experienced a crisis?
Has Qatar committed any wrongdoing against any Arab country?
I tried to contribute financially
The impact of contributions is provocative.
What is it, maybe I'm wrong, I say "Peace be upon you" and you say "you too" just to annoy me
This is the second time you have a problem or deficiency.
This is a personal issue, not something that concerns me.
But if you have an internal problem
Always I say it
and especially after His Majesty King Abdullah's speech
For Kuwait, and I know this man, he is sincere.
A man's words are what he hides
In his heart, Lala, this Lala, this talk, I always say it.
I always say this.
Always I say this during the height of our disputes with Saudi Arabia, I used to say this.
And go back to the document you have in the journal but
The Qa7iha differs for alalalala
On one hand, we said there's no way we're staying at this position.
And we tried our best possible.
What I want is to enter into this form
See what's happening with them, see their mistakes and then what?
Let's fix our mistakes, we're not meaning all the stuff we have, it's correct.
This is His Excellency Sheikh
To the existence of internal problems in Egypt
They want to get rid of them
Qatar's relationship with Egypt takes on the form of external dominance over Egypt, and cuts off its relations with Turkey or other countries.
And as for Allah, He has a supernatural power among us.
And may Allah grant us seventy million, if we are capable of reaching eighty.
They also have a problem that needs to be treated.
You played a role in the Qandil Shleit case, despite knowing that this file is a significant one held by the Egyptian government.
And I tried with the Frenchmen
We have received contact from a friendly country
In Qasih we saw, we said: "O brothers, this is what the Egyptians say," they said.
We want to see this document by request
Before Israel and other countries, Prophet Enshu was on the other side, watching this situation.
When we saw this document, we told them: "Brother, if the same conditions that the brothers are discussing with the brothers in Egypt."
And by stating this, it means that one responsible person says: "We are causing you trouble across the entire Arab university."
And by God, this means, this means a可怜 person
It means how did they let it reach us?
President Mahmoud Abbas remains
And we supported this
Is he addressing his people? Is he addressing us? Is he addressing the Arab world?
The problem is yours, you people
I think I think this is a healthy appearance
I am not the owner of the island as you accused me of
And the island needs its media competitor to get involved, just as in the West, there are many media outlets.
There are many media outlets that, at times, openly insult the elders.
But after a while they reached the stage of normalization
It can, it can, it can be
First of all, our relationship with Saudi Arabia has changed.
Even if we concede to Saudi Arabia, we accept this in Qatar, an
Important relationships
And Egypt is an important country, but regarding the Saudi-Egyptian relations
Also, Egypt's special status with any Arab country, Egypt is the largest major country.
This is true, this is true, but with Saudi Arabia, in terms of history and relationship, it differs.
It is a personal disagreement between the officials here and there.
We respect President el-Sisi's dignity.
I request that it be confined to a dispute over policies from different perspectives
I have a problem when an attack occurs on Gaza
The second issue is that they have a sensitivity regarding us; right now, we haven't discovered anything that Qatar or others are doing.
Malamaz does not intend to organize a meeting with the Egyptian president between the princes.
Saudi Arabia intervened in this incident
And as the Gharaid said, they first said there was a secret meeting, then the next day we found out today's day.
There was a meeting between me and Omar Salimán.
for Saudi Arabia
A non-reversible herd
I can't say to you that we agreed on everything.
Let's say this once so that after that you all start comparing yourselves
But honor is honor, whether great or small.
The minister says that if Egypt gets the appropriate settlement, the settlement
The bullying among children
I thought this was Egypt, bigger Egypt, bigger than this. I think it's the expression house.
Do you have a vision for resolving issues with Egypt, or are you just feeding the Egyptian people's expectations of divine intervention?
This this please, I would like to speak about divine intervention and others, because God knows who lives and who dies.
And I call upon you
He led them to believe that it would be in a certain style.
And we are proud of Egypt
There must be a specific way.
Oh, stop with me, oh, stop my back
What does the West demand from every Arab citizen?
The Arab world laments this and this is the Amir's policy
States derive their power from sources of power.
The United States has power sources, China has power sources, France has power sources, and a small country, Qatar, has power sources.
Manah bil-llah
The thing is clear that there is nothing in it.
All of this is a mess, you two workers.
But we are a small country on my eyes and on my head
And repeat it once more
So no one says we have sensitivity
None of us will seize it.
You have now, with regard to Israel, agitated them.
Medicine before I went to Israel
What do you see regarding solving the problem with Egypt?
The problem is also, they weren't the first.
And every day they file complaints against America if I tell you about the major countries you're talking about
And they deal with us out of self-interest, while we deal with them out of self-interest.
All complaints and every
In order to undermine the relationship
I believe it weakens any major country that does so.
And also diminishes our Arab pride when we go around complaining and moaning about our poverty.
Everything comes and everything we know
Our vision is to be based on the Arab interest.
And we are with them in anything
Are there any steps coming to repair the relations?
But I know there is a close relationship between the President and Your Highness the Amir.
If anyone moved any matters
The proximity of the two countries and their leaders will find itself at a loss, as the latter
It's possible, but we can't, after ten years, I swear to God, we don't know, we're from the side, always, any person who wants to invite us to a conference, we'll ban them.
Any party that calls us to a ban conference, if it has a position, it can state it at the conference.
What we can do here
Egypt is never going to be our big sister in any matter, but we have our own perspective and we discuss.
This is all required, whenever the time comes, we of course are happy with this procedure.
It was canceled due to political turmoil.
And we, as I mentioned, respect the Egyptian people.
Of course, canceling a contract and adding another contract—when you ask how many contracts are canceled, I ask how many Egyptians went to Qatar at the same time.
But our country's policy is like what you told us, the Egyptian people are close to us in Qatar from our heart.
Last June, we stirred the emotions of Arab peoples by closing the Israeli office on June 4, which was reported by Arts.
Why do you say we beat him when if we were prophets, we wouldn't have beaten them 14 years ago and closed it?
When Shani was still there, everyone was against him before they reconciled with Israel, and before secret meetings began between the Arab countries and Israel became easier.
And after that, after that, after that, after all, most Arabs settled down.
Either under the table or above the table, with Israel or talking to them in any form.
If we want to stir emotions, let us stir them at the previous Islamic conference.
The United States of America, Nasser Abdel Nasser, established a base at the Israeli Embassy in Belgrade.
Yes, he was a weak one among many weak ones who kept holding onto his wealth, none of which was suitable, and the ambassador carried it out.
Because we in the United Nations sit together with Israel, meaning there's no one who denies this document.
We found a ray of hope in lifting the burden from our brothers in Palestine.
Now the management has changed. The issue of Egypt was just a small part of my work, but unfortunately...
I didn't grow up, you're the one who grew up
My question is about the United States, the new administration, and the impact of this on your relations as Qatari citizens with the United States, given the presence of the largest military base in Qatar.
A disagreement over opinions
Road in solving many problems in the area
And if they are truly serious, we will help them beyond boundaries.
Expect a good relationship or a solution to the problems that have existed between you and the Bush administration
Many of these issues have been resolved
Qatari Emir spoke yesterday in Paris about what is happening in Iran.
And Iran has special relations with you, despite the fact that its relationship with the United States is poor.
First of all, we must lower ourselves within the framework of internal affairs, because we must respect each country and its internal affairs.
Lebanon after the elections
Before the elections, Saad Hariri, in a statement on the program, said that the Doha agreement ends with the holding of elections.
Did you also feel that? Or do you think the agreement is already in place, or are you proposing a new agreement?
The Doha agreement was a stage that brought them to hold peaceful elections.
One year and a bit more than a year has passed since the Doha elections.
We were closely monitoring them day by day, moment by moment, until they reached the elections as per the Doha agreement.
We entered in the final stage of one of the electoral circles to correct some misunderstandings that occurred.
But you still have a connection to the matter of organizing things in Lebanon.
We are always close to Lebanon, you know the Qataris, they love Lebanon and they go to Lebanon all the time.
It means I was the first country you could visit after Western Lebanon.
Question: Quick answer regarding what is happening in Yemen
You have entered a matter concerning the Houthi movement, and there are allegations that you have supported the Houthis.
Or he will expose you at least their situation in the north, with the state currently facing a greater danger, namely the danger from the south.
And we suffered what we suffered. Why didn't you stop here? Why didn't you stop here in Qatar?
Indeed, we faced considerable pressures during this situation, but this was our vision and His Highness the Amir's stance on this matter.
Houthi incident
And its stability has a positive impact on us, while its instability has a negative impact.
We intervened through a neutral party between the two sides
And we have reached an agreement
But I understand that this might be intended to be used for other purposes.
And I will be with them there, and we always stood with them in every matter.
and and and and malah asas min al-sahah
I think we don't need anything.
Sell it
And I say this, and I'm not sorry, I know that in the Arab audience there are many who will be against me.
Also, I would like to thank our dear viewers for your continued support. We hope we have clarified for you some aspects of Qatar's foreign policy.
Lastly, I'd like to send you a greeting from the program team. This is Ahmed Mansour, wishing you all a boundless welcome.
Peace be upon you, and may Allah bless you and grant you mercy.
Respected viewers, peace be upon you, welcome to this special meeting.
Bench Jamil bin Jabr al-Thani, Prime Minister of the Council of Ministers, Minister of Foreign Affairs of State Qatar
Of course, why do I say a special and exceptional meeting because
Qatar, and this man in particular was the main backer.
Sir, a simple and direct question
I think it happened because there was no Arab consensus at the beginning.
And we tried that when we went to the United States
The Arab consensus was important, and the Lebanese opposition from both sides was also significant.
Reaching results
Very important that external interference
Many opinions or suggestions from abroad
Arabic Lebanese international if you like you say
but it went through stages
There's nothing at all to indicate that these stages ever existed.
Does it mean the complexities in Linan?
Since the real period
It means that when you gathered and directly entered the Lebanese line and the Lebanese file
Have you discovered that the Lebanese contract is a major contract?
A Lebanese, Arabic, regional, international entity needs significant de-encryption.
Is it a very simple, small contract, but expanded due to external intervention?
Because we know Lebanon is a beacon for journalism, a beacon for culture, a beacon for tourism, a beacon for many things.
Le Lebanese must not allow themselves to
It affects Lebanon's security and stability.
Problem number one
The External Repercussions on Lebanon
You decided at 24 hours later to take everyone on one plane
From the aircraft, direct meeting with Qatar's Amir
It wasn't even expected, meaning they couldn't relax for a single moment except what you allow them to.
The secret, the secret, the secret is that once they are at ease and think more.
And they maintain many contacts. The secret is
Let us consider the idea of transferring them to Doha, as we need a certain atmosphere.
Or he gathered them in many difficulties of various kinds.
Under many conditions
We have brought them out for these circumstances, because you are coming for a solution.
If we want to succeed, we must take them out of this atmosphere.
and quickly
Allah, Allah, guide us to the clarification of the Venetian or the Beirut explanation.
Then we agreed that their main point was to go to Doha.
Both sides decided to go to Doha
It means that Baez believes, for example, that Qatar has an interest in aligning with a certain side.
From Beirut but
It means His Highness the Amir's position that we are mediators
In this process
Medically speaking, the Sheikh's state
Did you seriously discuss it?
With the two main parties involved, namely what is happening here in the Lebanese Kingdom, the Saudi Arab Kingdom, and Syria
In particular, with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, I spoke with Prince Saud.
And he showed his support for the idea
It means we benefited from Prince Saud.
The whole thing was just looking for a solution.
Her arguments are weak.
If you go, if you go to the mind
Her arguments are weak.
It should be removed because there is tension between me and Palestine.
There is Iranian nuclear tension
It means that the Arab University must have a mechanism to resolve disputes.
It means the African Union is better than us in resolving issues.
Whoever tries to bring together the parties
And they hold conferences to resolve the Arab disputes that have been longstanding and well-established for years, which they cannot resolve.
So that they gather the Arabs or cut off their limbs if there is one, or intervene to support the oppressed.
It should be studied
If we want it to be for the Arab University, not the Arab World University, the university
With Arabi, a tool for execution
One of the officials here is President Nabih Berri.
Requires Sin Sin
It means that it has become clear that the Lebanese agreed
And by God, see what I mean, us
First among them is Qatar
It never led to a result on any given day.
For the Arab Interest
He is the power for the Arabs
We tried it in such
In the United States, when we went to the Doha agreement
And the agenda will be the resolution, not another agenda.
There is no doubt that
and their most important role in the Arab world as a whole
in role
Let him stop by our agreement
For others, come let us help each other
Because this is a dangerous project and this is a dangerous project but
Why have we reached a stage where everyone plays on our field?
In our domain
It is very important that we prevail in the interests of our peoples and people.
Now we need an Arab summit after this agreement to see what we will do among the Palestinian brothers.
What will we do in Somalia?
What will we do in Somalia as a non-member of the Arab League?
Why isn't Sudan a member of the Arab University? Iraq isn't a member of the Arab University either.
We are part of the Arab world and a small part of the Arab world
We hope this is not a suggestion, just an idea.
Can Qatar have good relations with Syria and Saudi Arabia?
I think the first thing is that if they ask us to do something, we will do what we can.
But I am certain that His Majesty King Abdullah
King of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
and his brother, President Bashar
Historically, Saudi Arabia and Syria were in an agreement.
Can be a temporary stage
We find her afterwards, God willing.
Nevertheless, I would like to ask whether you could play a role in this aspect.
Even if not openly, you now mean that you have gained their trust.
We are striving for closer ties among Arab countries.
And this is His Highness's policy from the beginning, but this is the document.
Can what happened in Lebanon indicate that the region is heading towards major settlements?
Or what happened in Lebanon is a local Lebanese matter; regional issues still remain.
Not very attached to this situation
I hope the opposite. I hope this.
A new situation has begun in the Arab world, this is a wish
We can create
It will happen somewhere else
In other words, does the Sheikh's state fear that the escalation which had been ongoing for some time will continue?
The lowest point from here to the end of President George W. Bush's era
What's in my mind, there's no doubt, my suspicions are still with me, whether it's about the Palestinian issue, meaning now it's about Gaza.
It means I'm asking my dad.
What do we need anything else
He urges us to pay attention to this human aspect in Palestine.
What we can send them medicine
and food
Khebba for the patient in the hospital
If the electricity goes out, what then?
It means I hope
We, the Arab States, agree on an amount for this employee's medicine and food, which we shall call medicine and food.
Hey, how can the Red Crescent deliver it?
The Red Cross delivered it
But the Arab side's excuse is committed to this Israeli blockade.
I don't want to go into details about this document. I just say that as Arabs, we must deliver the medicine and the waste, even if we differ on enthusiasm.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has made efforts and pledged themselves to the management of the Holy Mosque.
Because this dispute will benefit only the other party.
Do not deal with this party because we are not going to resolve this false statement for you.
and I
So far, I don't see any signs of a solution ahead.
Do you fear an American-Iranian confrontation in the coming period, or will you invite it?
This is normal, of course we are
The lowest I can talk about Qatari state
Iran is an important neighbor for us.
We may not agree on all policies, or perhaps they may not agree on all Qatari policies.
It means, for example, they say to us: "We don't want any relations between you and Israel or any contact with you."
Perhaps someone considers you necessarily to be part of the rules already existing there.
This document we know how to deal with it
There is someone who said that after the visit of Qatar's Amir to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
He met, consulted, or spoke with the Saudi family
In Istanbul, deals between Syria and Israel
And I can say thanks to fate.
The second statement, the Kingdom was eager to find a solution, and I was in contact with Prince Saud.
What happened in the latest hours
Change strategy in negotiation tactics
From among you, or before the extremities?
We, as officials in charge of this
And from you, from all sides, we have sealed ourselves in our chambers.
And finally, we found ourselves that after that, His Highness the Amir entered the scene and became important.
And from it, the invention advanced.
The [name] has not been mentioned yet, it has ended.
And the message was clear when he said: "We know our size, our position, and our role until the end."
He intended to play a neutral role without provoking any other party.
Whether Arabic, regional, or international
but nonetheless
became responsible
Did you desire that, or did you not want it?
It means that by criticizing others, we are criticizing ourselves, because we want to avoid them as a nation.
And these countries
Can you work or
I think this is the combination that feels comfortable.
Perhaps my last or final question: What is your current relationship with Washington? Is it a lasting, distinguished, and meaningful one?
It means our relationship with Washington is a good one, let me say that.
It does not lack different viewpoints on the issues.
But this is our right, and if they are talking about democracy, this is democracy.
How is she? Meaning, how do you translate it on the ground that your relationship is good?
It means that if you talk about economics, it's excellent; if you talk about education, it's excellent too.
If you're talking about health, if you're talking about politics, I can tell you that it's fine.
In your opinion, and without any ambiguity, during the next phase
In my opinion, we should abandon the confrontation with Israel.
And if we want to stop playing on the Arabic field.
We will reconcile the factions among the Palestinians
We agree on a view so that we can become a respected force.
What I thought is that we are here with us
We need to become effective
Thank you all our viewers for your kind attention, and until next time by God's grace with my sincere regards to you all.
Hello viewers, welcome to this interview with the Prime Minister and the Qatari Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hamad bin Jasim bin Jabr Al-Thani.
In this dialogue
We are trying to anticipate the Arab political reality and Arab efforts.
Happy Sheikh, welcome
To investigate what is happening in Gaza
And I hope that through this dialogue, we will be able to
Let us cast light on your questions
Israeli entry into Gaza in a full land-based manner
And our goal was to have an Arab stance there.
Deal with friendly countries
and the friendly countries
And how to attempt finding a clear, strong Arab stance regarding the Arab countries?
And later we find areas for reconciliation
Before us, we know that more than one Arab country has violated
In an arbitrary way
And there will be no reckoning for it while
We find that we are held accountable for everything, whether intentionally or unintentionally.
We are the specialists
The only world that we always target
We always address in a certain way
I think what
to such a degree that we will not be able
Let us meet at the level of leaders
To halt this campaign, we are the ones.
What we wanted was to create a rift in the Arab world.
And there were five other verbal agreements.
By two-thirds
But the purpose of the meeting is not
We hope it turns out well and that our view is wrong because the goal
Solving the problem now is not the goal of top management
But is it being carried out on the blood of the Palestinians?
The ministerial request we made now does not cancel Qatar's request
And the one who also confirmed the owner of the honor
In his speech, he said that we are not insisting if it's embarrassing that it takes place in Qatar—we are not insisting that the summit take place in Qatar; it can take place wherever it may.
An Arab stance that respects others
Yes, but regarding the ministerial
We want to tell them that the Security Council resolution was issued.
and Israel
His meaning was not in the decision, and it has continued, and it still kills and devastates in Gaza.
And we need to ask the Arabs what we are actually doing.
What are we doing?
Will Israel be safe after it ends?
Implement what remains of the Security Council resolution
Could it be that there is a position, since Israel has not stopped?
Firing guns, we do not force our brothers
On the decision, it is considered that fat
From that day
We will talk about the ministerial meeting.
You will ultimately support this proposition.
We support the Arab summit, of course, and this is our idea, our thought: an Arab state, also requested by the summit, Syria, Yemen.
Oriental in a Arabic script existing
We have all been brought into the moderation camp.
and the camp of imbalance
And what do they mean by imbalance?
The one who divided the West
The Arabs who call themselves moderates and the Arabs who are not moderates
What we find is that there is a moderate one and a non-moderate one.
And afterwards, prophet, let me know what is balance and what is imbalance. Is balance walking according to Israeli plans?
And the humiliation of the disgrace done in an humiliating way
Or, we just need to keep the situation alive
This is a important question
The issue is whether countries
Proceeding according to Israeli plans and wanting to resolve issues through methods
I do not say she is moving according to Israeli plans, nor do I want to accuse anyone.
But I say
Then we called it the moderation camp
What is moderation in the West's view?
Are we willing to carry out the slaughter of a specific group of Palestinians?
Of course, in the elections that took place
I'm not either a supporter or opponent of Hamas, but I'm talking about the reality.
The reality that exists is that there is
Idea
By the name which they call them the Recycle movement
But we need to ask ourselves: what does this radical movement demand?
Is he denying her right, or is she demanding her right?
Are we separating them?
And we will also create other masses
Zad lan achna
Internal Arabic intellectual
This seemed to be happening
Therefore, we don't want to fight a war on behalf of others.
Yes, happy elder, in short
Who prevented the holding of the Arab Summit
I cannot say it's prohibited because there are reports, and the general consensus means it's well-known.
The prohibition of action
But the example I mentioned to you, we could have been possible
We take a vote and consult the two-thirds
But this was not his goal, because she's not just challenging, rather she's a vital necessity, we believe.
Others believed it to be an unnecessary need.
Well, let's go to the Security Council
or in the UN Security Council resolution
But the UN Security Council's decision, Israel said, will be implemented and then it will be observed.
I just want to focus on it again, once more.
What would happen if we apply the decision to the weaker party?
In what way will it differ from the first assembly?
The occurrence of disputes usually means differences of opinion.
The more important it is
Are we ready? Can we present a clear Arab stance?
From humanitarian aid
From clear support of our brothers
And also addressing the Israeli philosophical side, I say that
This is ridiculous; why are we even discussing it when I don't think everyone is ready.
Why should we freeze the Arab initiative?
Then forty-eight, we have committed ourselves to peace, forty-eight, the Israelis have not committed themselves.
Natural, conflicts do occur in society, but truly the matter is those conflicts.
Expresses positions that reflect deep-seated aspects in certain minds, meaning
One of the arguments he became familiar with is
There are those who describe Hamas's actions as sabotage.
and not even the minorities
This situation occurred, and we responded to it through one of my ministerial colleagues.
And I believe this means what the West says.
This is a radical movement, this is its ideology, and one says this is so.
And I do not wish to be men of others.
And therefore, always means, and I don't mean anyone in it.
Any foreigner finds
Either a Western country or a Western state you find
Among the Arabs
Yes, alright, the Sheikh's happiness now
Call for a second ministerial meeting
And as for Allah's schedule, it is one thing.
Here you are, O Arabs, what is happening? What is the third party's stance?
One million Israeli soft
which came after the decision of Fawtamanmiy and seventy
The decision that was issued
Israel has not implemented it, Israel has not carried out the task yet.
And there is no doubt that the Arab delegation made an effort
He is thanked for this decision
We are asking for Chapter Seven because Israel is above the law, meaning Israel.
And if you ask them, they will say to you: "We understand."
No fault of the Arabs that if they did
If that were the case, Israel would not hesitate.
It is above international law
This is a reality
Why did you go to the Security Council? And why did you link the Arab summit to what the Security Council will issue?
But the Security Council will strive for us
It requires a difficult decision.
to the decision
A responsible person might lose their position
We in the West are afraid
And we are the ones who witness when for example they agree
I would like to exit the form
The ones who committed this aggression against rebuilding Iraq's entire infrastructure at their own expense have destroyed it.
Let's not ask the Iraqi government or ask about the people who have died.
No compensation
Exactly the same thing happened in Sudan as soon as they started talking about trying Omer Bashir.
Sheikh Saadah
Sheikha Saadah
A major Arab diplomatic victory at the Security Council
He said that they were facing difficulties within the Security Council because the initial discussion focused on a presidential statement.
The consequences
Israel did not comply with it
I will be back in two days after a week after finishing the task
Because they have not committed themselves to the decision
Sorry, the assumed thing people commit to
Because Israel has completed the task
Do you have an alternative to this decision?
All the stuff we've done
We carried out the efforts of the brothers, unfortunately with their initiative.
The blockade of Gaza participated in it
I'm a friend of the West, and I have no objection to having relations with the West, and I'm not
Shield of the West, and shield of America?
But these people know the language of interests.
Your friends if you are strong
Or if you have a different point of view
And as for the latter, our view takes from it one part of the wine, and I say we have won.
What is victory?
What does it guarantee?
I can't currently say anything about any objections because the decision hasn't been made yet.
And the Council will be its own leader
You participated in the formulations
Shah, we participated in the formulations to some extent, yes we participated.
But you did not call for a meeting of Arab ministers with the American Foreign Minister.
But I'm sure the brothers who are going to iPhone us.
I referred to Arab elements for a particular interest.
In this regard, I am happy with the Sheikh's presence.
Since two years ago until now
Show me, I don't want to talk about the accusations.
What can I say to claim that we have revealed everything to you?
Are they people?
Rafz Israeli Rafz international and we also participate in this Rafz
And from here the disagreement became apparent and the encirclement became clear.
And Israel, in the month that has passed, killed twenty-eight Palestinians during the truce.
And they are leading themselves astray until we destroy them, because we do not desire for them to become like that in the judgment.
Those limbs, the joy of the Sheikh
It clearly states that the Palestinian conflict is a Palestinian conflict.
It means if there were
Who created the Palestinian conflict? Could it have been a Palestinian-Israeli conflict?
I will say to a party, you are with me the truth in this matter.
I don't say that Hamas with her is the truth in the truth.
I do not claim that nor do I say that
But Mai, the mediator, is usually a mediator at a distance from everyone.
And I don't mean only the mediator; I mean we Arabs are at one distance from everyone.
And what I need is for her to not exist, therefore we must eliminate her in any way, through various methods.
Once again training right and left forces
And then they were surrounded, and they were not given money or salaries.
And we are a positive model in the Western region
Let the people of Gaza see how people are living.
Ashe mbachache in f f f
On the contrary, in Gaza
I have called for a second ministerial meeting, a Arab ministerial meeting, but at this time
Talk about it is still ongoing between Hamas through Turkish mediation and
This meeting you invited us to seems like an attempt to circumvent.
The circumvention if we had taken another approach
We don't have initiatives
In this document
Egypt is an important Arab country.
And they are required to play a role, and we support any Egyptian effort leading to a consensus.
but it is important
We do not come
Bakerah beat the other side.
There is no path to peace
Balanced Egyptian initiative
Between international requirements, Arab requirements, and human requirements
And the requirements of Egypt's role is a significant role
She is a leading Arab country that we respect and appreciate.
This is what is required in your opinion regarding Egypt
The current proposals, the existing initiative, do not meet those requirements, Sheikh Saad.
I have an idea about the initiative
What they announced, we hear about it from here and from here information about it
What can I comment on something I don't know?
With my respect to the government or the Palestinian President, we must be present, and we all recognize the Palestinian President.
but also in people
Those observers on one side must be given their point of view.
So that this mediation can succeed
On this occasion, take into account the viewpoint.
The Hamas position was clear: this decision was not taken with our input, which means how could it have been issued?
An agreement in which Arabs participate in formulating it without consulting or taking the view of the main party concerned on the matter
We just mean that obviously we deal with the Palestinian state as a state.
And we deal with her power, let us say, one side only.
But now there is an apartment in a place where one part is located in one place and another part is located in another.
This does not mean that if we interact with people in Gaza, we should cease our interactions with the groups present in the West or the Palestinian Authority.
We treat the Palestinians as one people and one government.
If they ask for a limit from Al-Ghazah, it would be with them.
And now let's get our team together
What he announced about it
Firstly, the decision did not state that it welcomed the Egyptian initiative or any other initiatives.
Some consider it to constitute the yeh.
This is an interpretation, but what I understood from reading the decision is that Aheb welcomed the Egyptian initiative.
We hope the Egyptian initiative will succeed in achieving its objectives.
Cease the fighting
I do not doubt them, rather my brothers in Egypt.
Israel did not accept the UN Security Council resolution
And you consider this decision as if it never existed, since Israel did not accept it.
Even if he later accepted it, things would have already changed on the ground.
Yes, Sheikh Saadah talks about Egyptian efforts, Egyptian efforts.
Turkey also participates alongside her at the same time and was
About an Arab deficiency
Or about Arab disputes that cannot reach a solution, the Betali came to occupy a place.
It means that the Arab sides were supposed to cede it.
Welcome to Turkey's position
And a position that must be assessed Arabically and Islamically
Turkey Islamic State
and therefore this natural role
And it is necessary for people to walk with me.
No Arab consensus on addressing the situation
One says let them dismiss the task
It's necessary that we clearly state the nature of this aggression, its continuation, and the delay in addressing it.
Icon is in a Middle Eastern position facing
It means Israel is capable of acting in the region, I'm not talking about an Arab-Israeli war, we are the people who always claim for peace.
No, we are a country, meaning I love to live in safety.
But I'm not asking for an Arab war; I'm asking for a stance.
Arabic and clear
In the context of initiatives and proposals, of course you keep track of what's happening.
and the proposals and conditions that the Hamas movement puts forward
Do you think
As an on-the-ground observer, the on-the-ground reality
And the political figure resulting from the military operation now allows Hamas to impose its conditions
It's necessary for him to be the right one.
This is what we agree on. This point, we agree on it together.
The second thing
We're not here right now, they're hiring. I don't know about this hiring like you told me.
The second thing
Well, what about Arab attitudes in such situations?
This Arab reality
What we witnessed after the start of those operations
Doubt exists that the Arab street's position is far ahead
About us, we are governments
Of course, I'm sorry that the Baga described this popular public event.
Why do they tell me this document?
Let us express the views of our peoples
The leaders of the Arab world
It means if they are Irudon
The lowest ones see what?
Of course, there is a high ceiling and there is a low ceiling.
By ending normalisation, ending diplomatic relations with Israel
Qatar Bank
The Israeli embassy office in Doha is closing
Qatar taking this stance
The Arab side must be radical and take radical positions.
Anything the Arabs agree on, we will also agree on collectively.
Let's start, we are in an Arab agreement
The treaty is weak and the relations are weak too.
We're ready
We align ourselves with our Arab brothers
But it would be a clear and credible Arabic decision.
And when dealing with others, they only consider countries that have relations.
Even countries that don't have relations
Very important
So long as you are clients of others
He says why isn't Qatar a model in this field?
If this is the only model, we are ready to be part of it.
But we still want
Arabic model Qatar commits to part of its Arab commitment
Like
And he's not going to sell anyone anything
But our problem is the lack of trust among Arab countries.
And I don't want to say our secret, unfortunately I don't want to say brokers
And therefore it is very important
Official call anywhere, as we must rise above this
Some expelled their ambassador, some submitted protests, some expelled the ambassador like Shafiz.
And this is part of the dispute
But due to her, the ambassador and those who summoned the permanent diplomatic missions summoned five ambassadors, and all of this is films about our peoples.
It means we spoke about the modest ceiling of the people's demand
At the top of the roof, who demands the opening of fronts? Who demands Syria to open its front with Israel?
See, we are calling for peace, not for fighting with Israel.
And we do not seek conflict with Israel.
To carry out fighting with Israel
And how can we agree?
What's this problem anyway?
Let's talk to our leader so we can move past our disagreements
I heard what the Sheikh said about it, that it was happiness.
Condition that countries do not sell some to others
What do you mean?
It means now
The street won't show us mercy
Sheikh Saadah
Is what is happening today the continuation of the project initiated by Finteh and Sateh with the Lebanon war?
Do you think there is a difference?
I don't think there is a difference between the goals.
Lebanon meant it had its own freedom
The rest of the parts, of course, are still under review and will be submitted to the United States.
or similar to that
Lebanon means we dealt with the Lebanese problem in a much bigger way.
Israel, of course, needs its surrounding weak countries.
Until it dominates, holding his long hand
And of course in countries supported by foreign powers
And therefore she wants to remain the only power in the region.
And now Irudon
Aygirón este ejemplo en Gaza
In Lebanon, how many sects are there?
And how a side
While Lebanon is going through Palestine, it talks about one side only.
But I'm going back and confirming you that the Palestinian problem is that they listened more to Arabs than to foreigners.
Both sides, and from here, the Hoh and every person who believes he controls the other side.
In your opinion, K K K as a monitor and observer
According to the plan, it will end in your broken bone
We, as Arabs, can we accept this, since this example might be repeated for those who resist?
Or he says Rahil
Whether for Israelis or others, the future
And We have presented a clear example
The highest in obedience and in assisting to break a bone
I mean, in our case, me and my uncle are abroad, and me and my brother are with my uncle.
We are not facing any conflict with Hamas right now, and I don't say that Hamas or anyone else is free from error or power.
They all have mistakes
Now we must pass this document.
On Turkic side
Because here failure is not the failure of the group
Sheik Saadah from Qatar usually means since a while, she has been actively proposing suggestions
And initiatives to resolve the issue took place in Lebanon
This happened in South Kordofan, we will talk about this issue, even if it's shortly after.
And we
What makes me want to burden my brothers is the sensitivity I have towards the harshness of some people.
As long as the state takes up all these initiatives, we have no objection; the main thing is that the issue will be resolved.
We aren't aiming right now to drop Qatar on the highest platform.
It means that it was not among the aims of His Highness the Amir.
This was his goal: how do we stop this bleeding?
And we stop this tyranny
What happened means it exceeds imagination
And we are in Qatar
Do we know something they don't know? I think so.
But the most important thing is that we have the intention.
The honest one to reach a superior solution
Talking about initiatives means it is useful to know where the initiative stands regarding South Kordofan, the Movement for Justice and Equality.
and the Sudanese government in Khartoum
And Eiken is special because it solves the Darfur problem, since you see the Darfur problem began with
The Arabs helped
But what did we achieve and bring to the international level?
Based on this, we will fight the system and now the employee is dissolved and we don't know how it was dissolved
And we always witness things as I mentioned at the beginning regarding the implementation of decisions—meaning we are the best people who align with the decisions.
Dimensions of the issue regarding competition: Is there also a competition regarding the Darfur issue?
What do I want to include in this document?
Before we conclude this discussion, there is a pleasure for the Sheikh, there is an economic summit.
Will you hold this summit? Will you attend this summit?
We will ban the peak
It will take place; we hope it will take place in a different atmosphere than the Arab one, but it is scheduled.
Be kon eib
Well, if Arab leaders come to this summit
When Palestinian blood is flowing in the streets of Gaza, here they gather for financial and economic reasons.
We help in tagging
But it seems no one is afraid of this street.
What you know about the situation means that obviously we don't wish for anything but peace to happen to us all.
and we will be safe
But it means there's no one who takes someone's small amount.
Prime Minister, Qatar's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hamad bin Jasim bin Jabr Al-Thani, thanked you sincerely.
Our dear viewers, wherever you may be, peace be upon you.
What is the point of this celebration, and to what extent are the statements of the High Commissioner for Human Rights credible?
People with disabilities are the group most at risk of neglect around the world.
And what about our Arab region and its level of interest in this issue?
These questions and others, we put to our guest for today's episode.
The previous United Nations Special Rapporteur on Disability
And she holds a Bachelor's degree in Literature, Social Services, and Social Sciences from Qatar University.
Similarly, for the Master's degree, Social Planning and Social Policies from Helwan University in Egypt
And many centers have been established in the field of people with disabilities.
Among them is a founding member and the General Coordinator of the National Organization of Persons with Disabilities
The year 1988
and the Deputy Chair of the National Committee for Persons with Disabilities from 2009 to 2099
Even two hundred and three
As well as contributing to the establishment of the Center for People with Disabilities
People with disabilities in Qatar
Our guest oversaw the launch of numerous programs, projects, and public campaigns.
And the activities related to people with disabilities in the Arab world
As well as delivering lectures and participating in conferences, seminars, and forums.
Hello madam, join us in this episode
The accepted term is people with disabilities
As for the beginnings, we introduced the term "conquering" in the 1980s and before that.
More educational when
The responsibility lies with those who provide them with that education.
The three and ninety appeared and a vital document in the United Nations
By mentioning this term before delving into the details
Regarding the remaining regions, although there are regions that are not or are not classified as nomadic and are instead classified as poor.
And Latin America, especially Latin America, truly can see this trend stronger than in any other region.
But statistics have proven otherwise.
The trend towards a legal orientation exists in the Arab world, as you can find in many countries.
Resources could be present and political will could be present
Well, here let me tell you some statistics, maybe you're already aware of them.
Eighty percent of them are from poor countries.
UNESCO says that nearly ninety percent of disabled children in poor countries do not go to school.
Sadeh Hapseh how do you react to these statistics?
It's true to a great extent.
I saw it first in South Kordofan, in Gaza, and in areas experiencing such events, namely wars and conflicts.
There is no distinction between a disabled person and a non-disabled person; the numbers are large.
Separate the children's maternal lineage, for example, among females, approximately fifty-three or fifty-two.
and in other countries
There are many obstacles that prevent these children from accessing schools, even if they do not have disabilities.
The city doesn't even have underground facilities, let alone this child finding that school.
Can he reach it?
For children and for others among the residents, that it is
Such projects and initiatives are wonderful, but we rarely hear about them in reality.
Yet when we talk about World Disability Day, which the world celebrated a few days ago, what is the point of such a celebration?
The role in the world
The best situation is that of people who don't have disabilities at all.
There are organizations that have arrived and carried out many projects.
Several important health strategies are applied.
Through this strategy
There is an overlap between the human aspect and working with specific target groups, such as people with disabilities.
At a certain level of awareness, the Arab world is awakening.
At awareness, we pause to receive connections and continue our conversation.
Thank you
I have two questions I would like to ask you, as they were previously settled by the United Nations.
The second point, what is it?
The United Nations laws calling for, for example, combating systems that hinder society's access to children—shouldn't they also apply to Syria's intelligence system?
Is there a law that allows me to file a lawsuit against the system, just as there are many in Syria?
Yes, Salim, your idea is clear. Salim, could you please share with us from Syria? Thank you very much, Naveed Al-Sayed from Kuwait. Please go ahead, Naveed.
Peace be upon you, and may Allah bless you and grant you mercy.
And upon you peace
Good evening
In the evening, the light prefers
I, if you allow me, I am from the category of people with intellectual/mental disabilities.
It means I hear the Arabs saying "the free one understands by indication"
And in the beginning, I say: "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Glory be to Him who spoke to us, and every thing spoke."
It means I've been sitting for more than thirty years, and I can't speak, not even a word or two today.
Praise be to God, God spoke to me
It means he speaks Gran, and I found that means
It means that I'm attacking because I exploit the Quran and because I'm a hypocrite, and I mean people and so on.
They declare me and point me out in the lower realm to the fire
I have only gotten publicity
And they do not exaggerate in the matter of the Haggi.
His house made of glass doesn't throw people stones
and of course my personal obstacles
It falls within the scope of this definition: the question raised by Sliman's inquiry
United Nations programs or their reactions regarding causes of disability such as political objectives or others
Engagement with different organizations and agencies
For discussing, convincing, and knowing, I am sorry, at no level
Disabilities and related issues are on their work agendas, in other words.
UNESCO, the international organization UNICEF, and in fact these organizations themselves create disability.
It is one of the programs that tries not to overlook children who have disabilities.
Suitable opportunities and schools
From the different environmental and other aspects
Similarly, UNICEF
But there are shortcomings that we must acknowledge: there are shortcomings in the United States' role as well.
Highlight the points of weakness and deficiencies I mentioned above.
Regarding the United States
The problem of routine and bureaucracy
Directly, I was present in my country, the state of Qatar.
but there was a routine and bureaucratic procedures that hindered
My work, in particular, sometimes I saw it during the constraints or shortcomings
He struggles or tries or fights people with disabilities to recognize them.
Until I reached a point about him that the International Community for the Disabled had not separated it into a distinct matter as they had intended.
But it occupied a certain part, somewhat appropriate
Unfortunately, there is no formatting between them
This is one of her most important weaknesses.
The inspection carried out by the Special Rapporteur and applied to countries
Stole the staff or stole the workers in those programs
Unfortunately, we received replies from only three out of eighty-four organizations and agencies, of which we received replies from only three.
Do not stay
The disability is permanent, stable, and continuous for many years, despite the fact that this disability is a fundamental human rights issue.
In the last period, yes, thanks to God, for two or three years
The issue of disability has become at least raised through activities such as seminars and others.
Welcome to you, peace be upon you
Madam, why are there no binding laws or decisions applicable to Arab countries, and who is responsible for implementing these international laws?
Regarding Arab countries and salary allocation, for example, allocating a salary for the disabled.
Are there funds designated by the United States?
Will these funds go to governments or to United Nations offices? And will these aid actually reach the disabled?
Finally, it should be noted that there were no binding decisions regarding the Arab countries.
Thank you very much, Ahmed al-Halabi, for telling us about Greece.
With us Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia, please Ibrahim
Hello to you all
And upon you peace
If you adopt this proposal
It is to write directly to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
You will convert to this fund
He is a product manufacturer
And allocating one percent of annual net profit
I'm back with our guest to answer callers' questions
And he says that doctors advised him to undergo surgery, but
It costs a lot and he cannot afford to cover this process, so where does it lead?
He is from Algeria
I believe it is important to meet Najeeb's needs.
It's the same as any other right, meaning the rights of disabled individuals.
All these rights and duties must be obtained by this citizen.
Joining the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is a mandatory and legal requirement.
And the rights and needs of individuals have expanded beyond the national scope.
or even at the level of non-governmental organizations
A matter for all countries, with supervision to ensure the implementation of these laws.
At least at the level of first-line managers, there must be awareness.
Then, at the very least, if we work on these treaties in this way
Even if there is not a strong commitment
There was feedback on the reports for the monitoring you were carrying out, and was there any interest?
But do not forget that standard rules are ethically binding and real, not legally binding.
to be committed and to uphold them
And we are aware that these issues will be resolved, discussed, or raised within a community context that suffers from many problems and complications.
Naji Zakarni, Director of the Qatari Deaf Center, is a sign language expert with Al-Jazira Channel.
The matter began with Ali sending a great thank you to Al-Jazeerah channel.
The one who is currently live-streaming this special episode
Now Ali is speaking and saying I am very proud.
She was and remains the caregiver for all persons with special needs in the place where she is located.
And we support her and stand by her always and forever.
Also, I say that there are many people with special needs.
Among them, there is no awareness of this agreement because there have been no training sessions.
Regarding it, especially in schools or hospitals or in government and private institutions
We insist that this agreement be published.
It was a law concerning people with special needs in all countries of the world.
This confirms and rests upon the fact that states shall
By adopting this agreement and signing it
Also similar to the State of Qatar and some other countries signed this document with the aim of serving people with special needs and serving us.
I would like to thank you very much, brother Nagi. I spoke on behalf of Ali.
I would like to thank you very much.
Your opinion might make a decision.
The previous United Nations Special Rapporteur on Disability might start with the proposal put forward by one of the correspondents, Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
Regarding the establishment of a support fund
It is a donation fund and accepts contributions from countries.
This fund is outrageous in spending on activities even carried out by the independent expert when performing his duties.
And even Arab countries have not contributed except for one country, Syria.
Therefore, fulfilling those obligations is a current problem in the United States.
The fund that
On the failure by major countries to comply and their lack of concern
Many people sadly say this to their neighbors, meaning that we don't care about jobs now.
It is a real issue of obligations
For human rights
Man in his general, broad form
The main page is specific
But that is why such treaties exist
Then if these countries fulfill their obligations, but the good idea that the brother launched
It is essential to emphasize that there should not be only an independent, standalone fund, but also existing organizations in the region.
From what she has in her budgets
Submitted for projects related to persons with disabilities in Gaza
Assistance for people with disabilities
The issue is always intertwined, meaning political factors are involved.
His state or government has greatly supported him.
The number has decreased, unfortunately
With nominal amounts

Of course, the gender withdrew from it.

I hope Arab countries allocate a portion of their budget
Thank you very much, Bahjat, Bahjat from Kuwait
A'isha Mohamed from Qatar, please
Hello to you all
And upon you peace
Good evening to you, and good evening to the Sheikha Bat Khalifa.
I just want to tell her a message of thanks and appreciation.
The past years
With our best wishes to the families of the special dependents.
With the continuous support of the sister Hapseh
Sharif banner bearer from Tunisia, welcome
There is another level, namely the genetic.
I believe that attention to genetic level reduces the rate of disabilities.
In our Arab customs, there is always the practice of a brother-in-law taking his brother-in-law's daughter, his sister's daughter, his uncle's daughter, and so on.
This means at this level, which is the disability level, thank you.
The comment replied to what came in relation to viewers' contacts
The truth is, it's the same as I said at the national level.
I know that there are guidance and support programs.
Located in the field of health services
Which also falls under the umbrella of Hamd al-Tabei
The Psychological Counseling Department believes that Waiza in Education has proposed programs to the Higher Education Council.
The private education department; I honestly don't know if it still exists.
But it's certain that healthcare services have been improved, yes, there is support and medical services.
And Tahaileh is available for these cases
Prevention is better than treatment, and he mentioned the genetic factor: marriage between close relatives. Is there a campaign?
For example, for awareness
In this regard
Definitely this is a very important and dangerous point.
And among the things that I and others have discussed in many words and many contributions.
Yes, there are awareness campaigns that are not only targeted
It was carried out by the World Health Organization
Similarly with regard to the UNICEF
Now in many Arab countries and Qatar has fallen victim to it.
And Tunisia is confirmed
There are now mandatory decisions regarding early screening.
and which has been applied in many countries
All of this is preventive measures.
And have such campaigns received a response?
The positive aspect, especially since it clashes with customs and traditions.
Of course, the difficulty lies in the fact that it clashes with the community's culture.
Icon in the decision to be in strategies to be in his will to confront this and enforce it.
For example, early screening is a very important issue before marriage.
Ask you about whether there are statistics talking about the disabled
And especially for the disabled in the Arab region
Qays on the Arab region in the sense that
and especially
With the recent events in the area
The regions, and conflict hotspots, regarding wars and conflicts, etc.
For every dead person, there are three disabled individuals.
Events in Lebanon in Darfur in many areas
I never will, first of all the problem is me
With human rights principles
There must be a role for people with disabilities, for their programs, and for their plans.
Seized the agendas already existing in ministries, institutions, and government and non-governmental organizations
In cases similar to those of wars or disturbances
Only for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay
In the world, and even more surprising, is that what he told the International Monitoring Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities regarding the demographic statistics.
This means the disabled are not included in the general population statistics conducted for the residents.
Does not always announce
For example, in his country Qatar, when the census was conducted, it was believed that more than five years had passed.

Exactly, but at least
Statistics are making some progress in this regard.
Hello to you all
Madam, thank you for this program and thank you, Sister Haseh.
But Ahmed Al-Lah, thank you, that I am Qatari, and to receive this attention from my country means
And my daughter is currently studying at independent schools and receiving a good education. Praise be to God.
And I would like to thank Mrs. Haseh
And her role as a motivator, the role that makes us neither fear nor worry about our children
And praise, gratitude, and great thanks to Allah for this group. And for whom does this group rely upon?
Thank you so much, Fatima al-Dosari from Qatar. Thank you for sharing with us. We will stay in Qatar with Latiifah.
Peace be upon you
And upon you peace
My dear Fawziah, the reality and the impending which we await to resolve the problem of our orphaned children.
And the role of the auntie among our Qatari children
I hope she responds to this question in the same way.
Peace be upon you
And I witness to what the State of Qatar has been providing for the hearing impaired.
Was our program an early detection program for hearing loss?
There is the Council of Persons with Disabilities
For people with disabilities, regardless of the type of disability
Even the civil society coalition AMGOU or other communities
Because the reality and what is happening, if we compare it over the past five years
What is being provided to the disabled five years ago and now
Thank you very much, Karem Nissim, for sharing with us from Jordan, and I'm returning to our guest again.
Of course the the
The society as a whole, and particularly families that have
Children have disabilities; they have great aspirations and expectations from every
Whether at the strategic level or at the operational level
But regarding one of the points you mentioned, which is very important.
Children who do not have documents or otherwise, either in Qatar or elsewhere
The international agreement, like many international documents
and commitment to translating it into plans and strategies
To provide those services automatically
From the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, regardless of religion, race, color, gender, or sexuality
Well, her husband's share means that you previously worked as a special advisor at the United Nations Office on Disability, after six years of service.
It means you were wishing for it.
Perhaps you didn't have the time, perhaps the financial aid wasn't sufficient.
It means there have been many achievements realized, and I am proud of them.
Through my participation or through existing organizations and through government institutions in many countries.
But especially the Arab region focuses
There should be more research and larger studies.
We started from a global survey that has produced more than one report about us.
Raising awareness is an ongoing process that must be continuously and extensively addressed.
Coordination among Arab countries
Between people themselves, people with disabilities and their organizations, because they are the ones
But they have a duty that is certain.
so that they struggle for it
Great thanks
Thank you
Our dear viewers, at the end of this episode, I would like to thank everyone who participated with us in the feedback and comments.
Tomorrow, if God wills, we will meet with a new guest.
Join us with your connections and messages in a new direct channel. See you soon!
Morning of the rose
I am much happier with your presence among us.
At the beginning, before we start and ask the different questions and get confused this morning
Shimaa, I can see you're here.
The entire Middle East deserves this global achievement.
Qatar actually put us on the world map.
Thank you, Qatar
Also tell Ali, hey Ali
First, the Brotherhood became the viewers.
And I say: Congratulations on the visit. To the entire Qatari people.
And if Allah wills, just as Sheikh Muhammad said, meaning
Before the dream, and hopefully now it will become reality and the work will start from today or from the announcement period.
I was expecting Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup.
Although there are strong files, meaning the U.S., Japan, Australia, I wouldn't have been worried about this particular issue.
Lay shofy hii eh akon meani sa7i7a bi3a ana al-taqr makhata
Our file is actually wow
View actual global maps with competition
We mean we were in the competition
Why are you afraid?
But thanks to God, Qatar's case was indeed strong and deserved that.
Indeed, the file on the FIFA World Cup, 22, and its hosting in Qatar
What is the matter with the Rijāzīs themselves?
It means for them in this field, happiness will definitely be greater, much greater, Allah willing.
It means I want that, we were insulfa before the air, but I wanted to hear that on the air.
At the moment of announcement
And when you received the joy, she was shocked, my word, my word, you're telling me, you're telling the audience.
and the radio
All the world followed us.
Dara al-ikhtilaf wa hāy feh
How did you see the international media?
Shoufi on the overall sports channels, particularly emphasized, especially Arab countries, meaning, thank God, everyone supported him.
Just announcing that Qatar has won the right to host it.
All Arab countries, and certainly not surprisingly, have this kind of generous gesture, announcing their willingness to advance towards Qatar, what began initially.
Publicly, from its human resources, how many volunteers can be mobilized?
Even in terms of external media, Shimaa
It means I and my friend went to celebrate a bad event.
Included in that annexation were those who were included, and the French press agency also considered it.
We also have meetings
It means nobody really insisted, so Qatar has become this, let me just daily remember it.
Hundreds of times a day, at a smaller scale, Earth's surface features are compared to Earth's largest features.
I think everyone is going to know Qatar, the one who doesn't know Qatar's real situation has finally become aware through the internet.
His companion of the 2018 world cup
It means that every football player dreams of serving his country, that he ends up being part of the national team.
Of course, any player in the Qatari league naturally wishes to represent the national team.
This means something positive about a player sacrificing himself even in matches.
Even if he succeeds and joins the national team, he'll still have all his own stuff.
It means that during matches, since the team's crest is on their chest, they must have everything they have.
And as for the responsible individuals, they have not fallen short, especially regarding the minors; this means they are teaching them professionalism.
Eating Sleeping The
Tell me about your experience—you played in multiple different stages across various years. How was your experience, and what was most important to you?
And as for nature, of course
Included in the youth selection stages for the first team
Train with Andes camps with the club with the national team
Each stage has its own characteristic.
Yes, Allah willing, you were like that, you were always moving around from
We finally got used to you for the sports.
Whatever you think, always keep it like this. We always want to take information from you and know the sports news through your updates. What about sports news with you?
In short, I'm being honest, we haven't seen many celebrities in the entertainment field; we used to host stars in their respective fields, and we also do the same in sports.
Like Ali and others in their respective sports fields
On the contrary, physical activity
What about you, we were the capital of sports
Qatar and hello, have we become the capital of sports and world football?
Instead of you being in various fields presenting social, economic, and cultural programs
You have different fields, you hate a certain bird, you have different championships.
But after that, sports
Good excellent
I wished for a long time, oh my love.
I wished that now my age was twenty-six, it would be ten years old instead.
They claim that the emerging youth have gained opportunities and greater opportunities.
They will cover it, meaning just as they say with their hands and so on.
Hey, what's up? Hopefully, the word I want to send to the players who
I hope so, meaning the young ones who will have a bright future, God willing, in the coming days, by God's permission.
Of course, I'm missing this opportunity, they're exploiting it.
And this means that these opportunities come on a plate of gold, they say.
They will certainly make extensive use of it.
What's new? What's happening? What's the latest? The programs I'm about to share with you. I know we've been on vacation for a while.
We'll inform you about your new update, God willing
In constant contact with the event, hello, Allah willing, we will reorganize the Asian Cup for one month from now.
We concluded in just two days, but regarding the Gulf Cup, I wish you all the best for the Kuwaiti national team.
They also published the news, which is available, meaning with intuition, re-create with intuitive stars.
Sure, I'm the foundation of the Qatar TV idea, meaning the first exposure for viewers was through the Qatar screen.
We have no doubt about this well-known fact, O Allah, absolutely.
And hopefully they will transmit the news message across all the channels.
whether special channels or regional channels or any other channels
And for Al-Afiah, Qatar Television
We are sure we hope for the best, Allah willing, always success, and we are still in this project.
First of all, I really love to thank the management of the football club for their support.
The fans of Al-Wahda Club say that from among
My childhood and I in the Wakrah
A sheikh was with us yesterday. Sheikh Nasser was with us.
From the club
I am the son of Ukkarh and the son of Ukkarh
But like I said before the program, this professional one
Belongs to each individual on the soil of Qatar
You guys, we know that young people love sports and addiction just like that.
Let's work on a social project that enters the social arena
Primary media awareness means that media has a very important role in promoting sports in various magazines, so that sports become part of daily life.
You have the youth addicted, but currently, sports seems to be entering schools, and physical education has become part of school curricula.
You have events where any sports event takes place, they celebrate those events.
You have the Qatari street, meaning we see the signs on the streets, and this is considered physical education awareness.
The female element for which there is a specific place on the ladder or anywhere else
This one is also a women's awareness or let's have a physical activity program for women participation in the sports field
After that, regarding us, we have become a Qatar-based women's player organization.
And by imagining that, Allah's thanks, sports appeared to be expanding.
and I also expect that the time period
To carry out many projects and extensive awareness campaigns on the topic of sports, and to expect that this period will be sufficient.
If you study properly and work properly
Hey, it's enough to just go with what we have, we have to make use of what we have, just like that.
Later, when I asked him, I was thinking about how the younger generation could possibly take advantage of the national team.
It means the capabilities and experiences of each device are all available.
Also, in his work, it is important that we, thanks to Allah, in Qatar, this thing is well known among Gulf and Arab communities as they greatly love the tradition.
Ashlon, I'm attracting this audience to follow sports news regularly, especially matches taking place in Qatar.
And being present at the same time
But you see, most of the Qatari street people love watching football, but the problem is attendance.
It means that if you enter forums, you'll notice greater interest, especially in forums related to anime or anime communities.
Great attention to the football league's hatred for the league
You as a player, you as a Qatari citizen, what is the solution you feel will attract you, so that you won't be repelled, you won't be repelled, you as a player?
What's the method that lets you watch your friends' matches on the feed?
He depends on himself from the beginning, meaning as a general thought or something.
Because they love them, they watch them on television or mean gatherings that bring them together.
For example, Japan implemented a major strategy to attract a large audience to attend.
When you prepare for matches with collective points, you don't know what it means; people are just swapping and making up solutions, hopefully.
And Arabic
The most important point for the player, hopefully, will be in Qatar, especially regarding our 22-man squad, what do you expect?
Besides material support, what is the role that actually improves its importance, we really need it.
Providing the means so that they can be reached by the generation, truly representing the Qatari national team and any participation in the major international tournament, the World Cup.
The time when I said "now, the scheduled time has begun, it's ending, when will it end? My mind's rule, I say, may Allah speed it up with the sweet ones."
We have made the impossible possible and turned a dream we thought was impossible into reality. Thank God, we are living in reality.
Like Sheikh Mohammed Hieh during the celebration moments, but it seemed like work.
May God willing, 212 events will be reported under the name of Qatar
I proudly say to every person in Qatar and I say this honestly: today Qatar is a role model among the world's landmarks.
With the help of the Phoenicians and twenty-one
And thanks to the elegant journalist, Amina, we wish you all the best, Allah willing, and I will always follow you so that we can benefit from the insights.
Thank you so much, I'm really happy with the mother's eyes
Young Qatari talents
And returning, they sing a new kind of songs that have emerged during this period
But in a form of rhythm and fast beat music
And his group is also from the Haura faction, God willing.
Be with us, Yana, our viewers, and let's begin our journey from this very moment, good morning.
We are trying to cast such a glance at him
In short, we can define rap as fast spoken music.
The performer recites the lyrics rather than singing a rapid rhythmic melody.
Comprising a large number of verses, it addresses a number of different topics and issues.
and which may sometimes be a person
An emotional political meeting
and often controversial
and largely liberated
And the male singer who performs for us doesn't sing the lyrics of the songs.
But he repeats it
And in his voice he generalizes as a secondary factor
Generally, the voice is not important in rap songs.
And for this reason, he is not called a singer but a rap performer or rapper.
And Rabeeh is concerned with the following ethnic aspect in the songs
For example, the flow of synchronized ticks, or the throw.
Their concern is to follow the concern of their people, the concern of their loved ones.
They have a style like that specific to rap
And I expect they'll give you a better and greater idea than me, personally.
Morning of light, hello
And Allah, first of all, it means that during a period, we wanted to create something that would be meaningful.
We stand out with
For us, why do we mean we don't rap?
After all, hip-hop is an art form existing in every country in the world.
Why isn't it available in the app?
Say, I mean we create something new.
It means we give him from it a message.
He spoke about the negative and positive aspects that become part of our society.
It means we deliver there a message first, secondly, that it means it's a funeral.
This is an art form among the various arts, and perhaps this knowledge, for the viewer, has greatly addressed many social and psychological issues among youth.
Every moment I expect it to change, and as time changes, I expect it to.
And Allah knows that Taghbal is weak.
I sing from twenty-five, the Taghbil was weak at the beginning.
Then we say about ourselves that the new beginning for us is the year two hundred and ten.
In Tibet and among the ethnic minorities, more
For example, she likes to try singing and rapping in the same style during this period, at this moment.
Yeah, definitely a big deal compared to people
Also in his role as a prophet, we speak about them, established in such a branch.
A nice band, you guys have so many concerts, we can talk about this band.
How did it start and what was the idea that one person could actually run a team? How many of you are part of this team?
And Allah, at the beginning, we mean before the establishment of the group.
Rab reached Doha, meaning it started in 2005.
It means each one means loving the rap idea that he raps, he raps and goes down to the website.
I go down, Salman goes down, Falaan goes down, and then there is a rival among them.
And we met some people
It means we are now competing with each other.
Then after a while, after that period, meaning the duration of these years, we reached the year two hundred and ten.
But the number of one hundred and ten had a system of groups, meaning groups for each case, meaning every three or four together.
Well, in short, we said, why is it that we don't just unite and say we're all one group called Rappers?
or by Lézi Kiu Rabbers
And we agreed on that thing, simply meaning we said we're all one name, we're all united together in one hand.
And we presented, meaning we represented this thing and said, "This idea is the same."
Surprisingly twenty-five one
Twenty-five waw, if God wills, a big group
Well, in a way, either he plays or sings, or the whole group performs rap songs.
And he's the one who tunes and he's the one who plays the melody
It means you're assessing when you say something personal.
How are the numbers arranged by difference? Excellent, how are the five and twenty arranged?
He means each one himself has his own abilities
It means every member of the group can make a complete song.
Without any, he does not rely on anyone else.
But there might be differences in skills, for example, if Salman is better than me.
He hears it and says to me: "Don't change a single word here."
Maybe each one can edit for the second
You help a bit
Until actually there is an official entity that supports these activities, or until there is a company, for example, that collaborates.
And among them will be righteous distributors.
It means that even when the work appears like this, it will be elegant and truly give you a formal look.
And Allah knows, we wish for clarity, meaning we wish for support from them, meaning they say, "Our company has built it," and they tell us, "We will deliver, we will produce for you the product."
We don't have any problem, meaning
Sorting out some things is difficult.
Therefore, why are you not considering it as your first idea?
Even one person just gets to know the first CD
Like this, you can attract two partners thereafter.
Year 2007, made CD "Anaa"
She distributed it, God willing, among the youth.
How was Aqbal?
And Allah
Text text for the year two hundred and seven, maybe we'll succeed in the Gulf region with real strength
But it's not possible right now
Well, we were returning to Insulph but we didn't get to see the passion, meaning for example you hear about a big group of young people between Barcelona and Ciaasto, for instance.
Let's talk about it.
They told us that they will organize a party for you.
And it means they covered all costs and procedures, and coordination means transparency, meaning what we expected at that level would be achieved.
It means honesty, and it was a great job.
And there was some pressure, meaning there were no ads, nothing at all, just the concert itself.
What was in the announcements, what was in the show, means before the event Abuyomen
Well, we said meaning there's no one from my family, meaning the event before the announcement, there's no one from my family.
And we're inside, meaning before the event starts
By that I mean a point in our favor here
Actually, what it means is that our voice reaches families, not youth.
Our view is that we expect this idea to be true among the youth.
It means that in this stage we discovered that there is a group, actually more than one group, that we heard from.
In the song "Kuza Ma3in," there was a significant interaction with the audience and the band.
And most of the songs had interaction in them.
I don't mind it, most of the songs, but since the songs were more and we were a larger number
It means the entire group is being misled.
What are those words? What problems are they solving?
We are talking about the situation we are in, but the one we are in is better.
Cook it slowly even if it's in large quantities
Even if they spoke before, I am not them.
Get out, you have to get out, the sentence is random
If that means the rhyme comes out
It means criticism, if we think about it, we write this instead of writing that word; this is better.
Well, we have something, let's check it out.
One of the songs you made
And we will follow up on it, and also take into account the public's opinion on this issue.
And if Allah wills, they will also enjoy such words.
Thank you for including my program's name in the introduction.
With you, KI DI and DJ Mr. Bubo on Doha Morning Show
Good morning, Qod Morningiq Ladies and Gentlemen from
This is key, Mr. Bubo and this is key, it won't be broke
And don't forget the program starts at 7:45 a.m., meaning Friday morning on TV.
With the numbers, Hassan Naima is with us in the nomination Shima Al-Hamadi
With us, the exit Nasser Al-Malki, the show episode Qatar, definitely
Because actually it contains the name of Al, thank you guys, may you be blessed, I am
I'm awake now and I want to inform you that the youth have the upper hand in the control room.
Last night at night it was recorded
And who wrote the words in you or who?
Each one writes his own words.
Because if I go, I'll write words about Yusuf
No, just write these words in here, in love for singing, in love for emotions.
I expect you to write about the 2022 World Cup and the Asian Cup. I think you might actually qualify for it, otherwise not.
We're sure about ourselves, meaning we're definitely going to release a song through this platform.
But if it's to be official or this, then what does that mean?
It's necessary to have songs in Qatari songs about the homeland and love for the homeland.
Through the art of that, the art of rap is correct.
Yes, I expect that today everyone is waiting to
We are seeing live on air right now
By the way, this case reached Zayed streets in Doha.
If our viewers are as we saw Doha getting decorated to welcome the Asian Cup
The concerned authorities have finalized all arrangements to be ready for reception.
The match and the expected attendance will be larger than what we've seen so far.
Before I start, I expect the length of the crust from the beginning to the end
Definitely important for receiving this important regional event
At upcoming events, God willing, I will continue them in the coming days, God willing.
It means that on our side, they said they will hold a party for you.
But until now, things mean there's some complexity involved.
The procedures and this is for sure true
Well, if he tries to mean, for example, I saw Yusuf and I saw Falaan
And I heard from my brother that I have a song posted, and I saw the three of them.
Appropriate for the rights of the wealthy
The possibility that we can sing it
I would be at home.
Then he sent Yusuf's email through the internet.
For you, Yusuf has this part of the song
Also, while working, they travel by land
Inside this field, they have reached the millions of audiences.
We're not trying to copy, but one person hears, meaning the best one.
But it means a strong opponent in his style.
What prevents me from taking ideas from them and imitating them in things?
But it means reverse it, take the idea, change it, and apply it to my songs, secondly.
They worked hard, established a special branch, and ended up with more than a dozen people in it.
Dhath about a person named Abdullah al-Da'il
He has experience and is able to discover groundwater.
It lies in their ability to detect underground water sources.
One of the residents of the city of Mertes
There are many experienced people out there.
To determine water locations before drilling boreholes
And it may require or may drill many wells, and there is no water
Assisted by copper pipes or fig branches
Or the date palm indicates the presence of water sources.
What tools does he use?
The MK MK discover groundwater
This used to be old
But now they have been replaced with copper sheets.
Now, the Al-Qa'ibin are moving together with Bayt al-Hasan in parallel.
And now we walk in slow steps, walking lightly.
We witness what we pass along the course of water.
Then the two Qa'abahs will open
Now, right now we are going through this situation, right now we are going along a watercourse.
It has now opened up in this way
When we start, it begins now.
This is now in the water current
And from and from here the middle becomes
Now we can determine the course of water flow or the underground water flow route this way.
And of course, the process is repeated multiple times at various locations until we find the best location.
Abu Ibrahim confirms
Reaching an advanced stage in this profession
His discoveries would be extremely precise.
In the region, several times and outside several times in Shqra and in Acharmelah and in Athithya
More than forty-five ber have been discovered.
His error was no more than five percent.
You need training, experience, and divine grace from Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala.
Outperforming modern devices and laboratories
In a record short time
Abdulrahman al-Murshid
For Doha Morning Program
City of Maramat, north west of the Saudi capital, Riyadh
We will follow up on this report and assuredly promise you further reports from Arab and international countries.
I hope so, Gulf region
We have now reached our viewers different websites and addresses, but they all have meaning.
The big and first title and waf
If I expect there to be a large group of Gulf youth within the Gulf itself
In certain individuals, they follow them
But for example, it doesn't mean you should simply follow them, but rather that you feel it's necessary to keep track of their actions first and foremost.
And by God, they are the Gulf influencers, generally, among them there is a connection.
So, it means I'm not competing with other competitions, I just released a song.
And speak about the incident
It means she'll be a competitor like you said her goal
Eikon Bina is connected and means just one specific one.
In Saudi Arabia, Qasi did that, may Allah reward him, working in the field
He's really big now, he has a CD, and he has a fan base.
And he had more than such a company possible to adopt
We hope you have reached this stage, and perhaps you will go beyond this stage even more, God willing.
If God wills, we wish you all the success, with God's permission, through this lesson.
It's available, and the reception of this important sports tournament, the Asian Cup, let's see the available clips with the logo.
In addition to a group of Qatari youth
The style might come from the West, but with a Gulf touch.
Waiza emotional songs, rap songs, and a distinguished group of twenty-five people
It is necessary that each one follows your news first and foremost.
Please expect that you will receive an email, a specific website on the internet, or a forum.
And Shalun can reach you
And by God, before that period we had a special website within us.
But if there are issues between him and the company, the company's staffing company.
It meant several times Isker several times didn't know what it was
So, we faced problems with it, and the last thing was we just got rid of this sugar.
Well, there's no doubt about it, the site is drunk, drunk
Well, what's the current alternative until they solve this problem, since they're not even trying.
in the UAE or Saudi Arabia or Bahrain or Oman or even in Morocco or in Egypt
One has to stay in touch with you, know your news, and see the songs you produce between one period and another.
What's the alternative now?
The current alternative relies on personal pages, for example
What exactly is it called?
He is Goufi from Atsouin Serge but in Google
By Al-Rab Qatari or Qatari Rabs
They make advertisement videos even for you
Yesterday, you worked on the program.
We have uploaded more than a video on YouTube
Song and image
Song and the same format as a video but with pictures and text
I expect that we'll see even more progress
They need a place for their devices, but each one has his own device at home.
and the hammer, the computer, the piano, and the guitar
And as for me, I really hope it becomes a good support.
For example, a company means
We produce CDs for you
We will provide you with a dedicated space
From ourselves
But in the end, we're still left with a personal matter.
We don't want this to become a personal job.
And as for my words, they do not differ from the words of Yusuf.
Ad video needed, we need an ad video
And the album
And the spread of the video by Aklib, I think it's very important.
So that information is shared more
So if support is available, then everything is included with it.
Your sweet voices reach every place
It means one of the different arts that deals with problems and resolves issues.
Thank you to Yusuf Al-Nacemi and Salman Al-Abdullah for being with us
And we wish you all the best, naturally, in the name of our program, Qood Le Layyam, for the youth.
These projects were indeed good.
In the Ezza Ezza project, it's almost ready but needs further technical development.
Its history and price
You will receive the cashier's check, along with all the details and ready-to-go.
And recognizing the behavior based on what each part holds and observes its components and their effects
And he's still in Trolly
Icon combines itself, the user can choose the material he wants with the most precision
Of course, most of these projects reflect a child's perception of a problem.
He also has other activities and goals.
The center currently encompasses a set of programs and events based on a central idea.
We have ten objectives established by Her Highness Mozah when founding the Center.
Maybe maybe also
He goes directly down underneath, moving underneath the roof, going down to the train underneath the roof from his house.
But the main idea is that they are clothes
Please show me all the stores in Qatar that sell black T-shirts
Icon in each house, key of the house, key of the car, I have a button, press it
Tell me if I have lost my key, I lost it from me, tell me the right to the key that
Yes, we will return once again to the projects they will carry out, Allah willing, through the Cultural Center.
And early childhood education is a waste of time
and developing his skills and nurturing talents
We move on to what children possess, a set of skills, whether they are journalistic or research-oriented.
If personal skills in speaking to the audience and persuading the audience are considered.
With the diversity of all these skills, a special program has been established to serve them.
We have become known as pioneers of the future, and we have achieved significant progress in this field. Now, we have reached the final stage of our graduation projects.
We have also reached a large number of young child preachers
and their creativity
You have young broadcasters as well.
To return to television means it's essential that they produce children's programs.
We're currently preparing them for television
Through their television, Qatar Television
This means we will together end up at eighteen years.
Welcome to them, wherever they may be, yes.
This also means the National Television
And our need to attract or win over and discover these talents and foster their development
From administrative to research staff
To specific biases in thinking
To the readers, various diverse fields
In such cooperation between you, you take ideas with pride.
In every field, for example, the program "The Promising Preacher" with the Ministry of Endowments
The Quran, our guidance, is the guidance of the generations. Likewise.
The Scientific Society, and its role was significant in developing projects and providing technical support for these projects.
The major role also belongs to the Higher Education Council, as well as supporting schools and their partnerships.
Professor Abdullah, your move to Katar this great monument
The one that also gathers a large set of great events and activities
Is it considered that pushing someone forward means reaching the same central position?
But you are taking a separate building like that.
Far from this great monument
and provided us with a face to interact with the public in a simpler way, meaning
And pioneering projects as well
In many of these dull receptions, they are introduced to the nature of cultural programs that are presented for children.
Because our main project during the next three years will be
It is the national project for promoting reading among children.
Under the supervision of Sheikha Hasea bint Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani
She has supported this project with very great support.
This is a key project aimed at developing children's reading and storytelling skills to enhance their abilities.
The different cultures relating to reading, especially
There are obviously many programs.
That means now we've recently moved over
Badi an nayaa means reorganizing the bazi means the activity
And its design and development should align with the nature of visitors, meaning cater.
We are sure we wish you all the best, Allah willing, through this center.
The one that gathers within its folds very important ideas
Of course, the first thing we would like to thank you for this kind gesture.
The most important thing is that every time we interact with children, we discover more about our own children.
Today's children are not yesterday's children; their childhood is not our childhood.
They need us to give them more attention, focus, and time.
Give him enough listening to his interests and imagination
And I will continue intellectually with them
They work. It means their way of dealing with children is like a hotel that provides them with accommodation.
He is a bank that provides money
He is the one who lacks a child who listens to these ideas, who listens to this fantasy.
And indeed, they transported us through the long days, the Al-Ma'ariz transported us to twenty-three
Through this sermon
We hope for success, Allah willing, for the projects that won awards.
And thank you for joining us, Professor Abdullah Al-Jamili, Director of the Cultural Center for Children. We wish you all the best, God willing.
Indeed, these projects are realized and exist in reality, and are not just dreams over time.
Hello and welcome, our viewers. The Children's Cultural Center concluded its program last Monday evening at the Diplomatic Club.
National Vision Forum for Generations under the theme: "Generations' Dreams – National Reality of the Future"
Which was organized on the occasion of the country's National Day, with the participation of more than seventy children from Qatar.
Al-Mu'arraz witnessed our viewers participating in various activities and competitions.
And innovative projects for children
Generally, on behalf of you, our viewers, we are pleased to welcome Dr. Abdullah Al-Jamili, Director of the Children's Cultural Center, and welcome you and good morning.
Morning of Light, may God bless you, my dear sister.
At the beginning, I would like to thank you for granting us time with the center.
To truly discuss this distinguished hadith is indeed a reality.
We are also glad to have you through the program so we can cover as much as possible of all the events that have taken place through this campaign.
This National Anthem of Generations' Dreams
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Of course this reminder
Contribution of the Centre for Children's Culture
For National Day celebrations
And naturally, he had a strong presence, which was very important with every child.
To enable children
From the moment he lives with a dream
With the project
This project or dream
Children's dreams are vast.
Its scope is wide; we have defined it within the range of twenty to thirty.
And other key areas of Qatar's 2030 Vision
We proceeded by training children in four stages
How do brainstorming techniques and a set of thinking tools expand a child's thinking scope?
What exactly do you mean by that sentence?
They are facts of the nation's tomorrow
In other words, what our children dream about today
And this project grows with this project
This is a truth, meaning it explains this vision: children will start living from this day.
With a big dream
If it is an environmental field or, for example, a field in health and human development, and other fields
Which serves the country
I expect that when we know there are children in a certain place
or in a certain surah
Was all of this created through
The Al-Ma'ariz contained noble and honorable traits.
The honor of the family is their example, so that the children may learn from them as role models.
Yesterday the Arab decline, two weeks or three weeks ago
And among the winners were those who received awards in various awards in the Arab world.
There was a schedule for reviewing their projects
Yes, and the images definitely prove what you said, Professor Abdullah.
This is a collection of photos that were present at the exhibition and various events, of course.
This is also accompanied by the last approved one, accompanied by the absent one.
The innovator or the creative
This is one of the children's inventions, may it be blessed. It's a very nice idea, we could expand it for broader audiences.
And we're telling you, what exactly is this document, the colored football?
Four or five projects came up about this topic, among them was the colored ball.
He is also the smart stadium
This ball, if you look outside the field
It varies; its color changes.
We'll return like this, I expect big things in future matches, God willing.
Well, what does this mean after all these dreams?
As for need, it refers to his concerns.
And I expect, especially when icons have responsibilities, that they take into account for small projects the minds of small people.
But we don't know whether these projects might actually benefit us. Here, the football union president in Qatar.
What do you think about the colored ball idea?
Does love the idea?
Very much appreciated his visit, of course, and he took a look at the projects related to football.
He stood on the street and supported these projects at that moment.
A major figure in the moment and supported these projects
The public has also voiced support for a large number of projects presented by our children.
And our beloved, what projects can we possibly highlight in a big way and get people to support?
Of course, in our committee, there is a method of evaluation, and within that committee, there is a primary evaluation method.
These projects are the ones that won awards, the first, second, and third projects.
It was surprising and won the first prize.
He had very detailed information about the project and the project was ready to start.
It means, besides administrative aspects, we need many administrative elements.
I went into very detailed aspects and distributed brochures to visitors, meaning it was ready for its project.
These are definitely the pictures that we're currently looking at
This is a group. Yes, this is also a group with many projects participating.
Maybe they're just as aware of this, meaning they're not really interested in just sitting and watching films or cartoons.
It is not actually linked; part of it might be realized by institutions adopting it.
For example, we give project names, what projects are these?
How is this Zaydah used? How is the house arranged, gathered, and reused?
Forty-seven students
Qatar University celebrated the graduation of 47 students from its 33rd batch yesterday.
And Dr. Khalid Bin Mohammed Al-Atiyah, Minister of Foreign Cooperation, expanded...

From his work in the series of the artist Abdulhameed Al-Sharshani
Who emphasized his presence through various actions, including the series "Hearts for Rent"
And they struggled to prove themselves on the artistic stage.
In the field of art, there is no favoritism.

which is 170 kilometers north of the capital, Riyadh
It was said that his lineage traced back to Amr al-Qays al-Tamimi.
It excelled in its effects, pure water, and sweet air.
Poets sang about it, were enchanted by it, and its fame is linked to its well-known mountain, Kumit.
It is said, "Ghadir is a measure"
Of course, city of markets, city of footprints.
And Islam had previously appeared.
There were old things whose history was unknown, such as the well of Khalid ibn al-Walid.
Which is where we are currently present
The noble companion Khalid ibn al-Walid, may Allah be pleased with him, ordered at the time of passing through the battle of al-Radha at this al-Bir.
And it has remained up to this day
The saying goes: "Secure me, and I will secure you."
Once you see how much fun you have, you'll realize it.

Among its most notable features is the Well of al-Walid.
Because it was revealed during several days of the battles of al-Rahd, directed towards Yamamah.
He went into the military and ordered men to dig this well.
which still has its water drawn from it to this day and people take a bath from it
And al-Jayyūs al-Hamawī, in his dictionary of countries, mentioned that Khalda passed by repeatedly.
It is an old mud house that has been restored to its original state.
It contains several sections that highlight the architectural character of the area and its renowned heritage and archaeological remains.
The poet said: "When we arrived at water, it was water purified."
Ghadir Kamit la Ghadir al-Anjel
Professor Amin also, by God's will, means cooperation between the family, the guardian, and the guardian with this center, as well as with the child.
And I expect there might be different ways he could join you early on.
The general training process approach

We ask her math questions and different questions
We're going to take a short break and then continue with you. After that, we'll see how this smart kid interacts with us.
Now the public artist's director has become wise.
It means any action performed from the first three seconds, the action is considered done, but remote control is still available.
What made him tired out with twenty thousand other series
Verified twenty thousand series are correct
The Sunnah series means, and for some people, they focus on one action.
Can I see the second tasks?
What is it exactly?

What are the things you provide for our children and our daughters?
It was clarified with Professor Aymen and Professor Nesmah, especially Kobra's contribution to children, our children.
And it is a program for mental math skills
By needle and by abax
To achieve some specific goals, we tried to simplify part of them.
I felt Professor Ibrahim sensed there was indeed a difference. The student, as soon as he entered, on the first two days...
And after he has completed months with you, perhaps three or four months.
If he were studying in public or private or even independent schools
Basically, the program is scientifically not feasible through certain methods.
After one level of the program has passed
The document clarifies where the child lost or failed to develop his abilities.
And it has reached a certain point, or what the developments have become with the child.
And we are a machine following a scientific method, a scientific program.
Not only some methods or mechanisms are applied routinely
in a scientific, organized manner
Before the program starts and after having gone through this cycle or level
Professor Ibrahim Al-En is a founder of this center, just like what we see from our viewers, a student among the female students who joined this center.
We really liked this thing happening today on our own terms so we can show our viewers the importance of this moment.
I don't have any objection
If this is a short clip, it's a simple scene from a series that will feature in the second season.
But since we have just seen this clip from the first season of the series
Chat with me about the episodes of your series, where each episode has a different theme.
The year focused on who is going to

This was the reason.
Diet alij that one series and all Qatari artists working in it
And the one, even if he has a scene, I say, Praise be to God
Thank God for all circumstances
Well, let's go back to the beginning of your story.
I would like to express to him a great thanks, of course.
Consult her about various things
Of course, the artist Abdulaziz Jassim from among humans until the last day, until after the dispersion, yes or no.
In our theatrical works, we have collaborated with the stage, when our first produced work, directed by Abdulaziz Jassim, we worked with them as a theater and television company.
He is the one who built us, He is the one who taught us, and He is the one who guided us.
Of course, after Professor Ghannam in Suwal Dnya, what was limited with us in Faiz Tosh Fen
Because honesty has given us opportunities, we young people have.
They have between thirty to thirty-two working days in the year.
We have two projects this year. Thank you. Thank you. Tera.
A cheesy feeling, of course, from Tara's artistic production
The Series Director, Professor Manir Al-Zubaidi
We're back with our viewers, and today we're talking about reflective medicine.
The palm technique, palm of the hand
This treatment is actually practiced since ancient times.
We dined with our guest
The inspection method is as follows
Inflamed period of Germany
A sensation inside the hand, sometimes a gritty feeling, like the sensation of broken blood vessels inside the hand.

This is a nerve day when you had a nerve in it
For ten years I walked barefoot on the sea
Well, we know that when someone walks on the sea, I expect them to spill lies.
A non-uniform surface is not only the sea
Negative capacities might be the plates
He might be surprised that you discovered these things through massage.
Surely the most important people are children
Children, glory be to God, mother, focus with me
His tiredness comes from milk and the food he consumes.
Her child approached her and took her, the child's name is Tomatic
Your sugar
Press lightly, Glory be to God
You'll notice after a few seconds, the child first starts to widen, then cries out due to the pain here.
Then suddenly, glory be to God, I see the gases coming out.
What are the discoveries you've made, Professor Abdulaziz?
But less than the second problems are joints and bones, headaches, back pain and obesity
Secondly, regarding menstrual cycle or period, or menstruation in general
Focus on a stone or on your legs, or simply press here and say "Subhanallah" below the navel, and problems with your menstrual cycle if you have any.

Pregnant woman
Pregnancy becomes easier for her.
But here or here, of course, or Allah knows best
If you tell them that indeed, in the seventh or in the ninth month, you're going to give birth.

Seven moist moistened afflatuses
And if you put a little date syrup, it will be enough, Allah willing.
As Allah says: "I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan." The discovery of this in the Quran, of course.
It means Allah has not made this moist date grow, and He has not failed.
Lord, praise belongs to You, and I seek refuge in Allah from the words of Allah.
Shakir answers, "Kor answers a small one"
The bed is the place of childbirth, and for example, you go to the bed and grab the iron.

Salim, Professor Abdulaziz, thank you for this pleasant meeting. Of course, thank you to our guest who is with us.
May Allah grant you good health, Allah willing, and may you succeed, O Lord.
We will talk in more detail about it, Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad al-Thani, Director of the General Health Administration at the Supreme Health Council.
Good morning, Sheikh
Let's go straight to it; let's look at these events.
The Truth: A Healthy Steps Program Towards Qatar
It means it is a program that constitutes one part of the national strategy for addressing and combating obesity.
It means four countries from the ten in the world have the highest GDP, and they are Gulf countries.
And we have started at the Higher Health Council a strategy, naturally in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and Training and other agencies to combat obesity.
Fearing its spread more and more, soon it will happen.
And one of the programs for protecting against obesity is healthy steps towards Qatar
Let's work on this competition together so it becomes an international competition.
Of course, the program is six weeks.
Every week is different from the next week
To educate seventh and eighth grade students about the importance of health during this age.
In the beginning of life, they become aware of themselves, meaning they recognize themselves.
And in the first week, as you remember, it was about what your favorite game was.
Week 2: Walking
You have to walk, meaning obviously every time someone walks, they gain points.
It's a map of Qatar, and every time someone earns points, they move forward in school, taking steps forward and progressing to the next grade.
There will be a sweet opponent, meaning among the students.
In the third week, he drinks Manbih water, he drinks carbonated water.
We say he gets used to drinking soda water a lot every time he gets thirsty, he takes soda water, I don't drink water.
Next, in week four, your favorite sport
Some of the games at school are what he likes.
And we're playing his sports game, which he loves.
So we force him to mean that he means he practices sports
The boy eats a healthy meal.
And his family knows he has to watch over his children so they eat a healthy meal.
And the Al-Jazira Academy is an academy for boys and girls so that we can take them.
Of course, may God will it, this is exactly how it will succeed, I hope, we will gain experience in the coming years.
Of course, the students are not aware of their feelings and say our activities are more.
We enjoyed the games more than we enjoyed spending time with our colleagues.
Girls, our skin tells you acne has improved.
Indeed, indeed exactly, for he will become conscious.
Fathers know about their children
And with their peers in the second rows, he says, "My brothers, meaning, they learn from them and their peers and brothers."
And thanks to God, the news is spreading that there are many enthusiastic schools which will participate next year, of course, starting from now.
God willing
Of course, the official supporter was Kuitel in supporting this.
We had an Esper zone that organized sports competitions for students and awareness.
Al al al 3ala ta2olh al ta2am means
And praise be to God, there are several departments, meaning among them, meaning I mentioned this, and later on, I might have missed it.
But praise be to God, everyone participated in part of what was with him
Some of them, some of the brothers, used to organize competitions on Saturdays.
And therein was variety.
We tried to create several types and include as many people as possible.
He is the future generation, meaning
Until this experience or its spread reaches the widest possible extent in Qatar
Well, the first time you evaluate it, there will be some things you have to adjust.
Now that it has spread, praise God, the harmful results have emerged.
If God wills, we will publish it because currently people are demanding, saying "Why didn't you include us?"
Stop eating, eating healthy to achieve this, you don't have a problem
We observed throughout his life, from his early years, how he began to develop, when he was twenty or twenty-five years old.
Your side mentioned a set of titles each week that had a title
If we go back, we'll try to make our today's segment about the closing of the events.
Also, when we return to remember the people, in our program there were more than just guest appearances.
Let's go back, let's restart, every week what was the information we wanted to share with the students?
If God wills, my brother, the first thing, of course, for example, in the first week, the favorite fruit
Of course, fruits as a whole, what are their benefits?
What's the benefit of fruits that contain vitamin C?
He himself starts to realize what he likes in fruits, not all fruits are his enemies.
It means he could have a sensitivity of one type or two types, but why don't the rest eat them?
Week two: People think walking is just for the elderly, why do the young walk?
It means that when I grow up, I will walk.
On the contrary, you walk because she guides the mind and the brain, meaning.
And when a person walks, calming their mind, their mental clarity improves, meaning
You were leading them to walk to the students
No, they are not all required to walk, whether at school or at home.
and they record their points through grade schools
Because they are not daily, meaning not every day
And this had an event where people were following the girls' school journey together.
See, we are the ones who are creative, meaning we have innovative ideas.
The spirit of competition and teachers come up with new ideas; we give them ideas, and what comes out of them.
Each one had his own skills in this aspect.
Of course, in the third week, drink water, obviously throughout the time we try to drink it so we don't get thirsty and prefer to take carbonated water.
Of course, Week Four your favorite sport
If we manage to reach his favorite field and support him there
He is a sports enthusiast in Riyadh
Their love for sports is that he is a player, a person who plays sports without feeling anything.
Since we discussed it before we start talking about the Qatar relationship for spinal cord disease patients
Let me welcome our guest for today's episode and our studio.
Hello and welcome to you
May God bless you with us in this program
Among them is this disease, perhaps many of us have never heard of it.
At the beginning, as the Egyptians say, "I'm not interested in the topic."
This is a chronic disease
Affects the human body's nervous system
Affects the interval of twenty to forty years
This disease also has no known treatment to date and no known cause for this disease and its occurrence.
The active group in society, which is the youth group, is usually affected.
Treatments used for cancer patients keep you away from evil and other diseases
This disease is characterized by inflammation of the brain nerves and spinal cord nerves.
and it is the central nervous system in the human body
The body feels that there is a body nearby having a body.
The nervous system consists of
Will this electrical cable cover the area?
White blood cells are the first white blood cells to attack or dissolve the protective layer.
Which leads to the failure to transmit the neural signal or a weak or impaired signal.
Leads to a state of separation from you
So far, with the advancement of medicine, progress in medicine means Professor Abdulaziz, so far we have not found a solution for this disease.
Well, besides the solution, we need to find out how we end up here, meaning.
Also, one must have a preventive measure from this issue.
The direct cause means the nature of life, the nature of food, cycles of life
And what is the exact direct cause that makes a human being susceptible to this disease?
Everything that exists currently is just theories.
Even by marriage
They are trying to solve the health problems that humans face.
Yes yes
All of these topics might mean they somewhat provoke debate within society.
So far, we don't know the reasons behind it.
Well, the age group that can get affected by this disease is obviously neurological sclerosis.
Of both sexes
Of course, the disease, after reaching forty years, begins to show itself in quietness with the person.
But so far, we haven't found a solution to this disease.
Does this mean there is actual evidence of many people being in the Gulf, or in the Arab world, or even in Qatar?
In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, statistics indicate that there are 25,000 infected cases.
And Qatar means
Personally, I've been made aware of three out of four very distinct cases recently, only within the past week.
Currently, we have 25 patients. This is recorded in the files.
And in it, many people who are diagnosed with this disease travel to other countries for treatment, for example.
Well, Professor Abdulaziz, is there some traces, for example, of a person who got sick with this disease?
Are there any signs that indicate to the family of this patient or to the patient personally that I am suffering from multiple sclerosis?
For example, this virus appears to be wiping out
Hey, let's be honest, this is a malware virus.
Because nervous system diseases control the entire body
Well, maybe we should go somewhere or give a specific reason for a specific place, because God made eating natural and God made drinking natural.
