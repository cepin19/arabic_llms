Chapter: Is the choice of the kingdom of the heavens?
And he said to them, "Who do you say that I am?" Luke 22:24
And he gives Jesus one of the children, and places him in the middle of them.
And indeed, We have granted you the truth: except what you have changed and what you have taken as your own, like the small children. As for your life, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Mark
The one who humbles himself in this way, like Walid, is the one who will be chosen, ruler of the heavens.
The one who welcomed Polid in this condition, his name is the one who welcomes me.
The one who got caught in the cataracts is one of these small ones who are safe with him; that's why they have a large stone around their neck like a crocodile's and they are thrown into the sea.
Oh well, people of this world, what kind of things they get into in the dark! They must end up in such situations, but oh well, these very things that cause them!
And if not your hand nor your foot will save you from the abyss, they will cut you off and cast you into it, for goodness' sake, enter eternal life with one hand or one foot, and let there be neither pair of hands nor pair of feet with you, and you will be cast into eternal punishment. When?
Otherwise, your eye will cause you to fall into the pits, and it will hurl itself upon you. You will not enter eternal life with one eye only, nor will you have both eyes and be cast into the fire of hell. Matthew 5:29 The Wicked Ox
Among you is a child from these little ones, so that we may say to you: "The angels with them in the heavens are always with those in the heavens."
"The path of man's birth saves those who perish." # 18.11 This verse is not found in the early manuscripts.

Otherwise, how could he hear? You have only one witness, or will you make every word of this testimony depend on the witness, or on the three witnesses?
Otherwise, they will not listen to me, and they will not listen to the people of the Church; they will consider me as one of those who worships idols or who does not pay taxes.
For God's sake: What is bound on earth will be bound in heaven, and what is loosed on earth will be loosed in heaven. Matthew 16:19; John 20:23
And we will say to you once more: except that you agree with the people among you on Earth that they will demand something from you, it will surely be fulfilled from what is in the heavens.
While none of you gathered together, I was among them. The one who was not present.
And Peter came near to Jesus and said: "Lord! How many times shall I forgive my brother or sister sins? Up to seven times?" Luke
And Jesus said to him: "Not only seventy times seven, but seventy times seven."
On this day, it is like a kingdom of heavens, one king accounting with his slaves,
And it began to appear that they would be held accountable, Jabu had a debt of millions of silver dirhams against him,
He was warned not to return, ordered to follow him and his wife, his children, and everything he had, and to remain faithful to the religion he was upon.
And the servant prostrated himself before him and said: "Patience, O my master, and do not let your anger rise against me."
And she was unfaithful to him, and he divorced her, and allowed her to live with her religion.
And Malik took that slave out, and met one of the slaves who was with him, who had taken a hundred dirhams' worth of silver, and he beat him and hanged him, saying: "Return to me what you took!"
And his companion fell at his feet, asking him: "Wait, and I will return to you the thing that is upon me."
But what if he does not, and if he is imprisoned until the religion upon which it is based is restored.
And Mili saw the slaves among their companions, their hatred was great and they spread news of their women to the people of Dakhsha who were involved.
He gives him to his master and says to him: "This slave is one who doesn't even deserve it! You have granted me your entire religion, and I am not even worthy of it!"
Ewa, alaash net ma rahmati-sha al-Abd sahabik kamā rahmatika anā?
And her mother worries, and she locks him up so they can arrest him until he recites what's on his head.
The path is open to you all in the sky, except what each of you has permitted to his own heart from his very soul.
The chapter Jesus teaches about divorce

And it was followed by an abundance of human groups, and they were seen.
And Qurbu cursed the Pharisees and said to them: "What is halal for a man to release his wife for the first time, as was the cause?"
And he replies to them, saying: "What you have not read in the Book of God, Allah created Adam from the clay, and He shaped him."
And they said: "This man has made the people disbelieve and has led them astray, and he has brought them into a single group."
And that's how they concealed it, but Giulio had the unit. What God gathered, no one can separate."
And the Freycinet: "And why did Moses command that a man should give his wife a divorce document, allowing her to be released?" When?
And Jesus answered them: "The way of hardness of your hearts has allowed Moses to release your children, but God's law, which was given to Adam and Eve, has not permitted it."
Rani said to them: "He who has once committed adultery and then married another, will be in a state of corruption." Matthew 5:32; 1 Corinthians 7:10, 11
And the man said to his wife: "Otherwise, Hadi would have been the case of a man with a woman, better that he does not marry at all."
And Jesus replied to them: "No one can accept this message except those upon whom God has already put it."
For those who are born of crookedness, they do not have the ability to marry, and there are those who reject them. And there are those who do not marry before the kingdom of heaven. Those who can understand this will understand it. Jesus blessed the little children.
And Jabu brought the people young children to place their hands on them and claim them, and the teachers were angry at Jabu.
But Jesus said to them: "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
And he placed his hands on them and left. The young man dressed in
And the young man said to him: "Teacher, which of these works can we do to have eternal life?"
And Jesus answered him, "How can you say that I have shown you the way to life? God alone is the source of life. Unless you enter through my teachings, you will not enter into eternal life."
He asked him, "What commandments?" And Jesus replied, "You shall not kill, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness,"
Tahla Fback and Mek, and tell me what's near you how you wrote your head».
He tells the young man: "I have followed all the traditions, so what about the remaining private ones?"
And Jesus answered him, "Unless your will be perfect, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. Sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; come, follow me!"
But Milai heard the young man's words and walked away, sad, as he was dressed in a heavy garment.
And Jesus said to his disciples: "Verily I say unto you, it is hard for a person to enter the kingdom of heaven without suffering."
And we add to them: "The entry of the camel from Ain el-Beida is easy for those who wear the garments of the Kingdom of God!"
And they were amazed at the teacher, overwhelmed by this speech and exclaimed: "Given this calculation, how can we survive?"
And Jesus saw them and said to them: "People cannot believe in me, but God can do everything."
And Peter and James replied: "Let's go, and let's follow you; will not our reward be great?"
And Jesus said to them: "Truly, I say to you: at the time when all things were new, I will send my messenger to the people of Israel, so that they may sit on thrones judging the tribes of Israel. When?"
And whoever permitted Fadiourah, or his wife, or his daughters, or Bah, or Mah, or his children, or his lands, in the name of this, will be granted the same reward as those who permitted it a hundred times, and will attain eternal life with Allah.
A great many of those who were seated at the right were made to sit at the left, and a great many of those who were seated at the left were made to sit at the right. Matthew 20:16; Luke 13:30
Chapter Twenty: The Metals of the Servers in the Grape Garden
"The path of the kingdom of heavens is like a single man on earth, having grapes in his garden. At dawn, he went out to hire servants for his garden."
And they had a dinar for the day and a share in the Gardens.
Jawah al-Tasoud left home in the morning and met three servants standing in the market with no service.
He tells them: "We will surely attain the Gardens for you, and we will surely deliver you from what you have been enduring."
And he went out. He left again at noon, and then left again at three in the afternoon, and added three more servants.
And once, during the evening, he left the five rooms, and encountered two servants standing there, waiting for them: "Why are you standing here all day without serving?"
And he replied: "Even until the point where we served him." And he said to them: "We will surely reach Paradise."
And at evening, the Garden of Paradise was revealed to him: he saw all the servants and granted them their release, beginning from the last until reaching the first.
And they took from the five at midday, and each of them took a dinar.
And Mili Jao the Lulins, their account is not enough to cover their debts, but even they are not given dinars per person.
And Mili had been freed, they began to see the king's palace,
And Waki'goloo said: "The two of you have served us for one hour only, while we, the ones who remained serving all day under the sun, are the true servants."
He is answering the king's only son among them, saying: "I didn't take anything from your companions, did I? Did we agree together on a dinar?"
Ewa took your side and will treat you fairly! And the one who came last, it was me who wanted to give him your treatment.
"Shall I, who have no right to act, behave as I wish? Or shall I be treated as a guest while I am the one who is generous?"
And Jesus said: "The two will be one, and the one will be two." Matthew 19:30; Mark 10:31; Luke 13:30. Jesus prophesied for the third time about his death and resurrection.
And Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. He separated the disciple Thomas from the others and took him aside along the way:
"Here we are going to Jerusalem, and see something outrageous: handing over a human child to the heads of religious leaders and scholars of the Sharia, and you have decided on death for him."
And Gad will deliver him to the people, so that they may know the God whom you have offended, and they will beat him and crucify him. On the third day, Gad will follow him to death." Amos and John asked Jesus about his children.
Johanna and the children of Zabdi are with Jesus, and their prayers and requests are that He fulfill one of their needs.
And he said to him: "What do you want?" And he replied: "I want you to take my son and go to your father's house, one to your left and one to your right in your kingdom."
And he replied to Jesus: "You collect what you don't even know about, and how can you drink from the cup that we are about to drink from?" And he said: "How can we?"
And they said to them: "Yes, certainly, we will drink it, but the women of my family and my sisters will not drink it, because nothing will be given to them except what you have found for them."
And Milu heard the ten disciples speak about this matter, and they were greatly disturbed about Jacob and John.
Jesus and the disciples said to them: "You know that the heads of the communities will rule over them, and the major officials will impose authority over each one under them. Luke
And we have not sent down anything that would be specific to you. But those who would be great among you, especially those who take care of your servants. When?
The one who wants to be the leader among you, especially concerning the servant of yours.
And man is born not to serve people, but to serve and benefit people with his life." Jesus healed the blind
And at that time, when they were leaving from Acre, Jesus had a large crowd following Him.
And they saw Jesus standing by the road, and did not hear him speak for a long time, and they began to go away and to turn aside: "Our Lord, our Savior, Son of David!"
And Wahak, they made the people stay silent, adding: "Rahman, my Lord, son of David!"
And Jesus stood up and addressed them, saying: "Ash, begotten of me, do not let me be for you!"
And he replied: "We have closed our eyes, sir!"
And Jesus looked upon them, and touched their eyes, and immediately they saw and followed Him.
Chapter twenty-one Jesus then enters Jerusalem
And they went near to Jerusalem and arrived at the village of Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two of his disciples:
And they said to them: "There is a man suffering from dizziness in front of you, and there is a female donkey tied up with a male wild boar, and they have taken them both."
Otherwise, why should they have one need, when God has provided for them, and for others, too?
And this will all come true to fulfill the words of the Prophet who said:
"Look at the daughter of Zion: There is your king coming to you, humble, riding on a donkey, and a colt on a donkey."
And the disciples went to the place where Jesus had commanded them.
And the donkey and the ass were loaded with their burdens, and Jesus sat upon them.
They provided a large group of people with their needs on the road, and they cut off others from the tree thrones and led them onto the road.
And the groups of people who came before Jesus and followed him, like Caiaphas and Caiaphas: "Praise # 21:9 Praise. Literally: We have appointed for the son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Praise to God in the highest!"
And Milah entered Jerusalem, and all the inhabitants of the city were present, and they said to him: "What is this?"
And the groups of people replied: "This is Jesus, the Prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus was walking along the marketplaces and streets of Beit El.
And Jesus went into the temple and drove out those who were buying and selling, turning over the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling doves.
And they said to them: "You will write in the Book of God that it is the House of Prayer, but we will return it to the Sharafa!"
And he said to them, "O people of the house of God, you are a people of two kinds and of a mixed origin, and I have healed them."
But the leaders of the religion and the scholars of the law were greatly disturbed by the miracles performed by Jesus, and they heard the children singing in the house of God and praising him: "Blessed is the son of David!"
And Jesus said to them: "Have you never read in the Book of God: 'From the lips of infants and from the breasts of nursing mothers, the praise of God comes forth'?"
And after that they parted and went out of the city to the house of Cyana, and stayed there. Jesus went to the vineyard.
And by morning, Maali had returned to the city, hungry.
And he saw one fig tree by the roadside, and went to it, and found nothing but leaves, no fruit. Then Jesus said to him, "May the fig tree never bear fruit again!" And that very hour the fig tree withered.
And Mili saw the teacher who had been there, he was amazed and asked: "How come the date palm was cut down?"
And Jesus answered them, "Truly I say to you: unless you have faith, you will not receive anything. You have not received anything except what I have given you. But even if you had the mountain of the mountain moved and the sea overturned, you would not have received it. When?"
And you have taken what you need for prayer through faith. Who gave Jesus authority?
And Jesus went into the house of God to learn there, and he met the leaders of the religion and the elders of the people, and he said to them: "From what authority do you exercise this power? And who gave it to you?"
And Jesus answered them and said to them: "Even I will ask you one question, and if you do not answer me, I will not give you any power from the kingdom of heaven:"
Where did John's baptism come from? Was it from God or from men? They discussed among themselves and said: "Only we received it from God; otherwise He would have said to us: Why did you not believe in John?"
Otherwise, we have come from people, and we fear the people, because they think John is a prophet.
And they answered Jesus and said: "We do not know." And Jesus said to them: "Even I do not have power over this man to deliver him to you." The father of the boy
"Ahsh said to them: 'One of the men had a goat with the kids, and he went to the well and filled it: 'I will go to the well and bring water for my children today.'"
And he replied to his son and to the young man: I do not want it. But he regretted it and went.
And Bu went to the second child and asked him as he had asked the first. He replied and said: "Brother, sir! But not yet."
"Who is the woman who anointed the head of the man named Marad Baah?" They said to him: "The woman." And Jesus said to them: "Tell me the truth: the poor and the corrupt will precede you into the kingdom of God."
John follows after him # 21.32 Here John the Baptist is meant. "Come, follow my path and believe in it, but only those who were willing to pay the tax and accept the corruption believed in him. Even after seeing him, they did not repent and did not believe in him." Luke 3:12; 7:29, 30. The wine of the garden and the gardens of the grapevine
"Heard one metal another: This man, the landowner, planted vineyards and built a wall around them, dug a cistern, and built a tower; he hated vineyards and left."
And when the time came for harvesting the grapes, he sent his slaves to the vineyards to collect the harvest.
They threw stones at the women, beat the slaves, killed one, and stoned another with stones.
And Sa'if 'Abid al-Khurin more than the Lulun, and they showed them the way to the Khurin.
And for the father, he taught them and his son, saying: "Respect your son."
But Mili saw the Garden of Eden and the son of the Garden: This is the one who will bring the fruit! Yahweh, let us kill him and take his fruit!
And they raised him up and threw him out onto the land of the grapes of the garden, and they killed him.
Ewa, except Jamul of the Garden of the Grapes, Ashno special manages the Garden of the Grapes?
And they replied to him: "The corrupters will be punished, and their reward will be the Garden of Paradise, which will be given to them as a garden of grapes, not as a garden of grapes that will be above them."
And Jesus said to them: "How long will you remain without reading the book of God? The house that was not built with stones is not a house of God! This is from the Lord, and it is wonderful among us!"
On this day, the kingdom of God will be taken from your hands and given to a people who will give it its full measure.
The one who fell on this room will surely be crushed, and the one on whom the room fell will be shattered.
And when they heard the leaders of the religious scholars and the Frères, they understood that they were speaking about them.
And they would not believe how it was done, but they were afraid of the people's groups who might think them a prophet.
Chapter Twenty-One: The Metals of the Wedding Ceremony
And Jesus again began to teach them, standing with the crowd of people, and said:
"Like my kingdom, the kingdom of heaven, belongs to one king, the king of the wedding for his son."
His slaves give to the bidders, but they don't want to receive.
And Sufet abducted two children and took them away: "To the ones who are presented: I found the wedding, I destroyed the camels and the male goats, and everything else is gone, I will go to the wedding!"
But they are not the ones who are involved; it's those who went to the market, and those who walked around selling and buying.
And two others among those present, they made the slaves of him and took them and killed them.
And the king is worried, his military officers are in fear, and they have lost this battle, and their city has been burned.
And he tells his slaves: The wedding is here, but what we showed them is not what they wanted.
Eiva Siro Daba Loven Kitekawa the two paths and showed them to each one he met at the wedding.
And the slaves going to the two roads, gathering those who met them, neither the deceitful nor the losers, even the wedding house's hospitality.
And the king came in to see the hospitality, because there was one man among the guests who wasn't wearing wedding attire
He said to him: "Why did you come here without your wedding clothes?" The man remained silent as he had nothing to say.
And he said to the servants: Lift up his shoulders and his legs, and place him on the bed of the valley, so that he may become a burden and the suffering of the nation may be relieved. When?
While the tax burden is heavy, those who choose to bear it lightly. The tax relief for the Emperor
And the Pharisees saw that Jesus was speaking to them and thought that He had made a mistake in what He said.
And they are spending their time with the Herodians, and they are saying to him: "Sir, we know that you are honest, and that you teach the way of God with truth, and you do not follow party lines, since you do not act as they do."
Ewa, did you see Lin a shah? Is it legal to pay the tax to the Emperor or not?"
And Jesus knew their hypocrisy and condemned them: "Why do you mock me, the hypocrites?"
"Give me the money so we can pay the tax!" He took the dinar.
And say to them: "Did Hud guide, and did the scribes guide the wealth of any people?"
Qa2il lih: "Dial Qaysir!" and he said to them: "Ewa lih dial Qaysir, Qaysir gave it to Qaysir, and the one dial Allah, Allah gave it to Allah!"
And Milly heard them, they were amazed, and she was left and went away. The question about the dead's sale
Your delegation today, Jacob, with Jesus, two of the Sadducees who believed in raising the dead, asked: "The works"
"O Saadi, Waghal Mousi: No one died, not even a man, except for my brother who married his wife so he could raise his children on his mother's name."
We had seven women from the Khout family; Lul married one of them and she died, and she had no children, so he later married her again.
And this happened again and again, until the seventh.
And after their death, the woman died too.
Ewa Shkon, the seven men who would become the man of this woman on that day? For all of them were men of hers.
And Jesus answered them and said: "You have fallen away, because you know neither the Word of God nor the power of God."
On the Day of Judgment, people will not be given a choice, nor will they be allowed to choose, but they will be like the angels in heaven.
As for the sale of the dead, what you have not heard from God's words to you is:
Am I God, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living."
And when the groups of people heard this speech, they were amazed at its education. The great commandment
And Maliki reported to the Frisians the news that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, who gathered together with their companions.
And one of them was a scholar of the law, and Jesus tested him with this question:
"O my master, what is the major bequest in the Shariah?"
And Jesus answered and said to him: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind."
Hadi is the great pledge and the successor.
The second inheritance in its condition: it seeks what is near to you as you would seek your head.
And on this matter of the traditions, the entire law and the books of the prophets are based. Luke 10:25-28 Christ and the prophet David
And the Samaritans were gathered together, with Jesus and the Galileans:
"Who is the Christ? From whom was he born?" And he answered: "From David!"
He tells them: "How did David, by the Spirit of God, command his Lord, 'My God, deliver me'?"
Say: "O my Lord, increase me in strength, that I may be able to fight against the people of Yemen under your feet."
"Ewa, except David, who said to Christ, 'My Lord,' how could Christ be the son of God?"
And no one even replied to him with a word, nor did anyone during that day think of asking him questions.
Chapter twenty-three Jesus warns his disciples against the scribes and the Pharisees
And Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples,
And they say: "The Alima and the Freycinetians are the ones who have the right to interpret the law of Moses,"
Ewa, the ones who have been given to you, follow them and join them, but you do not make them effective, because you do not give them the power that was given to them.
They will heap hardships upon you and burden people's shoulders, but they will not move until someone strikes them together.
Otherwise, they would create a situation where people wouldn't see them, and gangs would expand within them and their neighborhoods, and prolong their suffering.

O welcome, the scholars, the hypocrites, the hypocritical friars! You are spreading on mint, basil, and camomile, and you leave behind the important matters of the Sharia, which is truth, mercy, and faith.

O these ordinary officials! Record as a purification from the law, but as a sentence.

And Jesus and the crowd answered them: "Return with all your might, and you will be wronged!"
He said to many people and took my name and proclaimed: "I am Christ!" and caused many people to stumble.
And through that path, you'll hear about the war and news of the war. Then you'll take off! This situation has to happen, but this one won't be the last in this age.
