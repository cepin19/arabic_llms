As for the birth of Jesus the Messiah, it was like this: when Mary, his mother, was engaged to Joseph, before they had come together, she received the Holy Spirit.
Joseph was her husband, as he was, and did not wish to make her known; he intended to release her secretly.
But as he pondered these matters, the Lord's angel appeared to him in a dream and said: "O Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife. For the one who conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
And she bore a son and named him Jesus, for He will deliver His people from their sins.
All of this was to fulfill what God said to the Prophet, who said:
Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel," which means "God with us."
And when Joseph awoke from his sleep, he did exactly as the angel of God had commanded him, and took his wife.
And she did not know it until she gave birth to her firstborn son. She named him Jesus.
Zi'arat the Zoroastrians
And when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the king, magi from the east came to Jerusalem
They said: "Where is the Messiah, the king of the Jews? Indeed, we saw his star in the east, and we came to prostrate ourselves before him."
When Herod the king heard this, he was greatly disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
And gathering all the priests and scribes, he asked them: "Where is the Messiah born?"
They said to him, "In the Judean town of Bethlehem, for thus it is written in the prophet:"
And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are not the smallest among the rulers of Judah, for from you shall come one who will shepherd my people Israel.
At that time, Herod called the magi secretly and questioned them as to the time of the star that had appeared.
Then he sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and carefully investigate the child. And when you have found him, tell me so that I too may go and prostrate myself before him."
When they heard from the king, they went. And the star that he had seen in the east went before them until it came and stood above, where the child was.
When they saw the star, they were exceedingly joyful.
And they came to the house and saw the boy with Mary, his mother. They were filled with awe and prostrated themselves before him. Then they opened their treasures and offered him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
Then, when they were told in a dream not to return to Herod, they took a different route to Cœlestus. Flight to Egypt
And after they had departed, the angel of God appeared to Joseph in a dream and said: "Rise, take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod intends to search for the child in order to destroy him."
Then he rose, took the boy and his mother at night, and went to Egypt.
And this occurred until the death of Herod. So that what the Lord said through the prophet who said: "I called my son from Egypt."
At that time, when Herod saw that the magi had mocked him, he was extremely angry. So he sent orders and killed all the boys in Bethlehem and in its surrounding areas, those two years old and under, according to the time calculated by the magi.
At that time, what was said about Jeremiah, the prophet who said:
"A cry was heard in Ramah—Noah wept bitterly. Rachel wept over her children and would not mourn, for they were no longer alive." Return to Nablus
When Herod died, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream in Egypt.
Saying: "Get up, take the boy and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the boy have died."
Then he rose, took the boy and his mother, and went to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus held rule over the Jews instead of Herod his father, he feared to go there. And when a dream was given to him, he withdrew to the regions of Galilee.
And he came and settled in a city called Nasserah, so that what was said about the prophets might be fulfilled: "He will be called Nasserah."
John the Baptist prepares the way
At that time John the Baptist came preaching in the Judean wilderness.
Say: "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near."
This is what was said about Isaiah, the prophet, who said: "A cry was heard in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord! Make his paths straight.'"
And John wore a garment made of camel's hair, and a belt of leather around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
At that time, Jerusalem and all the Jews and the surrounding nations around the Jordan came out to him.
And they relied upon him in Jordan, acknowledging their sins.
When many of the Friscians and the Sadoquines came to his ordination, he said to them: "You children of vipers, from whom will you flee when the anger comes?"
Then make good deeds worthy of repentance.
Do not think in your hearts, "We have Abraham as our father." For indeed, I say to you, Allah is able to produce offspring for Abraham from these stones.
And now you have placed the axe on the tree's root; every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water for repentance; but he who comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
The one whose seat is in his hand, who will wipe with his hand, and gather his wheat into the storehouse; but the chaff he will burn with fire that never goes out. The Lordship of Jesus Christ
At that time Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John to be baptized by him.
But John stopped him and said: "I need to rely on you, and yet you come to me!"
Then Jesus replied and said to him: "Wait a moment, for it is fitting for us to complete all good." At that time he allowed him.
When Jesus was baptized, he went up from the water, and suddenly the heavens opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending upon him like a dove.
And a voice from the heavens said: "This is my beloved son, in whom I am pleased."
Jesus Faces the Trial
Then Jesus went up into the wilderness to be tested by the devil.
After having fasted forty days and forty nights, he finally grew hungry.
The tester approached him and said to him: "If you are the son of God, say 'Let these stones become bread'."
And he replied saying: "It is written: Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God."
Then Satan took him to the Holy City and placed him on the corner of the Temple.
He said to him: "If you are the son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written: 'He will appoint his angels to take care of you, and they will carry you so that you do not strike your foot against a stone.'"
Jesus said to him, "It is also written: Do not test the Lord your God."
Then Satan took him also to a very high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory,
He said to him: "I will give you all of this if you turn away and prostrate yourself to me."
At that moment Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written: 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'"
Then Satan left him, and when angels came, they served him. The beginning of his service in Galilee
And when Jesus heard that John had been imprisoned, he withdrew to Galilee.
And he left Naphtali and went to live in Kfar Nahum, which is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Nephthali,
So that what was said by the prophet Isaiah may be fulfilled:
The land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphthali, the way of the sea beyond Jordan, a land of nations.
The people sitting in darkness saw a great light, and those sitting in the pit of death and its shadows saw a light.
At that time, Jesus began to teach and say: "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has drawn near." The Call of the First Disciples
And as Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon, who was called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; and they were fishermen.
He said to them: "Go with me, and I will make you fishers of men."
And at that time they left the shelters and followed him.
Then he passed by and saw two others: Jacob, son of Zabdi, and John, his brother, in the boat with Zabdi, their father, adjusting the windows; so he called them.
At that time they left the boat and their father, and followed him. Jesus knows and heals the sick.
And Jesus walked throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the kingdom of God, and healing every disease and affliction in the people.
His fame spread throughout all of Syria. So they brought to him all the sick, the sufferers of various diseases and pains, the blind, the paralyzed, and the lame, and he healed them.
And a great crowd from Galilee and the Decapolis, Jerusalem, and Judaea, and from across the Jordan, followed him.
The Sermon on the Mount - The Expositions
And when the crowd saw him go up to the mountain, he sat down and taught his disciples.
Then he opened his mouth and taught them saying:
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are the mourners, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are the hungry and the thirsty, for they will be satisfied.
Blessed are the merciful, for they show mercy.
Blessed are the pure of heart, for they see God.
Blessed are the makers of peace, for they are the children of God who call.
Blessed are those who are cast out for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
O you are blessed if they insult you, expel you, and say against you every evil word, all for my sake, they are liars.
Rejoice and celebrate, for your reward is great in the heavens; indeed, they treated the prophets before you in the same way. The salt of the earth and the light of the world.
"You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt loses its flavor, what is it good for? It is no longer useful for anything except being discarded and thrown out by people."
You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
They do not light a lamp and place it under the mat, but on the lantern, so that it shines for all those in the house.
Let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good deeds and glorify your father who is in the heavens. Completion of the Law
Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to abolish but to fulfill.
Verily, I say to you: Until the heavens and the earth pass away, not a single letter or stroke of the Law will disappear until all things are fulfilled.
From among those who nullify one of these minor commandments and teach the people thus, a small one is called in the kingdom of heaven. And from among those who do and teach, a great one is called in the kingdom of heaven.
I tell you: unless your blessings exceed those of the hypocrites and the Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. Anger
"You may have heard that it was said to the ancients: 'Do not kill; whoever kills will be subject to judgment.'"
As for me, I say to you: whoever is angry with his brother in falsehood is liable to punishment, and whoever says to his brother: "You are a fool," is liable to gathering, and whoever says: "O fool," is liable to the fire of Hell.
If you have brought your sacrifice to the altar, and then remembered that your brother has something you need to do,
Leave your offering near the altar, and first reconcile yourself with your brother; then come and present your offering.
Be a debtor and settle your debt quickly while you are still with him on the road, so that he does not hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the policeman, and thus you end up in prison.
Truthfully, I tell you: do not leave until the last Philos has died! Adultery
"Perhaps you have heard that they were told: Do not weigh."
And as for me, I say to you: whoever looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you distress, remove it and cast it from you, for it is better for you that one of your limbs be lost than that your entire body end up in Hell.
And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and cast it from you; for it is better for you that one of your members should be lost than that your whole body should be cast into hell. Divorce
It was said: "A man who divorces his wife should give her a book of divorce."
And as for me, I say to you: Whoever divorces his wife except for a reason of adultery causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. Oath
Also you heard that it was said to the elders: Do not break, but fulfill your oaths to the Lord.
And as for me, I say to you: Do not swear at all, not even by the heavens, for they are the throne of God.
Nor shall I go to the earth, for it is the resting place of my feet, nor to Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great king.
Do not swear by your head, for you cannot make a single hair white or black.
But your words should be: Yes, yes, no, no. And anything beyond that is from the evil. Retaliation
"We heard that someone said: 'Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.'"
And as for me, I say to you: do not resist evil, but if anyone strikes you on your right cheek, turn to them the other also.
And if anyone wants to dispute with you and take your cloak, then leave him your garment as well.
And whoever you give a single measure, let him go with two.
Give to him from whom you are asked, and from whom you wish to borrow, do not return it. Love of enemies
"We heard that someone said: 'You love your near relative and hate your enemy.'"
And as for me, I say to you: Love your enemies. Bless those who curse you. Do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you.
So that you may be children of your Father who is in the heavens, who causes his sun to rise upon the evil and the righteous, and who sends rain upon the righteous and the wrongdoers.
For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not the ten also do the same?
And if you only show kindness to your brothers, what advantage do you gain? Do not the ten also do the same?
Be complete, as your father in heaven is complete.
Alms
"Be cautious not to make your faith a show before people that they may observe you; otherwise, you will have no reward with your Lord who is in the heavens."
When you perform a charity, do not blow the horn before you, as the rich do in mosques and alleys, to be praised by people. Indeed, I tell you: they have already earned their reward!
As for you, whenever you perform a charitable act, do not know your own limits, what you are doing, your right hand.
So that your faith may be tested in secret. He who sees in secret will reward you openly. Prayer
"And when you pray, do not act like the women, for they love to pray standing in the mosques and in the corners of the streets, so that they may show themselves to people. Truly, I tell you: they have already earned their reward!"
As for you, whenever you pray, go into your hiding place and close the door, and go to your father who is in the hidden place. Your father who sees in the hidden place will reward you openly.
And when you come, do not repeat false speech as the nations do; for they think that by their abundance of speech, their requests will be granted.
Do not resemble them. For your fathers know what you need before you ask them.
O you who believe! Separate yourselves in this manner: Our Lord in the heavens, that Your name may be honored.
Let your kingdom come. Let your will be done, as in heaven, so on earth.
We baked our bread, gave it to them today.
And forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who are sinners against us.
And we were not involved in the experiment, but we were saved from the evil one. For Yours is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, forever and ever. Amen.
And if you forgive the people's sins, your heavenly father will also forgive you.
And if you do not forgive people for their sins, neither will your father forgive your sins. Fasting
"And when you keep your fasts, do not become like the women who change their faces so as to appear to others as fasting. Verily, I tell you: they have already received their reward."
As for you, whenever you remain silent, anoint your head and wash your face.
So that people may not see you as a beggar, but for your father who is in the hidden place. Your father who sees in the hidden place will reward you openly. Treasures in heaven
Do not store your treasures on earth, where rust and moth destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
But We have placed for you treasures in the heavens, where corrosion and rust do not spoil them, and where thieves neither dig nor steal.
Because where your treasure is, there your heart is also.
Saraj al-Jisim is the eye; if your eye is simple, then your entire body will be light.
And if your eye is evil, then your whole body will be dark; if the light within you is darkness, how great will that darkness be!
No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will hold fast to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money. God looks after us.
Therefore I tell you: Do not worry about your lives—what you eat or what you drink—nor about your bodies—what you wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
Look at the birds in the sky: they neither sow nor reap nor store in granaries, yet your Lord sustains them. Are you not far better than them?
And among you, if anyone cares, can he increase one of his arms beyond his height?
And why are you concerned with clothing? Observe how field flowers grow! They don't tire nor do they weave.
But I say to you: even Solomon, in all his glory, was dressed in one of them.
If the field grass that is present today and will be placed in the oven tomorrow is dressed by Allah in this way, isn't it clear that You, O people of little faith, should also be dressed in this manner?
Do not worry, saying: "What will we eat? Or what will we drink? Or what will we wear?"
All of this is what the nations seek. Because your heavenly father knows that you need all of this.
But first they asked for the kingdom of God and righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about what is its own. Today's hunger is enough.
Blaming others
Do not charge, so that you may not be charged.
Because you weigh out wrongdoing in the measure by which you measure others, and you measure for yourselves in the scale by which you measure.
And why do you see the fault in your brother's eye, but do not perceive the beam in your own eye?
Or how can you say to your brother: "Let me remove the impurity from your eye, and here is the plank in your eye?"
O Marai, first remove the splinter from your eye, and then you will clearly see how to remove the dirt from your brother's eye!
Do not give holy things to dogs, nor place your sandals before pigs, lest they trample on them and turn around to tear you apart. Ask, seek, knock.
Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you.
For whoever asks shall receive, and whoever seeks shall find, and whoever knocks shall have the door opened for them.
Or is there any of you who, when his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?
And if he asks a fish, will it give him life?
If you are indeed evil people who know to give your children good gifts, how much more will your father in the heavens bestow blessings upon those who ask Him!
For whatever you wish people to do to you, do likewise to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets. The Narrow Gate
"Enter through the narrow gate, for the gate is wide and the road is broad that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter through it!"
What a narrow gate and what a difficult road leads to life, and few indeed are those who find it! The tree and its fruit
Beware of the false prophets who come to you in garments of smoothness, but they are actually wolves in sheep's clothing!
From their fruits you will know them. Do they gather from the date-palm dates, or from the fig tree figs?
Thus, every good tree bears good fruit, while every bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot produce good fruit.
Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
And by their fruits you will know them.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven. Only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven.
Many will say to me today: "O Lord, O Lord! Didn't your name reveal us? Didn't your name drive out demons? Didn't your name create for us great forces?"
At that moment I declared to them: "I never knew you!" Go away, you doer of evil! The wise builders and the ignorant builders.
"Everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on rock."
Then rain descended, rivers came, and the wind blew, yet the house remained standing, for it was built upon rock.
And whoever hears my words but does not put them into practice is like a man ignorant, who builds his house on sand.
Then rain descended, rivers came, the wind blew, and that house struck and fell, and its fall was great!
And when Jesus had finished these sayings, the multitudes were amazed at his teaching.
Because he taught them as one having authority, not as the scribes.
Healing of the blind
And when it came down from the mountain, a large crowd followed it.
And when he recovered, he came and prostrated himself before him, saying: "O Lord, if you wish, you can purify me."
And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, "I want you to be healed!" And immediately he was healed.
Jesus said to him, "Look, do not tell anyone. But go, and take yourself to the priest, and offer the sacrifice Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." Faith of the Centurion
And when Jesus entered Caphernaum, a centurion came to Him, asking Him...
He says: "O master, my slave is inside the house, severely mistreated and abused."
Then Jesus said to him, "I am coming to heal him."
Then the centurion replied, "Lord, I am not worthy to enter under your roof, but only say the word and my servant will be healed."
For I am also a man under authority. I have troops under my command. I say to one: Go! He goes, to another: Come! He comes, and to my servants: Do this! They do it.
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him: "Truly I tell you, I have not found, nor in Israel, such faith!"
And I say to you: Many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
As for the children of the kingdom, they are cast out into the outer darkness. There, there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go; just as you believed, it will be done for you." At that very hour the servant was healed. Healing of Bartolomeu and others
And when Jesus came to Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying in bed, ill.
She took her hand, and the fever left her; she got up and served them.
And when evening came, many madmen came to him; and he brought forth spirits by a word, and all the sick were healed.
So that what is said by the prophet Isaiah, who said: "He took our infirmities and bore our diseases," may be fulfilled. Submission
And when Jesus saw a large crowd gathering around him, he commanded them to go to the other side.
The writer approached him and said to him: "O teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus said to him, "The foxes have their dens, and the birds of the sky their nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
One of his disciples said to him: "O Master, permit me to go first and bury my father."
Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their dead." Calming the storm
And when the boat set sail, his disciples followed him.
And a great disturbance had occurred in the sea until the waves covered the ship, and he was asleep.
His disciples approached and woke him up, saying: "O Master, save us! For we are perishing!"
He said to them: "Why are you afraid, you people of little faith?" Then he stood up and stormed the wind and the sea, and great calm ensued.
People were amazed and said: "Who is this man? Indeed, both the wind and the sea obey him!" The devils were cast out.
And when he arrived at the Euphrates near the village of the Jarghaseen, he was met by two madmen coming out of the gorge, so fierce that no one could pass through that path.
And if they had cried out, saying: "What have we done to you, Lord Jesus, Son of God? Did you come before time to punish us?"
And far from them was a large herd of pigs being tended.
And the devils asked him, saying: "If you expel us, grant us permission to go to the pig herd."
He said to them: "Go." So they went out and proceeded to the pig herd, and there they found the entire herd had been pushed from the bank into the sea and had died in the water.
As for the herders, they fled and went to the city, and informed them of everything, and of the matter concerning the madmen.
And when all the city had come out to meet Jesus, when they saw Him, they asked Him to leave them.
Healing the disabled
He entered the ship, passed through, and arrived at his town.
And if the possessed one is brought to him lying on the bed, when Jesus sees their faith, he says to the possessed one: "Have confidence, son; your sins are forgiven."
And some of the people of the Book have said within themselves: "This is a deception!"
Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them: "Why do you think of evil in your hearts?"
Either it is said: "Your sins are forgiven," or it is said: "Arise and walk"?
But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then He said to the paralytic, "Arise, take up your mat and go to your house!"
He stood up and went to his house.
When the multitudes saw them, they were amazed and praised God, who had given mankind such a power. Call time
And as Jesus was passing by, he saw a man sitting by the tax collector's booth, whose name was Matthew. He said to him, "Follow me." And he got up and followed him.
While he was reclining in the house, many people, including Caiphas and others, had come and reclined with Jesus and his disciples.
When the Pharisees looked around, they said to their disciples: "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said to them: "The healthy do not need a physician, but the sick do."
Go and learn what it means: "Indeed, I desire mercy, not sacrifice; for I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." The Question of Fasting
At that time, John's disciples came to him and said: "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?"
Then Jesus said to them: "Can the sons of the bridegroom cease celebrating the wedding feast while the bridegroom is with them? But there will come a time when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast."
No one places a patch of new fabric onto an old garment, because the patch takes from the garment, making the tear worse.
They do not put new wine into an old cask, lest the cask burst; for the wine will ferment and the cask will be ruined. Rather, they put new wine into a new cask, so that both remain intact. The establishment of Yair's daughter and the healing of the bleeding woman
And as he was speaking to them in this way, a man came and prostrated himself before him, saying: "My daughter has died, but come, place your hand on her and she will live."
Then Jesus arose and he went with him and his disciples.
And if a woman has been experiencing menstrual bleeding for twelve years, and she comes from behind and her garment is stained,
For she said to herself: "Only touching his garment healed me."
Then Jesus looked at her and said, "Daughter, your faith has healed you." And from that moment she was healed.
And when Jesus came into the house of the ruler of the synagogue, He looked upon the singers and the crowd who were singing,
He said to them: "Turn back, for the child is not dead but merely asleep." They laughed at him.
When the crowd had dispersed, he entered and took her hand; the girl stood up.
That news reached every part of that land. Healing of the blind.
And as Jesus was passing by, two blind men followed him, crying out and saying, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
And when He came to the house, the blind ones came forward to Him, and Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They said to Him, "Yes, Lord!"
At that time, they looked at each other and said: "According to your faith, let it be for you."
Then their eyes were opened. Jesus rebuked them, saying, "Look, no one knows!"
But both of them went out and spread it throughout that land. Healing of Akhras
And as they were leaving, a man with a mad step approached him.
And when the devil cast out the leper, the people were amazed and said: "Never has such a thing appeared in Israel!"
As for the Frezis, they said: "The devils come out from the head of the devils!" The few were the majority.
And Jesus walked throughout the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the kingdom of God, and healing every disease and weakness in the people.
And when the multitudes showed them compassion, seeing that they were distressed and scattered like sheep without a shepherd.
At that time he said to his disciples: "The harvest is great, but the workers are few."
So they asked their Lord of harvest to send a sign to his harvest.
Sending the Twelve
Then he called his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits so that they could drive them out and heal every disease and every weakness.
The names of the twelve apostles are as follows: the first is Simon, also called Peter, and Andrew, his brother. Jacob, son of Zebedee, and John, his brother.
Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, and Matthew the Tenth. Jacob son of Halaf, and Labbaus the one called Tadaus.
Saman the Qanawi, and Judah the Escholite whom he delivered over.
These twelve Jesus sent out and commissioned them, saying: "Do not go into the ways of the Gentiles, and do not enter into any Samaritan city."
But go to the crookedness of the house of Israel.
And as you are going, disputing and saying: "The kingdom of heaven has drawn near."
Heal the sick. Purify the impure. Raise the dead. Expel demons. Take freely, give freely.
Do not acquire gold or silver or copper in your territories,
And no provider of road, no two garments, no shoes, no staff, because the doer is entitled to his food.
And whenever you enter a city or village, investigate among its inhabitants those who are entitled, and establish yourselves there until you leave.
And when you enter the house, salute it.
If the house is worthy, let your greetings come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your greetings return to you.
And if anyone does not accept you nor listen to your words, then leave that house or that city, and shake off the dust from your feet.
Verily, I say to you: The condition of the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the Day of Judgment will be more likely than that of this city.
"Behold, I send you forth like sheep among wolves; be wise as serpents and gentle as doves."
But beware of people, for they will deliver you to assemblies, and in their courts they will flog you.
And they will be brought before the rulers and kings on my behalf as witnesses both for them and for the nations.
When they deliver you over, do not worry about what you say or how you speak, for at that time you will give them what you speak.
For you are not the ones speaking, but the Spirit of your father who speaks through you.
The brother will deliver his brother to death, the father will deliver his son to death, and the children will take their parents' lives.
And you will be hated by all because of my name. But he who endures until the end—this one will be saved.
And when they expel you from this city, go to the other. Indeed, I say to you: you will not complete the cities of Israel until the son of man comes.
"The student is not better than the teacher, nor is the servant better than his master."
The student need only be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they have called their master "Elzabul," how much more are the members of his household!
Do not fear them, for what is concealed will not be revealed, and what is hidden will not be known.
What I say to you in the darkness, say it in the light; and what you hear in the ear, proclaim it from the balconies.
And do not fear those who kill the body, for they cannot harm the soul; but fear those who are able to destroy both soul and body in Hell.
Are two sparrows being sold for a silver piece? And one of them will fall to the ground without your father's permission.
And as for you, even the very tips of your heads are protected.
Do not be afraid! You are better than many birds!
Everyone who acknowledges me before men, I also acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven.
But whoever denies me before men, I will deny him before my Lord, who is in the heavens.
"Do not think I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have come not to bring peace but a sword."
For I came to divide man from his father, and daughter from her mother, and the young woman from her mother-in-law.
The enemies of humanity are its own family members.
He who loves my father or my mother more than me does not deserve me, and he who loves my son or my daughter more than me does not deserve me.
And whoever does not take my cross and follow me, he does not deserve me.
He who has lost his life will find it, and he who has lost his life for my sake will find it.
He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.
He who accepts a prophet by the name of prophet, his prophet's reward is taken; and he who accepts bar by the name of bar, his bar's reward is taken.
And if one of these young ones quenched his thirst with a single cup of cold water, simply calling him a student, then I say to you: his reward will not be lost.
John the Baptist and Jesus
And when Jesus had finished all that he had been commanded to do to his twelve disciples, he withdrew to teach and preach in their cities. Jesus and John the Baptist
As for John, when he heard in prison about the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,
He said to him: "Are you the one coming, or do we wait for the next one?"
And Jesus answered them and said: "Go and tell John what you hear and see:"
The blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor are made joyful.
Blessed is he who does not stumble.
While these two went away, Jesus began to say to the crowd about John: "Why did you go out into the wilderness to see? To see a reed shaken by the wind?"
But what did you come out to look at? A man dressed in soft clothes? Behold, those who wear soft clothes are in the homes of kings.
But what did you come out to look at? Prophets? Yes, I tell you, and even better than prophets.
This is what was written about him: "Behold, I send before you angels who prepare your path before you."
Verily, I say to you: Among those born of women, no one is greater than John the Baptist; yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven is being taken, and the plunderers are seizing it.
Because all the prophets and the Law until John prophesied.
And if you wish to accept, this is Elijah whom it is intended to come.
He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
And who in this generation is like this? It is like children sitting in the markets calling out to their companions.
They say: "We have given you, yet you did not dance! We have provided for you, yet you did not thank!"
For John came neither to eat nor to drink, and they say: He has a demon.
The son of man came to eat and drink, and they said: "Behold, a man who eats and drinks wine, fond of the corrupt and the sinners. Wisdom has justified her children." Woe to the cities that did not repent.
At that time, he began to reprimand the city that had built the majority of his forces, because it had not changed.
Woe to you, Korzyn! Woe to you, Beit Saida! For if you had made images and idols of the forces made in you, they would have turned to dust and ashes long ago.
But I tell you: on the Day of Resurrection, your images and your idols will have a more likely state than you both.
And you, O Kafrunahum, raised high to the heavens! You will descend into the abyss. For if you had created in Sodom forces created in you, you would have remained until today.
But I say to you: the land of Sodom will have a greater chance of being destroyed on the Day of Judgment than you have. Relief for the weary
At that time Jesus replied and said: "Father, Your name is Holy, for You have hidden this from the wise and the learned and revealed it to children."
Yes, O Father, because thus has the matter come before you.
Everything has come from my father; no one knows the son except the father, and no one knows the father except the son, and whoever wishes for the son to declare it.
Come to me, all who are weary and burdened, and I will refresh you.
Carry my message to them and learn from me, for I am humble and modest in heart; thus you will find peace in your souls.
Because Neri Hen and my pregnancy is light».
Father Saturday
At that time Jesus went on the Sabbath into the fields, and his disciples were hungry. So they began to pick the sheaves and eat.
The Pharisees, when they saw it, said to him: "Behold, your disciples are doing what is not permitted on the Sabbath!"
He said to them: "Did you not see what David did when he and those with him were in need?"
How did he enter the house of God and eat the bread of provision, which was not allowed for him or for those with him, but only for the priests?
Or have you read in the Torah that the priests in the Temple on the Sabbath desecrate the Sabbath, and yet they are innocent?
But I tell you: here is greater than the temple!
If you knew what I meant: "I seek mercy, not sacrifice," would you have condemned the innocent!
Then the son of man is also the Lord of the Sabbath.
Then he left there and went to their gathering place.
And if a man has dry hands, ask him saying: "Is it permissible to perform istihala on wet clothes?" so that they may complain about it.
He said to them: "Which of you, if he has a single goat, and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will he not take it up and set it free?"
Man is much better than a goat! He does good even in the midst of evil!
Then He said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out. And it returned as before. Thus, God chose the one.
When the Pharisees came out, they discussed among themselves how to destroy him.
And Jesus knew, and withdrew from there. And a large crowd followed him, and he healed them all.
And they advised them not to display it.
So that what was said by the prophet Isaiah may be fulfilled:
Behold, the one whom I have chosen, my beloved upon whom I have set my soul; I will place my spirit upon him to proclaim truth to the nations.
He does not complain or shout, and no one hears his voice in the streets.
A besieged city that will not be stormed, a burning torch that will not be extinguished, until the right side reaches victory.
In his name, there is hope for the nations. Jesus and Barzaphan
At that time, he brought to him a blind and deaf madman and healed him; even the blind and deaf man spoke and saw.
And they all gathered around you and said: "Could this be the son of David?"
As for the Frisians, when they heard this, they said: "The demons only come out through Baalzophel, the chief of the demons."
Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them: "Every kingdom divided against itself will be destroyed, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand."
If Satan casts out Satan, then he has divided himself. How then can his kingdom stand?
And if I, Balaam, cast out the demons, then who do your children cast out? Therefore, they will be your judges!
But if I, by the Spirit of God, cast out demons, then surely the kingdom of God is among you!
How can anyone enter the house of the strong and plunder his belongings unless the strong first secures it? And then how could he plunder its house?
He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not join me with me divides.
Therefore I say to you: every sin and offense will be forgiven people, but an offense against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
And whoever says a word against the son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whoever says against the Holy Spirit, neither in this world nor in the world to come shall it be forgiven.
Make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree worthless and its fruit worthless, for from the fruit you know the tree.
O you people of the snakes! How can you speak good things and yet be evil? For the mouth speaks due to the quality of the heart.
The righteous person, possessing a good inner treasure, brings forth goodness, while the wicked person, possessing a bad inner treasure, brings forth evil.
But I tell you: every idle word that people utter will be accounted for on the Day of Judgment.
"For with your words you justify and with your words you condemn." – Yohanan
At that time, some of the Kitabites and the Fursa'is replied, saying: "O teacher, we wish to see from you a sign."
And he replied and said to them: "A wicked and sinful man asking for a sign, and no sign will be given him except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
For as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights, so will the son of man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.
The people of Nineveh will be saved in this generation, and they will be saved because they repented at the call of Jonah; and behold, here is something greater than Jonah!
The Queen of Sheba will come to the faith with this generation and teach it, because she came from the farthest parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, greater than Solomon is here!
If the unclean spirit exits a person and passes through places without water, it seeks rest but finds none.
Then he says: "Return to your house from which you came." He comes and finds it empty, covered, and adorned.
Then he goes and takes with him seven souls even more evil than himself, and enters and settles there, so that the latter part of that person becomes more evil than their earlier part! Thus it is also with this generation of evil people. The will of God.
And when he was speaking to the crowd, his mother and his brothers stood outside, asking that they might speak with him.
One of them said to him: "Here is your mother and your brothers standing outside, asking to speak with you."
And he replied and said to the one who had asked him: "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Then he extended his hand toward his students and said: "Here are my mother and my brothers."
Because He who makes the will of my Father in the heavens is my brother, my sister, and my mother.
Like the farmer and its interpretation
On that day Jesus left the house and sat by the sea,
A large crowd gathered around him, until he entered the ship and sat down. The entire crowd stood on the shore.
And He spoke to them often by parables, saying: "Behold, the sower went out to sow,"
And as he was sowing, some fell along the path, and birds came and ate them.
And the last one fell upon the enclosed places, where he had little soil, so that vegetation grew there despite having no deep ground.
But when the sun rose, it burned, and it had no root.
And the last one fell on the stake, where the stake protruded and suffocated him.
And the last one fell on good soil and produced a harvest: some a hundred, another sixty, and another thirty.
He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
The students approached him and said to him: "Why do you speak to them in parables?"
And he answered them, saying: "Because it has been given to you to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but it has not been given to them."
He who has will be given and increased, and he who has nothing, from what he has will be taken.
For this reason I spoke to them in parables, for they are seeing yet they do not see, and hearing yet they do not hear nor understand.
So it came to pass among them the prophecy of Isaiah, which says: "You hear, yet do not understand; you see, yet do not perceive."
Because the heart of this people has grown hardened, and their ears have become heavy with hearing. They have closed their eyes, so that they may not see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, nor understand with their hearts, and return so that they may be healed.
But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear.
And I say to you: Many of the prophets and the pious longed to see what you see, and to hear what you hear, yet they did not see nor hear.
"Listen, you are like the farmer:"
Everyone who hears the kingdom and does not understand, the evil one comes and snatches what was sown in their heart. This is the seed on the path.
And the cultivated land in the fortified areas is the one that hears the word, and currently accepts it with joy.
But it has no existence in itself, but only temporarily. If there is a shortage or persecution for the sake of the word, then at that moment he will be found.
And the cultivated among the thorns is the one who hears the word; and these, the world and the pride of the rich, choke the word, so that it bears no fruit.
And the cultivated land on good soil is the one that hears the word and understands it; it bears fruit, producing some a hundred, others sixty, and others thirty. Like wheat and barley.
For example, he said: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field."
While the people were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed darnel in the midst of the wheat, then left.
When the plant emerged and produced fruit, the Zawan also appeared.
A servant of the master of the house came and said to him: "O master, haven't you planted a good crop in your field? From where does he get his grain?"
He said to them: "A man enemy has done this." The slaves replied: "Do you want us to go and gather him?"
He said: "No! so that the grain may not be lost with the chaff, while you are gathering it."
Call them both to harvest together; and at the time of harvesting I say to the harvesters: "First gather the spelt and thresh it thoroughly to burn, but as for the barley, gather it into the granaries." Like the small grain, like the yeast
He gave them another example saying: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field,"
It is the smallest of all the buzur. But when it grows, it becomes the largest of the boqul, and turns into a tree, so much so that birds from the sky come and settle in its branches.
He gave them another example: "The kingdom of heaven is like leaven taken by a woman and hidden in three measures of flour, until the whole mass becomes leavened."
All this Jesus taught the crowd by parables, and he never taught them without a parable.
In order for what was said about the Prophet, who said: "I will open with examples from my mouth, and speak out what has been kept secret since the creation of the world," to be understood, the interpretation of the examples of wheat and zawn.
Then Jesus sent away the crowd and went to the house. His disciples approached him and said: "Explain to us the parable of the sower."
And he replied to them: "The good seed is the son of man."
And the field is the world. And the good seed is the children of the kingdom. And the tares are the children of the evil one.
And the enemy he sowed is Iblis. And the destruction is the disappearance of the world. And those who are destroyed are the angels.
As the Zawān gathers and burns with fire, so too will this world come to an end:
The son of man sends his angels to gather all his belongings and those who commit sins.
They are thrown into the midst of the fire. There, crying and grinding teeth.
At that time the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear. Examples of the treasure, the pearl, and the net.
Also, the kingdom of heaven is like a hidden treasure found in a field by a man, who then concealed it. And upon his joy, he sold all that he had and bought that field.
The kingdom of heaven also resembles a merchant seeking good pearls.
When he found a pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had in order to buy it.
The kingdom of heaven also resembles a network spread out in the sea, a university of every kind.
When it was full, they carried it up to the shore, sat down, and gathered the camels into containers; as for the aridah, they let them out.
Thus it will be at the end of the world: the angels will come forth and separate the evil from the righteous.
They throw them into the midst of the fire. There, crying and grinding their teeth.
Jesus said to them, "Have you understood all this?" They replied, "Yes, Lord."
He said to them: "For that reason, every learned writer in the kingdom of heaven is like a man of a house who takes out something new and free from his treasure."
And when Jesus had finished these parables, He departed from there. Nain rejected Jesus.
And when he reached his homeland, he taught them in their assembly until they said: "From where does this wisdom and strength come?"
Is this not the son of the carpenter? Is not his mother named Mary, and his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
Are all his sisters here with us? Where did all of this come from?
And they found him. But Jesus said to them: "A prophet has no honor except in his own country and among his own people."
There were no large forces because they did not believe.
Cut off the head of John the Baptist
At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard news about Jesus,
He said to his disciples: "This is John the Baptist, who has risen from the dead! Therefore, miracles are being performed through him."
For Herod had seized John, imprisoned him, and put him in prison for Herodias, the wife of Philip, his brother.
For John was saying to him: "It is not permissible for you to have it."
And when he intended to kill him, he feared the people, because they regarded him as a prophet.
Then, when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced in the middle, and Herod was pleased.
Then he promised him that whatever he asked for, he would give it to him.
And since she had learned from her mother she said: "Give me here on the dish of John the Baptist."
Let the king grieve. But because of the divisions and those who lie with him, it is decreed that he shall be given.
So he sent and cut off John's head in prison.
So he placed his head on a plate and gave it to the boy, who brought it to his mother.
His disciples came forward, lifted up the body, and buried him. Then they came and told Jesus. The five thousand men were filled.
And when Jesus heard this, he withdrew alone in a boat to a desolate place. Then he heard the crowd and went out from the city.
When Jesus came out, he saw a large crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their illnesses.
And when evening came, his disciples approached him saying: "The place is empty and the time has passed. Send the crowd away so that they may go to the villages and buy food for themselves."
Then Jesus said to them, "They need not go. Give them to us to eat."
They said to him: "We have here only five loaves and two fish."
He said: "Come to me with it to this place."
Then he commanded the crowd to sit on the grass. He took the five loaves and two fish, looked up to heaven, blessed them, broke them, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the crowd.
So everyone ate and was filled. Then they lifted up twelve full measures of the threshing floor.
And the eaters numbered about five thousand men, excluding women and children. The miracle of walking on water
And at that time Jesus ordered his disciples to get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, so that they might reach the crowd.
And after the crowd had dispersed, they climbed the mountain individually to pray. And when evening came, he was alone.
As for the ship, it had become battered by the waves in the middle of the sea, because the wind was blowing against it.
In the fourth watch of the night, Jesus was walking on the sea.
When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled and said, "It is a vision." Filled with fear, they cried out!
And at that time Jesus said to them, "Be courageous! I am He. Do not be afraid."
And Peter answered him and said: "Lord, if you are he, command me to come to you on the water."
He said, "Come." Then Peter got down from the boat and walked on the water to reach Jesus.
But when he saw the wind was strong, he feared. And as he began to sink, he cried out, "Lord, save me!"
And in that case, Jesus stretched out his hand and took it, saying to him, "You of little faith, why did you doubt?"
And when they entered the ship, the wind calmed.
And those who were on the boat came to him and prostrated themselves, saying: "Truly, you are the Son of God!"
When they had crossed, they came to the land of Jinsart.
Men of that place recognized him. So they sent to all the surrounding villages and brought all the patients to him.
And they asked him to let them touch only the hem of his garment. So all those who touched it were healed.
The pure and the impure
At that time some scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem came to Jesus, saying:
"Why do your students copy the elders if they don't wash their hands when eating bread?"
And he replied to them: "And you too, why do you transgress Allah's command merely because of imitation?"
Indeed, Allah commanded: "Honor your father and your mother, and whoever curses either father or mother shall be subject to a severe punishment."
And you say: "Whoever says to his father or mother, 'The sacrifice is what you benefit from me,' does not honor his father or mother."
You have nullified Allah's bequest due to your imitation!
O Mar'uwun! Well, Isaiah prophesied about you saying:
This people draws near to me with their mouth, honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
They do not worship Me, while they know My signs and the guidelines for humanity.
Then the crowd said to them: "Listen and understand."
What goes into the mouth does not defile a person, but what comes out of the mouth defiles a person."
At that time his disciples approached him and said to him: "Do you know that when the Pharisees heard this, they withdrew?"
And he replied, "Every tree that was not planted by my heavenly father will be uprooted."
Leave them. They are blind leaders of blind ones. And if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.
And Peter answered and said to him: "Explain to us this parable."
Then Jesus said to them: "Are you still not understanding?"
Do you not understand that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is then expelled?
And what comes out of the mouth originates from the heart, and that defiles a person.
Because evil thoughts emerge from the heart: killing, adultery, immorality, theft, false witness, and corruption.
This is what makes a person impure. As for eating with unwashed hands, it does not make a person impure." The belief of the Canaanite woman
Then Jesus departed from there and went to the regions of Perea and Sidon.
And a woman from the Canaanite region, coming out from those borders, cried out to him, saying: "Have mercy on me, O Lord, son of David! My daughter is severely possessed."
He said nothing. His students approached him and asked, "Send her away, for she cries behind us!"
And he replied, "I have sent only to the donkey of the wrongdoer in the house of Israel."
Then she came and prostrated herself before him, saying: "O Master, I mean it!"
And he replied, "It is not good to take the bread of the children and give it to the dogs."
She said: "Yes, sir! And dogs also eat the crumbs that fall from the table of their masters!"
At that time Jesus replied to her, "Woman, your faith is great! Let it be done for you as you wish." From that moment her daughter was healed. He fed four thousand men.
Then Jesus departed from there and came to the shore of the Sea of Galilee; he climbed the hill and sat there.
A great crowd came to him, with a man who was blind, and a man who was lame, and a man who was mute, and a man who was deaf, and many others. They laid them down at the feet of Jesus. And he healed them.
So the multitudes were amazed when they saw the crocodiles speaking, the lame walking, the blind seeing, and the disabled becoming whole. And they glorified the God of Israel.
And Jesus called his disciples and said: "I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint along the way."
His disciples said to him: "How can we get enough bread in the wilderness to feed this large crowd?"
Then Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" They replied, "Seven small loaves."
Then command the assembly to sit upon the ground,
And the seven took bread and fish, thanked God, broke them, and gave them to their disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowd.
So everyone ate and was filled. Then they lifted seven full baskets of the leftover barley,
And the eaters were four thousand men, except for the women and the children.
Then the crowd dispersed and went up to the ship, and came to the outskirts of Majdal.
Request Aya
The Frisians and the Sadoon came to him to test him, and they asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
And he replied to them, "If it were evening, you would have said, 'Awake, for the sky is reddening.'"
In the morning: Today is winter because the sky is reddened by a cloud. O you who see! You know how to distinguish the face of the sky, but you are unable to recognize the signs of the seasons!
A wicked generation asks for a sign, and a sign is given to them only the sign of Jonah the prophet. Then He left them and went on. Khumur of the Pharisees and Saducees.
And when his disciples came to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.
Jesus said to them: "Look, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees."
Then they reflected upon themselves, saying: "Indeed, we have not taken bread."
And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them: "Why do you think about yourselves, you of little faith, that you have not taken bread?"
Until now do you not understand? Do you not remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets you took?
And what about the seven loaves of the four thousand? How much did you take?
How can you not understand that I did not say to you to beware of leaven? I said to beware of the Pharisaeans and the Sadducees?
At that time they realized that he had not said they should avoid leaven, but rather the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter's confession of Christ
And when Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say that I am?"
They said: "Go, John the Baptist, and others, Elijah, and others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
He said to them: "And you, who say that I am?"
And Simon Peter replied, "You are the Christ, the Son of God the living!"
And Jesus answered and said to him: "Blessed are you, Simon son of John, for you have not known either harm or blood, but the Father who is in heaven."
And I tell you also: You are Peter, on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, so that whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
At that time, he instructed his disciples not to say to anyone that Jesus is the Messiah. Jesus foretells his death and resurrection.
From that time on, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer greatly at the hands of the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and on the third day rise again.
And Peter took him and began to rebuke him, saying, "By no means, Lord! This shall not happen to you!"
And he turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men."
At that time Jesus said to his disciples: "If anyone wishes to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me,"
He who wishes to purify himself will destroy it, and he who destroys himself for my sake will find it.
Because what benefit would a person gain if he won the whole world yet lost himself? Or what does a person offer as ransom for himself?
Then the son of man will come in the glory of his father with his angels, and then each person will be rewarded according to their deeds.
Verily, I tell you: Among those standing here are people who will never taste death until they see the son of man coming in his kingdom.
Manifestation
And after six days, Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, and brought them up to a high mountain alone.
His appearance changed before them, his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light.
And if Moses and Elijah have appeared to them, speaking with him.
And Peter said to Jesus: "Lord, it is good for us to be here! If you wish, let us make three shelters: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And as he was speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said: "This is my beloved son, in whom I have rejoiced. Hear him."
And when the disciples heard this, they fell to the ground and were greatly afraid.
Then Jesus came and touched them, saying, "Stand up, and do not be afraid."
They raised their eyes and saw no one except Jesus alone.
And as they were descending from the mountain, Jesus said to them: "Do not tell anyone what you have seen until the Son of Man rises from the dead."
And his disciples asked him, saying: "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
Then Jesus answered them and said: "Elijah will come first and restore all things."
But I tell you: Elijah has come and they did not recognize him, but they have done whatever they wished to him. So will the Son of Man suffer among them too.
At that time the disciples understood that He had said to them about John the Baptist: "He healed a boy with a demon."
And when they came to the gathering, a man lying on his side approached him.
And they said: "O Lord, have mercy on my son, for he suffers greatly, and often falls into fire and often into water."
And he brought him to your disciples, and they were not able to heal him.
Then Jesus answered and said: "O unbeliefful generation, rebellious ones, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to me!"
Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out of him. From that hour the boy was healed.
Then the disciples approached Jesus privately and said: "Why couldn't we drive it out?"
Then Jesus said to them: "Because of your lack of faith. Truly I tell you, if you had faith as small as a mustard seed, you would say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it would move. Nothing would be impossible to you."
As for this group, they do not emerge except through prayer and fasting.
And as they were hesitating in Galilee, Jesus said to them: "The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men."
