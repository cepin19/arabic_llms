Can we use this coupon for flights?

When are you coming to Boston?
Let me give my opinion.

Can you make us a piña colada?
I can't even understand a word of what the people around me are saying.
Good evening. I have a reservation. My name is Yamada.
He walks every three minutes.
Yes, each part of the structure is connected to another.
Where is the monument?
Is this the right way to the station?
That means your reservation.
Oh, I understand. These are the cable channels in the hotel.
If we send from this store to Japan, can we avoid that?
Five iron, it will save your life.

Forgive me. Where is a pharmacy near here?
My son is studying at the graduate school of Harvard University.
"We'd like to make an international call at Japan's expense. The number is Tokyo three four seven six two nine three six."
A bee stung me. It hurts a lot.
This is how you talk to people.
Brother, where can we complete our transactions?
The houses are close to each other, which makes life convenient.
So what's the honey farm?
Sure. Houses changing their clothes, how's it going.
Do you want a hot water bottle?
"Thanks, wake me up tomorrow at six in the morning."
When can you bring these things?
In fact, I bought it yesterday unexpectedly from a shop near my house.
Cow or chicken?
I have a metal plate in my bone.
We love to walk in the sun.
Where do we stand on the shore?
Where is the lost and found office?
Show me how to use this machine.

A bit grumpy star?
We love novels, but we prefer those that are easy to read.
What is a good boutique for children's clothing?
We like to go out early in the morning. Can we leave now?
We hope you'll come back again.

We like to get a medical check-up.
This is a one-carat piece, right?
I'm so happy to meet you, Zada.
Where does the morning star rise?
How many hours will it take you to get there?
Do you love to get it for us?

We love to get our money back.
Don't do this and that and the other, please.
"Enjoy your life, Hassan."
Aman, talk to me.
How do I eat these big crab claws?
Where's the nearest ski resort to here?
And jazz?
I'm free these days.
Intoxicating?
You need to leave by 6:30.
Will you come tomorrow morning as you promised?
Should I reserve it for you?
We'd like to see the city manager.
Reception? It's Nakamura. I've just recovered. But I don't like the house.
We love staying together.
We like to go out.
My mistake.
We like to talk to you so you can evaluate us in the morning.
We hope to see you again.

He, oh, from here.
Orange juice, beer, syrup, whiskey, cocktail.
No, thank you. Can you get me two bottles of water, please?
If you have it, you don't need to pay again when you take the forty-four bus.
How about a dish?
We like to walk to the restaurant.
We like a heavy coat for winter.
I had some personal things in this bag.
When will we finish the tourist route?
I did it.
We play tennis twice a week.
"What's that? Am I in the wrong place?"
I don't have any hobbies. I just work, like most Japanese people do.
Oh, Prof, Korn likes to give surprise exams.
When you see someone, just wave your hand.
We need you as soon as possible.
We'd like to send this postcard to Japan by express.
We love to complain, thank you. My name is Haruko Ogwa. I made a reservation in my mind.
Didn't she bring gifts to anyone in this country?
Forgive me, we want to send this to Japan. How much does this cost?
We like a photographer who doesn't charge too much.
At this hour, sir? Eleven in the morning.
No. I'm Japanese.

Keep it long.
