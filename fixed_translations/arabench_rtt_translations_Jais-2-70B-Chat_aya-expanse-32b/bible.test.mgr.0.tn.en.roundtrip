environmental khoa is the most important one in the kingdom.
khoaIn that hour, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Jesus called a little child to him and had him stand among them.
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
khoa one should become as humble as a child; for such is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
Everyone welcomes someone like this for my sake, he welcomed me.
Wouldn't it be a sin for someone to lead one of the young ones who believe in me astray? If they did so, it would be better for them if a large millstone were tied around their neck and they were drowned in the depths of the sea.
khoaib is this world because of the things that make people make mistakes. Things like this should not happen, but how flawed are the people who bring them about.
If your hand or your leg makes you commit sins, cut it off and throw it away. It is better to enter Paradise with one hand or one leg than to enter Hell with two hands and two legs. In Hell, the fire burns forever.
If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. (The Parable of the Lost Sheep)
Be careful not to despise one of these children. This is what I mean. Their angels in heaven can come at any time to see their father in heaven.
(No
What do you think? Imagine there's a man who has 100 sheep and one of them gets lost. Would he leave the 99 sheep in the pen? Wouldn't he go and try to find the lost sheep?
What I'm about to tell you is true. If he found this sheep, he would be more joyful than he was about the ninety-nine others that did not get lost.
He is with God in heaven. He doesn't like even one of these little ones to be lost. As if one does a sin with you.
If your brother wrongs you, go to him. Tell him what he did wrong. Keep the matter between you two. If he listens to you, you've corrected him.
How could he not listen to your testimony? So take one or two others with you. The book says, 'On the testimony of two or three witnesses a matter must be confirmed.' (Deuteronomy 19:15)
But how could he refuse to hear witnesses? In this case, tell it to the church. But how could he refuse even to hear the church? In this case, don't treat your brother. Treat him as you would like to be treated by someone who has nothing to do with God or someone who collects taxes.
What we are telling you is true. Whatever you love to keep on earth, that will be kept in heaven. And whatever you love to let go of on earth, that will be let go of in heaven.
Again, this is what we've been telling you. Imagine two people agreeing on something, anything you ask them about. God, who is in heaven, will grant it to you.
"Wherever two or three are gathered in my name, I am there with them." The servant who did not leave.
Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus said, "Not seven times, but seventy-seven times."
The kingdom of heaven is like a loving king who gathers all the money his servants have served him.
And as the owner continued to do so, he brought him a man who owed him millions of dollars.
The man failed to fulfill his obligations. Therefore, his creditor issued an order to sell the man, his wife, his children, and all their possessions to pay off the debt he owed.
The servant fell to his knees before him. "Please, give me some time," he begged. "I'll finish everything right away."
His master had mercy on him. He forgave his debt and let him go.
See, that slave went out and found another servant who had borrowed a few dollars from him. He grabbed him and strangled him. "Return what you borrowed from me!" he said.
The other man knelt down and begged him, saying, "Please, give me a little time, I'll return it all to you later."
If the debtor refuses, on the contrary, they go and get him and put him in prison, so that he stays there until he pays his debt and is released.
The others saw what happened. They were very worried. They went and told their master everything that happened.
And then, the master called the servant and let him in. He said, "Wicked servant, I forgive you for everything you owe me because you begged me."
You too, you must have mercy on the other servant, just as I had mercy on you.
In anger, his master gave him to Hafsia. So that he would be ruined until he pays off everything he owes.
This is how your Father in heaven will treat each one of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.
Jesus teaches about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Enormous crowds followed him. Then he healed them all.
He used some astuteness to talk and they tested him, telling him that the law allows a man to divorce his wife for trivial reasons.
Jesus answered and said to them, "Have you not read that He who made them at the beginning made them male and female?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
They are no longer two, they are one. So the man should not separate what God has joined.
They said it was Moses who decided that a man could give his wife a divorce paper and walk away.
Jesus said, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts are hard. But it was not like that from the beginning."
Here's the killer. Any man who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery. A man can divorce his wife only if she has been unfaithful to him.
The students said that's how the relationship between a man and his wife should be, so it's better not to get married.
Jesus said, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining unmarried. Only those to whom it is given can live without marriage."
"For those who cannot have children because they were born that way, there are people who have adopted them. There are people who have made themselves like this to serve the Kingdom of Heaven. And those who can accept living this way, they must do so." They brought the children to Jesus.
They brought children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray over them. But the disciples rebuked them.
Jesus said, "Bring me the little children. Do not drive them away. The kingdom of heaven belongs to them."
Jesus laid his hands on them, and then departed from there. Jesus and the rich young man.
A man came to Jesus and asked, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?"
"Why do you ask me about what is good? Jesus answered. There is only one who is good. If you wish to enter the kingdom, obey the commandments."
The man said, "Which ones?" And Jesus answered, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness."
"Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) and "Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"I've heard the words and kept all the commandments," said the child. "What more do I need to do?"
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."
When my little son heard this, he went away sad. He was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "What I am telling you is true. It is hard for the rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
I kill you again, it's difficult for a camel to go through the eye of a needle. But it's even more difficult for the rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When the disciples heard this, they were astonished. And they said, "Who then can be forgiven?"
And Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter answered him, "We have left everything and followed you! What then will we have?"
"What I'm telling you now is true," Jesus told them. "When everything is renewed, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. And then, those of you who followed me will also sit on twelve thrones. You will judge the twelve tribes of Israel."
Everyone left their homes, families, and possessions behind, in order to receive one hundred times more. To also receive eternal life.
But many of the first will be last, and many of the last will be first.
"The Story of Currency in Paradise"
The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
He agreed to pay them the usual daily wage. Then, he took them to the vineyard.
With nine troubles in the morning, he went out again. He found people standing in the middle of the market doing something.
He told them, "You too, go work in my vineyards, and I will give you what you deserve."
He went out again around noon and at three o'clock and did the same thing.
With nearly five, he went out and found other people still wandering around. He asked them, "Why are you standing here all day long doing nothing?"
They answered him, "Because no one has hired us." He said to them, "You also go and work in my vineyard."
When night fell, Si Vine spoke to the man in charge of the service. He said, "Call the servers and pay them. Start with the last two who served. Then go to the first ones."
The workers who came with the five have arrived. Each of them received their daily wages as usual.
When the laborers came to work for the two brothers, they expected to be paid more. However, each of them also received the usual daily wage.
When they lifted her, they complained about her masters.
They said: 'Those people who worked yesterday only lasted one hour.' 'We paid them as we should. We did most of the work and endured the sun's heat all day.'
One of them answered, "He is the owner." And he said, "My friend, I have treated you fairly. Isn't it as we agreed that you would work a full day for the usual rate?"
Take your money and leave. I want to give others what I gave to you, it's only fair.
"My brother, don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Do you feel like I cheated you when I gave it away for free to others?"
He said to them, "The last will be first, and the first will be last." The Lord Jesus again spoke of his death.
Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. As they were walking along, he took the twelve disciples aside and began to speak to them.
He said, "We are going up to Jerusalem." "The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death."
"Then they give him to the people who are not Jewish. The people will mock him, beat him, and crucify him on a cross. On the third day, he will rise from the dead!" His mother asked Jesus about his request.
A woman named Zebedee came to Jesus. Her sons came with her. She knelt down and asked him for a favor.
"What do you want?" Jesus asked. She said, "Grant me that one of my two sons may sit at your right hand and the other at your left in your kingdom."
"You do not know what you are asking," Jesus said to them. "Can you drink the cup I am about to drink?" "We can," they answered.
Jesus said to them, "You will drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The other ten disciples heard about it. They were troubled like the two brothers.
Jesus called them together and said, "You know that the rulers in the Gentile world lord it over their people, and their high officials exercise power over them.
Don't act like that. Instead, whoever among you wants to be important must be your servant.
And whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave.
"Consider how man was created. He was not created to serve, but rather to serve others. He was created to give his life as a ransom to free many people." Two blind men regained their sight.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, two blind men following him.
One day, two men were sitting by the road. They heard that Jesus was passing by. They began to cry out: "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The crowd told them to stop, they told them to be quiet, but the people kept shouting, "O Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"
Jesus stood up and called out to them, saying, "What do you want me to do for you?"
They answered and said, "Lord, we wish to see."
Jesus was very concerned about them. He touched their eyes. In an instant, they could see. And they followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem.
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them,
He told them to go to the village ahead of them. When you get there, you will find a donkey tied up and its foal with it. Untie them and bring them to me.
If any of you speak to him, tell him my master needs them, and their master will send them right away.
This is so that the words they said in the name of the prophet might be fulfilled. It is written,
Say to the city of Zion, "Your king is coming to you; he is righteous and having salvation, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey." (Zechariah 9:9)
The disciples went and did what Jesus told them.
They came with a donkey and a colt, and they placed their belongings on them, and then our master Jesus mounted them.
And so the crowds spread out a great deal, spreading their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
Some of the people went ahead of him, and some followed. They all shouted, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up, and the people asked, "Who is this?"
The people answered, "This is Jesus. He is the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus drove out all who were selling and buying in the temple.
Jesus entered the temple. He began to drive out all the people who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers. He also overturned the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer' (Isaiah 56:7), but you have made it 'a den of robbers' (Jeremiah 7:11)."
Blind and disabled people came to Jesus in the temple. He healed them.
The chief priests and teachers of the law saw the miracles he did. They also saw children in the temple shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" When they saw this, they were indignant.
"What do you hear the children saying?" they asked him. "Yes," answered Jesus. "Haven't you read this scripture: 'You have taught the children and the infants to give you praise.'" (Psalm 8:2)
After Jesus had sent the multitudes away, He went up into the mountain alone and departed from the city. He spent the night there, and the fig tree withered.
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a carob tree by the road. He climbed it but found nothing but leaves. He then said to it, "If you don't bear fruit, you're not a carob tree at all." In an instant, the tree withered.
The students were puzzled. "How did this fig tree dry up so suddenly?" they asked.
Jesus answered, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
"If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer." Jesus' authority was questioned.
Jesus entered the temple courts, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. "By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked. "And who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered, "I will ask you one question. If you answer me, then I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
"Where then did John's baptism come from? From heaven, or from men?" And they reasoned among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'"
But what if we say, 'from among men'? We fear people. Everyone believes in the one who warns them, [thinking], "A prophet."
Jesus answered them, "I do not know him." Jesus said, "No, I will not tell you by what authority I do these things. The parable of the two sons
What do you think about this? A man has two sons. He went to the first and said, "My son, don't work today in the vineyard."
The boy replied: 'No, I won't do it.' Then, he changed his mind and left.
And he walked over to the other boy and said the same thing, and the boy replied, "Sure, uncle," but he didn't go.
"Who among you has not sinned?" they asked. "None," he answered. Then Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, tax collectors and prostitutes will enter the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John came to show you the right way to live, and you didn't believe him. But the tax collectors and prostitutes believed him. You saw this, but even then you didn't repent of your sins and believe. The story of the tenants.
Hear another parable. A man had a piece of land, and he planted a vineyard. He put a fence around it, dug a winepress in it, and built a tower. In the vineyard, there were some farmers. Then he went away on a journey.
When the time of the harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants, saying, "Pay me my rent."
As for the renters, they kidnapped his servant, beat one of them, killed another, and were about to kill the third by stoning him.
After the man sent another helper to the tenants, he sent even more than he had sent the first time. The tenants treated the man's helper in the same way.
And finally, he sent his son to them. He said, "Respect my son."
Then the tenants saw the son coming. They said to each other, "This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours."
My brother, they seized him, my brother, they dragged him from among the gardens, and then they killed him.
When the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do to these tenants?
"This will drive away evil people," they replied, "and then, the gardens will be rented to others. They will receive their due from the harvest."
Jesus said to them, "Did you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
Let me tell you plainly. May God remove it from you and transfer it to people who will bear fruit.
Everyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces. But this stone will fall on everyone who falls on it and crush them.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' stories. They knew who he was talking about.
They found no solution but to arrest him. But they were afraid of the people. Everyone was convinced that Jesus was a prophet.
The wedding feast story
And he told them other stories.
This is the Kingdom of Heaven. The King attended his son's wedding.
He sold his servant to the people he invited for dinner. The servant told them to come, but they refused.
And after that, he sent out some more slaves, and said to them, "Tell those whom you invite, 'The banquet is ready, the ox and the fat calf are roasted, and everything is prepared. Come to the wedding.'"
But of our servants, not one cared; one went to his work in the country, another went to his work.
And the rest of them joined their service, did all kinds of evil with them, and killed them.
The monster was very worried. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed the fighters and burned their city.
And afterward the king spoke to his servants, saying, "The wedding feast is ready. But those who were invited were not worthy to come.
Walk to the corners of the street. Invite anyone you meet for breakfast.
No, the servants went out into the street. They gathered every person they found, good and bad. The wedding hall was almost filled with people.
The king came to present the guests, and he noticed one who was not wearing wedding attire.
His friend asked him how he got there without a wedding suit, and the man had nothing to say.
And then the king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and his thighs. Throw him out into the darkness. The servants will weep and gnash their teeth."
Many are called, but few are chosen. Is it truly the end of taxes for Caesar?
The Pharisees went out and plotted to trap Jesus in his words.
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. They said, "Teacher, we know that you are a man of integrity. You teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't swayed by others, and you don't care how important they are.
Malā, qūlnā shnūwa rāyk? Yākhī yalzam nkhalsūo al-ḍarā'ib li-Qaysar wala lā?
But Jesus knew their evil intentions. He said to them, "You hypocrites, why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the money of the people that they pay in taxes. They brought him silver coins.
He said to them, "Whose picture is this, and whose words are these as well?"
"Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's."
When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away. The wedding took place at the time when the dead will be raised.
On the same day, the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They did not believe that people would be raised from the dead.
They said, "Teacher, this is what Moses told us: If a man dies and has no children, his brother must marry his wife and father children, so that his brother's name will not die out."
We were seven brothers. The first got married and died. He had no children, so he left his wife to his brother.
The same story happened to their second and third brother, and their tale even reached the seventh one among them.
In the end, the woman died.
Now, when the dead rise, who will you be? Seven of them were married to you.
Jesus answered and said to them, "You are wrong, because you do not know the Scriptures, nor the power of God.
When the dead rise, they will not marry. Nor will they be married to their fathers or mothers. They will be like the angels in Paradise.
And what about the dead? Didn't you read what God told you about them?
He said, "I am the Lord of Abraham, the Lord of Isaac, and the Lord of Jacob." (Exodus 3:6) "He is not the Lord of the dead, but the Lord of the living."
When the crowd heard this, they were astonished at his teaching. It was a central teaching.
The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus. So the Pharisees met together.
One of them was an expert in the law. He put a question to Jesus to test him.
"O teacher," he asked, "what is the most important commandment in the law?"
Jesus answered, "'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.' (Deuteronomy 6:5)"
This is the first and most important testament.
"Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
Everything written in the Sharia and the prophets is based on these two commandments. Who is the father of Jesus?
The Pharisees gathered together. Jesus asked them,
"What is your opinion about Christ? Whose son is he?" "The son of David," he answered.
He told them, "Why then does David call him 'Lord'? The Holy Spirit spoke through David." David said,
The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool." (Psalm 110:1)
"David called him my Lord, how could he be his son?"
To some extent, they could only answer with a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask them a question.
Jesus condemns the Pharisees and the elders of the people.
Jesus spoke to the people and his disciples.
He said, "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat."
You have to obey them. Do everything they tell you to do. But don't be like them. They don't practice what they preach.
They tie heavy loads and place them on the backs of others. But they are not willing to lift a finger to remove them.
Everything they do, they do so that others can see them. They wear small boxes filled with verses from the Holy Book on their foreheads and arms. They make the boxes very wide. And they wear very long fringes on their garments.
They like to stand in important places at meals. They also like to be in prominent positions in the synagogue.
They like it when someone greets them in the markets, and they love it when people call them "my Lord."
"But whoever it is who pressures you, tell them it's God? Your Lord was not Christ, we are all brothers and sisters."
Don't call anyone on earth "Father," for you have only one Father, and he is in heaven.
You don't need to be called a teacher. You have one teacher, and that is Christ.
The most important one among you will be your servant.
Everyone lifts themselves up so that another can bring them down, and then another comes to lift them up again.
"How terrible it will be for you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees! You are hypocrites! You lock people out of the Kingdom of Heaven; you yourselves do not enter, and you prevent those who want to enter."
(No
How pathetic this is for you, O teachers of the Sharia and the French! O hypocrites! You roam everywhere to extinguish one person's faith. Then you pounce on them like two sons of hell like you.
How stupid this is for you, you who are holding onto your eyes. You say, 'There was a swearer in the name of the temple, this means nothing. But anyone who swears in the name of the temple's gold must keep his oath.'
You're blind and foolish! What's more important? Gold or the structure that holds the gold?
You also say, 'How can anyone swear by the name of the altar, it means nothing. But when someone swears by the name of the gift that is on it, then they must keep their oath.'
Oh, you fools! Which is more important? The gift? Or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
Anyone who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.
And everyone who swears by the temple, swears by the temple and by the Lord who dwells in it.
And whoever swears by the sky, swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it.
How difficult it is for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin—but you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former.
O you hypocrites! Remove even the smallest insect from your food. Won't you even swallow a whole camel?
How terrible it is for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dishes, but inside you are full of greed and self-indulgence.
Blind Persian! Clean the inside of the glass and the plate. Then, the outside will also become clean.
How terrible you are, you teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but inside are full of dead people's bones and all sorts of impurity.
This is just a show with you. From the outside, you appear to be doing what you committed to. But from the inside, you are full of mistakes. You pretend to be something you're not.
How terrible you teachers of the law and Pharisees are! Hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.
And you said, "How was our life when the people before us were alive, we wouldn't act as they did, we wouldn't assist in the killing of the prophets."
Do not bear witness against yourselves, and admit that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
They have completed the sins that those before them had started.
O Ashush Al-Faawiyah, how will you escape the eternal sentence in the fire?
So, I am sending you prophets, sages, and teachers. That you may kill some of them, crucify some, and scourge some in your synagogues, and drive them from city to city.
So you will wipe out the blood of God's faithful people that is scattered over the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of Zechariah the son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
That's what I've been telling you is true. This is all going to happen to the people living now.
O Jerusalem! O Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. Many times I wished to gather your people together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!
Your house is empty.
"We say to you, no longer will you see me until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'" (Psalm 118:26)
Signs of the End Times
And Jesus went out of the temple, and as he was going, his disciples came to him to show him the temple.
"Do you see all this?" Jesus asked. "What I am about to tell you is true. Not one stone will be left standing on another; every stone will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. His disciples came to him privately and asked, "Tell us, when will this happen? What will be the sign of your coming, and of the end of the age?"
Jesus answered, "Be careful! Be on your guard against deceit.
Many will come in my name, saying, "I am the Christ!" and they will deceive many.
You hear about wars. You also hear people talking about future wars. Don't be afraid. Things have to happen. But the end is not here yet.
Sword against sword, kingdom against kingdom, people walking hungry, earthquakes in many places.
All these are the pains of the birth of Christ.
And then they will tell you to curse and kill. All nations will hate you because of me.
At this time, many people will turn away from their faith. They will hate each other. They will hand each other over to their enemies.
Many liars and false prophets will appear. They will deceive many people.
As evil increases, the majority's love will grow cold.
But he who endures to the end will be saved.
This good news of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.
Prophet Daniel speaks of the "abomination that desolates" (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11) on a day when you will see it standing in a holy place. The reader must understand this.
Alas, the people in Judah had to flee to the mountains.
Not even one person on the roof descends to his house without taking something.
No one is allowed to enter the field with their shoes on.
How terrible it is for children to be tied up like that! How terrible it is for breastfeeding children!
I pray to my Lord that you won't have to flee in winter or on Saturday.
You will suffer a great deal in these days, you will be worse off than anyone else from the beginning of the world until now, and there will never be anything like it again.
Time did not cut short, no one lived. But for the sake of God's chosen people, it will be shortened.
At that moment someone will say to you, "Look! Here is the Christ!" or, "There he is!" Do not believe it.
False messiahs and false prophets will appear. They will perform great signs and miracles. They will try to deceive the chosen people of God if possible.
Saw, I told you before.
It means, if someone tells you, 'He's far away in the desert,' don't go there. Or if someone tells you, 'He's deep inside the house,' don't believe it.
"The lightning that comes from the east we see in the west. So will the Son of Man appear."
Eagles gather wherever there is a carcass.
After the futile suffering that occurred in those days, "the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light. The stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will be shaken." (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
At that time, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. All the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with great power and glory.
That He may send His messengers with the trumpet's blast, so that they may gather His chosen servants from every direction, to bring them from one heaven to another.
Learn a lesson from the fig tree. As long as its branches start to soften and its leaves appear, you know that summer is near.
And in the same way, when you see all the things happening, you know the end is near, she is at the door.
What we're saying is true, and the people who were there won't die until all of this happens.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. No one knows the day or the hour.
To a certain extent, no one knows that day or hour. Even the angels in heaven do not know. The Son does not know. Only the Father knows.
Remember how it was in the days of Noah. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people ate and drank. They married. They gave their daughters in marriage. They did all these things until the day Noah entered the ark.
They knew nothing about what was going to happen until the flood came and swept them all away. That's how it will be when the Son of Man comes.
There are two men in the middle of the earth. One is pulled and the other is released.
Two women are grinding in a courtyard with their hands, one pulling and the other releasing.
Keep your eyes open. You don't know when the day of the Lord will come.
You need to understand one thing. Imagine the owner of the house knows what time at night the thief comes. He'll be on the lookout. He won't let his house be burglarized.
That means you too must be ready. For the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
Imagine a master who appoints one of his slaves as the supervisor over the other slaves in his household. The slave's task is to feed the others at the right time. The master favors an honest and wise slave for this task.
This will be good for the servant when he starts working and taking care of his place until the owner returns.
What we're saying is true. The teacher will make this servant responsible for his entire house.
"Won't someone come to help this poor servant? Someone who blames himself and says, 'My master is taking too long to return.'"
Imagine that he doesn't hit other servants. And imagine that he eats and drinks with people who get very drunk.
The master of the servants, when he returns one day, the servants do not think of him. When he returns, at an hour, the servants do not know.
And after Sebou, the master cut him into pieces and sent him to the place where liars go. People go there with complaints and grind their teeth in anger.
A Tale of Ten Maids
This is how the kingdom of heaven will be at that time. Ten virgins took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them are donkeys. Five are sensible.
The donkeys shook their lanterns, but they didn't shake the oil.
The clever ones poured oil into pans and shook their spoons.
The bride waited for the groom for a long time, and her friends all got tired and fell asleep.
In the middle of the night, the servant wept and said, "The groom! He has come to meet us!"
And then all the bridesmaids woke up and prepared candles.
Fools said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil. Our lamps are going out."
He replied: 'No. There might not be enough for all of us. Instead, go to the oil sellers and buy some for yourselves.'
So they walked down the aisle. As they were walking, the groom arrived. The ready bridesmaids entered with him to the wedding reception. Then the door was closed.
Then, the rest of the servants came. "Sir! Sir!" they said. "Open the door for us!"
They replied: "What we're telling you is true. We don't know you."
Be careful. You don't know the day or the hour when the bridegroom will come. The parable of the three servants.
And again, this is how the kingdom of heaven is. A man decided to travel. He called his servants and put them in charge of his possessions.
He gave $10,000 to one man. He gave $4,000 to another. And he gave $2,000 to the third. The man gave each servant the amount of money he knew the servant could manage. Then he went on his journey.
The maid who took $10,000, packed her bags and invested her money in another job. She made an additional $10,000.
He who has four dollars in profit, gains four more.
As for the man who stole two thousand dollars, he walked away and dug a hole in the ground. He hid the money in it.
After a long time, the master of these slaves returned. He wanted to collect all the money they had earned.
The man who took $10,000 brought the other $10,000. He said, "Sir, you trusted me with $10,000. Here I have made another $10,000."
Answer the master: "You have done well, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful in a few things. Now I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's joy!"
Walid came to me with four thousand dollars. He said, "Teacher, you trusted me with four thousand dollars. Here I have made an additional four thousand dollars."
"Well done, good and faithful servant!" his master replied. "You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!"
And the man who took the two thousand dollars said, "My lord, I knew you were a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering crops where you did not plant seeds."
I didn't care. I went out and dropped your two thousand dollars on the ground. I saw that's what you deserved.
Master replied: "You servant, you evil and lazy one! Do you think you know where we reap what we did not sow? Do you know where we gather the harvest where we did not scatter the seeds?"
Alright then, you should have deposited my money in the bank. When I return, I'll take it back with interest added.
And he said to his servants, 'Take away the thousand pieces of silver from him, and give it to the one who has ten thousand pieces of silver.'
Everyone has something to give and more to add until it's gone. But what about those who have nothing? Even those who have something, it's taken away from them.
Get rid of that stupid servant. He's going around in the dark, making people sigh and grind their teeth. Sheep and goats.
The Son of Man is going to come in his full glory. All the angels will come with him. Then he will sit on his glorious throne.
All the people will gather before him. He will separate them like sheep and goats. He will be like a shepherd who separates the sheep from the goats.
He puts the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right, "Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world."
I was hungry, and you gave me food. I was thirsty, and you gave me drink. I was a stranger, and you welcomed me.
I needed things. And you gave them to me. I was sick. And you followed me. I was in prison. And you visited me.
And then the righteous will answer, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you? When did we see you thirsty and give you a drink?'
When did we see you a stranger and not invite you in? When did we see you in need of clothes and not give them to you?
When did we see you sick or in prison that we might visit you?
The king replied, "What I am about to say is true. Anything I have done for one of the least of my sister's servants, I have done for you."
Then he said to the left, "You are cursed; depart from me into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels."
I got hungry. But you didn't give me anything to eat. I got thirsty. But you didn't give me anything to drink.
I was a stranger. But you did not introduce me. I needed things. But you didn't give me anything. I was sick and in prison. But you did not visit me.
"Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty and not help you? When did we see you a stranger or in need of clothes or sick or in prison and not help you?"
To answer, "What I'm going to say is true. I haven't done anything for any of them, not even the smallest thing, that I haven't done for you."
And then they will be dragged to be punished in the Hereafter. But those who did what is right will receive eternal life.
Plan to kill Christ
Jesus finished saying these things, and then he said to his disciples,
As you know, the Passover is in two days. The Son of Man is to be handed over to be crucified.
Then the chief priests met with the elders and plotted against Jesus in the court of the high priest Caiaphas.
They made a plan to entrap Jesus in his words, so that they could accuse him. They wanted to kill him.
But this year, they said that people will come and cause trouble for the woman who pours perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of a man named Simon, who had a skin disease.
A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster jar filled with very expensive perfume. She poured it on his head while he was at the table.
The pupils, when they saw this, cheated. "Why this waste?" they asked.
The perfume was sold at a high price. The money was donated to the poor.
Jesus knew this. So he said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a good thing for me."
There will always be poor people among you. But I will not always be with you.
They overwhelmed me with the smell of pâté to prepare me for burial.
What we are telling you is true. What he did will be told everywhere, so that this good news can be spread throughout the whole world. It will be told on her anniversary. Judas agrees to hand over Jesus.
One of the Twelve went to the chief priests. His name was Judas Iscariot.
He said to them, "What will you give me, and I will deliver Jesus to you?" They counted out thirty pieces of silver for him.
And after the supper, Judas, who was one of the twelve, came with a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people. The Last Supper
This was the day before the Passover, when the Jews were to eat unleavened bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to go to prepare for you to eat the Passover meal, the unleavened bread?"
Answer, "Go to the house of a certain servant and say to him, 'The master says, "My time is near. I will hold the Passover dinner at your house with my disciples." ' "
The disciples did as Jesus had told them. They prepared the Passover meal.
When night fell, we found our master at the dinner table with the twelve.
While they were eating, he said, "What I am about to tell you is true. One of you will hand me over to my enemies."
The pupils were very sad. One by one, they said to him, "Not me, Lord, is it?"
Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand with me in the dish, he will betray me.
"The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised." "Woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born."
Judas is the one who will betray me. He said, "Not me, Lord, is it?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is you."
When they were at the meal, Jesus took bread, gave thanks, and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is my body."
And then he took the cup, thanked and praised them. He said to them, "All of you drink from this cup."
This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for the forgiveness of the sins of many.
This is what I told you. From now on, I will not drink wine with you until the day I drink it with you in my Father's kingdom.
They sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said to Peter, "You will deny me."
Jesus said to them, "This night, you will all stumble because of Me. For it is written, 'The Lord says, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)
But after we rise from the dead, we will outshine you in glory.
Replied Peter, "Everyone else might leave because of you. Not me, though."
Jesus answered, "What I am about to tell you is true. This very night, before the cock crows, you will disown me three times."
But Peter said, "I will never die with you! I will never say I don't know you." And they all said the same thing. Jesus prayed in Gethsemane.
After that, Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane. He told them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
And he took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him. And he began to be sorrowful and very troubled.
Then he said to them, "My spirit is very sorrowful. I feel as if I am about to die. Stay here. Keep watch with me."
A little later, he fell on his face and prayed, "Lord, you could have removed this cup of suffering from me. But your will, not mine, be done."
After he returned to his disciples, he found them sleeping. He began to ask them one by one, "You men, could you not keep watch with me for even one hour?" Then he turned to Peter.
"Be careful and continue. Don't let them test you, don't make a mistake. The intention is there. But the body is weak."
For the second time he went away, knelt down, and prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not what I want but what you want."
And then he returned. Once again, he found them sleeping. Eyes that could not be opened.
So he left the boys and went away again. And this is the third time he has prayed for the same thing.
And he came to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of sinners."
Come on! Let's go! That's the one who hands me over to them! Jesus, arrest him!
While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. A large crowd was with him, armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Judas, who was about to betray Jesus, had made an agreement with them on a signal. "The one I will kiss is the man," he said. "Seize him."
And Judas went immediately to Jesus and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered and said, "Friend, do what I have come to do." Then the men came forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' disciples pulled out his sword, struck the high priest's servant, and cut off his ear.
Jesus said, "Put your sword in its place. Everyone who takes the sword will die by the sword."
I wonder if I can ask Dad to help me? But he gives more than 70,000 words to the angels in a moment.
But how do prophecies come true? They tell you it has to happen this way.
At that time, Jesus said to the people, "Have I come with a sword and a staff to conquer you?" He added, "Is it necessary for you to come to me with swords and clubs to arrest me? Every day, I sat in the midst of the
"But all this is happening so that the words of the prophets might be fulfilled." After all this, his disciples all fled and ran away. Jesus went forward to face the Sanhedrin.
The men who had arrested Jesus brought him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
Not long after, Peter followed Jesus. He walked as far as the high priest's courtyard. He went in and sat down with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.
But they didn't find any evidence, and there were even many mistaken witnesses. In the end, there were two other witnesses.
They said, "This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Will you not answer? What is it that these men testify against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us, are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
"Yes, it is as you say," Jesus answered. "But I tell you all, there are coming days when you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "You have done a great evil! Why did you need any more witnesses? You have heard him say it yourself!"
What's your opinion? He must die, answer them.
And then they spat in his face. They slapped him. Others continued to curse him.
They said, "Predict for us, Christ! Who hit you?" Peter said he didn't know Jesus.
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A servant came to him and said, "You were also with Jesus of Galilee."
But in front of everyone, Peter told me he wasn't. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.
And then he went out to the gate that led to the middle of the house. Another woman saw him there. She told the people, "The two of them were with Jesus from Nazareth."
Again he said it wasn't him. He even said, "I swear, I don't know the man!"
After a while, the people standing there went to Peter. They said to him, "You must be one of them, because your accent gives you away."
And then Peter started cursing himself, swearing, and told them, "I don't know that man at all." Right away, the rooster crowed.
And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said to him, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times." And he went out and wept bitterly.
Judas hangs himself.
Early in the morning, all the chief priests and elders of the people decided that Jesus should die.
They tied him up and dragged him. Then they handed him over to Pilate, who was the governor.
Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned to death. He felt great remorse and sadness for what he had done. So he returned the thirty pieces of silver that he had been given to the chief priests and elders.
"I made a mistake," he said. "I handed over a slave who wasn't guilty." "And what does that have to do with us?" they replied. "That's your problem."
What Judas did was throw the money in the temple and leave. Then he went and hanged himself.
The chief priests scoffed at the money. They said, "It's against the law to put this money in the temple treasury. It's blood money. It was paid for the death of a man."
So they decided to use the money to buy a plot of land from the potter. People from other countries were coming to be buried there.
That's why they still call it the Field of Blood.
And the words which Jeremiah the prophet spoke have come to pass. They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him who was valued by the sons of Israel,
"They paid me thirty pieces of silver, the price set by the Lord for a slave, and I took the silver and bought the potter's
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus answered.
But when the chief priests and elders complained about him, he did not answer them.
Then Pilate asked him, "Do you not hear the charges they are bringing against you?"
But Jesus answered nothing. The governor marveled greatly.
Every year at Easter, the governor releases one prisoner to walk free. The people choose who.
At that same time they had a famous prisoner named Barabbas.
When the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Whom do you want me to release to you, Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Pilate knew that their chiefs were jealous of him, and he knew that this was the reason they handed Jesus over.
When Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message. She said, "Have nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to kill Jesus.
The governor said, "Which one do you want me to release, one of the two?" "Barabbas," they answered.
"What shall we do then with Jesus who is called Christ?" asked Pilate. They all answered, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What has he done wrong?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere with them, and that they were becoming restless. So he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood. It is your responsibility."
Answer everyone, "We and our children will accept that we are guilty of his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas. But he flogged Jesus, and then handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
The governor's soldiers took Jesus to the Praetorium, which they called the Praetorium. All the other soldiers gathered around him.
They stripped him of his clothes and dressed him in a purple robe.
After twisting together a crown of thorns, they placed it on his head, and put a reed in his right hand. Then they knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!"
And he fell to the ground, and they hit him on the head with a stick once and twice.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him of his robe. They dressed him in his clothes, and then led him away to crucify him. Jesus is crucified.
As they were leaving the city, they met a man from Cyrene named Simon. They compelled him to carry his cross.
They came to a place called Golgotha. Golgotha means the place of the skull.
They mixed wine with a little gall and offered it to Jesus to drink. When he tasted it, he would not drink it.
When they crucified him, they divided his clothes among them.
They sat and stayed there all night.
They put a sign above his head that read: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
They crucified him with two thieves, one on his right and one on his left.
And the people who passed by shouted at Jesus, mocked him, and shook their heads.
He said, "So you will destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days? Save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"
How, how, the high priests, the scholars of the law, and the elders laughed at him.
They said, "He saved others," "But he cannot save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
He is confident in my Lord. And my Lord, He will save him, God willing. He said, "I am the son of my Lord."
Exactly, the thieves who were crucified with Jesus also taunted him. Jesus died.
From noon until three in the afternoon, the whole country was plunged into darkness.
With a loud cry, Jesus said, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1)
So the people who were standing by and heard it said, "He is calling for Elijah."
Immediately, one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
The rest said: "Let him go, let's see if Elijah comes to save him."
After Jesus cried out loudly again, he died.
At that moment, the temple's curtain was torn in two, from top to bottom. The ground shook. The rocks cracked.
The graves were opened. Many bodies of holy people who had died rose.
They came out of the tombs. After God resurrected Jesus, they went to Galilee. There, many people appeared.
The Roman commander and the people who were crucifying Jesus saw that earthquake and saw everything that happened. They were very afraid and said, "Certainly this was the Son of God!"
Not far away, many women were watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for him and meet his needs.
And Mary Magdalene was there. And Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee's children, were also there, watching from a distance. They buried Jesus.
When the world was darkened, a rich man came from the land of Arimathia. His name was Joseph. He did not follow our Lord Jesus.
And Pilate went out and asked for the body of Jesus. And Pilate commanded that it be given to him.
Joseph shook the body and wrapped it in a clean shroud.
They laid him in a new tomb hewn out of the rock. They rolled a big stone across the entrance to the tomb. Then he went away.
Mary Magdalene and the other women were sitting there looking toward the tomb. The tomb guards
The next day, which was the day after the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
Sir, they said, we remember what this liar said while he was still alive. He said, "In three days I will rise."
"No, give orders for the tomb to be secured until the third day. If you don't do this, his disciples may come and steal the body, and then tell people that Jesus has been raised from the dead. This last lie will be worse than the first."
Pilate answered, "Take a few soldiers with you." He added, "Go. Make the tomb secure to prevent the disciples from coming and stealing his body."
They went and marked the grave, put a seal on the tomb, and placed guards.
Christ has risen.
It was still dark. It was dawn on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
A strong earthquake occurred. An angel came down from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled away the stone and sat on it.
Shining with the approach of dawn, his clothes white as snow.
The guards were so scared that they trembled and became almost dead.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.
Not here! He's gone, just as he said! Come see the place where he was lying.
"Go quickly! Tell your students, 'The teacher is no more. Now you must go to Galilee. You will see him there.' That's what I've told you."
The woman runs from the grave. They are afraid but happy. They run to tell the students.
One day Jesus met them and said, "Peace be upon you." They replied, "Greetings," and bowed down to him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. They will see me there." The guards went and reported this to the chief priest.
While the women were walking, some guards entered the city. They told the chief priests everything that had happened.
When the chief rabbis met with the elders, they came up with a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
They told the soldiers, "We want you to say, 'Your students came at night. They stole while we were sleeping.'
The governor was hearing this report, so we give him money to keep quiet, and that will keep you out of trouble.
The soldiers divided the clothes among themselves and did as they were told. This story spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus' last commands to his disciples.
After Jesus and his eleven disciples went to Galilee. They went to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they worshiped him. But he has no mind of his own.
Then Jesus came to the disciples and said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
You shall not go away and leave your disciples from every nation. Baptize them in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And be sure that I am always with you, even to the end."
John the Baptist is coming in the way.
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
"Behold, I will send my messenger before you, who shall prepare your way before you." (Malachi 3:1)
"A voice cries out in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
And so John came. He baptized people in the wilderness. And he also told people that they should be baptized and repent of their sins. And then God would forgive them.
All the people from the Judean countryside went out to him, and all the people of Jerusalem also went out to him. When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John wore clothes made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
"After me comes one who is mightier than I. I am not worthy even to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals."
"They will baptize you in the Holy Spirit. Jesus is baptized and tempted."
At that time, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee. He was baptized in the Jordan River by John.
Jesus was coming up out of the water. At that moment, he saw the heavens opening and the Holy Spirit descending on him like a dove.
A voice from heaven spoke to him, saying, "You are my beloved Son, in you I am well pleased."
In that moment, the Holy Spirit sent Jesus into the wilderness.
He was in the desert for forty days. The devil tempted him. Wild animals did not harm Jesus. Angels took care of him. Jesus chose his first disciples.
After they put John in prison, Jesus went to Galilee. He preached the gospel of the Kingdom of God.
He said, "The time has come. The kingdom of my God is near. Repent of your sins and believe in the good news!"
One day, our Lord Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the sea; they were fishermen.
"Come, follow me," said Jesus, "and I will make you fishers of men."
In a jar, they shook their nets and followed him.
After some time, Jesus walked on. When He walked, He saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in their boat mending their nets.
Instead of resting, they went after him. Jesus drives out an evil spirit.
Jesus and the people with him went to Capernaum. When the Sabbath came, he went into the synagogue and began to teach.
People were amazed by his teachings. He taught them as someone with authority. He didn't speak like someone who had studied Sharia law.
At that moment, a man in the crowd cried out. He was possessed by an evil spirit. And he said,
"What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!"
"Be silent," Jesus said firmly. "Come out of him."
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Then it left him with a scream.
All the people were amazed and began to ask each other, "What is this? A new teaching! And with great power! Even the evil spirits hear it and obey it."
News about Jesus spread quickly throughout all the region of Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and his companions left the synagogue. They went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's old wife was lying on the bed. She had a fever. They told her about Jesus.
He walked to her, took her hand, and helped her stand up. The heat escaped from her. And now she's serving them.
That night, after the sun had set, the people brought all the sick and those possessed by demons to Jesus.
All the people in the city gathered in front of the gate.
And Jesus healed many of them. They had various diseases. He also cast out many demons. But he would not let them speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prayed in a solitary place.
The morning began very early while the world was still dark. Our Lord Jesus got up and left the house. He walked to a place where he could be alone. He prayed there.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they called out, "The club is turning against you."
Jesus said, "Let's go somewhere else. I want to go to the nearby towns. I need to preach there as well. That's why I came."
So he walked and turned in every place in Galilee. And he preached in their synagogues. And he also cast out demons. Jesus healed a servant who had a skin disease.
A leper came to Jesus, kneeling down and begging him, "If you choose, you can make me clean."
Yassine was very worried. He reached out and touched the man. He said, "I agree to do this." "Be 'clean'!"
In the place of sickness, count it as a blessing. Healed.
"Felix is still in his hour. And he gave men a strong warning."
"Don't tell this to anyone," he said. "Go and show yourself to the priest. Offer the sacrifices commanded by Moses. This will be evidence for the priest and the people that you are clean."
As soon as the man left, he started talking openly and spread the news to everyone. Therefore, Jesus could no longer enter the city openly. He remained outside in desolate places. But people kept coming to him from everywhere.
Jesus heals a servant who cannot walk.
After some days, Jesus again entered Capernaum. The people heard that he had come to the house.
The people who gathered were so many that there was no room, not even outside the door. And Jesus preached the word to them.
Four of the people who came didn't move a muscle.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and lowered the man on a mat.
They did not believe in him. So he said to the man, "My child, your sins are forgiven."
And he was a bit like the Sharia scholars, as they thought.
Why is that man talking like that? He's saying something really bad! Only God can forgive sins!
At that moment, Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to them, "Why are you thinking about these things?"

As Jesus passed by, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he said to him. Levi got up and followed him.
After this, Jesus was dining at the house of Levi. Many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with Him and His disciples. They were part of the large crowds that followed Jesus.
Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to him, "Why do you eat with tax collectors and sinners?"

One Sabbath, Jesus went to the synagogue. There was a man there who had a withered hand.
Some of the Pharisees were watching Jesus closely, looking for a mistake. They focused on him, wanting to know if he would heal the man on the Sabbath day.
Jesus spoke to the man with the short, crooked hand. He said, "Stand up in front of everyone."
And after, our master Jesus asked them and said, "What does the law say we should do on the Sabbath day? Should we do good or evil? Should we save life or destroy it?" But no one answered.

Jesus entered a house. Once again, a large crowd gathered. It was so large that Jesus and his disciples could not even eat.
