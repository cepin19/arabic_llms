khoa I want you, I want you too.
khoa! Sultan, what are you saying?
Loss! This is an opportunity we must not let pass us by.
And after all, I don't interfere. This is my right; I take it. You have the right to take it before me.
khoa Allah, have mercy on your parents, don't bring us problems.
Salih, don't be ...... God forgive me!
Please, does a brother advise his brother based on what you say?
khoa I'm hungry.
And I found a great determination.
The holiday isn't anyone's property.
Tell it to yourself.
This Eid will not come again.
Don't be a jerk, Saleh!
And take the opportunity from us
No, no, no, no, don't try to convince me, it's impossible, impossible, I won't do it.
The problem is that he's afraid.
What are you afraid of?
This is a government project! Everyone takes.
This is the rule!
Even those who don't participate benefit from it.
He is the head of a huge project.
This means he's in control.
Third Millennium Global Beaches, more precisely, the first phase of the infrastructure.
O fool.
This is a place we can loot!
If he refuses to take
Who gave you the right?
You have no right to exploit her.
His car isn't working today.
Who was supposed to take him to the project site? Wasn't it me?
No, if that's the case, you're right.
Who gives you money to fill up your car four and five times!
Leave it to me.
Don't be foolish and stubborn.
Take advantage.
Look at Uncle Thursday.
And now, as they say, he's called a millionaire.
A third of the project,
The second third is a commission.
One who plays in a popular band,
They say there was a national celebration.
And he bought a hundred torches.
You know what they've done.
Added zero.
No use, auntie.
"May God guide him if he wants."
Let's eat with him.
I spent last night trying to convince him.
It's an opportunity.
For the greater good.
And if God wills good to prevail.
This is common.
Keep it between us.
Don't tell anyone about this.
Do we need to worry?
Just my friends
Neck headache.
The man began to change his mind.
I spoke to him today.
Two-hour morning.
He began to be convinced.
We have a meeting with him in a bit.
And we need to convince him.
He's cutting our salaries.
Let's try to change his mind at the meeting.
Brother Ali, Brother Osman.
I don't know.
Today is my first day at work.
Calculate for Ali.
How dare you!
Sure. But are you sure I'll get some?
Father, I ask you.
If you're hungry and walking in the street
Are you eating or not?
I am a person who eats a lot.
Don't worry.
The plate is large.
Still working on the draft for the meeting.
If you are okay,
If you have any concerns
What I want to know
It's legitimate.
May God guide you, Saleh.
This is reasonable because you are a leader for the first time in your life.
The topic is very simple.
We're putting down our share.
In the project budget?!
What do you think?
That's why we don't want anyone to suspect what we're doing.
So we can put our share as a separate topic!
This amount of money was looted.
By the people responsible for the project.
It's not possible.
No, no, no! Oh! Alright!
You know how these things happen.
But you seem to have some concerns.
Their right
First of all,
Everything is in our hands.
I told you he's lying.
What's wrong with you?
He says the new car is his friend's, and you believe him.
He said it!
We say, for example, that it's his friend's car.
In a very special place yet!
Except for a very rich man.
I didn't hear this talk from people.
He told me that he bought the land and registered it in his name.
He said, "Please."
He has money now.
Now he's going to start lying.
Aren't we his family?
Is this it?
Aren't we doing anything?
In the end, we won't get anything!
He wants to eat it all by himself.
Don't shake your head!
Neither she nor her brother
Sit down and everything will be fine.
I spent the whole night with him.
I told him, "No matter what, these are your friends."
Finally, he agreed.
This is what should be.
And God willing, you won't take it all at once.
This is the third millennium of global beaches.
Especially the infrastructure.
Then they'll start the second phase.
And you continue with him.
May God reward you with good.
Good thing you pressured him into agreeing.
You're no different from them.
No problem.
I hope you explained it to him.
We want a percentage.
They all take a percentage.
Until he said after I convinced him.
They want their team to attend a meeting to finalize the project budget.
They need to follow up, it's their money.
We sat down and were certain of this.
Submit it as soon as possible so they can approve it.
Take your time.
Who is this? Do you know him?
He's a relative who's in business with me.
You mean that
Responsible for doors, windows, and everything related to finishing.
Fine, fine.
How much do you want to finish?
How much do you charge?
Which is that we take the money.
Let's give ourselves a week to think about it.
And we determine the value of the money we receive.
You have people waiting for you and they want some.
Abdulaziz Sadeq.
If someone decides to take half a million,
This week, everyone is thinking straight.
They specify the amount they want.
By next week, they'll have made up their minds and decided how much they want.
Not up to you.
Then, it's up to you?
Let him go.
Hello, guys, what's up?
I don't know what he's doing here.
Hello! Who encouraged you to take on this project?
This is a government project.
Is Sultan your brother's name?
This is our neighbor's driver.
Sometimes he drives us when my car is broken.
Write.
Abdullah's document.
No, no, there are still three more.
What else can I do, I'm bored of it.
I told him, "Alright, brother, let's discuss the budget and get it over with."
No, no, this takes a sum of money.
How much do I give him?
Oh my love, he has kids!
He has 25,400.
Four hundred
They add it by force.
How much are you giving them!
This is too much.
That's my mom we were just talking about.
Oh, Mom.
No, no, no, this is the last one! Oh, my son!
Oh no! My son, you want to go to Thailand for treatment.
Wait, wait, what happened?
Why are you upset?
But from the first stage, the infrastructure specifically.
Not used
Add three thousand.
Buy me watches from Thailand, the ones with shiny strass.
You added them?
Oh, Mom.
No, Mom, I didn't add her, I just wanted to make sure of the name.
Dear mother of mine
Let's increase our determination.
The budget needs to be set; it can't be open-ended like this.
Tomorrow is the last meeting and everyone needs to decide how much money they want.
I made this.
Is a million enough!
Gali's son
Oh! Youth, oh! Youth, wait, there's noise, give us a chance.
The committee is in a meeting right now to approve the project's budget. Financial matters are not discussed right now, it's too late.
My father is tall.
You told us not to disgrace us in the ministry's courtyard.
Oh, we're just screaming, don't draw attention to us.
If anyone asks, tell them we're all here.
We'll tell him the power is out or there's a lightning strike.
Don't make noise, this is the ministry's courtyard.
Silence %pw Silence %pw
Thread it! I hear you!
How much is the budget now?
Without my brother
Altogether, fifty million.
Fifty million only for the first phase.
How much does it cost now?
His name is Saleh.
Participation is a concern, human!
In general, cheers.
Hurry up, let's get to work, all the beneficiaries are waiting.
No problem, the most important thing is that we don't want any discussions. Let them agree on the budget and that's it.
And you'll start implementing them from tomorrow.
It serves a very large segment of society.
God bless you, this is the International Millennium Beach Project.
This is the first stage.
More precisely, the infrastructure.
This is the right of future generations.
Absolutely, and on behalf of the program's team, I'd like to greet you and congratulate you on the launch of the project tomorrow, as far as I know.
It took us a million and a half years.
One and a half years
Once again, in the name of the Future Achievements Program,
This project
And future generations
May God perpetuate the blessing of oil upon us.
Second, third, and tenth stage.
The deputy
Welcome!
Why did they gather us here? When will they come to pick us up?
What? Where does Len need to take us?
Praise be to God, I have grown up and gone senile.
Let's sit down, the sun is hot.
Yes, cute girl.
But I don't see anything.
Anything but the sea.
Why did they isolate you?
Eman told me that my sister Manira is here.
My father's land in the countryside
I expect from the one who lied to her and gave her incorrect information.
This is not that land.
I saw a farm in the distance and thought it was your father's farm.
And then why do you ask about these things?
Do you have brothers?
Those who work and invest in land, real estate, companies, and exert effort.
I don't have a headache.
You've disappointed me, Iman.
And also my sister.
How don't you know?
They have to give it to me.
These are your brothers.
"And the truth is better than nothing."
For the money.
And now we're helping her and taking her to the hospital.
I don't know how many years she spent fighting her brothers in court.
Nine or ten years, no more.
No, thanks.
The brothers of Umm Salim are thieves.
Poor thing, she was telling me yesterday.
She wants to build a mosque before she dies.
You don't know.
I'm not saying your brothers are like hers, God willing they're not.
How many years has it been since my father died?
Why are you asking now?
She saw the farm.
What else do you want?
Not every three months is a check deposited into her account.
Oh, Falcon, calm down a bit so we can understand the situation first.
It's not up to her.
If another person, his sisters wouldn't get even a single penny.
I got it.
Where from?
It's not my money.
Did you see that, my moon?
Please see it.
Becomes fifty thousand
Because I was brave and asked about my father's land in the desert.
Sure that my share is more than this.
Everyone lives in villas like these.
Their children are in the best schools.
What can I say, Manira, oh!
I won't stop until I get my rights.
I'll take my rights.
"We should invest your money in the company!" "No, thank you."
Everyone is fighting with each other.
People have lost their compassion.
Don't think your brothers are better than mine.
Look at me.
Twenty years
I used to go to the court a lot.
And in the end
I didn't get anything out of it.
Why do they do this?
That's why I'm telling you, my dear, be nice to them.
Treat them well.
And I get bored of them.
Why do courts take so long?
We are four hundred thousand altogether.
If we reach a million like other countries.
I doubt, by God, that the dear one will issue an order.
Look, my brothers.
By God, I don't want all this.
What can I say, my love?
"All I can say is 'Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji'un' (To Allah we belong and to Him we shall return)."
"According to Allah, and He is the best disposer of affairs for us."
Didn't you have a court hearing last week?
As usual, oh dear!
The judge asked us to write a memorandum.
We've gone through this many times.
The rich are spending millions and millions, you're just watching them.
And as I told you, you'll become a judge.
And we won't take your rights.
That's why I'm telling you, if I were in your shoes.
I'm satisfied with what they give me.
Because this time
We owe you nothing.
Men are asking about you!
She has a little bit.
Just a few questions about her share and
She just wants to know something and leave.
If you can get it.
I'm dragging you and showing you.
He knows her way.
I signed a waiver.
"She has fifty-two years, and her husband works."
Take it or forget it.
Why are you asking now?
He's just greedy.
It's like it's not real.
It's my father's inheritance, and I want to decide how much of it I should take or leave.
It's not necessarily my decision or his decision.
This is God's command.
Why are they tormenting my father in his grave?
I didn't expect that from them.
For the money.
Thirty years ago.
I don't know what to do, Nasser.
Land, buildings, and real estate are easy to understand.
I don't know how much they charge.
Even the company,
It's your right to go and ask about everything.
I won't leave them alone.
How do you get back to them?
Not up to you.
And it's not up to you anymore, I have the right to know everything.
The input
Your sister entrusted him.
The one who is allowed to search for everything in the company.
Falcon, Saad
Shouting at us
Falcon only
Brother Nasser
Allow me to take
Yes, sir.
Go now.
Excuse me, secret.
Don't give him a reason to attack us.
Now, if he goes and files a complaint against us,
He said you hit him.
Shall we let him do what he wants?
He has an official document.
Official! We can't stop him.
He has the legal right to search everything.
If he would just take a look at the budget and accounts.
We give her forty thousand every three months.
If he examines the budget,
Multiply twelve by eight.
Divide it by three.
Thirty-two
You know how much.
This is what we have with her.
Except for lands and projects
We are free to do what we want.
We have nothing to fear, so let's not be afraid.
If he is convinced, that's what came out with us. If he is convinced, welcome him.
Let them go and behave.
They only give their sisters enough money to live on.
She is married.
She has a real man she can rely on.
What do you want to do with the money?
This is what should have been from the beginning.
Yes, Your Highness
On his own accord
Even my desk.
Brother Rashid, this should have happened before.
As you wish, my father.
File by file
The day I inherited her actual estate,
Villas and lands that you didn't know about
And they came out seven.
They became forty.
She didn't know.
Poor thing, she was shocked.
It's not possible.
Don't leave them alone.
Please, my son, I don't want to hear about courts.
The more you care.
The less the judge speaks, the better.
For half a minute
And then he says his usual phrase,
"I don't know about the seventh, fourth, and two thousand."
They will be very happy, my son.
You must never get out of bed, ever, mom.
May God heal you.
No, no, take your time and come.
Nasser and my sister Monir
After we slammed the door and kicked him out of the company
He sends one of my schoolmates.
His name is Abdullah.
And now
I won't allow it.
Does it mean that he can influence them?
Inshallah
AAA
Do not rely on fate.
The courts only have the reports.
Delays, arguments, and failed lawyers
The years passed.
And time passes by.
Wambia got a real one.
God have mercy on the mother of the peaceful ones.
You advised me the day before she died.
Never judge.
Our judge said
She died without taking anything from her inheritance.
She died and the judge still hasn't resolved her case.
Why don't we become like other countries?
Hala Abdullah
Brother Abdullah
Years passed.
This is my brother Saad.
May God increase your honor.
The most important thing
Brotherhood
Brother Rashid
You are a brother to me.
Don't neglect material problems.
Do you have anything else to talk about besides my sister?
No problem.
Why tell him not to speak?
He is honest.
They don't even want me to take my share of my father's inheritance.
My mother told me yesterday that my brother Saad's wife had passed away.
Her father works as a messenger at the ministry.
It's all my father's money.
We've been waiting for a long time.
Let's try one last time.
You sent them your spring, Abdullah.
They didn't respect him, they even expelled him.
Let's see what Sheikh Abdulrahman is going to do.
He is like a good man.
Surely Nasser said.
What you need to do
Threaten them with the law.
Did you forget the words of the mother of the poor about the courts?
The brothers of Umm Sulaym might not be afraid of courts.
Just my brothers
He might be afraid of gossip.
They might be embarrassed to go to court.
To wait and see what will happen after Sheikh Abdulrahman's visit to them.
God bless you.
Is this the Friday sermon?
If you don't have it, get lost.
What are you saying, my son?
He tells the truth.
Go away, %pw go
I'm going to court tomorrow morning.
Why do I have to wait until after tomorrow?
I decide, not you.
What happens if I wait until tomorrow?
Welcome, my brother Rashid.
This is a promise.
I've told you before.
Let's scare them with the law.
And now he's begging me to postpone the court appearance.
Because they know you're serious about it, my dear.
It's necessary that we visit your sister Manira.
What is this?
Oh, you asked me what this is, this.
God bless you all.
It's a miniature model of a courthouse.
God bless you.
And all of you
God bless you
What did I say?
He told you not to go today.
And it was postponed until the day after tomorrow.
To the lab, take that sample, it's from the courthouse building.
Ready to show you the way.
You enter through this door, this one.
The day you enter through the door,
Put all your things over there.
Mobile and anything metal so it doesn't make a beep beep beep beep beep sound.
"They tell you to register the case, go to the eighth floor, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, take the elevator."
Walk around the desks.
See the judge, if you really need a particular judge, for example.
And after these things
They want to sue us.
We're here to show her the way.
We'll see when you get your revenge.
Either you take the lady or you leave.
As he said.
safety first
We're having breakfast at my sister's house today.
Oh, did the ministry approve his project?
My sister told me that he was very happy, he couldn't believe it.
If they agree on the project, I'll treat you to dinner at my place.
Praise be to God, one good turn deserves another.
How happy you are, Abu Waleed!
How lucky he is!
My sister told me that he was so happy that he couldn't sleep last night.
Praise be to God! Wow! Manal!
That's what they call business, but some good men helped him.
Zayn, tell your father.
Insha'Allah you liked the food.
Thank you, Bawalid.
Good health to you, Abu Walid. May God bless you.
May Allah enrich you and provide for you.
"Like this delicious food, O father of Waleed."
Hire an accountant and a secretary to organize your work.
They told me just rent an office and they'll take care of everything.
Please, Uncle.
Oh, my dear son.
My father has a BlackBerry.
"Naba Bayt Aoud" translates to "News of the House of Aoud."
Look, he looks better now.
Oh, didn't we agree that you would give a speech after lunch?
And now, ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming the owner of the project, my father, Abu Waleed.
Excuse us.
Congratulations, Abu Waleed.
You deserve it.
But frankly, you're not an expert in business and trade.
Oh man, what's the story with this project?
How are you!
Praise be to God, %pw
Last year,
The day the Japanese team played against our national team.
I was at Souk Waqif.
I don't know about him now.
This is a manufacturer's catalog for multi-purpose halls, our ministry is circulating it, submit to them.
Any contractor can build it for you.
What understands
Which contractor?
The Japanese are awesome.
When you open it, the computer says "beep beep beep beep."
Cinema, if you want.
If you want a kitchen, press kitchen.
The day I presented the catalog to the ministry committee,
What happened to your contract with the factory?
I paid a little.
Earnest money
The most important is your contract with the factory.
Praise be to God, I signed it.
And give me time until I place my first order.
What are you waiting for?
It's true that they agreed to it.
We're still waiting for Abu Fahd's signature.
What did the secretary say?
Bu Fahd said he wasn't present.
Do you want tea?
"Son, tell me what you did!"
You don't know Abu Fahd, he might come and he might not.
He will appear one day.
He doesn't have time.
Come on,
You're the boss here.
Do you want to kill me?
No, he has to sign.
See all these files on my desk, they all need Abu Fahd's signature.
And the solution, what should I do?
God helps you.
"It's a quarter to two. Oh, Bou Walid."
It's time to go home.
I don't think Bou Fahd is coming with me.
God helps you, come tomorrow.
You said you've known the manager for a long time and he's a friend of yours.
Your turn?
He is a failed manager.
Our petty manager has nothing on me.
Shame on them for pretending to be wise when they are not qualified.
They don't do anything useful.
Do they do anything? Never!
They don't move a chair without Bou Fahd's permission.
The manager didn't ask about you yesterday.
People's issues are pending.
You seem to be going to them today as well.
I'm in trouble.
I face problems every day.
Because the factory gave me limited time.
No, God willing.
Even if they ask about you
You're not the only one waiting for Abu Fahad.
Look at these files.
They all want Bu Fahad's signature.
I think he's coming today.
Please sit down.
Or walk.
I'll keep calling you until I reach you.
If anything happens, I'll call. Don't worry.
Goodbye
Forgive me, I scared you. This is my wife.
Oh! Boy, they approved my two-month-old appointment.
I just need your signature. What's the matter?
Oh! My son, the registration period, my daughter will miss the university scholarship, her papers need to be finished.
My problem with the factory, the deadline, the deadline.
Patience
All your papers will be signed.
He's drinking his coffee. As soon as he finishes, you can come and see him.
Please, I ask you all to be quiet.
Yes, Your Highness
safety first
Hold on, folks.
Wait, where are you going, wait.
Do you know what happened first?
What happened?
He has an essential trip.
He has a unique voice.
I'm fed up with this.
Our interests have been compromised, my friend.
We wait for Bu Fahd every day.
What should we do? Wait for Abu Fahd.
"Peace be upon you, father."
He can't be blamed.
Everything is going badly.
The factory is in Japan.
Tell him the deadline has passed.
And my aunt is another story.
Oh my age, she lent him money.
He is facing problems from all directions.
Mom, I'm really scared for my father.
Don't leave him alone.
Who are you calling?
Yes, who is it?
Bu Waleed
For the factory and your brother's money.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
How long do you want me to wait?
They always say,
We are waiting for Bu Fahd.
Oh! Dad, you've done enough.
But all my friends are joining university next week.
What are you looking for?
My love, the phone.
Just give me some time.
Okay, who are you talking to?
Wait, Abu Fahd.
I don't know what to tell you, sister.
I endured a lot with her.
God helps you.
Bu Waleed is in a pitiful state.
He's shivering like a palm tree due to the fever.
This is because the allotted time is about to end.
There are five days left.
He's losing all his money.
May God protect us.
How great! You're dragging me, you're dragging me, you're dragging me.
I hope you feel better.
I have an unusual fever.
The part on top is vibrating.
The other party is completely still, not moving.
50% of my body is not working due to the heat.
This is a discount.
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
My sister helps.
She's waiting for us to return her money.
May God reward her with good.
We don't care about your sister now.
And so my manager, God help me.
It seems he heard.
God knows what he wants.
I invited him and Abu Fahd.
A problem is pulling me down.
Tomorrow is the last day.
I lost my money.
Don't drag us in.
In the brain, in the brain
How can you speak?
Give me the phone so I can see who's calling.
Mr. Bou Bled
I'm calling you because I sense something in you.
Stay on standby.
safety first
You've been a committed person all your life.
You were a role model.
Don't think I'm not aware that you leave work early every day.
I can deduct from your salary.
What's wrong with your phone?
Instead of discount
I'll put you on the inventory committee.
Are you going to the stock exchange with them today?
You should never leave work during working hours.
If I do
Then don't blame me.
Today is his last chance.
You see him confused, holding his phone, waiting for their call.
He's afraid he'll get fired from his job.
My phone, oh! Bou Walid
Poor thing.
Let him go, poor thing.
Oh! Bou Walid
Yes, hello
You're the one who's been calling me, not your son.
Go finish your paper.
Don't worry.
Thank you, you've been very helpful.
It seems that Bou Fahad is present.
How can I assist you?
He is a very important officer.
Where are you going?
Let's go to Uzbekistan.
Brother, where is Uzbekistan located?
It's the third office on your left.
Don't cough.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't sit.
Don't look at me.
Or do you want
House by house
Push
Oh people, this mole is crazy!
Do you know how much I spent?
After all these years, you
He takes papers and returns papers.
My knees are weak now.
The back-and-forth between all these ministries.
We were just kids.
I used to carry bags of bread on my back, just like kids carry bags of chips.
After that, God wanted, and I learned to ride a bike.
Especially the bicycle that I learned to ride and bought.
Olive green
They harass me when I ride this bike, oh God.
This is our daily bread, and raising our children.
The manager has arrived.
We need to celebrate after you finish.
Praise be to God, praise be to God.
So you're planning to quit your job?
I bear witness that you are a true citizen.
Now I want to rest, brother. See you later.
We are all for you.
Don't you want us to give you a one-year extension?
Enough, enough.
May God reward you with good.
You gave me a four-year extension.
I should have retired a long time ago.
All my children have found jobs now.
The other day, yesterday was his first day at work.
And now, oh! Abu Abdulaziz,
My father wants to rest.
You're just a mailman.
Banana seller
Do you think that
I haven't eaten candy in four years.
Oh, how delicious this dish is!
See him now.
We'll do anything you want.
Transfer me to the HR department.
Have you finished all the transactions?
"Ayna min amsin"
Your papers are delayed.
I'm bored.
Okay, finished.
Stay in touch.
My son Khalid
From this moment on,
Inshallah, I will work %pw yeah
Great, great
I'm at work and I can't leave.
Could you stop by the General Administration of Human Resources?
I have some papers over there.
I want you to join the civil service.
Thank you, dad.
Where are you going?
I have to go to the bank.
She is determined for all of us.
What now?
I have to go to the bank.
Send him with someone else.
No, my sister, I can't leave work.
Okay, okay, goodbye.
It's as if he didn't agree, right?
He said he can't leave work.
What are you going to do?
I'll go to the bank tomorrow morning.
He is used to going to work every day.
I'm sure he's bored.
This is good for him.
Do you let him rest?
Oh, my love, I'm happy that he will return early.
Connection: He said that Khalid...
He went to finish his paperwork.
Fear your Lord.
Everyone has to rely on themselves.
My mother regrets the khonafrush.
Mom, it won't rot.
I'm not regretting spoiling her, my daughter.
But I say, after he left the job and went...
And Khalid gave him things to do.
He is lying in his room.
Those who were lost at sea.
Good morning, father.
Hello, my daughter.
Abby please
He just called and said the manager is angry.
Give me your papers.
I am happy
I told you to let the kids fend for themselves. Why don't you listen to me?
You haven't resigned yet.
Oh my goodness!
Waiting for you, with the date spread in front of me.
We'll eat it today.
safety first
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.
Sorry, my dear father.
God helps you.
What's going to the market?
Get out of here quickly.
I'm gone, my daughter, I'm gone.
Oh, Bismillahhirrahmaniirrahim.
"Masha'Allah"
Zayn found a house.
Sit, sit, sit
I told you to stay home.
Let your children learn to be independent.
What can I do, Um Saeed?
They are going through a tough time, I need to help them.
Enough, enough, calm down.
And I'll get you a glass of water.
And the spider to eat it.
Oh, my eyes are so tired.
And from the taxi
He's naive.
The City branch is gone.
They want her card.
She didn't even take her car.
And he gave him the papers.
"He is doing well, praise be to God."
Rely on your age.
I told you.
I want you to rest.
Take a chair and sit with us.
Lunch was very delicious.
I went from ministry to ministry.
I'm moving from one ministry to another.
My daughter's papers are finished.
You spoiled them when they were young and you're still spoiling them now, it's all about spoiling.
My kids are in good positions at work.
And they're busy all the time. What should I do?
In daily meetings, either with the manager, or with the president, or with the minister.
They have good jobs. When they are needed, they must be present for this work.
"So you can go out and get your work done, there are people who force you to sit all the time. What were you thinking?"
I'm coming to you now, may Allah reward you well.
I'll be right there, goodbye.
Excuse me now, oh oh oh, Bu Shaheen
They called me, saying it's ready.
If you sell your father tomorrow to finish your work,
If this continues, I'll be late for work.
Fear God
Impossible, especially tomorrow, I can't.
Because he loves you.
Even though he's upset and tired of your behavior towards him.
You don't respect his age.
He has been exhausted and lying in his room for two days.
Due to the winding streets in the hot sun.
Make him give you the papers.
And go straight away to finish it.
The committee starts from early morning until afternoon.
Mom, did you hear me?
Do you want the construction to stop?
Since you have a deadline and a committee tomorrow,
You need to finish your paperwork tomorrow.
Some of them at night.
He has a committee meeting tomorrow, he needs to be present.
What's happening, man?
He's holding back his tears.
Frankly, I didn't lie to my father.
The committee changed their mind.
They said they'll come this weekend.
Why didn't you tell him?
Oh! Dad, don't go.
I'm leaving because the committee isn't here.
It would be better for you to leave the cafeteria and those girls.
Overwhelmed him
Enough
I apologize.
"I wil
Thank you
Oh! Dad, Khalood is a girl.
He is wrong.
And he is still selfish.
The day he found out the committee wasn't coming.
Blessed
"From this moment on, father."
We do our own work by ourselves.
Stay at home.
Let me kiss you on the head.
Welcome, welcome my son!
Good morning
Oh, my dear father
The precious one is worth the whole world to me.
I don't want you to be sad.
No problem.
As I told you,
After we finish this paper.
I was going to do it myself.
He asked me to come urgently.
Because I have a meeting.
Your Excellency, the Minister
May God bless you.
You meet important people.
I feel happy when my children are with so-and-so or with such-and-such.
Don't worry and keep doing your work and sing.
Where is Bou Saada?
Please, dad.
The envelope is with me, I'll put it with the tea things.
Just send it over with the tea boy.
Oh, my dear father.
You want to say that it didn't happen?
It is possible to forget.
Because the committee will meet in an hour.
No, God bless you.
My son has a meeting with the minister today.
Give me the papers.
This is my daily routine, work, home, work.
I'm not seeing anyone.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, hello
Yeah, no, I didn't tell him anything.
He takes a week off and goes to the sea.
They said he was happy on the farm.
Goes early in the morning.
He's having a lot of fun there.
And guess what?
They say he's a good cook.
And he goes to him.
safety first
What happened?
What happened, my friend?
May God guide you.
No, no, I'm fine, nothing's wrong with me.
Your papers are scattered.
He is at the farm.
And she
Her friend's research.
I'm thirsty, I want water.
Give me water, water.
Oh my son
No, no, take this away, I don't want it.
Do not write this.
Their father is perplexed.
Thank you, sister.
You're right.
No, no, no, I told him.
You have the right to choose.
I'm sorry, sister.
They call it my league and cup.
Talk about the match referee.
He started rambling.
And they gave him the title of the one who stopped corruption.
People started inciting him.
They gave him some gibberish to say on television and radio.
And also
They put him in prison.
Believe it or not, my sister.
These days, everyone only cares about themselves.
Why is he looking for trouble?
Now, I'll never be able to
Let him speak and say his famous phrase, "Stop corruption."
Praise be to God that he is well.
Congratulations on your arrival!
safety first
Mom, I'm late for work.
Listen, my son
I was warning you.
Last night
Now I just want to remind you.
Okay, Mama
I won't call.
No radio, no TV, and no calling on QT.
Your sister Aisha
And your bride keeps crying all day long.
Please have mercy on us, may God have mercy on you.
As I said.
Stop the meaningless chatter.
Because I don't want you to be sad.
Your uncle Abu Munira
I came here two days after you entered prison.
And he said, "That's enough."
Cancelled
After many attempts, he finally calmed down.
But next time he's going to drag you to court to divorce his daughter.
Present, Mother.
I promised you.
You won't see any good if you call a TV or radio show again.
I told you I won't.
Excuse me, I have to go now.
I'm just telling you to be careful.
The manager told me that
I want you to work here.
So you can talk about management.
And it starts getting us into trouble.
How does the manager justify this decision?
He has millions of excuses to say.
Where should I go!
Are you serious, resigning?
I told you before?
Hello, yes.
safety first
I told you.
You know, for the greater good.
We need to reduce the number of messengers in the ministry.
You're right, but...
Please, just once, say "Stop corruption."
Cool
Stop corruption.
True, yes
You're still here!
We have work to do.
Disaster
Let's solve this issue.
What did I tell you?
I told you he's going to be in trouble.
And Mona was standing here and heard me say these words.
What, Dad, you did?
I heard them say that with my own ears.
Please go and let me talk to your father alone.
Let me talk to your father.
He went to prison, we considered it a slip and forgave him.
We can't forgive him after what he did.
Just because they're relatives.
Are you hearing this?
Calm down.
Insha'Allah everything will be fine.
May God guide you to the right path.
I came to drink coffee.
I introduce you.
Feeling bored.
Your uncle gave you two weeks.
By God, he will take you to court to force his daughter to divorce you.
Even if I leave,
Why do you want problems?
Just be careful.
Even if someone asks you
Ignore him.
Isn't he the anti-corruption man?
Yes, by God.
He looks tired these days.
We haven't heard it once, please let us hear it.
No, it's fine.
Are you police?
No, no, Mom, you didn't understand it.
I asked him to speak on a radio program about a problem that happened to my cousin.
He was hesitant.
We felt he was hesitant because we talked to him in front of people.
So I suggested to my cousin that we go to his house and talk to him in private.
I felt that he was agreeable.
He was hesitant.
And get lost.
Enough, enough, enough
I'm upset and I'm never going to talk to you again, got it?
Are you Saleh Saad?
God bless you, may this custom increase.
You have a strong sense of responsibility.
The ideal employee
But unfortunately,
Although I tried.
Peace be upon you
We created a ghetto that wasn't necessary.
I was calling the secretary to inform you not to come.
Shahin Shafik
What I knew
Is there anyone living in Qatar who doesn't know about Saleh's fight against corruption?
Are you Saleh known as the Stop Corruption Foundation?
Stop corruption.
Ah, the job.
There are no jobs, you know.
Zayn didn't bring it.
Am I crazy to hire him here?
I went everywhere, Mitha.
Even one of them told me that there was a vacancy five minutes before I came, but they gave it to someone else.
My sister Aisha got divorced yesterday.
I'm responsible for them now.
I have a big responsibility now.
I don't know what to do.
He flatters the minister.
But I didn't feel like it was the right thing to do.
He's afraid that this will take my place.
Alright, that's enough.
Who said I would be silent?
But I want it to be implemented in a way that doesn't affect me.
I'm thinking of a way to get rid of it.
And that's the end of it.
But how?
I know him.
Is he the one who talks on the radio?
Bring it to his house.
And give him only the information.
You are loyal and patriotic.
A very enthusiastic citizen.
Thank you.
I stopped doing that, really.
I bear witness that your voice is the voice of truth.
Bu Fahd's word
Believe it or not, Saleh.
"We haven't heard his voice for a long time, saying stop corruption."
He wanted to see you.
This is natural, okay.
I am ambitious in the tent.
Forward, forward, forward
You are one of a kind.
Sweet talk.
Your voice on the radio is even sweeter.
Let's hear the end of corruption once and for all.
Yes, yes, just one, Bou Fahad tells you, listen, listen, listen to him.
Stop corruption.
This is the original, Your Highness, this is it.
Continue, I don't want you to stop.
I can't.
And then he resigned.
Even though I want you to continue solving people's problems and issues.
Listen, Saleh.
I'll give you one problem.
You are the voice of truth.
I want to talk to you alone.
He is a very important person.
You can't say no to him, you have to say yes.
Yeah, right.
Your chance.
Opportunities only come once.
No, this is %pw
Don't you understand?
Wait for my brother, please.
From these issues and problems
Minister's happiness
The ministry requested eight thousand pipes in its latest project.
Bear a pressure of 220 mmHg = 220 mm of mercury.
But this employee
So they'll approve the pipelines that
So he can take the balance.
Stop corruption.
Thank you, thank you very much, my brother Saleh, for stopping corruption.
No, God bless you.
This call is a special request.
I hope you hear it.
The final station: corruption. Stop corruption.
You know.
Necessity made him do it.
This is the last one.
The sultan was deposed.
Did the minister fire him immediately?
He provided accurate information.
Now Bu Fahd can do what he wants.
I'll do all the tasks.
Yes, sir.
Certainly, Your Excellency.
safety first
Stop corruption.
The last time, for sure, I won't do it again.
And this is my job application, sorry, I was just joking.
They got what they wanted.
Listen to me.
Because he fears one day
And expose his faults.
To criticize and expose corruption,
They are afraid of you.
Let's play, my sister Aisha.
You are kind.
Your uncle, Abu Munira
I guarantee you I'll find a job.
Those who criticize are foolish.
Hateful, hating our land.
Do we have any problems?
We don't have any connections.
I might have heard that word before.
In our government departments,
We don't have any bribes.
What we know
Employee
Does a foreigner get more than a national? No, never.
We produce everything locally.
The problem is which family you belong to; we never have such problems at all.
If your manager or supervisor gets upset with you,
We are the best people.
Our country is the best country.
Trouble-free
And thank you.
What did you say on the radio yesterday?
Mama, I want candy.
No sweets until dinner.
That means there are no sweets.
Why is your shirt torn?
Mom, Adoul and I were playing.
I know you were playing.
But what tore your shirt?
God is enough for you, O weakling.
Come and see what your unjust nephew has done.
What you told me was expensive, we don't need to buy it, and you said it's okay, it will look nice on Waleed.
I saw what he did.
The shirt is not suitable for use right now.
That's why he's not afraid, no one is stopping him.
Mom, where's the candy?
See how he was planning to throw it, it's clear this was intentional.
Poor Walid.
He was happy to be wearing that shirt for the first time.
Bishop
Where is the bathroom?
In the garden
Why did it happen?
Something between me and him.
Don't tear it.
Be a little ashamed.
Don't argue with the child.
The child can't have his way.
He is unrepentant.
Don't ask me to mind my words.
Are you a repairman?
We raise them.
Mind your manners.
Don't argue with him.
Why are you fighting like children?
Stay away from the subject, boy.
Don't interfere.
His saying, "He raises his children justly."
He is a child.
You can't tell the difference between a child and an adult because you're crazy.
You know.
It's okay, it's not your fault.
Let's go upstairs.
They deserve it.
Waste our time responding to them.
One shouldn't
Where people loved each other.
Okay, okay, I'm coming, goodbye, goodbye.
Come on, man, there are a few papers you need to sign. The minister wants to see them.
"Okay, I'll speak to the minister. Don't worry."
I saw the disaster. I saw the catastrophe.
"He's new, oh! Alive." (Note:
This is not kids' stuff.
You're right.
Ruined the clothes.
Look, look
This is what we dwell in.
Look for pants that are straight, where one leg can be worn by a man and the other leg is exposed.
It's clear that this isn't cut by hand.
His body was cut with a power saw.
All I can say is, "May God protect us."
I'm telling you
Who wants candy? Come here.
I still know
If you know, take a walk around the villa.
I love you not just because you can ride a bike.
Also because of something else
True fact
Okay, do you want some candy?
Yes, I want two.
I'll give you four pieces.
Who undressed us in the closet?
How did your father cut them?
He has a big pair of scissors, he can even cut a car with them.
Under the bed, take all the sweets.
Not to this extent
No one else can do this but you.
Why do we have to be quiet?
The most important thing
Which is that we insist on what we say.
Who cut the clothes? Was it the child?
Which computer?
What is it about?
It's impossible for a child to do these apartments.
Why don't you believe me?
Go around your neighborhood.
Give me some.
You're always like this.
It conflicts every day, my son.
Good old days
I seek forgiveness from Allah and repent to Him, and I ask Allah for well-being.
May God guide you.
Who can hold a big pair of scissors like this?
You go and meet friends.
You liar, son of a liar.
Go and get these big scissors.
Behave well, oh my sultan, hush.
Come and find a solution for this. Come on, my son.
How do I start?
Each one of you
You are fathers.
A child is born.
When the baby is born,
You are my brothers.
Listen to my words and reconcile with each other.
Okay, tell me, what are you going to do now?
And what does it mean to weep and tear their clothes?
It's nothing compared to the disaster they caused. All my documents and information are gone, they destroyed everything.
I won't let him.
He speaks in a very formal Arabic dialect, like those who speak in museums.
Leave him.
He'll keep talking until he finishes and leaves.
My crazy brother knows it well.
I greeted him.
He's full of hatred and jealousy.
He's upset because I broke the computer.
Oh, Fahd.
Sultan, punch, punch, punch
They fear God, my son.
Hit him, hit him, be quiet, pay attention, be quiet.
Take your cousins and play with them outside.
May God guide you.
God bless you.
Old men.
What have you left for your children?
Okay, Mama
Your brother is Abdurrahman.
Maybe for the last time, my son.
Do you know that the older brother is the best for girls?
He knows how to talk to people.
They argue.
Don't be annoyed with me.
You're supposed to
To play a role
May God guide you.
Even you have become like them, my son.
My mother hit my son. They conspired against us. You're saying it's a B.W. Stay away.
Stay away.
There's blood coming out of my son.
You've shamed us, you kids.
It was the kids who were throwing them.
He doesn't want to believe.
I saw them.
We told him these kids don't believe us.
"He said from his window."
He saw his children throwing and, because he was far away, thought they were adults.
I'm not crazy.
You can go.
I might be tired or dizzy.
Do you know who they are?
And you tell me they're throwing stones.
It seems
Oh my age!
You're telling me to rest at home, we've signed an agreement. What more do you want?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
"What is this, oh Lord, oh Lord?"
God is the best adviser.
Mom, Mom
It's all your fault.
Because of you
Your men have the minds of children, or rather, sick minds.
Take me to the hospital, I'm dizzy, I'm dying.
It's not the first time I've seen him.
And I noticed that he never takes his eyes off you.
He's not enrolled in the business class.
He has only been attending the class with us for a week.
It's clear he's dead; he wants to get to know you.
Don't worry, as long as he loves you this much. Don't hold yourself back too much.
No, my sister.
I don't want him to say I'm easy.
I ran after him.
Let's keep it simple.
And now he's running after you, dying to get to know you.
I really love him too.
No, I don't feel it's the right time.
100%
Admire you *
Afi waited for her to come and said, "Excuse me, may I introduce myself?"
Take the initiative.
You're right.
But I'm waiting for the right opportunity.
The right opportunity
What are you waiting for? You and she are in the same class.
What did the teacher say?
Could you please ask her?
Oh, what's her name?
We've been exchanging glances for three months.
But we've never met before.
You're old.
Which is that you go and say, "You're welcome."
Can I get to know you?
Not to this extent
I need to wait for the right opportunity.
Quiet and polite structure
I don't know what you're looking for.
We finished filming all the episodes yesterday.
Yes, truly.
Don't forget about us.
As long as I am free.
Which is buying the villa behind the villa we have for Waleed.
Tomorrow is his wedding day, he doesn't live far from us.
There's no use for it now.
You're late.
You didn't know.
I saw it empty a few days ago. Who bought it?
And they bought it through a housing loan from the Development Bank.
God bless their home.
Good morning, my son. May God bless your morning.
Engage, start the engine.
Thank you, my son. May God reward you with good.
Come on, Nora, come outside the car, it's working, come, I'll take you.
Peace be upon you too.
What do you want?
Neighbors are chatting with each other, what do you want?
You'd better leave us alone.
Neighbors talk to each other, you, the outcast.
One person parked their car behind mine, I can't get it out.
Alright, if you don't mind, give me your car keys.
Even the car key
Keeping you in this Titanic mood.
I see you.
safety first
Now you know a lot about me.
I just know that you are Waleed.
Walid Rashid Abdullah
Surely when people hear your father's name, many will think you are the son of the famous actor.
Same name, God willing.
Frankly, my father Rashid Abdullah is an actor.
Is Rashid Abdullah, the famous actor, your father?
Do you eat biscuits? Why didn't you have dinner with them?
Fry
How did you find out that the famous artist Rashid Abdullah is our neighbor?
Yeah, right.
My friend at university, you know her, she told me this.
He loves acting, just see his works.
He finally said, "We live near someone famous and valuable in the community."
Oh my heart, oh my joy.
Oh, he's so handsome, funny, and charming.
And his son is a fine young man. May God help me, may He reward him well.
Our traditions say that
Do you know what?
Do you know why I want to take a picture with him?
Mom, tell my cousin Aboud
I read an interview with him in the newspaper.
Besson said he would make a series about diving.
Your husband is bringing you a sheep as a gift for the new villa.
Prove that he is a good neighbor.
Hello Saleh, is there anything new?
In fact, we have many names.
They told me, "O Abu Sa'd, may God prolong your life, that my name is there."
This will be determined according to the need and experience of the staff.
What we know
"Maybe we move."
I'm sorry, I won't be able to do anything for you.
Thank you
First, we wanted to move and settle, and then, when God blesses us with money, we'll buy the furniture.
I did the right thing.
Oh! Bouali
Don't consider me a stranger.
Whatever you want.
I'm present to help.
"A neighbor for a neighbor" (proverb)
But now I heard and saw it.
That's great, God willing, you are an expert in furniture.
Okay, I'll go with you.
Don't worry, my sister.
Whenever you want to choose the furniture, let me know.
My father would divorce your mother if you dared to change all the furniture in the house.
And I repeat it again,
Don't hesitate to ask me anything.
We've become like family now.
Your sister can study without you.
I just want her to be independent.
I'm sure you were talking to her!
Tell me to lie and say he's my friend.
Oh! My son, oh! Ali
I don't have anything against it.
As long as she loves me and I love her, I'll solve the issue.
You're dreaming.
Let me introduce you to your cousin.
Leave it to me.
As you wish.
They reject you.
We'll see.
Good night.
Good night.
What happened to Ali?
Oh! My brother, the car is broken.
Every now and then, it tires me out.
My daughter, may God protect her, has a lecture.
My car is always breaking down.
Your daughter is our daughter.
What's on him.
There's no need to bother your head, my brother Rashid.
No, God bless you.
The car is parked in the yard, and the driver is sitting idle.
The Development Bank bought you a house and a car.
This isn't our car.
Our neighbor Rashid Abdullah's car.
I see the relationships are developing.
We will discuss matters of mutual interest and benefit to both parties.
Oh, that's a huge development.
Let's go!
Mom, you embarrass me.
I agreed.
Nora told me she's like my daughter and the driver will take her to university every day.
I told her that my father's car would be in maintenance for a week.
By God, no.
She said the driver picks her up every morning.
And God is a witness, O Mother of Ali.
They are good people.
No, no, no, Real Madrid.
There is no initiative nor power except from God.
Oh no, what am I doing now?
What can I do, I have responsibilities.
Who's taking my daughter to college?
Oh! Bou Ali, since Mr. Rashid Abdullah is referring you to me.
We can't refuse your request.
Bu Saad, Bu Saad
I'm sorry, Bu Saad.
Bu Ali knows how to kill me with love.
Good health to you, Abu Saad.
They love you, God willing.
This is sweet.
Oh, people, Mr. Rashid is busy. Leave him alone.
"It's okay, Mr. Rashid, if we wasted your time."
No problem.
How lucky you are to have connections.
We are your friends and brothers, take care of us if we need anything.
Just tell me where you want it and I'll bring it to you.
What happened? Why are you dragging me?
You're offering me a gift.
They agreed, mother agreed.
Manal talked to her mother about me.
Why aren't you believing?
Umm Waleed
"Do you have a party?"
I don't understand.
I hope Waleed gets married soon, the light of my eyes.
She called me, poor thing.
She's taking some accessories.
Not accessories! Jewelry.
Is this my mother?
She still goes in a fancy car.
Insha'Allah, Insha'Allah
God willing, I can't look at you.
This is from the kindness of Um Al-Waleed.
In addition to all this, she gave you the car.
With the driver.
If I went with you like this, they wouldn't believe that this tired man is the husband of this queen.
Oh my God
Are you going in those clothes?
What's up! No, no, no, no, no, don't worry.
Without seeing me, you won't recognize me.
They're surprised, thinking he's a sheikh.
Bring him coffee, may his life be long.
By God, I didn't recognize you. I thought you were an VIP, but you're not Bu Ali, you're not Bu Ali.
Seen how?
Even your walk is different.
Blessings of Allah upon you and the people who are kind to us.
Are they VIPs?
I've arranged everything from the cradle to the car.
I'm sure I'll find it with you.
In the last series you acted in.
There was a show, as I remember, it was a wedding.
I was wearing a shiny black bisht.
And I also want you to teach me how to wear the bisht.
Because, God prolongs your life, I have never worn the bisht in my life.
Masha'Allah, you look beautiful.
So that one day you can enter the council.
This is not correct.
My brother, Rashid,
Do you have a cufflink?
Good evening.
Always with me and with Khulood.
This is the reason.
Present, You are my age.
We're family now.
And we don't want our daughter, Nour, to be far from us.
Noura suits Waleed.
He told me he sees her at university and won't find a better wife than her.
Lucky for that.
Inform her father, and Allah will provide us with lawful sustenance.
Why did they reject him? What's the reason?
Because his father is an actor.
My father is right.
Quickly, tell Rashid that you want him.
Where are you?
I'm screaming from the pain.
Because his father is an actor.
You have no shame.
I am an actor.
So far, I'm acting honestly.
I've been acting on stage for a few hours and my role is about to end.
When the play ends.
You're playing roles.
I act.
Convey a useful vision.
Just you
I wear costumes to act in roles.
On the stage
But you
You wore it in the guest lounges.
The role of the rich and wealthy woman.
Who is the actor?
Who is the real actor?
Don't be sad, Waleed.
Lift your head up.
Shame
You missed the scene.
I heard her screaming at him, "Don't turn your head, don't turn your head." Poor thing, it broke my heart.
And he walks straight ahead.
Like a horse.
It's Thursday, really Thursday.
These are Thursday.
Her husband is crazy.
She is jealous of other women.
That's why he walks like that.
So he wouldn't see any women or any woman see him.
Saw how crazy his wife is?
Always, don't turn your face.
I'll finish the work at the office tomorrow.
Thursday, please, if you could take me to the city center, what does it look like?
Thursday, show me the look in the middle of Doha.
Isn't your wife saying City Centre?
Oh, Thursday!
I'll go see what Salem wants.
Oh, my heart aches for him.
When will you change?
If only you could hear what they say about you.
Even my friends say more than that.
Why is she doing this?
She's jealous of the women around me.
Why are you so jealous?
Sometimes when I sit in front of the TV
It is it.
By God
No, no, it's fine.
Hello, peace be upon you, sister.
You're seeing this,
I just spoke to her in front of you, and I heard a man's voice.
By God, sometimes you take my clothes and throw them in the street.
Make yourself worthy and let her go.
I'm having difficulty divorcing her.
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Don't come closer to me, stay there.
Get out of my head!
Nothing bad.
Who are you talking to?
You're wasting your time with these insignificant people.
Especially this bear, I hate it the most among your friends.
The one with puffy cheeks and hair like a child's plantation.
This bastard has no shame.
Do you want to torment me in my grave?
Let me talk to her.
Tell me what happened to you.
Who are you talking to!
I don't see anyone here.
Oh Salem, what's wrong with you! What happened!
Thursday is my friend's day off.
After a while, he faced the wall and started talking to himself.
Burst out laughing
Poor Thursday
He always imagines his mother and imagines talking to her.
"God bless his wives"
They say Thursday is with you.
Busy now, he's on an international call, very far away, even the call is cutting out.
What does the speech say?
God help you, Thursday.
Why did you stay!
I can't sleep.
Regarding tomorrow's meeting
With the women's delegation at the ministry
"Mumkin lo hom" Translation: "It might be possible."
God guide you, Thursday.
These names are at the discretion of the Minister's Office.
Come on, God!
Why are you afraid of her?
If you were talking to Salem, why are you pretending not to know him?
Tell the truth.
Why are you hiding behind the water tank?
That's all.
I saw the last number that called you. It's saved in your call log.
The last number!
You dialed the last number after deleting the girl's number you were talking to.
Tell me her name!
I told you, I told you, I told you.
I told her that I was talking to Salem.
My friend at work, Saloom.
You didn't believe me.
Slippers?
Are you going on a diving trip?
By God, brother, you didn't let me change my clothes.
Whoever is willing, contact him!
Call my wife.
Call my wife.
Say it, brother. Give me the password. I'll give you the number.
You help each other.
There's no use in you guys.
You're a liar like him, I'll show you.
If you interfere again, I'll go to the minister's office.
Cursed me
And she threatened me that she would complain about me to the minister's office.
She is truly brave.
She is planning to ruin my career.
My mistake was listening to you and calling her.
Listen, Oh Thursday
I complained about him in the minister's office.
You come to me and tell me the whole truth, get me out of this situation.
This has nothing to do with me.
You're a coward.
O my sisters and brothers
Good morning, everyone.
I'm pleased with your attendance at the meeting.
Where's the rest?
Fled
Where is Thursday?
He is coming.
Turn off your phone.
Fine, don't lock it, leave it in the office.
The meeting is only for an hour.
Not by me.
The war seemed...
Oh no, that day he was sitting at your place.
Where can he go?
He can't go.
And since that day until now, his situation hasn't changed.
Others, other than you, are surrounded by women.
This is not jealousy.
He sits alone here in the hall at night.
He says, "This is my mother."
His mother is deceased.
That's why I've decided to find a solution for myself.
She told you to move away from the section with women.
Is it a military decision?
See the signature, it's very clear at the bottom.
Brother, please excuse me, I have moved to the Social Affairs Department.
Oh Ministry of Social Affairs! Are you sure you transferred me there?
Why are you strange?
Thank you, may God reward you with good.
Are you Mr. Thursday, sorry, Mr. Khamees?
A call from the minister's office, they notified us.
Have you been to your new department?
Who's with you in the office?
Isa, Saleh, Jasim,
Oh! Thursday, the minister decided to transfer you only yesterday.
And you just moved to the new department today.
I explained to you my problem with my family.
The minister decided to transfer you.
I have to go to the minister.
He started his annual vacation today.
One and a half months and he'll be back.
Oh, what a disaster!
If you want my opinion,
The minister is going to tell you the same thing.
Work there until we find you another place, and this time he will be the one to transfer you because many people have talked to him about your problem with your wife.
It is God's right to kill you.
What shall we do!
Don't chat when your wife calls.
You never know, maybe they'll walk with you if you beg them.
I asked them to put the abayas in the car. I had put them in the trunk for you.
How much?
I put ten because there are five of you in the office, so that's two each.
It's obvious that he's very afraid of his wife.
Imagine he gave us the names of all his children.
And he calls me Abdelkader.
Its name
He's good-looking and handsome, that's why she's afraid she might fall in love with him again.
In the name of God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God
Who called me?
It's Ayman Abdelkader sitting next to Hassan behind Khalil.
Each one of you can choose the abaya you want.
Look at this.
How much is this?
What happened?
Excuse me.
Where is the welfare office?
There are supposed to be five employees.
What's your name?
I'm handsome.
I'm crazy, my wife drove me crazy.
I'm crazy.
You presented the project to us.
And I met them.
What did they say?
They said.
Muna, prepare tea.
I can't.
You want me to go back to the kitchen and ruin my outfit?
Go now, make us some tea.
Go, go, nonsense.
Go listen to what the man is saying.
Don't forget, we are the children of Scorpio.
Go, go, and bring me a cup of tea without sugar, go, go, go, go, go.
The bank said the project is good.
I called him many times, his phone is busy.
Poor things, they've been waiting for you for a while.
My brothers are as usual.
Only one of them took a month off. She traveled three months ago and didn't attend.
God is Generous, Goodbye.
And all the changes are in our favor.
Pour us
Yes, but if I built a garden.
It takes up space equivalent to at least two or three villas.
The park is a place for the residents of the complex to relax.
Men don't need women's opinions.
Let it be for yourself.
Put the tea down and leave.
No garden.
Just a moment
My sister, you know I love football.
Your uncle and brothers will kill you if they find out you're playing hooky from school.
What are you planning to do, do you want to kill yourself?
I told you.
I suggest you forget about it.
Don't hurt yourself.
No, I'm not angry with you.
I was busy.
You are permitted, and may goodness and blessings be upon you.
Oh, Uncle Shahin, congratulations!
Inshallah
Is this Thursday?
Grew up
He grew up.
I'm tired of looking for a wife; I haven't found one.
I come from a well-rooted family.
You know.
Leave the topic of his marriage alone.
Is this from the HR department?
May God grant you a long life.
Leave it aside.
I have a few remarks on his suggestions.
Okay, may God grant you a long life.
Anything else
No, may God grant you a long life.
Take care of them, and I'll check on them if I have time.
What happened to the employees I sent you yesterday?
What happened?
See you later.
What happened?
Are you crazy?
We are your older sisters.
We suffered from it.
You know, they asked me what you play at school.
I told them you play table tennis.
"Good that they didn't kill you."
This was just the beginning.
Do you know who we are?
What is our origin?
Do you know what that means?
This time we've had enough of your attitude.
Scorpion Leader
Small scorpion
Oh uncle, let me give her a slap.
This was enough.
Leave it until next time.
You changed your mind! You said you wanted architecture.
Are you crazy?
A scorpion's daughter can't work in the streets with men.
Engineering and Construction
Shame us
Let me break her head.
No, no, Sultan, no
Sure, O Sheikh of Scorpions.
You hit Fatoum.
Let your brother try his luck, Falcon.
Shame
"It's okay, Darking, at least you got a slap in the face."
Show my face
Why do they want you to go with them tomorrow morning?
What do they want?
Please
Walk in front of me.
Where are you going?
Don't say a word.
Where are you going?
I told you to shut up and say nothing.
And write the instruction instead.
Or even nursing, we have no objection.
What else do you want?
You have two options.
Just so you know, we're open-minded.
Never say we forced you to change.
Nursing versus education
Get lost.
We need a copy of the application.
Soul, Paradise
O leader of the scorpions, oh my son.
The great scorpion himself wooed you.
Thank you, uncle, but when is the engagement party?
Miss Munira
What you ask for is difficult.
I can't travel, oh Khalid.
I have personal circumstances.
Recommended by the minister.
Difficult
Think about it again.
Don't decide now, think until tomorrow.
How are they making you work like this!
That's why they don't say anything.
I have a suggestion.
Let one of them travel with you.
Girls don't need to travel.
This is bullshit.
Shame on you!
You should be grateful we even let you go to work.
Go tomorrow and tell them you can't travel.
Shut up, don't argue.
Listen and be quiet.
Thursday, the son of Scorpion
He approaches us.
He is indeed stupid and has no degree.
But it's a scorpion.
What will you do, sister?
What should I do, Fatima?
I am weak and bankrupt.
What can I do?
There's nothing I can do.
What can you do?
The engagement is next Monday.
I'll talk to you when the sheikh arrives, depending on his time.
Oh, sweet laughter!
Go get yourself some new dresses.
Go buy some new clothes, my son.
I love this laugh.
Brother, I'm asking you.
I don't want to hear a word.
Prepare us some tea and coffee and cake.
How lucky you are, Aisha! You've become a friend of the minister now.
I'm just afraid it might be a rumor, oh Boukhaled.
Manira was nominated to be a minister in a new ministry within the new ministerial structure.
Muna deserves all the best.
Insha'Allah it's not a rumor.
Will you be in tomorrow?
And it's necessary for all of us to cooperate to serve this country.
Through everyone's efforts in their places, thank you.
I wish you all the best.
Thank you, Sir.
Thank you = Your happiness
Thank you.
Welcome, please come in.
Peace be upon you
Yes, with soap as you requested.
He is the general supervisor of the women's football league.
Ask him about Fatima's playing.
Inshallah
Captain Fatima scored 2 goals like a professional player.
Captain Fatima is talented, brothers.
Captain, what do you think of Fatima's play?
She is a good forward player.
She travels to China.
Captain, isn't it a bit far?
God bless you.
Your sister is playing an important game.
She was teaching education, but I went today and transferred her.
I study architecture.
There is no difference between a man and a woman.
True? Go make coffee.
Where are you going?
I'm fed up with waiting.
Stupid, are you stupid?
Go and greet your mother and tell her you're fired.
Go *
O fool.
The coffee in your pot has gone cold.
They call it a year-long project, but as soon as they find out you have a TV series, they call it a "side project."
Peace be upon you, how are you, and how are the kids!
What did you tell her?
I told her, "You'll be with us in the series."
Sure, and she'll be the main character.
See Ali Shawul playing the role of Nouf.
There's something called makeup that makes one look younger.
Mary's role is only in twenty-six or twenty-seven episodes.
Let Shaola benefit.
He's going to give us endless lectures.
I'm afraid he'll be a nuisance to us.
The most important thing is that he doesn't know that the company producing you and Hamed.
Oh God, I hope I'm not late.
And Rashid, too, is happy.
The director and actors are ready.
For the sake of time, oh! Guys, let's start the meeting.
I wish you would tell us your opinion.
Hamed, do you want to say something?
Frankly, I think it's the best.
I saw the maid commit suicide.
You know the most touching part for me.
It was after the maid committed suicide.
The day she hanged herself from a fan, she spun around and bled until she died.
They found her crying for her child, which aroused their emotions.
And he kept jumping until he reached the house yard.
This is enthusiasm.
The police come, search the house, and arrest the mother.
It's a really awesome series.
I was almost done with the series here on the table.
It's really an extortion of the artistic conscience.
My community
The whole subject is about strange events.
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
Seventy-two murders
Are they awake?
You're known for holding people up.
Fine, Professor Hamed, let's stay open-minded.
Let's vote by majority.
Professor Nasser, don't claim openness and use the majority as an excuse, this doesn't work with a critical assessment of artistic production.
You're involved in this matter due to your government work.
safety first
I heard the doorbell ring.
There was an Indian with a bag in his hand.
He asked me, "Are you Madam Hessa?" I replied, "Yes."
I opened the bag.
It was a ring worth about seventy to eighty thousand.
I'm afraid the Indian brought these things by mistake.
No, not by mistake.
This is Samira.
Haram Hameed, the supervisor at the company.
A gift from her to you, may God bless you.
Yes, this is for you.
The ring is very extravagant.
I've never dreamed of having such a ring.
Bless you, Hessa, my love.
This is what I call the series of blessings.
Ali and Hamed own the production, but they are employees there and cannot offer it under their names.
What will we get more than the ring?
Don't share this with anyone, keep it between you and me.
Am I crazy to do that?
Relish the moment.
They call him the magician.
Just five percent, a little.
They barely agreed to four million for them.
Reelj will take 200,000 riyals regularly.
I think we'll give the college girl role to Nada.
It's sweet that she loves someone and rides away on a bicycle.
The work we are going to produce is called "guilt tripping."
They told me about a role in the series.
I wish to know
Gulf series are always like this, the fashion of this year in blackmail.
Okay, tell me what my role is.
And you, my dear, are also present.
Don't embarrass me.
Jay Jay now
I made all this breakfast, don't go and leave me.
With you is Omar, the manager's secretary.
God, protect us.
How old is he to ask to see me at this time of day?
He said it would be a weak and silly series.
Don't waste your money on him.
Okay, so, what happened next?
God preserve me, what do I say, I hope a rad said something bad to the series.
Don't be afraid.
Leave it to me.
A mentally ill person.
It's a social series.
You saw him on TV.
No, God prolong your life.
The series that is still on TV is called "Blackmailing the Flower of Youth."
But, I suppose the budget they're asking for is very high.
It requires a high budget.
But don't forget that the producing institution is local.
We need to support him.
What's on him.
Have you read the arts page?
I heard they're starting to film the series "Blackmail of Conscience."
And that a huge budget is allocated to it.
But it's said that the series is weak.
And some people said that the series consists of a school that teaches corruption.
They might stop fighting.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
Welcome, welcome, please come in, please have a seat.
Good morning
Good morning, may God bless you.
I am Eli Monir. I'm a journalist, and I have an appointment with Mr. Hamed, if you don't mind.
Yes, fine, go ahead and sit for a bit, because he has a meeting.
Mercury, everything allows us to use a design for the universe.
By the way, we will communicate with all the world's correspondents so they can get in touch with us.
This is your job.
From Mercury Media Productions
He addresses her issues in a way that classifies them as the best output in the history of the world.
Do you believe who wrote this?
He has no shame.
Do we have such a journalist?
Do we have such a journalist?
A journalist must have a sense of ethics.
They work.
Do you think they are here for *
I met the Minister; do you know what he told me?
Very sad and his events are not natural.
The first episode is tomorrow, I'll watch it with people.
What do you think, mom?
It's okay, Mom, this is the first episode.
I've seen people talking to themselves in Gulf series.
"Did you also see or do you want to kill your children except in your series?"
Oh! My son, art is a matter of taste, not exceptions that you generalize about people and society.
Mom, this can be done in plastic arts, but drama is completely different.
Don't give me a headache.
As if they were imitating the Turks.
Don't judge now, at least watch the first five episodes.
This series failed.
We can't let our kids see it.
Is it that bad, my friend?
There are things worse than soap operas on TV.
Frankly, not everyone.
This is your mistake.
In every house and for every person
Go and gather the people who understand these dimensions and hidden lines.
And find them.
Not ours
Tell me what happened.
The minister is with some guests.
I stood up to greet him.
We agreed to produce the series.
How does the minister like it?
Okay, let's hear Nasser's opinion.
My colleague wrote this.
I only post messages that say something good about the series.
No, no, don't worry.
Tomorrow I'll read the newspapers and I'll publish praise messages from me, saying that viewers sent them.
Inshallah
Resting
For this year
That's fine if they have an agreement with him.
The best series in the history of Gulf drama
They're all upset with them.
Okay, let's say they all have agreements with them.
I'm translating the translation.
I wish they would rerun the series Extortion of Conscience.
Thank you, His Excellency the Minister of Culture, for this series.
I wish they would replay it.
The day the minister's office called me for the first time.
"We hope to receive the final payment for the series soon."
They were right to call you the wizard.
This is what it was all about.
The profits were rewarding, and we got our money.
And the series also failed.
The writer himself told me that he regrets writing it.
I'm here to suggest a second season of the series.
The minister believed the press hoax that they fabricated.
Believed the fake success we created.
He is not satisfied with the series.
It means it's impossible for him to agree to a second part.
I assure you that the minister himself is asking for a second part.
I can't help it.
Say thank you.
For all people
Who worked on this project?
And we congratulate them on their success.
They all deserve it.
In fact, winning awards for outstanding festivals
Proves that there is
This is what you think.
You are a genius.
Surely we'll win the gold.
What was he saying?
He said, "If the readers and the press were lying to me."
Yeah, why not have a second part?
The Arab and Gulf TV festivals are an artistic wash.
Art wash!
I've heard about money laundering.
Not art
Ill-gotten gains
The series are the same.
What can we do with "one-to"?
What does it mean?
We didn't sign a contract with them? They have to comply.
Write them.
Our products are exported worldwide: bread of all types and shapes, flat, large, small, triangular, and diverse.
What did we agree on in the contract?
Two million dollars
What are you doing with the Australian baker?
He is the inventor of bread.
Did anyone tell you about this product?
"No, by God, they told me it's just bread, but I don't know what's in it."
Zipper bread
You call it a souvenir.
Stop cutting the bread you call "samiid bread."
The inventor tried to make it easy.
Jean's bread
This is the secret.
You eat bread with worms.
Those people do really strange things.
This zipper is amazing, its productivity is in a way that as soon as you put it in your mouth, it melts.
It can have different flavors: strawberry, ketchup, coffee.
Do you know how much I've invested in this project?
Three million dollars, with patents.
"Please! Oh, forgive me."
Yes, Abu Nasser.
Yes, Your Highness, I am present and at your service.
We received it today, Your Highness.
His saying "Oh! Forgive"
We were with your son Nasser yesterday at the stadium watching his team play soccer.
I agreed with him.
So that his team consists of drivers and security men,
And our team is not yet complete, we only have one goalkeeper, if he gets injured we'll be in trouble.
I should have fans by now.
The day I took fifteen players,
I didn't say anything.
Important people in the company
Those we can't do without
Get some pastries from the hospital bakery.
Why are you bothering the man?
You said that this rich kid can't run after a ball and humiliate himself.
Does what he wants.
Just don't take those we can't do without.
What do I do, mom? My team has a match and I need four players.
No more excuses.
"What's done is done."
Hamed didn't attend today, teacher.
I went with him.
The cat said "Meow".
And leave me standing in the goal area.
The match started.
I didn't feel anything.
They told me the ball hit me while I was distracted.
Have you ever worked as a guard?
I only played because Nasser asked me to.
"There is no power or might except by Allah."
We're tired of your love for football.
From this moment, oh! Nasser
No football.
You need to disband your team.
And all bakers return to their bakeries.
What do you think?
Open, this
I don't want to hear anything.
Please, Abu Nasser.
Listen to what he wants to say.
Okay, I'll do it, just for you.
Speak, what do you want to say?
Tomorrow we'll have our last match in the tournament.
Don't upset him, Abu Nasser, please.
Alright, oh! Guys
Congratulations! Congratulations!
Zayn, Zayn, Zayn, Congratulations
Oh! Professor Nasser, my father wants to speak with you for a minute, please.
Good job, my team was punctual today.
Mr. Nasser, it is necessary.
You promised us a party.
Show me how to call and book a hall at the hotel.
We invite the press and journalists to come there.
No way! We'll find Rashid at our house.
So that on the day my father sees the players and their success, he might not cancel it.
Take the cup, take the cup, take the cup, take the cup, take the cup.
I hope so.
No, no, I saw him taking pictures with the players and talking to the press with them.
It seems Sami, the editor of the sports page, conducted an interview with him.
Picture
Keep him close to me.
Aim correctly.
He is happy.
You're proud of your baker sons' success.
Psychological
And the effort
Loyalty to the bakery.
"It's allowed, Abu Nasser, follow us. The team is playing 4-4-2."
Loyalty to the bakery and the coach's plan.
Thank you, Uncle Bo Nasser.
Health
Hello, goalkeeper.
League and Cup = Journalists from BeIN Sports conduct an interview with you.
No, they are not from the council.
They sent their representative to conduct the interview.
Bring the cup, bring the cup, bring the cup, bring the cup.
You know, we encourage the youth.
I expect a bright future for them.
Yes, goodbye.
Inshallah your phone will ring non-stop and your picture will be in the newspapers. Congratulations on this hatred.
Do you know who was talking to me on the phone?
He said the price of machines has gone down. He said okay.
Yeah, you've become famous now. Under every picture of you in the newspapers, they write: "First athlete in the global bakeries."
I wasn't interested in soccer.
What are you saying?
Since I was in school
The one who sat next to me loved football.
You say I wasn't close to football.
Since the person next to me plays football, I am close to football.
Being close to sports means I am an athlete.
We're not International Bakeries anymore, we've become International Football.
I heard him say he was going to make it a sports club.
And today we meet the first athlete of the global bakeries, Bo Nasser.
To develop football.
Before the match, tell us your predictions before you go to the theater.
The game is intense today.
The team that controls the midfield will be of the *...* type today.
Yeah, God willing, we're in contact with professional player agents to develop the International Bakery team.
His name is Saud. Listen, we need commitment.
(Ah, he wants the money from the last deal for the players)
It was of no use.
The day I gave you the prices.
I gave you the rate for international calls.
Doesn't the Gulf form part of the world?
Of course not.
This is none of your business.
You just need to tell me as soon as a Gulf customer arrives.
Open the fax line.
Two of them are defenders, one is a midfielder, and the other is a central player.
Look at these four players.
Three of them cost...
Two hundred thousand dollars per player
Take them all in one bunch.
It's six hundred thousand. I'll give them to you for five hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
This is about African players, now, the Brazilian player.
He's a million-dollar player in his own right.
Set this price, but later send me a fax to show it to me here. Let me see, I've received a fax from a club in the UAE.
The decision is yours.
Thank you.
God willing, he will examine his leg.
How is he?
Knee knee
The knee is beautiful.
We don't want to get injured, God willing, no cruciate ligament tears.
Oh! Bu Nasser
What is this muscular fiber?
Oh butcher, make me a flat roast.
Frankly, you're lucky to have Brazilian and African players. Congratulations, congratulations.
Thank you.
Alstore, Store
Oh, God willing, you have another business.
No, no, no, just the players.
I see them unloading boxes.
Hey guys! Yes, we want them, from the jungles of Africa.
Yes, why?
Karim, open one box for him.
He is a human being like us.
The youth said, "What did you hear?"
He said they were young.
As long as we
Why don't you give us this little boy as a free gift?
Listen, Abu Nasser, if you take care of him and raise him well, it will eventually benefit you.
And they go and leave in the stadium.
Please, please, please, please.
Poor, he's still young.
Put it in the annex and let him raise it.
If you need anything, don't hesitate, all the players are with me.
Your coach needs to understand.
We won 2-0, we dominated the game.
He is the coach of Spain.
I love it.
Successful coach
The game needs to be controlled.
And this is the opposite, Al Wakrah Road.
We can't just let the coach do whatever he wants.
He spent less than two months with the team.
We need to put a stop to this.
If he were an expert in football, he would have activated the wing players during corners and attacked from the center.
Ah, it relied on stealth.
Oh mother, don't make me wait long.
He must expel Kakono from Malawi.
And they replaced Shinamoo with Hababo Hitewala Hatoawa Hawawa.
No, no, no, no, no, I don't want him to play.
Keep away from his madness, his delusions are contagious.
What line?
Execute the plan.
Let go of your worries.
This is not the job of the coach and team manager.
Star of the game, star of the team
You mean we're not football experts.
Listen up! Sultan
Let him go home.
Don't take him in the bakery van, let him go in a taxi.
Your anger is not your business.
Stay informed.
Did I see my father do the right thing?
Throw it and bring it back.
What did he do?
The team is destroyed.
Goodbye, our team.
Mmm mmm
"No, he's not crazy. He said 'you're divorced.' Tell the truth, what happened between you?"
From the first day I saw him, I told your mother I didn't feel comfortable with this boy.
I feel he can't handle the responsibility.
Stop talking and reminiscing about the past.
You need to go to your father and find out why your daughter is divorced.
I don't know what to say, by God, my brother Rashid.
Why did he divorce her then?
It's not right, oh! Abu Abdullah, we need to know, we have the right to know why you're divorced?
Please don't interfere, it's none of your business.
How does that mean I shouldn't interfere? The man is waiting in the living room to find out why his daughter is divorced?
She doesn't know how to appreciate her husband and respect his feelings.
Who is Barcelona?
It's not your fault, you don't know La Liga.
Barcelona is not that great.
This is Guardiola's team.
I'm leaving now, the guy who's waiting for me in the lounge.
If I go, I'll go. Fine, stay here and leave it to me.
You have to go out and not shake your head.
She didn't stop cursing Barcelona.
Messi is the football magician who scores a hat-trick in every match.
Maradona himself said that Messi will be better than him.
And your daughter, who is immodest, makes fun of him. Listen.
I'm not a Barcelonan, and I don't like (the word).
What does that mean!
Listen, may God guide you.
Don't tell me you've lost my son.
He apologizes and reconciles with her.
Good health to you.
Praise be to God, we have a lot of money.
What's the point of our money if we can't make our son happy?
Oh, okay.
The most important thing is to play for Barcelona.
Mom, I'm not angry.
Go to hell! Forget about it, boy.
"Here's your tea, son."
You know, my son, they are the ones who will lose.
A thousand girls wish for you.
Drink, my son.
I feel guilty about it.
Oh my dear, she just got divorced two days ago.
After one month of marriage.
What's happening with you that you want me to interfere?
I don't want to be in trouble with him.
Who told you those inconsistent stories!
Don't listen to her.
She knows who he is.
What more do you want!
Her wealth is vast.
Remember the building I wanted to buy and convert into an apartment hotel?
Those in Mansoura.
She is her father's property, and when our son marries our daughter, I will ask him for this building.
If I can't.
Talk to her brother.
Listen carefully.
A millionaire who proposed to you was born.
Do you know what it means to be a millionaire!
Opportunity only comes once.
They were once so rich that they bought a palace in Spain to spend every summer there.
What about the whole Barcelona story?
The girl's family might have spread this rumor to prove their daughter's innocence.
Let's say the story is true and the man loves Barcelona and is loyal to Catalonia.
His wife is supposed to respect that.
And don't mock the team.
"Let's assume that this story is correct."
May God reward you with good, Your Highness Abu Burjain, because he has two towers on the corniche.
Design them in a strange way, like ropes twisted around themselves.
When people see them from a distance, they think it's one tower.
What do you think? All the wealth is yours.
Hello
Praise be to Allah, Zayn, take something for yourself, eat something for yourself.
Thank you, my love.
But tell me, my dear son Abdullah, he is waiting for your reply.
No, don't worry, my dear Am Abdullah's light of my eyes.
If I search all the Gulf countries, I won't find anyone better than you.
They are to give us their estimates for building the structure.
I'm done, Your Highness. Is there anything else?
Yes, your family is calling you.
Look into their wedding needs, prepare the check, and I'll sign it.
In the name of God, as He wills. In the name of God, as He wills. With your permission, sir.
Abdullah is divorced again!
I wish the kids were from you and the money from him.
Bless you, auntie.
Wear it to keep warm.
Yes, but I don't know where my mother booked us?
Where did you book us, Mom?
My mother says she booked us to Malaysia.
What's wrong with Malaysia?
Happy travels.
What's wrong with you? Has anyone heard anyone saying that she's crying on her way back from her honeymoon?
"Why are you crying, my daughter?"
Tell me what happened, my daughter.
Mom, she's so full of herself.
Why?
She's full of herself, forget about her.
Good for you for kicking her out.
I feel guilty about it.
This is her mother.
Why is she upset?
What happened to her?
May God reward you well. Don't forget to bring us olive oil from Spain.
Ah, Spain. Where are we going?
Zayn.
My mother says she booked us to the Maldives.
Okay, okay, oh! Maldives girls are also pretty.
And she still amazes you %pw.
I thought you were coming back happy from your trip.
What angers me the most is why did he take the kids?
Come! Take the bag.
What's wrong with them?
Why are you sad, my dear?
Be quiet, may God give you health to say such things about my son.
Oh! My son! Why are you sad?
When I see the peels, I'll get depressed.
May the one who upsets you die, my son.
Propose to her, propose to her, propose to her. Your father has a lot of money and there are many girls.
Shut up and know my children, anything small bothers him, why does he live miserably!
Oh dear, my son, call her and divorce her.
Praise be to God.
Say it to her three times.
You are divorced. Wait, wait, don't slam the door, two divorces.
Absolutely absolutely
Very tense
Oh! Dad, go ahead. Oh! Dear, relax and don't worry, there are plenty of girls, as they say. Go ahead! Dad, oh!
That's a problem.
Just because they saw you at the disco.
Word by word, let me speak to him.
What's my mother's name? He has already divorced me, he said "You are divorced, divorced."
Why is he the one divorcing you? Doesn't he have any shame?
Now if a woman goes to a disco, what will she do!
And one if necessary %pw.
What's wrong with him! What's happening in the world!
You see his spirit, you see his soul, you see him prostrating, you see him humiliated, and he doesn't know who you are.
I am the father of Abdullah's divorced daughter!
My daughter got divorced!
Your daughter is different.
You buy and sell them at Toys R Us stores.
As if you can taste the bitterness in your mouth right now for your daughter, and you're upset.
And they did nothing.
"If the apple doesn't get wet, it's peeled; divorce it."
It's fine to let them go as you please.
She's still married to Real.
It's fine with me, let him go.
And you feel the same feeling that people felt from your action.
Don't do to others what you don't want them to do to you.
Don't accept it for people.
Do you know who owned the land on which this complex is built?
In a strategic location?
Just leave it to God.
And also at a ridiculous price.
Our screen.
I need to get Abu Sakr's approval.
I went to his office, but I didn't find him.
And I was going to the library last week and they told me that he was traveling.
He has a meeting. Come tomorrow after it. I've already paid off my loan, and the problem is that I need to get Abu Saqr's approval.
He's the life of the party.
No, no, no, no, this is official business.
The right place for that, may God preserve you, is the office, not the house.
Are you eating yet?
What satisfies Abu Saqr?
Everyone has a key.
Tell me, Abu Fahad.
Do you know him?
What I know, I only see it on TV, and you told me that you meet him during Umrah.
We don't know each other well.
Let's go.
God guides you to at least consider the reason for this holiday.
No need, may God guide you.
The month is thirty days long, and he has made fifty resolutions.
I suggest Your Excellency that they put you in the Guinness Book of Records.
As the world's largest banquet maker.
By the way, who is the brother with you?
Welcome, this is a blessed time.
Honor, Your Highness.
So oh! Abu Falah
You say Abu Saqr is having a feast every day.
This is what we see.
Come on! Abu Fula, invite us tonight for a special occasion.
May God protect you and your son, Saqr, today.
Machine Allah, Bou Mohammed Bou Abdulaziz deserves it. May Allah bless you.
He is here, welcome my son.
Peace be upon you.
Why?
By the way, my son Saqr needs to visit the agency tomorrow and choose the car he wants.
I've been waiting for approval for a year and a half.
I was out of range.
But the day I arrived at his place
And give him money.
May God guide you, Abu Saad.
This way things don't work.
I said to him, "Okay."
He needs to visit the exhibition and choose the car he likes.
We buy three for him.
We'll call him!
Take me to him.
You told me you saw him on his pilgrimage last year.
Today, his elder son Shahin.
His game was banquets.
This is your chance.
Visit him and congratulate him.
"It's worth being good, oh! Your Excellency."
Shahin Oh! Abu Sakkar.
Praise be to God, thank you people.
Praise be to God that Shahin is well, may your life be long.
God bless you
By the way, who are you?
Happiness
You didn't recognize me.
I can't describe you (expression).
Your Highness, I was with you last year at this time.
I remember buying a red rosary.
God bless you.
I was in the hospital.
Visiting a relative
It's a pleasure to meet you.
So, are you still hesitant about entering the business field or have you made up your mind?
I'm tired of him.
"Why, Falcon, trade is a fine thing."
You have to start, open an office, and then see.
Abu Sakr,
Please, sir, say yes.
Why?
I have a gift, a falcon.
Full circle
Even if trade loves you and is coming to you, you would say no.
Who has everything available to them like you do today? Since you got the license, everything comes to you for free—a car and the best office on the corniche.
Yesterday, Abu Abdul Aziz was telling your father that if Saqr wants to enter into business, he will make him a partner with 50% share.
Mom, how can I balance business and university?
Mom, don't make me do something I don't like.
And you're lucky that agencies, offices, and cars are dropping on you for free.
It's an opportunity, boy, for whoever can start a project in this era without capital.
Your only credit is people's love for your father.
Be smart and invest it.
Believe me, my son, this is the opportunity of a lifetime.
Oh Rose, prepare lunch quickly.
And he arrived with the pickles and pepper.
He left nothing, he left nothing, I'm afraid he'll take over the samosa agency.
Your son has a good appetite for business.
This is what I was waiting to see. Do you know what he told me today?
He told his mother, "I want to expand my investments."
He wants to enter the Caribbean Sea and invest in the islands there.
And may Allah protect him from the eyes of the envious.
Abu Sultan was telling me yesterday, "Your son has just entered the business."
He has twenty agencies, six restaurants, and is a shareholder in two banks.
The input
I think, Allah knows best, that they haven't opened it yet.
Ah, what's wrong with the person in the northern area of our office?
No, I just liked it.
Good health to you and congratulations, Abbas.
In the name of God.
God bless you all.
There's no need to regret now.
What are you saying, man! A whole year of misery and hard work to get the supermarket ready.
What's happening! I think he passes by the shop every day.
He saw her and sent his secretary, whose name is Samer.
He told me that this is Saqr bin Abu Saqr, he wants to be your partner instead of taking the shop from you.
Does he want to be your partner again?
There is no power or might except with Allah.
You started talking to him, right?
He asked me, "Who are you, brother?"
I said business!
Why did you tell him you have an Iranian bakery?
The day we were walking by this bakery, there was a small sign. What was written on that sign? What was the name written on the sign?
It was written on it: "Al-Farij Bakery".
No, my father's name is different.
Peace be upon you.
How's your job going?
Present, Your Highness. God willing, we will finish the workers' accommodation drawings for the Future Company tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.
No, Professor Sakr, this is my wife, Elissa. Let me introduce you to Professor Sakr, the owner of the company.
Hello, how are you?
Let her take one of the company cars.
Thank you very much, you're not falling short.
Even cooking now has become a science and a study.
Today, someone says, "I want to work in business. He has some money and wants to invest it."
But he doesn't have sufficient knowledge, understanding, or study of economics, or even business.
A person like this
Do you expect him to succeed? I don't expect him to waste his time and lose.
Did you hear? Oh! Abu Nasser!
I heard Shadi and Raqeh talking on Monday. What were they saying?
What is this?
You are my son, Falcon.
See it.
Speak today.
Oh, we're not talking about your son, Saqr.
We're talking about the rule.
Your son, Sakr, is exceptional, God bless him. I don't want to sound jealous.
Thank you, he's talking about the rule.
You scared me, my son, Falcon builds his age with his own soul.
He once gave me a car as a gift.
He sold it and invested the money on his own advice.
And whatever Allah has written, see it now.
Oh! Falcon, we're talking about ordinary people.
One of them is a falcon, and that's what Abu Nasser did with him. He took him and put him on the track.
Sagar has business talents.
Strong economic preferences.
Do we need to ask who his father is?
I'm really surprised.
"Masha'Allah" (Arabic: ما شاء الله) translates to "What God wills" or "God has willed".
Gulf Money newspaper in the economic referendum
Please.
Peace be upon you, hello hello Salem.
What's wrong with him?
By God, I don't know what to say! Oh, Salem.
Ah, I remember.
The story was true.
They say the company sends a fax to my father.
And they said to him
Oh, he couldn't bear it.
Saw.
They say that when he heard the news, ...
He fell in the office with the fax in his hand.
And he has done him much good.
As they say, I taught him how to shoot, and when his arm grew strong, he shot me.
What did the doctor say?
Pray for him, everyone! Salim
I am shocked.
I can't believe there are people like that in this world.
A man who gives to the poor without his left hand knowing what his right hand is doing.
Donations from this organization reach all Muslims in Asia and Africa.
But still, I would like Your Highness to clarify your goals and future steps, God willing.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, our goal at the Saqr Charity Association is to achieve solidarity in this homeland.
In addition to sixty blankets for our brothers affected by the Pakistan earthquake.
Last but not least, we also support seven poor families.
With a monthly salary of only one hundred and thirty-two riyals.
We won't be late.
I'll be right there.
Who is this deer?
Khaled and his wife are inviting us to the hotel tonight.
Yes, wherever I am with you, I am comfortable.
Oh my love, (may God keep you for me) is an expression.
Oh my age!
This is not fair. This is my livelihood.
This bakery
And take money for your own good.
Beans for five riyals, hot bread for three riyals.
Two hummus.
5 beans very very
They cooked six beans!
Come on, divers.
The captain is present and he brought breakfast.
Needs men.
Please, Your Highness.
What does it mean?
No, no, what I'm asking you for is to hear the word "yes" ringing in my ear.
Hello Nora.
Anoud is mad at you.
Can I bear your anger?
What happened?
Why are you upset?
Noura chose a plain and simple dress.
Don't say Anaud will get upset.
Oh my God, these Lebanese speak properly.
And you don't need to talk to him too much.
Even I'm jealous of her.
The best dress for the sweetest flower.
He flirts with her by calling her "little flower."
Let your blood boil, how long will it take?
I paid twenty thousand, and twenty thousand is remaining.
God compensate you, congratulations!
God be with you.
Hello, you honor Umm Saleh.
Hello Fadi, you look busy, I don't want to keep you.
I'm at your service.
Hello, hello
Did you receive the text message yesterday?
I've arrived, you idiot.
Did you like the joke?
So you brought the design with you?
I didn't have time to make them, show me your designs and I'll choose from them.
Frankly, your taste is better.
When they leave us, envy starts working.
He knows my project is good and has started to generate income for me.
They say he's going to do a project similar to mine.
Design and Tailoring Studio
Women's clothing.
This is Bu Nasser who doesn't have anything in business.
There are banks.
He wants to harm his cousin.
That's how it is these days.
Yes, he is my cousin.
Do you know what happened to me? I was sleeping and they woke me up, saying your cousin wants you.
Everything is fine! Ask me anything you want!
Everything is fine, everything is fine.
Inshallah.
You have no intention of any project, for example, like, like.
Are you looking for a partner or something?
I heard you were determined, so I thought I should pay you a visit.
Excuse me.
If you need more, we have it.
Praise be to God, the work is going very well.
What should I do, Abu Saleh?
They just ran it last week, too.
Yes, do it.
Okay, fine. If God wills it, goodbye.
This is it.
Are you sure?
With haute couture and the great misfortune!
What is it?
He rented a shop next to yours.
(Ad) Oh, you jealous ones! (Ad) Oh, you haters!
Before you know that the market is open to everyone.
You need to know.
May your heart be content with your cousin's daughter.
I'm not here to ask you questions.
You deny, lie, and mock me, and you said that to me.
I'd like to do my job in secret.
To take that shop next to us, you don't want to disrupt my work.
But they didn't say come and be like a thorn in the throat next to the wisdom teeth, you're driving me crazy.
This is envy and hatred, by God. I swear, I won't applaud you. This is hatred, leave me alone.
Come on, you guys are family! People?
Shame on you, Abu Saleh!
Leave him to me, I'll deal with him. Oh, you and your size!
I'll hit you just as you hit me with your theft.
Come on! People.
Just say "Peace be upon him" people.
By God, by God, I didn't do anything.
He advised me to hire a designer from the Philippines.
Don't let anyone lie to you.
Why specifically the Lebanese?
They're chatting with him, joking, and laughing, and they're all very relaxed.
That's why Abu Saleh brought a Lebanese person.
He started saying nice things and convincing me.
Enchant me, enchant me with a word from him.
He convinced me and made me pay twelve thousand riyals.
And after two days, I went to the auction market and found the same cabinet, its twin, for nine hundred riyals.
And you make money.
He is a Lebanese designer.
Can I meet with the gentleman? Yesterday you told me it was difficult, is it also difficult today?
Yes, by God, today is also very difficult.
I feel that Abu Saleh has been different these past few days.
What's wrong with him?
"No, I don't know. What happened?"
Abu Saleh is mentally exhausted after his cousin opened a shop and hired a Lebanese designer just like him.
For the past two weeks, the store's sales have been decreasing.
This problem is here in Qatar. No Qatari opens a shop without another Qatari coming and doing the same project and opening the same shop next to him. Should I go to him?
No, no, no, no, he's with Fadi the designer now, sitting and thinking of a solution.
What do we do now?
We're sitting here eating fish.
If we continue like this, I think we won't even be able to pay the rent for the shop.
A place far from them.
This means clearing the field for them.
Thank you very much, and what is the value of the discount?
Impossible, why don't you give away an evening gown with every wedding dress for free?
No hope, let's go.
What's happening? What's going on? We're going to the store next to you today, they're offering with every wedding suit 2 free evening jalabiyas and also a 25% discount.
Okay, let's go, come on.
And now wait two weeks, they will make the same announcement: Buy a wedding dress and get two evening jalabiyas with a 25% discount.
They are fighting us.
I'm thinking the same thing, if we leave them they'll destroy us.
What's on him.
What have you been up to?
It's definitely a challenge.
Of course, this is a challenge.
Bravo, this troublemaker deserves it, he doesn't want anyone to earn a living.
If he starts hearing the news within a few days, he'll close his shop.
Well done.
Moment by moment, sugar by sugar, I'm coming to you now, bye.
What's happening?
Saud says the place is uninhabitable and no one can live there. He says he doesn't know where this stench is coming from.
The smell has nothing to do with this ice cream, it's impossible.
Its smell lingers in the shop for at least six days.
100% sure.
Good night.
He cut the electrical wires from the shop.
Is this fair?
Now, will I sign a pledge or will we open a case and start a file?
Don't do anything for him.
Cut him out of this life.
Oh! Abu Nasser Something strange happened, no one comes to our place.
Abu Nasser, check, check, there's a customer coming, I'll talk to you later. This is very strange.
He lies in his bed groaning.
He said it's a psychological condition, and I was afraid to tell him that the bank called and they want the installments.
He was burdened with debts because of his miserly cousin.
What happened to him this time?
Poor them if they enter by mistake and see Saad the designer, they will scream in his face and run away from him.
Asleep! Poor thing, he never feels sleepy, his eyes are wide open and he stares at the ceiling.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
Saud is at the shop.
He bewitched him, I don't know what happened to him.
The women see it and are afraid of it.
I don't know, what happened to him?
You lost me, you lost me.
I have a lot of debts.
I'm afraid they'll imprison me.
I have no evidence against him to be able to sue him.
I don't know what I'm doing, I don't know what I'm doing.
Let him deserve it.
Please tell me what kind of magic you did to him. You made him turn into a monster, and women are afraid when they see him.
Spread a rumor.
Moob okay oh! Hey guys, tell him the photography group urgently needs him.
Oh! Please, people, I beg you, please tell him we need him urgently, urgently.
They really get on my nerves, drive me crazy, and annoy me. This is unfair, Professor Abdullah.
It's okay, dear Ahmed, don't be upset. You have heart problems, it's not good for you, my friend!
I swear I've called him so many times, my ear hurts, but he's just no good. Those extras are driving me crazy, driving me crazy.
You don't do anything, I'm responsible for everything!
Listen to me, I'll give you a deaf ear and a blind eye.
Episode twenty-five, scene fourteen, Ahmed and we're trying to finish.
Stop the filming because the extra didn't show up.
Oh my God, the production!
I have nothing to do with this. Oh! Professor Abdullah, why are you shouting at me?
Oh dear, if you don't want anyone to shout at you,
What happened, Abdullah?
Additional delay and they are in trouble.
Oh! Ahmed, I don't want anyone, my love.
Find someone who is valuable, someone who can convince people that he can truly become a millionaire and a billionaire, not just anyone.
Please, uncle, upload the photos and your order will be ready in half an hour.
No one, Ala'a, no one. I was just explaining to him.
Okay, I'll try to manage with two scenes instead of one.
You are responsible, and you are the production manager. You are responsible.
What are they going to do now?
They'll fix everything. You'll see the director getting angry and everything will be messed up, but they'll fix it.
I want one with these specifications. Where can I find it now?
What?
I didn't hear what the director said.
I know someone who might be able to help you. God willing, he will be of benefit to you.
%PW Saud Al-Nubk!
Saud Kanz! Remember him as Saud Nabq.
Yes, when he was little, they called him Saud Al-Nabk, and when he grew up a bit, they started calling him Kanz.
Why cans?
I'm telling you why, poor guy was wandering the streets, collecting cans and selling them by the kilo.
Oh! My brother, you are rich and respected, not depressed.
He's well-built, as I recall, he was quite muscular, a bit stocky, not tall and not fat.
Are you sure it's appropriate?
Inshallah, but you need to do his makeup properly, and I guarantee he will look suitable. He's actually quite funny.
Zayn is waiting, what's he calling for!
I don't have his number.
I'll take Amir with me and go to him.
Where is Saud Al-Ghanz's house?
What's he saying?
Shut up, shut up.
Saudi cans
We didn't have anyone in our neighborhood named Saud Cans.
Yeah, I'm sure it's from this neighborhood, but I forget which house.
This house belongs to someone named Saud and he lives with his mother.
Yeah, true.
But this is not Saudi cans.
This is Saud's laptop.
Sure, it just improves over time because the laptop is the same as the box.
Tall, sturdy, and a bit tanned.
He canceled the cans and started collecting old laptops. Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go Oh! Real one
He went to the vegetable market to buy it for me. Am I a goat? Where's the other one?
I don't know, my son.
This is what you always wear.
I have another one. Where is the other jotara? Where is it?
For the holiday.
This is what I'm looking for.
Fix and Mark X oil.
My son, iron it a bit before you go, it's creased.
But these days, I feel worse.
Mom, God guide you. Since yesterday, I've been trying to convince you to go to the emergency room, but you refused.
Oh mum, they said they'd pay me.
Alhamdulillah, you're now employed instead of being unemployed.
Come on, Mom, goodbye.
You wrestle her, get angry, and walk away.
You're sitting and slowly moving, and the camera will move with you to the right.
A. Jaafar! A.
Whose laptop?
Any one Aboud this is a very well-known actor Abdullah Al-Lamah.
This is for you, for me he is %pw boy, Aboud how are you?
How are you, my servant?
"She's the same age as you, but she acts more mature in front of people."
Yeah, we're from the same neighborhood.
Calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, be quiet, be quiet.
I love acting. I hope they give me a role where I can hit you.
Walking as you know, brother.
Once tired, you know she didn't sleep last night. Oh! My brother!
Asthma, oh! May Allah heal my brother.
May God heal her.
Your life is a bowl of cherries (idiomatic expression).
Oh! Sheikh, oh! Sheikh.
Does he have asthma medication for my mother?
He's a director, not a doctor.
Look at yourself, listen to what he's saying, his words make no sense.
What's his mother's name?
Spit in your face, what do you think of yourself?
I heard what they're saying about you.
It's a rule that says you're trivial, you should be more serious.
Give me, give him, give him, give him, give him half a million so he can fix the tires of my car.
And they gave him three million to bring me dinner.
I was asking you why you speak like that.
Because it's based on the requests of some people.
See Mr. Ghafel our local production, high-level actors.
Now excellent, he suits the role.
Okay, I'll help him. I don't have feelings, do I?
Did your parents buy this?
Your life is just a basket of cherries.
Take the gentleman to the makeup room, apply makeup to him, and I'll tell Salman to bring you the clothes and pick you up.
Go, go, go, this is sweet.
Fine, fine.
Listen, brother, leave the car with us until we finish shooting. I'll call you to pick it up.
Could someone give me a ride, please?
For you! Okay, I'll have our driver pick you up. Alright, thank you, brother. Thank you, thank you, wait.
Okay, call your friend, the extra one, call him.
Oh! People are calling Saud from the makeup room.
Let him clean my teeth.
It's written in front of me.
Okay, let's review.
This means me!
I didn't expect that from you.
Why are we fighting?
We fight for our rights.
Ah, wait.
And you need to know who you're talking to, Abu Abdulaziz.
Why did you divorce her, oh brother?
Divorce her and be done with it.
We would not marry our daughter to a thief's son.
Whatever you need, what do you think?
I'll clean it later, but the most important thing is to get ready because you're going to the fitting room to change your clothes, and we're ready to start shooting.
My teeth, toothpaste is expensive.
Oh! Guys, the shooting of this scene has been postponed.
Why like this?
I don't want tea, man, I'm sick of it. My stomach is bloated from this tea. What is this? I've been waiting for an hour. How long should I wait?
I didn't see anything. That's very normal.
May God give you health and strength.
These are fast.
Thank you, Your Excellency. May God preserve you.
Convey my salutations to those dear to you.
They say Abu Abdulaziz sends his regards.
Present, sir %PW.
That was fun, wasn't it?
Whoever is like you, they hand you over and kiss you on the forehead.
The first time someone kissed my nose.
How do they kiss them on the nose?
This is a problem.
His nose was like an ice cream stick, it would fit in your mouth. That was funny, that was fun.
I didn't laugh!
Don't mention it.
Can I become an actor?
Something's wrong. What's with your voice?
My son, my son is very tired, waiting for you.
Come quickly.
Welcome, Sheikh, welcome.
See her there by yourself, man.
Hear me, oh!
Alright, go now.
I see a lot of reverence.
What happened, my son?
"And upon you be peace. What's wrong, Your Highness?"
Vinegar, vinegar, vinegar, vinegar
And what's wrong with you, God willing, Dr. Hassan, come here, come here.
Oh! What happened, Dr. Hany?
Let honor rest in the office.
Don't worry.
She is the mother of all, God willing, she will be better.
Welcome, welcome, welcome.
Skate or I'll hit you in the face.
My name is Abu Abdulaziz.
Call me Oh! Sir.
How are you, Your Highness?
You chew.
Yes, Your Highness.
Welcome! Your Highness, please make yourself comfortable.
God bless you.
With this ugly face.
Go with him, Professor Rashid.
"And God, if I don't do something for you, tell me and you'll see what I'll do to him."
Oh! Friend, can I find a doctor quickly, please?
Doctor, my mother is sick!
Wait in line, it's your turn.
Hear me, oh!
Brother, can I ask you?
Oh! Yuba quickly, I'm sick.
You go to the hospital a lot, you take your mother every week, I haven't found anyone like them, they are good and they accept anything.
Unlike citizens.
Don't forget the citizens.
Zayn, go look for a woman in the hospital.
I love her.
Enough, brother! Oh! You're ignoring me.
Okay, then try to be close to her. Smile at her. Look at her. Give her your number. Your intentions are pure.
There's nothing wrong.
Take care of yourself.
"Don't go outside. If you don't go outside, I'll call security so they can teach us a lesson."
No, I don't want anything.
Why, Professor, you must drink.
For my sake.
No, thank you.
You can take her and leave the hospital.
The person speaking to you is Fahad Al-Marzouk.
If you're going to take him, then take him.
No, no, I want the clothes and the car too. I'll rent them from you.
So I can give you your money.
No, no, no, wait a moment.
Come on.
And what is this %PW Al-Falah Al-Marzouk!
Welcome, welcome! May God bless you.
The light of my eye was the site of his engagement ceremony yesterday.
I wish you had come.
They were surprised by what I did for them; it was a very elegant and unique party.
One is regular, and the other is diet.
Now you have no excuse.
What is this?
Mom, I promised my colleagues tomorrow at work.
Are you giving them this?
Yeah, what's up?
Noura, come here!
What is this?
He's going to take this to his friends to embarrass him.
Don't even think about taking it, or everyone will talk about you.
Give me money, and tomorrow I'll buy you something nice.
Yeah, but I've already promised them now.
I have to take it tomorrow.
What are they still doing? Change your clothes so we can get something to distract people.
Get lost! Come on.
And it is reasonably priced and its quality is very excellent.
Above average, but not the softest!
Of course there's high-end chocolate, but I thought you were looking for something affordable.
This is way too expensive, why are you looking for the most expensive one?
Unbelievable, look at this artistic touch.
This is called royal chocolate.
The same chocolate that is always ordered at the Spanish court.
Give me this.
Congratulations, and by the way, it comes with a warranty.
Welcome, welcome, rejoice!
Come here, my friend. Give us some of this chocolate, my friend.
What's the occasion, man?
No, Saleh Abdulqader, the one in accounting.
"By the blessing of God, he deserves it, give me one more."
And bring the coffee quickly.
Auntie, did you go to their wedding?
Oh, my darling, I'm going to their wedding, it's a disaster, it's disgusting. You believed it, my sister.
Did you hear what your aunt said?
That's why I want to throw you a wedding like no other has been or will be.
No time, you only have one and a half months.
I'm organizing everything.
But he won't let me do anything.
You're not living in the community, you're not seeing how people put everything they have into their weddings.
And you saw for yourself.
When you buy something nice, see how they praise you and your taste.
Didn't they tell you it's terrible and amazing?
Right, but how much did we pay?
The money we paid for the chocolate could buy us four sheep for the wedding.
Please don't interfere. Your mother knows how to do everything. Just give her the money and that's it.
This means they will accept whatever we choose.
Ew, your taste is terrible.
What's your opinion about this stage?
But excellence costs a lot of money.
Why, why, the previous one was better.
What do you think about this?
This is the first time in Qatar that someone has thought of creating a stage like a computer mouse.
Excuse me, one minute.
See the talk about everything except the stage and arrangements. This is the place where women with nothing to do but talk will sit. That's it.
The men are waiting for us.
We're going to the mouse stage.
It's a very strange phase.
The latest model in 2011.
We've already chosen the mouse.
You can sit aside, this is all for your own good.
You have to choose, if it's Noah's Ark, you have to pay an extra twenty thousand, and if it's the rat, you pay one hundred and twenty-five thousand.
Make up your minds and we're ready.
You're the first one to get married.
And do you see yourself taking someone from the Comoros? This is the kind of thing that happens in our country.
And we're still just at the beginning.
If you don't want a stage, where will you put the bride? In a box?
Iron, paint, and a bit of wood.
And the people are happy.
These people are playing us and laughing at us. They are scammers.
What are you doing now?
Annoyed and upset?
If you want to get married, it's your choice.
I'm telling you, the bride's mother has a right to know that Saleh is going through very difficult circumstances.
Doesn't he want to get married? Can't he afford the wedding expenses? That's fine with me. Do you want me to tell her? I'm serious, I'll call her.
We received a bouquet of flowers from the Netherlands.
In my opinion, if you put them on the tables at the wedding.
Are you sure this is your first time in Doha?
Also the Middle East!
Put it on the bill.
How much more will it increase?
One hundred and seventy-two, okay then.
As for Samir, I don't want to see this group at any wedding.
You know people's gossip.
Okay, they're reserved.
Your salary is higher than mine.
You're making a story that we won't be able to handle.
God help you, Saleh.
Only God guides you, you should have tried to fix things.
For me, praise be to God, I've decided to look for a wife in any Arab country.
They say there that marriage costs you just two thousand dollars and you're set.
Bless you, dear.
If God wills, his wedding will be next month.
You just need to specify how many cards you want and tell me.
If the invitations are sufficient, then goodbye. The most important thing is that people know they are invited, where and when, and that's it.
Your concern is only your concern, not what people say.
People know the level of the wedding from the cards.
Tomorrow is the day they'll see this wedding. I know what the women will say.
Look at their wedding over there. If these are their invitation cards, they haven't seen the cards of so-and-so.
We said we'd order it online.
It has a cloth cover, panda skin, and a silver sheen.
No one can blame you; you can't stop me.
I won't be the topic of the ladies' conversation. We'll order the cards, we'll order the cards!
I feel sorry for him, really.
Oh, my dear, his family is definitely putting a lot of pressure on him.
Oh man, he's sucking up to everyone.
What are you talking about? He even sold his car.
And he looked like he aged twenty years, this morning I saw him talking to himself.
Don't blame him oh! My brother, poor thing, I don't know when we'll develop.
Please close the door.
Pardon me, oh! My brother.
Did you try to convince them to have a wedding within your budget?
What do you mean by my budget?
Why? Do I live alone?
The problem our society suffers from is the illness of appearances, showing off, and boasting.
It forces you to be sick with the same illness.
If you want to live in it.
Once I winked at the mother of the bride.
She attacked me with her words (figuratively).
Trust in God.
By the way, tell me.
How did you get married?
And I don't want to get married, I'm not crazy.
Even if I decided, my brother, to get married.
I'm just thinking of marrying a foreigner or even an Arab.
He says your country!
We decided to get a DJ for the music.
Just because Umm Nasser brought a famous singer to her son's wedding.
He's a very well-known singer, but I forgot his name.
Why are you so upset?
It seems you don't like what I'm doing!
Enough that he sold his car, and every day one of his friends gives him a ride.
Previously, I entered the room and found him talking to himself.
I see, now you've changed your mind.
Since my brother Saleh is tired, mother, that's enough now.
I don't care about you and him.
I'm no less than people.
Don't make a mockery of us.
Oh, Mom, enough. My brother spent all he had and took money from everyone.
"Excuse me, be quiet."
My mother has new demands for the wedding, and my brother said he has no money. She shouted at him, and he said, "Tell them to cancel the wedding, I don't want to get married."
Where is she now?
She's inside and they're giving her first aid.
He said she was much better now and they were finding her a room in the hospital.
Oh, the scandal!
Relax, oh sister.
The doctor told you that you need to rest and gave you an injection to help you sleep.
How can he rest while he wants to make a mockery of us before the good and the bad?
I told him to bring me Abdullah Roishan, and he said he didn't have any money.
I feel sorry for your mother.
I'm afraid for her.
Go to her, go to her and kiss her head.
And tell her what she wants will happen.
I'll bring you Abdullah Roaished.
Abu Yusuf is kind; I don't expect that he won't help me.
It's not fair, you couldn't find anyone but Abu Yusuf.
He's cured!
Are you crazy, Saleh?
But the minister kept him because he was an old man and more than that, he was a disciplined and honest man.
In my opinion, if you tell him the same thing I told you, there's a good chance his heart will stop.
Yeah, sure.
This is because of the severe crisis you are going through and you want to ask Abu Youssef for some money, of course from the ministry's funds.
And Allah knows best, but when will you return it to him?
And if the accountants come and ask him about the money?
Sure, there could be a problem.
No one will know, and he will know how to act.
It's up to you. The men are in his office, and you need to be responsible if something happens to him.
I'm stealing in my last days!
It's not called stealing, Uncle.
On the first floor.
In it, there is a white box wrapped in a blue ribbon with a circle on it containing a picture of a dove's wing. Bring it, bring it.
Alright, Uncle Abu Youssef, it's me. If I don't have any problems,
I'm paying for everything.
They call me Abu Yusuf.
And you came in my last days
And ruin me, O Thursday
Salih, Salih.
"Listen, if someone else said this, they'd be slapped or something worse would happen to them. Oh, oh, oh, Khalid."
Salih, Salih.
All the methods I've tried are useless, Uncle Boyoussef. I am drowning.
I can't change my mind about getting married.
And you know they are all bald.
What's wrong with you?
No, no, the second one, the tablet I'm afraid of, the tablet I'm afraid of.
In the drawer, in the drawer.
Oh Uncle Boyusuf, the stairs are full of grains. Which one do you want?
The real image can be formed with the lens.
We've already booked two rooms for hair and makeup, just for us.
And we'll be there from tomorrow.
We came with Abdullah Al-Ruwaished and his band.
You'll get it, my dear.
No, I won't tell you.
Will this series be the most watched of the season?
We are the first people in the world to use it.
Mmm mmm
Bye bye.
There is no god but God.
Oh my son, don't forget to recite the Mu'awwadhatain when you enter the wedding hall.
The women here have evil eyes.
I told you before that it's awesome.
The best family I've ever met, may God protect you, I don't want to envy you.
Hmm, the police are knocking on the door.
I was wrong to obey you, O God.
It's not true, today is my wedding day.
"They are coming for the overtime."
And now, he will be imprisoned. Oh my God.
Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf!
It's still early.
That's not fair if that happens!
The company offered a contract of three million, two million of which was just for materials.
Wrote a memo to the minister.
We know there is corruption, but it doesn't reach this extent.
You don't seem to be living in this world with us.
Tell me what Osman's minister said.
And why didn't our leader object? They say he agreed with them.
By God, I don't know about him. By God, I don't know.
Where is the morality?
The right became left, and the left became right.
Oh! Saad, are you sure the minister fired him? Oh! What's happening in this world?
I just fired him!
And what next?
He is the king of the minister's sister.
This girl has a relationship with the minister.
Oh wonderful world.
What's wrong with you, guys? Don't you know who she is?
This is the new employee whom the minister hired to replace the disgraced Uthman.
Go, go, go.
What do you want me to do, Saleh? Object to the minister.
You're crazy!
Listen to me, man.
We have children, we want to live.
We want to live.
What happened?
That's him, standing by the elevator.
This is the reward for loyalty and honesty, brother Saleh.
I wish we could do something for you, brother.
Praise be to God, praise be to God in all circumstances.
What's wrong with you?
These are the strange things we see before us in this world.
We see things that are unbelievable.
I'm at your disposal.
I want you to stop by the cooperative after work to buy some vegetables for the salad.
I'll try. Goodbye, then.
Who's taking my sister home?
And she is very old, laughs, and asks who this is.
Hathil is my colleague at university, what's wrong if he drops me home? It's normal.
Oh my, I can't believe it, why do you look like this?
What are you saying?
Don't you hear what we're saying?
You're old-fashioned.
This is an old and yet new topic about right and wrong!
Right is right and wrong is wrong.
Life has evolved, and we are living in the age of technology.
The era of international variables that keep pace with the world and no one can catch up.
The more I live, the more I see!
Don't blame me, Manira! It's not in my favor to be tense and angry.
This is one of the things he sees in his day.
Saying he's sorry.
The world is not right.
Don't be sad, come have lunch.
Let me sleep so I can rest.
The official isn't angry with you.
Is the official not angry?
No, he's not my husband. Go wash your face and come back for lunch.
Present, my dear.
I'd love to meet you on my first day of work.
Honor, Your Highness.
Of course, of course.
Of course, I know you don't need anyone to remind you of the basics of work.
But at the same time, it's very important.
To remind you of some of the values and principles we work by.
In the public interest.
This is what should be your honor.
We all have to.
Oh sir, the lottery is very necessary.
They become thieves.
Thank you, thank you all.
Something else I want to say
And I warned you from my first day at work,
There is one employee among you.
Who is sincere, loyal, and faithful, and free from these bad things?
Just a little doubt.
There is a dedicated employee.
So that we can take the necessary legal action against him in our ministry.
No, it will be as you wish, Your Highness.
Praise be to God, we are all thieves.
As you wish, my lord, I'll say it in front of and behind my colleagues.
Where is Khalid?
Yes, Your Highness.
Khaled, you were always praising me, God bless you.
Present, sir.
Oh! Your Highness, you know how to choose.
"Only God guides you"
Why did you let the devil play with you?
You should be thankful that the matter was only about honesty.
Mom, why is my father in prison?
Be quiet! Oh, a girl.
No, no, I won't do it again.
Mom, why is my father in prison?
Stop.
This means he became honest.
It's wrong to say your father is honest.
Is this cool?
Your whole body is covered.
What will people see?
And maybe that means you're looking for a job, but no one will hire you like this.
Is there a respectable woman who covers her body and attractions?
She covers her chest, wearing linen here, still afraid of suffocating herself.
I'm tired of it, my son.
And I bought her a blouse and pants that reveal the upper half of her stomach above the navel.
It's just a hopeless situation, she doesn't want to be on the right track.
Here I am telling you!
It's only you who blames yourself.
To ask for the hand of your daughter Sarah for our son Rashid.
These days, one of us is only looking for men who are suitable for his daughter.
Let me tell you, Rashid, my son.
He's very kind.
What stops from drinking (idiom).
Drunk 24/7.
Drunk, drugged, and heavy all day.
And do not ask about debauchery.
Well-educated.
And let me say also that he is a hypocrite.
And how about the theft?
This is what I expected from you. How about drugs?
It's clear that I'll give you five riyals if you can find his eyes. I'll make a bet on it.
By the way, Abu Sara, we're just asking about the girl's hand.
You know the hustle and the loitering.
We know she comes from a good family.
The boy's blessing, a blessing, that's how the world is, a blessing.
I'm drunk.
I can't walk.
Come on, let's go.
Okay bye bye
Okay, call your father to come pick you up.
Why do I have to be the one to call him?
So he can come and pick you up.
Where is he?
I saw him there hanging out with his buddies, one of them was blonde.
Grandfather, by God, your father is walking happily.
Welcome, dear daughter Mona!
Majid! His name was Abdulaziz.
Yeah, true.
You're confusing me, my daughter.
And you know about the establishment of the State of Palestine with its capital in Jenin in 2090, after signing a comprehensive peace treaty with the State of Israel.
And Israel continues to practice terrorism, pressure, and siege against it.
And the latest is what the Israelis and their Arab friends have raised in claims against the Palestinians.
They smuggle plastic knives through the tunnels.
Especially Article Two, paragraph one (a), which states that the Palestinian people must cut their nails every day.
Let's go now to the decisive meeting.
Oh, cheapskate!
When Israel agrees to establish a Palestinian state,
Oh! Are you saying oh! Real? You're ruining our reputation, let me go!
For my sake!
Excuse me, Professor Nimer, excuse me, Professor Chief.
Can you give me a chance to speak?
Fully committed to the comprehensive international agreement.
What does the Israeli representative say?
To find any solid object, whether stone or plastic, as promised.
Oh! Even our homes, O King!
What do you call it, people of the Gulf?
In Palestine, everything is made of wood.
American companies, according to the agreement, provide us with wooden cars.
And all the doors of our houses are made of thermally treated wood.
We need to talk.
Don't change the subject.
Mr. President,
This is a very sensitive issue, and I want to vote on it because nail lengthening is a violation of the agreement.
If you agree, raise your hands.
But I had a strange dream once.
So you can control the students.
I'm tired of telling him.
This is the fourth school you will start attending from tomorrow.
Because I asserted my strong personality as a teacher from the beginning.
The children were behind him, tearing his clothes, and he did nothing.
How many times have I seen him without his headscarf?
This is what the manager told me.
Rashid is kind and we don't want to let him go.
The kids throw chalk at him.
And they pull his gutra in the break in front of everyone.
They said that this teacher is very indecisive and will ruin everything.
Should I tell them the ketchup story?
Come on, Mary.
What's the deal with ketchup? This is new, no one told me!
They poured an entire bottle of ketchup on the chair.
Come on, sit down.
He didn't know anything.
But one day he saw the kids laughing at him in the schoolyard.
Stop.
By the way, the principal of the school you'll be starting to work at tomorrow called me.
But, okay, we'll give him a chance.
Because I'm waiting to tell you.
The time for kindness and weakness is over.
Oh! Cousin Oh! Abdullah
You get a different Rashid.
And I don't need to remind you of the important educational quote.
You are a graduate of education and I am a graduate of education.
And we all know the saying,
The teacher gave birth to the first-grade class.
Mr. Rashid al-Qawi is obtaining it.
And if anyone errs,
There will be a problem.
He says, "When you come to speak, he just tells you to be quiet."
See what he says.
Who among you ordered me to be quiet and shut up? Who?
You're the one who told me to be quiet!
No, not me.
The one next to you, it's you!
Stop, go to the principal's office.
And his saying that Mr. Rashid scratched and expelled me.
I don't want to see your face here, hear me!
What do you think of my anger?
You can't just be like this on the first day, but you have to be like this all year round.
Beware of the consequences.
If I hear someone's voice
As I explain or speak.
Do you know what you've done?
It means tense, do you know what tense means?
Means tense.
Are you listening to what I'm saying or not?
I heard him, too.
Get out of the class.
The right of the viewer.
Pick up your things and leave now!
Pack your things.
It doesn't matter to me.
It's clear he's still looking for him.
No, Doctor, we didn't see it.
In general, ice cream made with milk, if it has strawberries inside, turns out to be very delicious.
Dear Abdulrahman.
Everyone makes mistakes and so does man.
I'm just joking, my son.
But the most important thing is that your father still doesn't know about it.
I don't want the chocolate in my bag.
Okay, where is your bag? Where is your bag? Where is your bag?
In class.
I'm at your disposal.
He says he's happy with you.
You can't tell the difference between a rich kid and a poor kid.
Bloody hell, how did the traffic light turn green or red?
Come here, where are you going?
The pigeons.
Are you still in the bathroom?
Knock on the door quickly and tell him that the first class started half an hour ago, quickly.
I was one juice and one chip before all of them.
I took her before all of them, I tormented them. My friend is Abdulrahman, and by the way, this is very healthy.
Okay, now go to Saud and get the PlayStation CD from him.
So what do we learn from this story then?
That man
He must have morals.
This is Sony, he told me to buy Sony once.
Okay, do you want something else, my friend Abdulrahman, my friend?
There's nothing now.
We learn for the story.
You all know I'm leaving this week because I got accepted into graduate school.
So I said, "I need to submit the event file before I travel."
How can I pick you up in the afternoon? Abdulrahman told me, but I don't know where he wants to go, but he didn't tell me when!
His father came back and didn't say anything to him. Thank God, you're guaranteed and at ease.
For example, I didn't take him this afternoon and he got upset and told his father, "No, no, no, this is a disaster, no, no."
Welcome, my friend Abdulrahman.
God help you.
What should we do? It's an order.
Do you like it? Do you like this?
Today, oh! Kids, we're going to have a new lesson in science.
Peace be upon you.
Thank you.
My father is a doctor.
What did you ask for? You didn't ask for anything. I'm present.
Oh professor, professor. How do you ask for water from the professor?
In which teacher does May answer for a student, are you his tea boy? This matter will not go unnoticed, I will write it in the report.
And you're still making fun of me.
Don't raise your voice or shout at me. Did you hear me or not?
Is this enough for you?
Fine, how many cars is this?
Four to five cars.
Excellent, this is excellent, sweet, excellent.
What's he doing?
As you can see, they're making a parking lot in front of our houses at the expense of our comfort.
Don't remind me of the days of Abu Nasser.
Abu Nasser is done.
Baraa is studying.
Zayn broke the table.
Don't worry, brother.
Why?
Are you different? (Idiomatic expression)
Change your attitude towards me.
Me or you?
We didn't say anything, oh Willie, my brother.
What is this?
Listen, leave everything where it is. That's better for you.
I'm not threatening you, brother.
What do you mean it's not necessary and I want to make things easier for you?
What are you saying?
Compensate for, what do they call it?
As if you wanted to
You'll like this to your taste.
Faster, faster.
Fine?
It's not up to him, this is unfair.
He is the boss of the neighborhood.
We're coming to Uncle Naif to talk, not to shout.
Who is this Rashid who does what he wants in the neighborhood?
Did you give me a chance to speak?
Okay, guys, quiet down. Let's listen to Uncle Abu Naif. What's he doing?
Now this good-for-nothing hay is playing with your nerves!
Leave it to me.
If I hadn't slapped him in the face, he would have stuck to the sunshade he made.
The game is played by its players (a proverb).
Is this appropriate?
Bye bye.
You've seen nothing yet.
You know he has a gold shop now!
And this is what I see here, they're wearing all these bracelets and necklaces.
May God compensate us.
Just walk, aren't you hot?
I can't believe that Rashid, the poor, unfortunate one, has become like this.
He became the vice president of the Global Center for Education.
Let him tell you, let him teach you. You are a teacher and he is a teacher, but look where he is now and where you are now.
Don't mention it.
Don't mention it! Oh, Abdullah.
"What's the secret?"
Doctor, doctor.
Teacher, I didn't do anything!
Professor, don't you know who he is?
Oh, the expensive one, I know who it is.
Here I'm telling you, we're not going to get a chance as good as this one.
I'm looking for a job! This is a joke, by the way, this is a joke.
No, my brother, the job is in my pocket.
Thank you for everything you've done, thank you, thank you.
Give him my regards.
Your mother sends her regards and says may God protect you; I'll tell her you said hello.
Okay, goodbye dear, in the care of the Almighty.
What more do you want? Your brother is going to be a minister, but believe it, my child!
Oh! Mom, we're working, we're working at a high level.
But if you work with him, won't they say anything?
He gave it to you that easily.
This is perfect, right?
Okay! This is automatic, without a doubt.
I sacrifice myself for you. May God keep you for me and my children. My dream is for you to be mine and my children's forever.
Your dream before mine
He is building a tower between the Corniche towers.
Come on, what are you waiting for!
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Well done, Abu Saleh.
It seems your friend is upset.
That shows, oh! My brother.
Well done, Abu Saleh.
He swore that he stood up, took the mobile phone, and gave it to Abu Saleh.
Look, there's something behind this, and I'm a hundred percent sure that Abu Sultan is holding a grudge against him.
His relationship with Bou Saleh wasn't good.
No, Abu Sultan won't do that unless he intends to do something else.
Grandfather? To that extent?
Open the car door for him!
Finally, he works on opening the minister's car doors.
Oh! My lord, don't break my heart, don't break my heart.
For your information, all the stories we hear in cafes happen in the countryside.
I just can't believe what I'm hearing!
My heart stopped, my heart stopped.
Oh my daughter, I'm afraid the women will gossip about the topic, and you won't mention the dishwashing machine. It will spread rumors about me among the women, oh my daughter.
Say something, Sultan. I'm shocked, I'm falling.
Good, I know what I'm doing.
What concerns you
Manira, I'm working on a low flame.
Opening the door for him is the first step of the plan in my head.
I'm the one who deserves to be the minister, not him.
Let me work, I have a plane to catch.
To make him quit his job.
Yes, plan.
He needs to trust me first.
They told me they appointed him as a minister because he was appointed two months before me.
Because I'm quite sure he's going to get fired from his job.
Magic can be undone.
What is it?
And what's this now?
And at every event he attends, the photographer will take many pictures of him until his image becomes very well-known in the newspapers.
And their houses were raised above the ground.
Huh? Are you sure?
Just stay like that. Let me work against him and you'll see.
On the contrary, Your Honor,
Of course, Your Excellency.
Tell me
Did you thank him for the lamb? By the way, the meat was very delicious.
The men are outside, go see them.
Don't be a fool. People want to give you prestige, and you want to humiliate yourself.
Only the minister, please, come in.
No, no, no, don't take my picture. But Your Excellency, just one photo of you.
And take one more.
Oh! Brother, I really liked your plan.
I want you to take it to him.
Picture, picture, picture.
He is a minister, he has plenty.
Alright, I'll tell you, wait!
Go to the second-to-last page.
Look how big his picture is with the groom.
Say, "He is Allah, [who is] One!"
Yeah, he has one or two pictures every day.
As you say, he is a social activist, okay, okay, bye-bye.
Everyone loves you, but I don't know what's wrong with you.
He is everywhere (expression).
They envy, they envy you. Only the fruit is thrown.
Take me to the market!
Is it working?
Peace be upon you.
Hello and peace be upon you, hello.
You're very famous.
Yes, your name is Abdulaziz Abdullah, right?
This is Riley.
How many times have I told you?
Three and fifty.
As for this famous person's right,
Are you at home today? Is something wrong?
Leave me alone, I have a headache today, my head hurts, I feel pain all over my body, and my colon is acting up.
I'm tired, so tired. I've been running around with him for a month now.
Let me rest today.
Hello, Sultan's mother.
Can I say something?
Oh, lady, I just want him to take me.
You started to love.
You saw for yourself what fame does.
I know, praise be to God that you're convinced.
For honesty's sake,
Your minister seems to be worried; he appears to like this villager.
I'll send my brother Saad.
No, I didn't follow any activities and I didn't read the newspapers, I don't know.
We are at your service, goodbye.
If God wants an ant to disappear, He gives it wings.
Peace be upon you, gentlemen, do you have a conference here in the hotel tonight?
Wedding?
No, it's fine, we didn't do anything. You don't have any activities, like a birthday party or an engagement celebration?
I don't know, but you can check with the hotel behind us.
Oh, there's a hotel behind you, right?
Normal to leave you in the car and go into the hotel to ask?
Go, go, go and take your time. Go and ask, go.
God helps everyone.
This minister is keeping us up at night?
This means he didn't find any party, wedding, or any disaster to get himself into.
He visited fifteen thousand hotels and couldn't find anything. He's as unlucky as he looks.
Just shut up, okay.
I didn't find his birthday.
The soul might make it for the second half!
In every issue, there are a hundred pictures.
He who doesn't sleep doesn't get tired, oh my, oh brother.
Oh! Real, the newspaper manager says first I should prepare his picture and then I'll prepare the newspaper.
My kids are having a contest over a picture of your husband, the minister.
One asks the other how many pictures of the minister are in the newspaper.
The winner gets a prize.
It's not like that. You have to come to the cafe and listen to the comments every day about the picture in the newspaper. They never stop talking.
Oh my, death is very near.
As they say, if it's written for the butterfly to die, it will approach the light.
People leave you and greet him.
He became one of the most famous people in the country.
Don't mention him, who is he?
I lost my dignity.
God bless you and her.
She said, "We all got married except poor Amal. She's the only one of us who didn't get married."
This is my fate.
It's not my fate to get married.
And forget about marriage.
"According to Allah, this is sufficient."
Did you see those guys sitting over there?
Ah, what's wrong with them?
Do you see the person playing with their hair?
Is this a boy or a girl?
After my father died, I mean he was killed.
I saw him grow up, didn't I?
It's not good to leave everything to the maid.
Go and make tea.
I'm tired of talking to my mom so much, but she doesn't just have one maid, she has two of them.
You see, killing you a hundred times won't stop me from interfering. Khaloud is my son, not yours.
You only talk about marriage, maids, and Khulood.
Mom, this isn't good. Khaloud is with the maid 24 hours a day and doesn't want to see anyone.
Get out. I want to rest, I want to sleep. How?
Oh my goodness, Saud, your brother Khalid turned out to be a girl.
Wait a bit if I don't tell my dad about you.
Let me tell you something, what's wrong with Khadija?
Saoud says Khulood is wearing makeup and he's acting like girls. What's going on? What's going on?
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness, oh my goodness! Oh, Saud!
Khulood has makeup on her face! Just a little bit of makeup. A child saw a makeup palette and played with it.
I saw a small dot, barely visible.
He is kind, sweet, and gentle.
Draw a line through Saud.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
The last time I asked you, Saad, what you wanted to be when you grow up and you didn't tell me. Now tell me, when you grow up, what do you want to be?
And you, my beloved Kholodi, my beloved Saad, what do you want to become in the future?
This year we'll go to London just like last year.
Yes, call the trembler in Bahrain.
His words bring Susen, Khalood and their cheetahs.
Convey our regards to Samora.
I seek forgiveness from Allah.
Today, my father told me to choose.
Do you want me to build you the land that overlooks the sea or the land next to it?
I said I don't want to choose.
Oh my love, I can live with you anywhere.
Thank you, my love.
And you taught me how to fish?
Wow, oh! Amal, my father opened his eyes and told me I graduated from university.
It doesn't look like a men's perfume.
I don't know, but it smells really strange.
Oh my God, what's wrong with me?
"The talk has become like women."
I forgot you're a bot.
And maybe you speak to people the same way outside.
I can't believe it, oh Khalid.
Please get out of my room!
Oh, how I miss you, Khadija.
You let me down.
Come on, don't make me sad. I'll tell my mom.
This is my son, and I know him well.
Oh, my heart aches, oh Khadoud, my light, I wish all children had the kindness and sensitivity of Khadoud.
And when you see a smooth and calm person, you call him gay.
Shame on you, shame on you for saying such things about your brother.
"It's just that they're making a big deal out of nothing."
He's so cute when he wears a really nice perfume. What's the difference between men's perfume and women's perfume?
Here I tell you not to say such things in front of your father.
I have.
I'll explain it to you, but calm down so Mohammed doesn't notice anything.
How did these girls get together?
Shame on a girl this beautiful to do such a thing!
Don't look at it, don't look at it!
I'm afraid he felt there was something that concerned him.
Cheer up.
I know you're following the Bluetooth trend these days.
I'm waiting for Saad, let him come.
How are you, Saad?
God protect you.
We were waiting for you, we didn't play cards.
Yes, why?
Would you like something to drink?
I've seen him lying here in your room for two days!
Because of the Bluetooth incident.
Yes, his older brother threatened him.
Hope is afraid of him.
Don't try. I told you, don't try.
"I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan, O my son."
I've booked it already.
I'm going far away. How can I face people? I can't!
What should I tell your father?
Say anything.
Oh, these kids only bring trouble. Oh.
This is the end, mother.
I remember when Khadija was little.
Of course, this will be the result.
Alright, please leave.
The truth always hurts.
The neighbor's window broke.
It's impossible for me to live in Doha.
I can't face people.
My phone was off for a while.
And what are you upset about, Amal?
You're a girl and you spend your whole day at home.
I say I'm a real person, out all day meeting people.
It's difficult, Amal.
I can't live my day and my life with my head always down.
My father has been feeling that something is wrong in the house and that there has been a change.
How long has my father been absent from the events happening here at home?
Sometimes I blame my father and sometimes I don't.
I don't blame him.
And I blame him.
The day he leaves home, the responsibility of the children falls on the mother.
We don't want to bring up past issues right now.
Does my father know about it or not?
But I want
Turn on his Bluetooth.
But I won't give it to him.
I don't want to see the shock in my father's eyes.
I'm going to be crushed.
Hello, Amal
He knows how to carry us.
It's much better to know from a second person.
Alas, our houses have reached that extent.
Because a dirty bomb called eternity exploded in her.
And the customs and traditions.
Meet them with impudence.
They stop their ears from it.
And they don't want to hear it.
They only hear one voice.
Which is dirtiness and strangeness.
They trample on all good.
What's on your mind?
You suddenly decided to study abroad.
All we can say is, "May God help you, my son."
God help you.
Those who return are the ones who bring the gift, not those who travel.
You're right.
This is a rule.
But every rule has exceptions.
Come with me quickly, Amal.
Did you see him, Yuba?
I don't hear anything.
Abu Saad!
Abu Saad.
Abu Saad, what's wrong with you?
Dad, what's wrong with you, dad?
Hey!
Don't be sad.
You are a great human being.
He really wants to marry you.
I didn't divorce you because of a fault in you.
I divorced you.
Because it's impossible.
I accept my cousin to be
Like you, brotherhood.
"For the righteous,"
You're here every day.
Before your time.
I was hiding underground.
This was before we were underground.
This is very strong language. Can you handle it?
You make a thousand and two hundred, that's a lot of money!
What Allah wills, happens.
Go, go.
You've only been here for seven months, stop humiliating me and take me home.
Embarrassment and scandal! Every time I go somewhere, the driver asks them how much they give you? I'm not satisfied with it, and today he asked for a raise.
This driver is making fun of you.
Oh people of Qatar, I need your help! I'm looking for a traditional house in Al-Shamal or Al-Khor, clean and within 100,000 riyals.
Yuba bothers me, he bothers me.
Return it so we can get rid of it.
Return it or replace it!
Tell your son he doesn't know what's behind this word! He doesn't know how much it costs in time and money.
And driving lessons. Return it and get rid of it.
The first time I came here to my house was six months ago.
Okay, I'll tell you something new.
Gas is now $1.14, before it was 50 cents to a real, maybe five riyals. Everything is getting more expensive, Your Highness.
Open your mind and listen to me carefully!
When I first came, what salary did I give you?
You gave me seven hundred.
Still new, very new. You've only been here for six months and you're already asking for a raise?
He refused the money.
The drivers you're talking about are old, very old, you're new.
Seven hundred is now eight hundred.
Go!
He said, "I'll give it to you, but for an extra 100 riyals."
And there's no use with three hundred.
Is what I told you correct?
No, no, Shashi, I'll get into trouble if I run away.
No, I'm afraid to.
Those who run away from their sponsors.
Why are you afraid?
Because before, the one who was responsible for these people...
I pay them six hundred to seven hundred in salary. Do you know how much they make?
How much do you earn?
Why are you afraid, kid?
I'm not afraid.
May God protect him.
I sat Nasser down and told him to go see it.
There was a limit.
He even stole the phone she bought for him.
What did you do?
What have I done!
They did everything they could, took his passport, and put it with theirs.
You can go! Oh, sir, you are excused.
We're looking for him everywhere.
This is the problem, this is the problem.
And after all this, they escape.
They got us into trouble and hurt us.
I told you to return it.
But you expect me to leave him.
I see him, whoever he may be.
Returning means he returns.
For me, I'd rather pay for his ticket and send him back than let him stay here and make money.
I'm fed up with him, I wish I could find him.
Men, go inside now, no one is buying now.
At the beginning of the game, you looked a bit nervous, I noticed.
But what are we afraid of? We were afraid that our team wouldn't score any goals.
We want more than three. We want ten, twelve, fifteen.
You made me feel before the match that you were scared; you were afraid of the team you were up against.
I'm not afraid of the opposing team, I'm afraid of our team. I'm afraid they won't score more than three.
This is our team's level, I know it. I'm talking about our team's level.
This is a lot of trust from you.
The team against us has nothing.
Awesome! The foxes just scored, you're up by one goal.
Where are you going?
I'm going home.
Do you have a car?
Come with me, I'll take you there.
Thanks, man.
Why are you even trying? You can't beat our team!
The joy of the match has just begun and the league has just started.
Did you hear what he said?
He said, "There's a big problem with that."
Mahmoud, bring the tea!
Now my friend is coming to pick me up for the stadium, quickly.
Take it, oh! My friend, Sajid.
Take it, sir.
What has he done to himself?
Ah, it's the Indian rupee.
Yeah, oh! Real, he's crazy about the ball.
Don't say that about my team, Leicester City Foxes.
These will win, these will win.
Come on oh! Sajeed, come on oh! Sajeed come, come the match is starting come on. Bring a bottle of water, the foxes are playing today.
Our dear scene is one of the most famous fans of the Foxes Club, and his name is Tha'loob.
They say you beat them because they were missing players.
What they say, what they say is not true.
What's not complete? Every team has a dozen players.
Whether it's one or two, it doesn't make a difference.
This fox is very clever.
This is the best fan we have.
Okay, on the occasion of Oh Fox's win, a final word you'd like to say to the foxes.
All talk is cheap.
The day they say the name of foxes.
His name is high in the sky.
This is the good fan.
Listen to me, brother.
You can find him just as enthusiastic.
Come on, Salam Waseem.
Where is the Indian who supports football?
Where have you been?
Oh! Real is a big star now, he doesn't come here.
I saw the man a few days ago and didn't recognize him. He was sitting in a cafe in Villaggio, I think it was called Starbucks or something similar.
I remember this boy, he used to sit with us at the café and didn't have money for a cup of tea.
He gave the boy twenty riyals as a tip in front of me.
What made him come?
Oh, [Real] sits with important executives in the club, helping him and doing everything he wants.
Can I say something fox-like?
Yes, Uncle.
My uncle says: Whether you go or come,
I don't know why you support such a bad and weak club.
These foxes are my team; they are in my heart.
The day I opened my heart
You can catch several rabbits in it.
I haven't heard the poem, Your Highness, that he wrote about governance.
The day we had a match with them.
Please, please oh! Fox, read, read my boy, read, read.
Oh uncle, oh God, who knows my secret?
My heart hurts a lot.
I never sleep at night.
You know we're the Foxes fan club.
Can you tell me the winner's name so I can have a scoop?
We will have a press conference, and God willing, we will announce the winner's name.
Who spends.
This is the famous Thaalib, the fan who was honored today by the Fox Club management in a very generous, rare, and amazing gesture.
Really!
Congratulations, Dhib, on this beautiful honor and this wonderful gift, of course.
What do you think, a pen or a watch?
This is him, Dad, I swear.
This is a move.
You see, this is
We need to tell the police.
Don't go anywhere!
All the masses, all the masses, all the masses.
No, no, no. Oh, my son, this isn't it. This resembles it.
I'm telling you this is not it.
I'm late.
I don't know the match times, oh brother.
Now how are we going to catch him?
We just need to wait until the Foxes play their next match.
There it is, there it is, I've seen it.
Okay, let's follow him.
Oh! Brother, you're very late.
This is it, this is it, this is it, this is it.
Follow him, follow him, follow him, follow him, follow him.
The problem is that we're not sure if this is it or not.
I'm telling you, oh! Dad, this is it.
I say the truth and wisdom that we go to them and ask them to tell us: Where did the driver you have come from? How did he come to you? When did he come to you?
You always complicate things.
We're reporting him, I'm sure of it.
The earth, God bless you. Yes, it is mine.
Yes, it's registered in my name, yes.
Also the other land that is adjacent to it.
Tell your father that Abu Abd al-Rahman al-Sabi'i sends his regards, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye.
No, no, God bless you. I think we're mistaken. Oh! A boy. We came for a friend and we thought you were him.
God balances things by making the number of people who resemble each other in God's eyes equal.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, my dear, thank you.
No, no, God bless you. Sorry, sorry, and thank you, thank you.
Excuse me. I'm here to help you. Goodbye. May God bless you. Goodbye.
And you say you're sure!
I don't know what your father will do! I'm very scared.
What did you do, Walid?
When, when, when, I, I was walking, the bag in his hand, I asked for it.
And try to sort things out now!
Go to your room now.
I hope nothing bad happens.
I hope nothing bad happens.
Now, try to make your father understand this!
Before my father finds out?
Break into a million pieces.
Okay, Mama, let's buy something like it as soon as possible.
Before my father comes.
"And to God, Mama"
You know when your dad gets angry, he starts to rant.
Go to your room and don't come out.
He did nothing.
By mistake, he supported the vase with his hand and it fell and broke.
Mom, I'm afraid for him.
I don't know where it is.
No, no, no, no, his father is crazy.
Why are you doing this to the boy, girl?
Scaring and terrifying him, do you want the boy to go crazy?
My daughter, can I say something?
Where do you think the boy went?
Okay, so I'll call you.
I hope nothing bad happens.
Auntie, I know where Walid is.
Come with me, and I'll show you where it is.
Oh God. Oh Lord.
This is it.
Please, don't make me go home.
I'm rough on you.
I didn't see the vase.
I really don't know.
This is your father's way, may God guide him, to scare you.
Come on, my son.
Oh my son, don't be afraid. As long as I'm in the house, don't worry, my son.
I have the solution.
We didn't say anything, Abu Waleed.
Please, I beg you, Abu Waleed.
This time, I'll forgive you.
What did you find in the house?
Where is he? Where did he go?
Where is he? Where?
Alright, my son. Oh! Waleed, your father won't do anything for you.
Are you sure, Dad?
Oh! Boy, yeah.
Are you leaving it here? I'm afraid one of the kids will knock it over and break it.
He asked me and said, "I want you to get me one like the one you got, and the one that Waleed broke."
He wants the exact same thing. I went and couldn't find anything but this, the last one in the shop. He's so lucky. Where are the kids?
In the room, I study.
Okay, take care of him.
Okay, just this game and I'll stop.
Oh, wow!
Okay, then study!
Just play this game and then we'll study.
Please, don't tell my uncle.
Dad, don't tell my brother, dad, this is the last time, I swear.
In a word.
And you, in particular, insulted me, your friend, at the café?
I'll see if I can tell my brother about you!
Okay, I won't call. This phone is in my pocket if you need to study.
Why don't you take him to the doctor, my daughter?
God guide you, mother.
He terrifies him to death because he beats him all the time.
Poor kid.
Wait.
Mom, where's Amoula? I didn't see her with you today.
She goes with her.
My sister doesn't accept wearing abayas.
Oh oh! My daughter, I didn't tell you the story of Manira and her son Naif.
She gave birth to a baby boy. May God protect him.
And the same height.
She was saying yesterday that she didn't know what to do with her son.
She wants to take him to the hospital, but her husband, Youssef, is against it.
I found out about the matter yesterday.
He fought with her and was shouting at her.
Why didn't you tell me?
This is a psychological condition.
And this is against the boy's will.
He needs to take his son and chain him in the middle of the street.
And then he tells him to do it again and pee in your bed.
Equal, equal, there's nothing.
What did you say? Oh, Mother Munira?
I was telling her "Eat, eat."
"Enjoy your meal."
Oh my goodness.
Mom, Mom
May your father not know about you.
Or I'll beat you to death.
Come on, go to the bathroom and take a bath before your father wakes up and makes a big deal out of it.
I won't listen to you.
Poor thing.
They shout and tremble.
I'm afraid something bad will happen to my kids.
I have to take them to their uncle so he can raise them.
I'm nervous.
They didn't fail, they succeeded.
Why are you taking them to their uncle?
Nasir got forty-eight out of fifty.
Why don't they get fifty out of fifty?
Their uncle was their alarm clock.
To be honest, I agree with his point of view.
Forget the emotions.
And my brother must punish them.
Okay, I'll take it, I'll take it.
This is the last time, this is the last time.
Fifty out of fifty.
We waste our time, and I assure them he is our son.
Why don't you get fifty out of fifty?
Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet. I've warned you, but you don't listen to me.
You're not listening to what I'm saying.
You shameless person!
Hit him once and let me punish him.
Ouch! That's enough, man.
So that next time you review very well, review!
Okay, enough.
Do you know what I'm going to do?
I'll make you jump on each other and turn into falafel.
Be careful going to public places with your families.
He's causing us a misunderstanding.
Teacher, Waleed is shouting.
Why are you shouting?
This is an excellent sign.
Strange that you're crying.
You should be happy.
Oh! Yuba, everyone has left, and even the buses are gone. You're waiting for someone to pass by and pick you up.
At the school entrance, he is waiting for the bus. The bus has arrived and the children are getting off.
Did you hear about the boy who committed suicide today?
They gave him his certificate.
His father threatened him if he didn't get full marks.
Walid, Walid, come back, come back, Walid, come back.
Hello and welcome, Live, to our new episode of the program "Without Borders."
Oil accounts for more than thirty-five percent of the total and various sources of energy.
While the rest goes to natural gas, coal, and hydroelectric power.
Therefore, oil is considered the primary source of energy in the world.
The Gulf countries and Iran alone have 867 billion barrels.
Followed by Iran with twelve percent, then Iraq with ten percent, then Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates with nine percent.
Then each of them comes to Venezuela with seven percent.
Then Russia by five percent.
The Gulf countries and Iran account for two-thirds of the world's reserves.
Unprecedented prices surpassing one hundred and nine dollars for the first time in history.
In this episode, we try to understand many of the complexities surrounding oil.
And the difficulties faced by oil-exporting countries.
Despite its sky-high prices
Also the problems faced by citizens and residents in these countries.
Due to inflation and unprecedented rise.
which will appear on the screen shortly, or they can write to us via our website "www.aljazeera.net"
Because today the market is the main factor.
And not the producing countries.
The day that determines the price is the strength of the market.
No more OPEC
Of course, supply and demand plays a role, of course.
But other factors are
Other factors are political tensions.
In the world
Real estate markets
And stock markets and others.
And they moved on to prices in speculation.
"Commodities" like oil, for example
And tomorrow I'll receive one thousand dollars, and only God knows.
Oil in 2004 jumped from $44.
And today we see it even in gas prices.
Varies from day to day
Oil prices fell below $90.
And increased in the second quarter.
Especially with the arrival of spring and secondly because most of the world's filters are under maintenance.
"Always, for the second quarter."
Seasonal demand for oil is declining.
In winter, it drops below ninety.
And all this indicates that speculation has power and control over the market now.
Things have changed a lot since we used to go to the traditional market in the past.
The market was influenced by supply and demand.
Seasonal supply and demand
Today, we see that economic growth
Today or yesterday, General Fallon, the commander of the Central Region in Afghanistan and Iraq, resigned.
His resignation sparked strong reactions due to its connection to the so-called impending American war.
Political or Geopolitical Effects
It could immediately impact the oil market, either negatively or positively.
The impact is certain and will have its effect.
Even speculators also react to political effects.
Those who can confirm, they say, some will tell you that America's war on Iran is coming.
What's happening here in the market? The market is going to be optimistic in a way.
This question, Mr. Deputy, is now in the light of what the White House has stated.
And this returned the region to an atmosphere of tension.
This foggy weather
But maybe Fallon saw this scenario.
He has a quick reflex on the oil market.
Today, we have the numbers to prove that there is no shortage.
Let me give you an example: in the past seven weeks.
In the United States of America, their oil reserves have increased by more than one-fifth over the past five years.
Today, I mean... I guess I should say...
Not even the next war, because today I tell you that even the world has profitable storage.
Even today's global consumption, you can choose any country and find long queues at gas stations.
This is something else.
What are the risks caused by this issue?
What number do you think it will be? I don't know.
Two hundred or maybe three hundred dollars, maybe less.
These tensions might escalate if they turn into real conflicts.
As you said, the Gulf represents sixty percent.
In a country far even from oil-producing nations.
You notice how the influence comes back on the oil market.
And it might reach three hundred dollars.
And they moved from stocks and other markets to the oil market. Today, you will see more than two trillion dollars.
Today we see printing.
Speculation that involves more than a hundred transactions a day.
That these tensions in the region and the anticipation
April, as they said before, will be the month to end this war.
God knows, I didn't do anything... I mean... what did I do?
In the area because now.
This is an election year.
The current American administration has only a few months left.
George H.W. Bush launched a war on Somalia and sent thirty thousand Canadians in his final days in the White House.
We see but do not expect events.
But I don't expect this scenario to happen.
Because this scenario is too expensive.
America doesn't pay anything, you and Iran and the consumer countries pay.
America Today
Now it relies on African oil and has many other alternatives.
See, there's nothing, let's talk clearly.
In your introduction, you stated that sixty percent...
Oil reserves
But now they release twenty-two.
I get oil from West Africa.
I'm from West Africa and anything they export from any other region in the world.
Oil production
Because this is a difficult number and fixed precautions and precautions
And what is called deep water production or sea water from the depths of the vast oceans.
Thus, the Gulf will remain a tough number.
Caspian Sea oil
And I consider them dreams because they are neither reality nor truth.
They ruin and destroy it.
The important meaning is that there is.
Today, Qatar is the world's largest energy exporter.
Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is why these countries are considered a force to be reckoned with.
and the energy needs of countries
This means there's definitely something called a "secret subsidy."
And despite internal objections within the United States, even at the level of General Fallon
But there are still some concerns.
"President Bush is going to do it."
Try to notice that political risks do not come from the Gulf countries.
It means no, no, no, not because of generosity, because none of us deal with generosity.
No dealing with too much generosity.
Not "in the current domain"
We're not part of a charity.
Or generosity
But he is generous to Westerners, not to anyone else.
With America precisely.
Where is the market?
Wherever we find economic return, we go.
We won't do it.
Like oil and gas
You're doing it out of kindness.
I have the proof.
I have the proof.
No more than sixty to seventy dollars.
It's the rise in prices.
But the decline of the US dollar that you insist on
You are in first place as Gulf countries and OPEC members.
That exports must be in dollars and you are refusing.
He changes the currency even though the currency has collapsed.
Even if the return is not in your favor.
No, what I said was 70 is necessary.
It's the experts' talk, not mine.
Okay, the dollar dropped thirty percent and oil rose more than that percentage which fell.
"So if we take the base year as 2004"
We see oil prices ranging between thirty-five and thirty-six dollars.
Of course, it means...
That the price of oil has increased.
But it's a minor increase, Madam Representative.
It means, if we take it.
We consider him now.
Even at these prices
I mean if we compare it to two thousand and four.
Until the rate of decline of the US dollar exceeded
Enthusiasm
React to the dollar's depreciation.
Whenever the price of the dollar falls, oil prices rise.
This is what the market has started to give him a sense of.
Our concern now is to reduce.
No, the situation hasn't changed. At the beginning of the reduction, they used to say this hill is too steep, but the situation has changed now and it's possible.
And the dollar began to lose value against other major currencies like the euro and the pound sterling.
The question is, why do you peg your currency to the dollar?
Weak currency with no backing.
This is a historic age.
Gasoline and its derivatives are priced in dollars, even for European production in the North Sea, Russia, and Norway.
Stating that America in the mid-seventies
Abolishing the gold standard that was once attached to the US dollar.
This is not true.
Okay, then tell me what's correct.
OPEC comprises
Four Gulf states
Qatar, Kuwait, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia
Today, OPEC's share of the global market
Forty percent
Today, if we say that the world consumes eighty-five million barrels
The countries that price oil in dollars
If you set a price in another currency, everyone will understand.
You can't.
All oil-producing countries need to agree.
You, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf countries, oh clever one.
Those who own 66% of the world's reserves are the big ones.
But I consider it an export.
Including Venezuela, Libya, and Iran
Cameron, Angola, and all those countries organized under OPEC.
Her share in the market does not exceed forty percent.
It was produced and exported outside OPEC.
This is what is linked to forty percent.
No one can judge his own soul.
Some countries have tried.
Untrue attempt
It's you who refuses because of American commitments.
From dollar to another currency
All oil-producing countries
Before, only one barrel was produced.
It's a pity they don't import it.
His salary became very high.
And sells its oil in dollars.
In his entry or reception, take his money in dollars and then convert it to the local currency.
His salary is not linked to the dollar.
True, but he...
But that's your problem. You sell in dollars, but if your currency isn't pegged to the dollar, then you don't have a problem.
My main question now is
What are the concerns and implications of pegging your currency to the dollar amid the dollar's decline?
Years ago
Especially in the 1970s, the dollar was a very strong currency and had immense power.
You see, this disengagement is not that easy.
Divorce is easy.
No, they are not here.
Divorce has its costs.
Who works for the benefit of these countries and not against them.
Profit and loss
Dow Jones announced yesterday that it includes 4 countries, including Qatar.
But there is also a report by Global Finance stating that there are four Gulf countries, of course, because Oman abandoned the unified Gulf currency.
I read a statement in the Dow Jones, and I don't think it's a genuine statement.
The Governor of the Qatar Central Bank has been dismissed.
He said yes, and that there will be studies, but also all the Gulf countries must.
Profit and loss must be studied very carefully, free from emotions.
Leave the matter for investigation until they come.
I can get you other economists who can do another study.
What contradicts this study?
Global House once said something simple and neat, issued in a report on March 8th.
Just four days ago
The Global House ID: the simple solution that requires a non-political decision.
The political decision can be summarized in two things.
Not three, first of all.
Regarding its intention or the five with Kuwait, regarding its intention in two thousand and ten to issue currency or study the issuance of a unified Gulf currency
The second point is to issue a decision to delink from the dollar.
Firstly, regarding the single currency.
From my personal point of view
So we can see the unified Gulf currency.
This action will be strong.
Will be
It can be one of the strong currencies in the world as you said.
What will come from the reserves and the huge revenues?
That's why the Prime Minister focused on this when he spoke.
Gulf countries because no single country can do it alone.
Unless it has a strong economic content
And today, we see economic growth even up to the euro.
Of course, you must not forget that the central bank plays a major role.
In the evaluation
And calculate the profit and loss.
From all these news
Tense situation
2008, as predicted by observers, the World Bank said this inflation will continue.
For a long time in the Gulf countries, but the solution is in the hands of the governments.
Some countries have raised salaries by seventy percent, such as the UAE.
To stop the inflation process that
And this is my question now: When will you raise the salaries of these poor people?
I'll hear your answer after a short commercial break.
Today's episode: Oil reserves and daily production of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries: Saudi Arabia
He has 64 billion in reserves.
And two out of ten barrels.
Nine out of ten produce daily.
One million, Kuwait produces one hundred and one and a half, and produces one billion and produces two and seven tenths of a million.
Qatar has a population of fifteen and a half billion and produces eight hundred and fifty thousand barrels of oil. Oman has a population of five and a half billion and produces seven hundred and seven thousand barrels.
125 million Bahraini dinars and production of 35,000
The total revenue for the year was 38 billion.
From 2003 to 2007
Europe is one hundred billion.
Sixty billion in the Middle East and forty billion.
In Asia and other countries
While the gross domestic product of the Gulf Cooperation Council states in 2017
The total is expected to be seven billion nine hundred ninety-seven million two hundred seven in 2007.
In 2009, there were 11.4 billion.
While continuous inflation continues to devour the salaries of employees and people working in this field.
But it will increase to three and eight-tenths in 2008.
Kuwait was only fourteen percent in 2008, but it's expected to be eight and nine tenths of the UAE.
At ten, while Saudi Arabia was six and a half and will reach six.
"And eight out of ten"
Salaries are steadily eroding.
What are the amounts and percentages that you will give to the poor here?
If we want to solve the problem
Actual solution
Always the salaries, always the increase in salaries.
It's not the solution.
I'm not against raising salaries.
This is not true, I this is not true.
We always
Of course, there is faith.
In the case of an increase, an increase without control over inflation will cause inflation to consume all these increases.
To solve inflation, a neutral committee comprising all experts and specialists should be formed.
And now this committee is developing
Because salary increases in the world
And of course, the golden rule of economics states
It won't have an end.
And whatever it is
Significant salary increases, but the difference is negligible.
Inflation is rising.
The solution is necessary and essential.
With a scientific study here at Bait.com, which specializes in recruitment, in cooperation with the British Yougov, a study was conducted.
Some 15,000 Moroccan employees work in the Gulf countries in 20 key sectors.
Especially experts and those with a career, there is no job satisfaction.
Because inflation here has started to devour.
Especially those with experience.
You're considering moving from these countries where inflation is eating away at you.
Now you will lose.
This simple concept, and you put the simple concept and try to apply it.
The solution to inflation is to increase salaries.
The balance is available.
He is there.
We are tense, the state is tense, and we are doing our best.
To solve this issue with a real solution.
Temporary solutions never solve the problem but rather exacerbate it.
Soon.
We wish we had more time until this committee is formed.
All requests
This is boredom, and you, O long-lived one.
Boredom will always be there.
True, but the state tried and covered it up with a 40% increase.
Here's an important point regarding the topic of increases.
In terms of promotions, you only want Qataris, as if non-Qataris work for Burkina Faso and Zimbabwe.
You consider Qataris, but you don't consider expatriates.
while the highest percentage in it
You are Ahmed, living in Qatar, not in Germany.
And everyone talks about it and suffers.
Much higher salaries than in the public sector.
On the contrary, we saw.
In the public sector
On the contrary, the public sector becomes
Because the best units and competencies seemed
I also read a report, and as you know, we are in an oil field.
Work
Follow our experts.
Engineers and workers who come from outside Qatar
Because we still interact with the global market.
What's the average salary increase for all these matters?
Hopes are with God Almighty, but we say...
The government has a plan.
And I say controlling inflation is most important.
It's a temporary solution.
"And we'll see, I'm sure."
"That bacon"
Positive results
You're at the edge of fifteen percent.
Okay, the second nice report tells you that twenty-two billion barrels of oil and forty-three billion cubic meters of gas are coming your way.
No comment, it's not a spray operation.
The procedure and of course we
But talking about economic growth must eventually reflect on people.
And contrary to any economic growth today, Qatar has the highest economic growth in the world.
And the opposite of that.
Also part of the "conspiracy" in the country.
And if it were not for these huge carriers and major projects.
In this country, it will also not be part of inflation.
It resulted in some inflation.
This then led to the existence of a wide market.
Firstly, regarding the link between the dollar and oil.
Oil for protection.
I am from the United States of America, and thus there is stability in power.
Thank you
Saad al-Ghamdi from Saudi Arabia, your question Saad.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Frankly, the ring is beautiful and the title is even better.
What I really want to talk about is that the region is now coming under American policies.
American policy in its current war, along with the cultural campaign it is waging against Islam, is part of a global economic war.
Now in China
The U.S. deficit with Japan also reached sixty-one billion dollars.
Japan originally invested in 2000.
With America, how much is nine?
Billions, and now it invests with the European Union at more than twenty-seven billion dollars.
To keep up with American politics and make the dollar an unavoidable currency for the whole world
"Brother, I'm telling you, buy now."
And the Gulf region will become.
As a place
Thank you, my brother Saad.
Mohamed El-Waseef from Egypt
Hello, Your Excellency, the deputy you have.
Oh Arab rulers in the Middle East, Your Excellency, you remind me of...
When there is
When there are calls for price adjustments.
Adjust the salaries according to prices as I said, Your Highness.
In Qatar, we considered you a prototype.
"And stick to not promising an increase. This is a purely Arabic style."
We want to consider Qatar as Abu Trika.
It's his right to say what he wants. Do you have a question? Of course, it's his right, he is responsible for this policy.
The question first.
Happiness must be taken into consideration.
This is another one who needs to respond to public opinion.
With the poor as I said, because they are the people of the countries that need special care.
Arab rulers who have no sense of empathy for the poor.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
Good evening to you, and good evening to you, Your Highness.
I want more.
Salaries are excellent and good. This is good.
Okay, thank you for the topic we need and suffer from.
I am with the poor and will always be, God willing, and we know that there are no poor people in Qatar and we are certain.
And it is ruled that Qatar, as he said, the money goes to the ruling family and to the ruler.
And this is the important question now.
Let's first answer the brothers.
We can't judge.
What happens to wealth?
Now there are new cities that have almost become like Pearl and Lusail and other places, meaning even Qatar is expanding.
This is not the case, the case is
Suitable urban plan
In short, because we still have two minutes, let's say what Qatar will do.
Qatar now, there's Qatar beyond oil and gas.
There is a clear policy of the state.
Because
Non-renewable resources
Because it is a non-renewable resource.
That's why today the orientation is in the State of Qatar.
The capital of the Middle East in education
Today we see the Education City.
Today, this educational city houses some of the best colleges in the world.
Building medical cities, media cities, and financial cities
Because today oil and gas
Of course not, we don't imitate anyone.
Remaining satellite channels
It's not just the island, you're going to make a hundred islands, and of course the island won't stand still.
Because these countries are our countries in the Gulf now.
In the 1970s, the boom that everyone now remembers was the 1970s boom.
Now let's see what Qatar has in terms of growth.
This calls for a special episode about Qatar in the post-oil era.
In our view of oil, its future and resources in the region, especially in Qatar. In conclusion, my regards to the program team.
I am Ahmed Mansoor, and I greet you without boundaries. Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Greetings from Doha, the capital of Qatar, this week.
And I welcome you to a new episode of our program "Without Borders"
At the same time, Qatar hosts the largest U.S. military base outside the United States, which is Al Udeid Air Base.
With the United States' enemies in the region
Like Iran and Syria
And its doors are open to leaders.
Indeed, Hamas leaders enjoy special relations with the Qatari leadership.
Like Emir of Qatar was the only Arab leader
Who visited the southern suburbs of Beirut, destroyed by Israel during the 2006 Lebanon War?
And there is still unlimited support for the reconstruction of what Israel has destroyed in Lebanon.
And at the time when Qatar reconciled
With its older sister, Saudi Arabia, about two years ago.
At the same time, clashes with the regime in Egypt.
Like the Lebanese file in which those who failed were successful.
To bring together the Lebanese factions in Doha, where they signed an agreement that led them to peace.
Final elections
Difficult files ahead.
The one who cared to be the driver of these files, not Qatar.
The smallest Arab country
In today's episode
We try to understand the basis and principles upon which Qatari foreign policy is founded.
And for whose benefit?
Qatar is the smallest country geographically and demographically, yet it plays these big roles.
And what are the qualifications that enable him to do that?
And who will be in direct dialogue with the Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister.
And for our dear viewers who would like to join us, they can call us through the program's numbers that will appear on the screen.
The visit made by the Emir of Qatar.
Al Jazeera's artillery roar to improve communications with Saudi Arabia
From the past like Saudi Arabia's attempt to control the Qatari government with the help of the Al Murra tribe.
In its edition published on June 20th last.
What is the nature of the confidential treatment?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Many things didn't happen.
What I believe is correct.
In many interviews here in this program, I always say that the important thing is that
And we consider it the backbone.
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
There was a misunderstanding.
Moreover,
A different perspective on things.
It's true that the border issue is over and it was a big obstacle.
The historical Saudi-Qatari relations were distinctive.
These links, if we notice them.
Between the two states and the two families.
It was ruined by misunderstanding.
Neither us nor them
Because there are no conditions between brothers.
And the matter is over, and now the relations are in a situation that I can confidently assert is excellent.
In the interest of the Cooperation Council
But how the situation between Qatar and Saudi Arabia was improving, and Qatar was the obstacle and the reason that led to 2002.
There's an important point.
And I repeat, if you go back to all the programs, I always said
Not only the elder sister, I was saying that our reliance in the Cooperation Council is on
Saudi Arabia is an important country in the region.
And we value our relationship with her.
There was media coverage, some of it was quite intense, and this was clear to both sides.
These countries are putting themselves in danger.
Failure occurred when the two brothers agreed.
Especially the Saudi-Qatar house.
They found themselves in conflict.
Wherever there are camels.
And I don't think it's a strategy of anyone in this conflict.
But please, Sheikh, allow me to put things in their proper context or to dot the i's.
Many observers see Al Jazeera as having undergone significant changes in the past two years.
At the time when cases were being criticized on Al Jazeera's screen
What's happening in Saudi Arabia.
Are the people who were arrested, or the opponents, or others, still standing?
The island has been dealing with these issues.
Even Al Jazeera's coverage of the Hajj has become politicized.
Praise for the system: What has the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques done during this different time?
First, you can ask the island management about this matter. Don't ask me because
What connects the two countries.
For the stability of the region
This strategy continued and reinforced the stability of the region.
The area you're referring to is the Gulf region.
Gulf Region
There are many cases around the Gulf region.
Also, the invitation of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques in Kuwait.
He had an impact on all listeners and the Arab world as a whole.
He spoke from the heart about resolving, surpassing, and burying Arab disputes.
Not just perspectives
He is not in politics, and politics are points of view.
In the Arab world, it is considered
A kind of war
While in the developed world
The tales of like minds.
Now you've been sitting for years.
The situation now
Listen first.
There's a difference between this topic and the other topic.
The idea of a small state defying the big ones and making them feel weak.
Any difference or misunderstanding
He had reasons.
And he finished his reasons.
The dispute was resolved through the wisdom of the leaders of the two countries.
Are there guarantees for the future relationship?
There are guarantees between two parties.
On love, brotherhood, and interests that unite the two countries.
And leaders, their words are considered more than a document.
Between Qatar and Saudi Arabia to develop this relationship.
And we hope for a lot of this Saudi-Qatari relationship to develop.
For the better and there will be more fields.
For this relationship, like the one we have with other Arab countries, other Gulf countries.
Because Qatar is an important country.
Okay, so Saudi Arabia is an important country.
What does Egypt want from Qatar? Because it's strange that at the same time you reconciled with Saudi Arabia.
And three organizations, which are Hezbollah.
It is Al Jazeera channel.
He is against the regime in Egypt, the largest Arab country.
First of all, let me start with this.
Egyptian people
And we respect the Egyptian people.
And her interest
on the many Arab issues and the sacrifices of the Egyptian nation
In this case
Would anyone believe that through this case we are trying to reach an understanding with the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt?
In light of your statement that you respect Egypt and Egyptians
We believe he is a good person.
Our difference with Egypt lies in two points.
Or a single point.
They accused us of planning to overthrow Gaza, but I don't think so.
And we do not interfere
In cases where other countries are following suit.
What believes in interfering in the affairs of any state unless there is room for reform.
Does that mean you intervened in the Hamas takeover of the Gaza Strip?
Of course, I don't deny that we didn't know about this as much as other people did from the media.
We have relations with Hamas and we have relations with others.
What made Egypt different or caused disagreement between you and it on this point?
Come here.
Hezbollah plot
Hezbollah and
But I'm talking about my country.
We were very surprised about this matter.
Shock in favor of Qatar
The pyramid said.
The pyramids spoke.
So they can attack Egypt and its position.
Can I reply?
Let's go back to the plot they mentioned.
Time will tell.
The beginning was not from the Gaza conference.
And I absolve the Egyptian people and President Hosni Mubarak of any responsibility for him.
If we go back a long way to the Mina Conference
After the Madrid conference, she remembers the harbor that was in Doha.
And this was an agreement, and since the conference was going to be held at our place
They said they didn't want to hold the conference.
"We know you're coordinating with Israel."
"Heading to Qatar and this is it"
What are we trying to understand why?
We sat and chatted, and conversations are always nice.
It has two parts.
And who are these?
There is a difference.
In political orientation
If we look at the Gaza conference that was held
His Royal Highness spoke with all the presidents, including his brother President Hosni Mubarak.
We received a foreign state.
The Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt has a viewpoint on the matter that it should not have been held.
And people are being killed while we watch.
If you want it to happen in Doha, we can make it happen anywhere in the Arab League.
It would be inappropriate to discuss the issue at the Kuwait conference while it's ongoing.
I'm from Israel and the Western world, standing and watching what happened.
The day we all said, "Now this is normal, and there is no power or strength except by Allah. As Arabs, we can't stop it. Not even a big country could stop this fighting."
Egypt's request for a ceasefire in Gaza was followed by an end to hostilities within an hour.
Even us
We should not take the Arab street so naively; our disagreement with the brothers is on one point.
This is in accordance with international standards.
And our hospitals are not enough, and doctors are being arrested at the borders.
You are the ones standing at the border.
It's there, and no one can enter.
Brotherhood, you didn't accept it well.
Because Gaza is next to Egypt and is considered part of national property.
When we talk about any human topic anywhere in the world, we're just talking about a human topic.
And we respect sovereignty in Egypt.
And we know her position, but this doesn't harm the Egyptian position.
And we wish a lot from Egypt.
Is the largest Arab country?
And we believe that he can convey our voices and the voices of others from the Arab world.
For all other parties
Even the rescue mission that followed Gaza
Those that the Europeans tried to save.
What happened in Gaza?
Whether it's a savings conference and so on, and I see it as a rescue for the government.
We were invited to a conference to coordinate among the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
We were gathered in the Cooperation Council.
These amounts will not be disbursed to any party.
But they will be released to
Those affected in Gaza
Directly and this was
Because it's off-limits from all sides.
I am happy for Egypt, and all the people in Qatar are happy for Egypt because Egypt...
Egypt's victory in political issues is very important to us.
But you just expect
Give me just two minutes.
There was a minister who boasted about what he was deprived of and said...
And anyone who harms Egypt, we will cut off his feet and break his hands.
Frankly, I believe this official has done his country a disservice.
On the contrary, they didn't fail, and they only talked about themselves.
And what helped them in this, and I said this to our brothers in Saudi Arabia, the Saudis intervened because the king has wisdom in this matter.
Let's settle matters in the Arab world.
We agreed.
That the king will decide that this is in the best interest.
We accepted King Abdullah's decision because we respect him and trust him.
But for someone to say that we stopped them is even an insult to those who did stop them.
They look like students in a school.
I think this is it.
The maximum has been reached.
He thinks he needs to assert his power.
We are sorry, we are sorry about this.
If you think a small state has no right, its rights are taken away.
And you intrude and bring your trouble into Darfur.
This is an Arab decision at the Arab League.
An African decision and a United Nations decision
I think the main problem is
Hezbollah's plot, along with Qatar.
My mother's plot in Qatar.
If it becomes possible after swine flu, if it appears somewhere, Qatar will be the cause behind the spread of this epidemic.
Qatar is a peaceful country that knows its size and capabilities.
But Qatar has a point of view.
Qatar has a secret policy.
If Qatar solves any Arab problem, we consider it an honor.
Because any Arab conflict
We think that any Arab disagreement could weaken our position regarding our main issues, which are Palestine and all the other challenges we are facing.
The Arab world has become a future.
Even our analysis became like theirs.
Western analysis
But there's a subject we know about; we know what happened in Pakistan.
In a way that I want someone to receive me and roll out the red carpet for me in Washington.
Is anyone blaming Qatar?
Did Qatar harm any Arab country?
I tried to contribute money.
These contributions are provocative.
I can see your game, just to say "peace be upon you" and you're greeting to raise my blood pressure.
This is a second case, which means you have a problem or you have a deficiency.
This matter doesn't concern me, it concerns you.
But if you have internal problems
We always say it.
Especially after the speech of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah.
In Kuwait, and I know this man is honest.
A man speaking frankly.
"I always tell her from the
I always say this.
I always say it, even at the height of our dispute with Saudi Arabia, I used to say it.
And you can refer to all the documents you have on the island.
The situation is different, no, no.
On one hand, we said no, there's no way, let's stop at this situation.
And we tried as much as we could.
I don't want to get into this topic.
So they can see their work and identify their mistakes.
And seeing our mistakes doesn't mean that everything we have is right.
Do you mean this, Your Highness Sheikh?
Because there are internal problems in Egypt.
They want to get out of it.
You deny that Qatar contributes in any way to the conspiracy against Egypt externally and tries to break its relations with Turkey and any other country.
As if we had superpowers.
They are seventy million, if we could make them,, eighty million.
They have a problem that still needs a solution.
That you played a role in the Shalit case despite knowing that this file is important to the Egyptian government.
And I worked with the French.
I received a call from a friendly nation.
There's a situation we need to deal with. We said, "Folks, this situation is about the Egyptians." They said...
Let's not see this issue as a request.
I'm from Israel and another country, and we want to see a second part, let's see this.
When we saw this, we told them that if the same conditions as the brothers in Egypt, they should speak out.
By stating this, it means that a responsible official can say that he deceived the Arab League.
This means he is a poor person.
How did she manage to get past us?
So they can make President Mahmoud Abbas stay.
And support us.
Does he address his people? Does he address us? Does he address the Arab world?
The problem is from you.
I think this is a healthy phenomenon.
I don't own Al Jazeera channel as they accused me of.
The island must enter the media competition, as there are many media professionals in the West.
There are many media institutions, and during their adolescence, they all curse each other.
But after a while, they reach maturity.
It might be or it might not be
Our situation with Saudi Arabia is different.
Even if we concede to Saudi Arabia, we won't accept this in Qatar.
Important relationships
And Egypt is an important country, but there is a special relationship with Saudi Arabia.
There's also a special relationship between Egypt and any other Arab country. Egypt is the largest Arab country.
True, but we have a history with Saudi Arabia and the relationship is different.
This is a personal dispute between some officials here and there.
We respect the Egyptian president.
I hope it is limited to differences in policies and viewpoints.
I told you about the problem when there was an attack on Gaza.
The second problem is that they have issues with us, and we still don't know what Qatar has done about it.
Why don't you try to arrange a meeting between the Egyptian president and the prince now?
Saudi Arabia intervened in this matter.
And as leaked to the newspapers, they initially said it was a secret meeting, but we found out about it the next morning.
If there was a meeting between me and Omar Suleiman
In Saudi Arabia
Torn beyond repair
And I can't tell you that we agree on everything.
Let's say it so no one misinterpret it: You're not comparing yourself to anyone.
But dignity is dignity, whether with young or old.
The minister said that if Egypt received the appropriate satisfaction.
Reda is between the children.
I don't think Egypt is that big; I think he didn't find the right expression.
Do you have a vision for how to solve the problems with Egypt, or are you like the Egyptian people waiting for divine intervention?
Please, I don't want to talk about divine intervention or anything like that because only God knows who will live and who will die.
And I claim
One deludes himself that there will be a way.
And our pride in Egypt
There has to be a specific way.
Either stand with me or stand against me.
Why does the Arab citizen feel pain?
In the Arab world, we suffer from it, and this is the policy of His Highness the Amir.
Nations derive their strength from sources of power.
The United States has resources that are sources of power, China has resources that are sources of power, France has resources that are sources of power, and a small country like Qatar has a source of power.
Our faith in God
What's clear is
You're trying.
But we're a small country, and I'm taking that into consideration.
And repeat it a hundred times.
So no one can say we have any kind of sensitivities.
That no one will take from us
As for Israel, now you've gone too far.
Okay, before I go to Israel.
How do you solve the problem with Egypt?
What's happening now?
And every day they lodge a complaint with America. If I could tell you the big countries you were talking about.
They deal with us based on their interests, and we do the same.
All complaints and all
To ruin the relationship.
I think any big country that does this will affect its image.
It will also affect our Arab pride if we run to complain to each other.
Everything is coming and we know everything.
Our solution is based on the interests of the Arabs.
And we're here for them if they need anything.
Are there further steps to repair the relationships?
But I know that there are good relations between the president and His Highness the Amir.
If anyone is playing under the table.
Opposing the interdependence of the two states and leaderships will find himself losing.
It can't be tomorrow, maybe after ten years. To be honest, I don't know, but from our side, if anyone invites us to a conference, we'll be there.
Anyone who invites us to a conference, we attend it, and if we have a point of view, we express it at the conference.
We can't
Since Egypt is the older sister, we have different perspectives and discuss things with each other.
This is all that's required, and whenever it comes, God willing, we'll be happy.
What was canceled because of this policy.
As I said, we respect the Egyptian people.
Of course you're asking about how many contracts were cancelled, ask about how many Egyptians came to Qatar at the same time.
But as a state policy, as I told you, the Egyptian people in Qatar are very close to our hearts.
Now, on the fourth of last June, the Arab world resonated when you closed the Israeli office published in Al-Adab on the fourth of June.
Why do you say we trolled them when we wanted to troll them, we would have shut it down 12 years ago.
Two days before the reconciliation with Israel and before there were secret meetings between Arab countries and Israel, everyone was campaigning.
And after most Arabs made peace
"With Israel, whether under the table or above the table, or talk to her in any way."
If we wanted to stir emotions, we could have done so at one of the previous Muslim conferences.
At the United Nations, Nasser's ally hosted a dinner for Israeli Ambassador Gabriela Shalev.
He was one of many guests who attended this banquet, and I don't know why the ambassador held it.
Because at the United Nations, we are sitting next to Israel, and no one can deny that.
Or we find a glimmer of hope to alleviate the suffering of our Palestinian brothers.
Now the management has changed, and I had a small space for the Egypt topic, but unfortunately...
What was I, was you.
My question is about the United States and the new administration and its impact on your relationship, as Qataris, with the United States, given the presence of the largest military base in Qatar.
There are differences in opinions.
Serious in solving many issues in the region.
Even if they're serious, we'll help them as much as we can.
We expect a special relationship or a resolution to the problems that existed between you and the Bush administration.
Many of these issues have been resolved.
The Emir of Qatar spoke yesterday in Paris about what is happening in Iran.
You have special relations with Iran, even though its relationship with America is poor.
First of all, we need to put it in the context of internal affairs because we must respect every country and its internal affairs.
Lebanon after the elections
Before the elections, Saad Hariri said in this program that the Doha Agreement ends with the establishment of elections.
Is this also your vision, or do you see that the agreement is still valid or will you have to come up with a new agreement?
The Doha agreement was for a phase that would lead them to hold peaceful elections.
A year and a half has passed since the Doha Agreement.
We were following it day by day, minute by minute, until they reached the elections according to the Doha agreement.
That we recently intervened in one of the electoral districts to correct some misconceptions that had arisen.
But you still have something to do with the arrangements in Lebanon.
We're always close to Lebanon. You know how Qataris love Lebanon and love to visit.
The first country I visited after a Western country was Lebanon.
Quick question and answer about what's happening in Yemen.
You interfered in the Hatin case, and there are accusations that you supported them.
Or it brings you face to face with the state, and now there is a greater danger, the danger of the South.
And we have suffered a lot, and this indicates why we stand here and not there in Qatar.
Indeed, we faced many pressures, but this was our vision and this was His Highness the Amir's stance.
The topic of the Houthis.
And its stability affects us positively, and instability affects us negatively.
We intervened as an honest broker between two parties.
We signed an agreement.
But I understand if this means it's used for other reasons.
And we'll be there with them, and we always stand by them in all circumstances.
And it's not based on a fact.
I don't see the point for us.
We sell it.
I say this with apologies, as I know there is a large Arab audience that disagrees with me.
Dear viewers, we also extend our gratitude for your kind attention, hoping that we have clarified some aspects of Qatar's foreign policy.
In conclusion, greetings from the program team, and this is Ahmed Mansour greeting you from Without Borders.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Dear viewers, peace be upon you and welcome to this special encounter.
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani is the Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State of Qatar.
Of course, why do I say it's a special and exceptional meeting? Because...
Qatar and this man were exactly the main sponsors.
Sir, just one simple and direct question.
I think it happened because there was an Arab consensus from the beginning.
And we tried this when we went to the United Nations.
The Arab consensus was important, and the Lebanese administration from both sides was important.
To reach some conclusions
It is very important that external intervention
Many opinions and suggestions from the outside.
Lebanese and international Arab, if you want to say.
He went through stages, but it meant something.
There's nothing that doesn't involve these stages.
Does that mean the complexities in Lebanon?
From the time of truth
So when you were gathered and you directly switched to the Lebanese line and the Lebanese file now.
You discovered that the Lebanese knot is huge.
The international regional Lebanese dialect that requires a large decode
It's a simple compound, but it has been amplified due to external interference.
Because we know that Lebanon is a beacon for journalism, a beacon for culture, a beacon for tourism, and a beacon for many other things.
Lebanese shouldn't be allowed.
To affect peace and stability in Lebanon
Problem number one
Are the spillover effects in Lebanon?
Suddenly you decided after twenty-four hours to take each one in a plane.
From the plane straight to meet the Emir of Qatar.
They wouldn't rest for a single minute unless you were kind enough to let them.
The secret is to not let them rest and think too much.
And made a lot of calls.
We suggest bringing them to Doha because we need the atmosphere.
Or you gather them with much difficulty.
In many circumstances
Let's get them out of these circumstances and into ones where they might find a solution.
If we want to succeed, we need to get them out of this mindset.
And quickly.
God made us succeed with the Venice Statement or the Beirut Statement.
And we succeeded because they agreed to go to Doha.
The parties decided to go to Doha.
Some thought that Qatar was more biased towards one party at the expense of the other.
And from Beirut only.
His Highness' policy if we are mediators
In this process
Okay, frankly.
Did I consult with honesty?
With at least the main parties concerned about what is happening here in Lebanon: the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Syria.
Especially the brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, I spoke with Prince Saud.
He expressed his support for the idea.
We benefited from Prince Saud that we...
Everyone needed a solution.
His justifications are weak.
If we rely on logic
His justifications are weak.
It should be removed because there is tension in Palestine.
There is the issue of the Iranian nuclear program.
The Arab League must have a mechanism to resolve issues.
Is the African Union better than us at resolving issues?
And try to bring the parties together.
We hold conferences to find solutions. Why can't Arabs with ancient ties manage to do so?
Either unite the Arabs or unite the parties, if there are any, or intervene to support the oppressed.
What needs to be under study
If we want to have an alarm bell for the Arab League, not the Arab world states.
The Arab League is just a tool for implementation.
There was a official present, namely the President Nabih Berri.
S-S requires
It seems the Lebanese have agreed now.
Listen carefully, we...
And above them, Qatar.
Nothing ever led to a result.
In the interest of the Arab world
It will be considered a strength for the Arabs.
We tried.
At the United Nations when we went to the Doha Agreement
And the agendas that have become for the solution, not for other reasons.
There is no doubt that
And the most important role in the entire Arab world.
So that we can put
Stop as agreed.
For the rest, they come to help us.
Because this is a serious matter.
Why have we reached a stage where everyone is playing in our courtyard?
In our yard.
It is extremely important to prioritize the interests of our people.
Now we need an Arab university after this agreement to see what we will do with our Palestinian brothers.
What are we going to do for Somalia?
What will we do for Somalia, which is not a member of the Arab League?
Sudan is not in the Arab League! Iraq is not in the Arab League! Why don't we try?
We are part of the Arab world and a small part.
I wish it were just a suggestion, not an idea.
Qatar has good relations with Syria and Saudi Arabia.
I think that first, if we're not asked to do something, we'll do what we can.
But I'm sure that His Majesty King Abdullah
King of Saudi Arabia
And the President's companion, Bashar
Because historically, Saudi Arabia and Syria had an agreement.
It might just be a phase.
And we will get it, God willing.
So far, however, I'm still insisting on asking if this is suitable for you, is it possible for you to take a role in this part?
Even if not in front of people, now you almost have confidence.
We strive for any rapprochement among Arab nations.
And this was His Highness the Amir's policy from the beginning, but this subject...
What happened in Lebanon, is this an indication that the region is on the brink of serious changes?
Or what happened in Lebanon is local and Lebanese matters for the region that are still ongoing.
Not related to this situation.
I wish it were the other way around. I wish this were true.
The beginning of a new phase in the Arab world.
We can innovate.
It happens somewhere else.
In other words, Your Highness, are you concerned about the escalation that was present during that period?
At least until the end of George Bush's presidency.
There's no doubt that I still have fears for Palestine, especially the issue of Gaza now.
I want to ask
We're not anything at all.
I request that I take care of the human aspect in Palestine.
We can't get them medicine.
And I didn't eat.
Electricity for the patient in the hospital.
What dies if the power is cut off?
I wish
The Arab League agrees on an amount for this food and medicine topic, we call it food and medicine.
We don't want the Red Crescent to reach him.
Let the Red Cross handle it.
But please excuse me, the Arab side is committed to this Israeli siege.
I don't want to go into details, but I'll say that as Arabs, we need to provide food and medicine, even if we disagree with Hamas.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has made a great effort and pledged in the Holy Kaaba.
Because this difference will only benefit the other party.
He says, "Don't engage with this party, as we will provide you with an incorrect solution."
And I
So far, I have no signs of a solution.
Do you fear an American-Iranian confrontation in the coming period, or do you expect it?
Of course, this is possible.
At least I'm talking about Qatar.
Iran is an important neighbor for us.
We might not agree with all of their policies, or they might not agree with our policies in Qatar.
For example, they tell us that we don't want you to have relations or contacts with Israel.
It can be considered part of you due to the American bases within it.
We know how to deal with this.
Some said that after the visit of the Emir of Qatar to Saudi Arabia,
I may be able to meet, consult, or speak with the Saudi host.
In Istanbul for negotiations between Syria and Israel.
And I can say it's a coincidence.
The second subject, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was keen to find a solution and I was in communication with His Royal Highness Prince Saud.
What happened in the last hours?
Change the tactic. Change negotiation tactics.
From you or other sources
We, as officials,
And from all sides, we locked the room on ourselves.
Finally, we found ourselves... and then His Highness's intervention was very important.
And from it comes the work of intervention.
Let's not mention it now.
And his message was clear when he said, "We know our size, our status, and our role," and so on.
We wish to play a role without provoking any third party.
If he is Arab, patriotic, or regional.
But still
I became responsible.
Were you showing this or not?
We're trying to prevent a little bit of jealousy because we're a country.
that these countries
Can do or not?
I think this will be the profitable mix.
Last question, your relationship with Washington, is it long-term, is it natural or special?
I can say that our relationship with Washington is good.
It means we don't have different viewpoints on issues.
But this is our right if they talk about democracy, this is democracy.
How good. How can you interpret it in real life?
If we're talking about the economy, it's excellent. If we're talking about education, it's excellent.
Also health, but if we're talking about politics, I can say he's good.
What's your opinion and elaborate on it in the next stage?
In my opinion, let's set aside confronting Israel for now.
Even if we wanted to stop playing soccer in the Arab world.
And repair the enmity between the Palestinians.
We agree on one opinion so that we are a respectable force.
I don't think we have any.
Be effective.
Thank you, our dear viewers, for watching. Until we meet again, I commit you to God's care. Peace be upon you, and God's mercy and blessings.
Welcome, dear viewers, to this dialogue with the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani.
In this dialogue
We try to explore the political reality of the Arabs and their efforts.
May God bless you, His Highness the Sheikh.
To investigate what is happening in Gaza.
And I hope through this dialogue that we can
We shed light on some of your questions.
The brutal Israeli incursion into Gaza
Our goal was to have a unified Arab stance.
Dealing with friendly nations
Sister countries
And how can we obtain a clear and strong Arab stance that Arab countries can agree upon?
And then, we find areas for reconciliation.
From our position, we know that more than one Arab country has been hacked.
In an offensive manner
And no one is punished until...
I'm tired of everything, intentional or not.
We are the specialized people.
In the world and the only ones always targeted
Always disciplined in a way.
I think
As much as we can't.
Meeting at the leadership level
To stop the disciplinary campaign.
We didn't want to create a rift in the Arab world.
And there are five other verbal agreements.
By a two-thirds majority
But the purpose of the meeting is not
Those who wish to be right and have our perspective be wrong, because the goal...
He is solving the problem, not attending a summit.
But is it solved at the expense of Palestinian blood?
What we are asking for now is that the ministerial committee does not cancel Qatar's request.
And this was confirmed by His Highness the Sheikh.
In the speech he gave, he said that we insist that it not be in Qatar if it causes any embarrassment. We insist that the summit not take place in Qatar. It can be anywhere.
An Arab stance that they respect, unlike ours.
Ayh wal-Waziri
We shouldn't tell them that the Security Council resolution came out.
and Israel
He had no say in the decision, and Gaza was bombed and shelled, and still is.
And I need to ask the Arabs what we do with this.
What are we going to do?
Is it when Israel finishes?
In order to implement the remaining Security Council resolutions
There will be a pause because Israel didn't stop.
We hit our friend.
To a resolution deemed final.
A few days ago.
We're talking about the ministerial meeting.
In the end, you will support this thing.
Of course, we support holding an Arab summit, and this was our idea, and some other countries also requested the summit, Syria and Yemen.
There is already an Arabic crack.
Or we'll isolate them in a camp of moderation.
And the camp of immoderation.
What do they mean by "without moderation"?
Organized by the West
Moderate and non-moderate Arabs
You will not find a moderate nation or a non-moderate nation.
And we want to know what moderation is and what immoderation is. Does moderation mean following Israel's plans?
He ends the matter in a humiliating way.
We just need to keep the case open.
This means an important question.
They are the countries.
They are following Israel's plans and want to solve problems in their ways.
I don't want to say that he's following Israel's plans, and I don't want to accuse anyone.
I just say
If we name the camp "Moderation"
What does moderation mean in Western eyes?
Do we agree on slaughtering a certain group of Palestinians?
Of course, the elections took place.
I'm neither supportive nor opposed to Hamas, but I'm speaking from a reality that exists.
The existing truth is that there is
Idea
What some call the radical movement
But we need to ask ourselves what this radical move takes.
For something other than her rights, or she demands her rights.
Or we'll arrange them.
And other crowds are created after
Against because we
Internal and intellectual Arabic
And it started to happen.
That's why we don't want to fight a war on behalf of others.
Yes, Your Highness, the Sheikh, in brief.
Who prevented the Arab summit?
I can't say there wasn't some effort, and the subject was somewhat known.
Prevention topic
But as I said, it might have been possible for us.
Hold a vote and get two-thirds.
But that wasn't the goal because it's not about the challenge as much as it is about an urgent need, which is what we see.
And others do not see it as a necessary need.
We went to the Security Council.
Or there is a resolution in the Security Council.
But the decision is for the Security Council; Israel said it would finish and then look into the matter.
All I want to focus on again.
We won't make efforts to implement the decision regarding the weaker party.
What makes it different from the first meeting?
Because disagreements sometimes lead to differences.
To the extent
Will we be ready to take a clear Arab stance?
Humanitarian aid
Support our brothers greatly.
Also to address the Israeli party and tell them
I don't think everyone is ready for this, we should check on that.
Why can't we freeze it?
Eighty-four and we are committed to the truce. Eighty-four and the Israelis are not committed.
It's normal to have disagreements in meetings, but in reality, these disagreements...
They represent their positions and what's in their hearts.
One of the reported fights was
He described Hamas' movement as "splitting."
Not even a little
This situation happened, and we dealt with it, and I had one of the ministers with me.
And I think this is what the West is saying.
These are radical, divisive, and other such moves.
"And we don't want to become someone else's man."
"And therefore" always means "and I don't mean anyone by it."
Any foreigner they meet.
"A Western country or Western countries that meet"
Among the Arabs
Okay, Your Highness, Sheikh.
Call for a Second Ministerial Meeting
Her agenda must be one thing.
Where are you, Arabs, from all this, and what is the position of the three-hundred-and-something state?
One million Israelis drive.
What was issued after Decision 1600
The issued decision.
Israel will implement it after it finishes the mission.
And there is no doubt that the Arab delegation made an effort.
What one should be grateful for this decision.
In order to demand Chapter VII, because Israel is above the law.
Even if there's a question, they say they understand.
It's not wrong for the Arabs if they are.
If it were so, Israel wouldn't ask.
Above international law
This is a fact.
Why did you go to the Security Council, and why did you link the Arab Summit to what will be issued by the Security Council?
At the summit, the Security Council is trying to help us.
He needs a tough decision.
The decision is yours.
He can make a official lose his position.
We were terrified of the West.
And we work a lot after they decide.
I don't want to get off topic.
Those who carried out the attack are rebuilding Iraq in its entirety at their own expense because they are the ones who destroyed it.
Let's not demand from the Iraqi government, and let's not demand the rights of the people who died.
No compensation.
The exact same thing in Sudan when they started talking about prosecuting Bashir.
Happiness
Happiness Sheikh
A Major Diplomatic Victory for the Arabs in the Security Council
They had a few difficulties in the Security Council because the first item was a presidential statement.
Implications
Israel has not committed to it.
He will be committed to it in two days, in a week, after he finishes the task.
Because they didn't gather with him.
Sorry, but people need to gather.
Because Israel agreed after the mission was over.
Do you have an alternative to the decision now?
All we did
Some brothers, unfortunately, with some efforts.
They participated in the siege of Gaza.
I am a friend of the West, and I have no objection to having any kind of relationship with the West. And I am pro-
Against the West, not against America.
But these people know the language of interests.
Your quarter if you are strong.
Or if you have a point of view.
And in the end, they take one percent of our perspective and we say we won.
And what is victory?
"with what it contained"
I can't say anything about precautions now because the decision wasn't made.
The council is the master of its decision.
I participated in the formation.
Yes, we participated in the formation to some extent.
But you weren't invited to the meeting with the Arab ministers and the US Secretary of State.
But I think the brothers who went were up to the task and delivered.
You signaled to the Arab parties for their own interests.
In this regard, Your Highness Sheikh
For two years until this moment
I don't want to talk about accusations.
I can't pretend we knew everything.
If they are people who
There was Israeli rejection, international rejection, and we also contributed to this rejection.
And from there the dispute began and the siege began.
And last month, Israel killed twenty-eight Palestinians during the ceasefire.
And we'll let them scream until they burn, because we don't want them in power.
These are the parties, O long-lived Sheikh.
Clarified the Palestinian conflict
"That is, if there was"
Who created the Palestinian conflict? There might have been a Palestinian conflict.
You're telling a certain party, "No, you're 100% wrong."
I'm not saying Hamas is 100% right.
I'm not claiming that and I'm not saying that.
But the mediator is usually in the middle, equidistant from everyone.
And not only the mediator, but we as Arabs are also equidistant from everyone.
But we don't want him to be present, that's why we need to end it by any means necessary.
A day training soldiers right and left.
And once by besieging them and not giving them money or salaries.
And when we create a positive model in the West Bank
So the people of Gaza can see how others live.
Luxury living
And the opposite is true in Gaza.
Invited to a second Arab ministerial meeting, but this time at the ministerial level.
What is the ongoing discussion between Hamas, mediated by Turkey?
This meeting that you were asked to attend seems to be going off track.
There will be a backlash if we make another initiative.
We don't have initiatives.
In this issue
Because Egypt is an important Arab country.
We require you to take a stand while we support any Egyptian effort exerted to reach an understanding.
Just important
Don't come.
Tomorrow with a party that overshadowed another party.
And not the path to harmony.
Balanced Egyptian Initiative
Between international demands, Arab demands, and humanitarian demands.
And the conditions of Egypt's role, which is an important role.
It is a leading Arab country that we all respect and appreciate.
According to you, this is what is required from Egypt.
The current proposals, the current initiative, do not meet these requirements, Your Excellency.
I have a vision for the initiative.
We hear some information from here and there.
I can't comment on something I don't know.
With all due respect to the Palestinian government or presidency, which should exist, we all recognize the Palestinian presidency.
But there are still people.
Those injured on the other side, whose perspective we also need to consider.
So that we can do these average tasks.
In general, to get the perspective.
Hamás' position was clear that this decision did not take our viewpoint into account, so how could it be issued?
A decision that Arabs participate in its formation without contacting or consulting the original concerned party on the matter.
We just want, of course, to deal with the Palestinian state as a state.
We deal with the authorities as one party.
But now there is a division in one party in one place and another party in another place.
This doesn't mean that if we deal with people from Gaza, we have to stop dealing with people who are either in the bank or in the Palestinian presidency.
We deal with the Palestinians as one people and one government.
They ask someone from Gaza to be with them.
And now we start coordinating with each other.
What has been declared.
Firstly, regarding the resolution, he said the mechanism welcomed the Egyptian initiative and any other initiative.
Some and consider them as a mechanism
This is an explanation, but from what I understood from reading this decision, it welcomes the Egyptian initiative.
We hope the Egyptian initiative succeeds in achieving its goals.
Who stops the fight?
I have no doubt about our brothers in Egypt.
Because Israel did not accept the Security Council resolution.
And you consider that this decision no longer exists because Israel did not accept it.
Even if you accept it later, things will change on the ground.
Yes, Your Excellency, the sheikh is talking about Egyptian efforts.
In cooperation with Turkish efforts at the same time
He has an Arabic excuse.
It's an Arab dispute that can't be resolved, so it came to fill the void.
It is supposed to be filled out by Arab parties.
I welcome Turkey's stance.
A stance that Arabs and Muslims should appreciate.
Turkey is an Islamic country.
Thus, this is a natural role.
And indeed, the people must follow him.
There is no Arabic conscience to resolve the situation.
One says, "Let them finish the mission."
There must be a clear Arab stance that puts an end to all this ongoing aggression and procrastination.
He will be in an Arab position opposite.
Israel can delay the decision, I'm not talking about an Arab-Israeli war, we, the people, always call for peace.
And we are a country that loves to live in peace.
But I don't call for an Arab war, I call for a ...
A clear Arab stance
Of course, you follow what is happening in the context of initiatives and proposals.
The conditions and proposals set by Hamas
Do you believe?
Now as an on-the-ground observer
And the political outcome of the military operation now allows Hamas to set its conditions.
Does he have to be right?
We agree on this point and disagree on that point.
Second thing
I don't know about this negotiation, as I've told you, they're not there, oh now they're negotiating.
Second thing
Okay for the required positions for Arabs.
This Arab reality
We have a witness after the start of those operations.
It's as if the Arab street has taken a very advanced stance.
As governments, we
Of course, I'm upset that some people describe others' gifts.
They tell me about this subject again.
Represents the views of the people.
Bosses now
That means if they want to.
At least they see what
The request, of course, has a high ceiling and a modest ceiling.
To halt normalization and diplomatic relations with Israel
Qatar
Closing the Israeli representative office in Doha
The person who takes this position.
Considering that the Arab side should be radical and take radical positions.
Whatever the Arabs agree upon is a collective agreement.
And what if we had an Arab agreement?
The treaty is one thing, and relations are another.
We're ready.
So we can walk with our Arab brothers.
I wish there was a clear and honest Arab decision.
They engage with others, not just countries with which they have relations.
But also countries that have nothing.
Very important
Don't become agents for others.
He says why not be Qatar an example in this field.
So if this is the only model, then we're ready to go with it.
But we still want
Qatar is a model Arab state committed to part of its Arab commitment.
Like
No one should sell one for the other.
Our problem is that trust between Arab countries is missing.
Unfortunately, I don't want to say our secret, I don't want to say broker.
That's why it's very important.
For formal invitations anywhere, we must rise above such things.
Some called the ambassador, some staged protests, some expelled the ambassador, like Chavez did.
And this is part of the dispute.
But some demanded the ambassador, and those who demanded the permanent member states, and all of this is a movie about our people.
We talked about the modest ceiling of people's demands.
"With all the expectations, some are demanding the opening of fronts, some are calling for Syria to open its fronts with Israel."
I told you, we are calling for peace, we are not calling for a fight with Israel.
And we don't want to fight Israel.
To wage war against Israel.
And how do they agree?
This is also a problem.
What brings us together is greater than what drives us apart.
What you said, Your Highness, caught my attention.
As long as countries don't sell to each other.
What does it mean?
Means now.
The street has no mercy.
Happiness Sheikh
Is what's happening today a continuation of a project that started in 2006 during the Lebanon War?
Or there is a difference.
I don't think there are disagreements on the goals.
Lebanon had liberated land.
Of course, some parts should be deposited with the United Nations.
Or something like that.
Lebanon means we've dealt extensively with the Lebanese situation.
Israel, of course, needs weak states around it.
To control and have the upper hand
Of course, there are countries that support him and he is a foreigner.
That's why she wants to remain the only power in the region.
And now they want
To change this example in Gaza
In Lebanon, you speak with how many sects?
And how many sides does it have?
While in Palestine, there is only one side.
But I can assure you again that the problem in Palestine is that they have heard too much from many Arabs and foreigners.
And from here the gap began, and each one thought he would control the second part.
In your opinion, as an observer and a viewer?
As planned, it will end in broken bones.
As Arabs, do we accept this because it may happen to those who disobey?
Or he expresses his opinion.
If they are Israelis or others in the future.
And we set the best examples.
In obedience and assistance to break bones.
We have a proverb that says, "I and my brother against my cousin, I and my brother and my cousin against the stranger."
Now, there should be no disagreement with Hamas, and I'm not saying that Hamas or anyone else is infallible.
They all have mistakes.
Now we have to forget about this topic.
Give me the part I assembled.
Because here, failure will not be a group failure.
Happiness Sheikh Qatar usually means a previous period when it tried to come up with proposals.
Initiatives to find solutions have emerged in Lebanon.
We'll talk about this in Darfur after a minute, even in a hurry.
We are
We don't want to rely on our brothers because sometimes there are some sensitivities.
As long as there is a solution, we don't mind if one country takes the initiative for all these proposals.
Our goal now is not to make Qatar a main headline.
What were His Highness the Prince's objectives?
One of his goals was to stop the bloodshed.
End the hegemony.
What happened was beyond imagination.
"And we are in Qatar."
Do we know anything they don't? I don't think so.
But the most important thing is to have good intentions.
To reach a satisfactory solution
Talking about initiatives being beneficial, we know what came to the initiative regarding Darfur, the Justice and Equality Movement's solution.
The Sudanese government in Khartoum
And it will mostly be about resolving the Darfur issue, because the Darfur issue is at its inception.
The Arabs helped.
But let's not make this an international issue.
Based on revenge from the system, and now we want to solve the issue but we don't know how.
And we always strive, as mentioned earlier, to implement decisions. We are the best people at implementing decisions.
Withdrawing the case file from competition. Is there also competition in the Darfur case file?
I don't want to go through that.
Before we conclude the discussion, Your Highness, there is an economic summit.
Will you attend this summit?
We're not attending the summit.
We wished it could have been held in a different atmosphere than the Arab one, but it was scheduled that way.
It would be a scandal.
That's good if the Arab leaders attend this summit.
Why is Palestinian blood being shed in Gaza while they gather there for financial and economic reasons?
Assistance with heating
I just feel like I haven't seen anyone afraid of these streets.
You don't know the circumstances, I mean, of course, I hope nothing happens to us, but safety first.
For safety.
But no one takes anyone in their small pocket.
"Many thanks to His Excellency Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State of Qatar."
Dear viewer, wherever you are, peace be upon you.
And what is the point of this celebration and the statements of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights regarding credibility?
People with disabilities are the most oppressed people in the world.
How long has our Arab region been and how interested are they in this issue?
These and other questions will be asked of our guest today.
Former Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
And he holds a Bachelor of Arts in Social Work and Sociology from Qatar University.
Master's degree in Social Planning and Social Policy from the Egyptian University in Helwan
I have held several positions in the field of disability.
She was a founding member and general coordinator of the National Committee for People with Disabilities.
In 1989
And the Vice President of the National Committee for Disabled People since 1999.
Until 2003
As I contributed to the establishment of the Shafallah Center for Children with Special Needs.
For people with disabilities in Qatar
Our guest has the honor of launching numerous programs, projects, and media campaigns.
Activities for People with Disabilities in the Arab World
He also contributed to delivering lectures and participating in meetings, conferences, and forums.
Welcome, Professor Hessa, to this episode.
The term used is "people with disabilities."
Initially, we called them "special needs individuals" in the 1980s and before.
A more educational concept for what
Among those who provide them with such education
A significant document appeared at the United Nations in ninety-three.
"About the term, before we go into the details."
I am from a second-world country, although there are regions that are not classified as developing countries but are considered poor.
And Latin America, especially Latin America, in fact, this trend there is the strongest in any other region.
But the statistics proved the opposite.
The orientation towards legal rights exists in the Arab world and exists in many countries.
Resources may be available, and political will too.
Okay, let me tell you that some statistics you might already know.
Eighty percent of poor countries
UNESCO says that around ninety percent of children with special needs from poor countries do not go to school.
Lady Hessa, how do you comment on these statistics?
To a large extent realistic
I have seen it in Darfur, in Gaza, and in areas that are exposed to such events as wars and conflicts.
You can't distinguish between a disabled person and a healthy person because they are numerous.
In fact, the children who have female illiteracy, for example, are almost three or two dozen.
In other countries
There are many barriers that prevent these children from reaching schools, even without disabilities.
In reality, the city doesn't have the infrastructure, even if this boy found this school.
What he can reach.
For the sake of the children and other residents
These agendas and projects are good, but we barely hear about them.
Except when we talk about the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, which the world celebrated a few days ago, what is the point of this celebration?
The situation in the world
Better than people who don't have a disability.
There are organizations that have arrived and implemented many projects.
Implements a very important health strategy.
Through this strategy
There is an intersection between humanitarian affairs and working with marginalized groups such as people with disabilities.
Now there is a degree of awareness in the Arab world, and it has become better.
At the awareness point, we pause to take calls and continue our conversation.
Thank you
I have two questions I'd like to ask her since she's been to the United Nations before.
The second point
United Nations laws calling for the fight against systems that hinder society, such as the Syrian intelligence system, are now in place for the benefit of children.
Is there a law that allows for demanding the trial of the regime, as there are many in Syria?
Yes, Suleiman, your question is clear. Suleiman Krou is from Syria. Thank you very much. With us is Nayef Saeed from Kuwait. Hello, Nayef.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Peace be upon you too.
Good evening
Good evening, welcome.
If possible, I am one of those with intellectual and cognitive disabilities.
Arabs say, "The wise understands a hint."
And there is a verse in the Quran that says, "In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. God has given us speech, praise be to God who gives speech to all things."
I sat for thirty years without speaking a word or two a day.
So praise be to Allah who made me speak.
I meant the Quran and found it.
People attack me for using the Quran as a reference and see me as a hypocrite.
They attack me, not knowing they are in the lowest of the low.
All I got was slander.
And not telling the truth.
If your house is made of glass, don't throw stones at others.
And of course, psychological disabilities.
Regarding Brother Suleiman's inquiry, it also falls under the same definition.
United Nations programs or what is their reaction to the causes of disability such as political goals or other objectives
Go to various authorities and organizations.
So that we can discuss with them, convince them, and understand to what extent.
There are disability issues and cases on their agendas.
UNESCO, the International Labour Organization, UNICEF, and the fact that these organizations indeed address disability.
It's one of the programs that tries not to lose children with disabilities.
With good opportunities and schools
From various environmental aspects
UNICEF after
But there are shortcomings. We must acknowledge that there are shortcomings in the United Nations as well.
What are the most common weaknesses and shortcomings you've discussed?
United Nations
The topic of routine and bureaucracy
I was in my country, the State of Qatar.
But there was routine and bureaucracy that hindered.
My job itself sometimes during constraints or shortcomings after
Struggle or try to fight for the recognition of people with disabilities.
Although Len accommodated my disability to some extent, he did not put it in a separate article as the Global Disability Movement wanted.
But a somewhat suitable part was occupied.
Unfortunately, there's no coordination between them.
This is one of his main shortcomings.
The investigation carried out by the Special Rapporteur and applied to States
Among the employees or people working on these programs
Unfortunately, we only received three responses from forty-eight organizations and entities, and they only provided three responses.
Don't give up.
The topic of disability is a permanent, stable, and ongoing issue for many years, even though it is primarily a human rights matter.
Recently, thank God, two or three years ago.
The topic of disability has at least been raised through events such as seminars and others.
Peace be upon you
Madam, why are there no binding laws and decisions for Arab countries, and who is responsible for implementing these international systems?
Regarding Arab countries and salary allocation, for example, allocating a salary to a person with a disability.
Are there dedicated amounts from the United Nations?
Does this money go to governments or to UN offices, and does this aid actually reach the disabled?
The final remark, if there are no binding decisions for Arab countries.
Many thanks to Ahmed Halabi from Greece.
With Yana Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia, hello Ibrahim.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
She may adopt this proposal.
Which is writing directly to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
To convert to this fund
Or a manufacturing plant
Allocating only one percent of the annual net profit
Go back to our guest to answer the callers' questions.
He said that the doctors advised him to undergo surgery, but...
Waid is overburdened and cannot manage, so where can he get help?
He is from Algeria.
I think it's important to meet Brother Naji's needs.
Like any other rights, the rights of persons with disabilities
All these rights and duties must be obtained by the citizen.
To join the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, this convention is legal and binding.
Fulfilling the rights and needs of the people within the national scope.
Or even at the non-governmental level
Obligatory for all states and restricted to ensure the implementation of these laws.
At least at the level of officials primarily, there should be awareness.
It's necessary to work on these treaties in this way, at the very least.
Even if there's not a lot of commitment in it.
How do you respond to monitoring reports, and was there any interest?
Just don't forget the guidelines, it's actually a morally binding document, not legally.
There is commitment and there is regulation.
And understanding that these cases will be resolved or discussed or that they will be within the context of a society suffering from many problems.
Naji Zakarna, director of the National Center for the Deaf, sign language expert at Al Jazeera TV.
First of all, Mr. Ali would like to express his gratitude to Al Jazeera TV channel.
The episode that was broadcast live.
Now Ali is talking and saying that he is extremely proud.
And she was a servant to all those with special needs in the place where she was and still is.
And we stand with her and are always on her side.
And I also say that there are many people with special needs.
Some of them don't know about this agreement because there were no training sessions.
About them, especially in schools, hospitals, or in public and private institutions.
And they must publish the agreement.
Law concerning individuals with special needs in every country of the world
And I insisted and insisted on these countries that
Adopt and sign this agreement.
Like the State of Qatar, some countries have signed this document with the aim of serving people with special needs and serving us.
"Many thanks to colleague Nagi speaking on behalf of Ali."
Thank you, you've been very helpful.
Your opinion might decide the matter.
Former United Nations Secretary-General, United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. We can start. Proposal submitted by caller Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
Creating a fund to support
A donation box that accepts contributions from any country.
This means that the fund is supposed to be disbursed for activities undertaken by the Special Rapporteur when engaged in
Even among Arab countries, only one donated: Syria.
The problem of fulfilling these commitments exists in the United Nations, therefore
The box
Lack of commitment and interest from member states, unfortunately.
Unfortunately, many people say this boldly, they don't care about the current situation.
Is the topic of obligations really relevant?
On human rights.
In its broad, general sense
The marginalized, especially
But that's why these covenants exist.
So that these countries fulfill their obligations, but it's a good idea from the brother.
Above all, it is necessary that there be no single independent box, i.e., one that is independent in form but composed of organizations already present in the region.
Who are the ones who have it in their budgets?
Special projects were launched for people with special needs in Gaza.
Assistance for people with special needs
The problem always involves political factors.
His state or government has guaranteed significant support.
Unfortunately, the number is decreasing.
For nominal amounts
The father is helpless.
Of course, I renounced my citizenship.
Take after him his offspring, indeed.
Sometimes me
Teaching problems
His journey was a sculpture.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Peace be upon you too.
"And we are grateful."
They rebuild themselves knowingly.
I wish Arab countries would allocate a portion of their budget
Many thanks, Joy Crown from Kuwait.
Hello Aisha Mohammed from Qatar
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
Good evening to you and Sheikhah Bint Khalifa.
I just want to send her a message of thanks and appreciation.
In recent years
With our best wishes from us, the parents of children with special needs.
With the continuous support of Sheikhah Hessa
A noble standard-bearer from Tunisia, welcome.
There's another level, which is the genetic one.
I believe there is genetic care that reduces the percentage of disabled people.
In our Arab customs, a cousin always marries his cousin, and so on.
In this way, at this level, a level of disability and thank you.
Can you comment on the viewers' comments?
Frankly, as I said at the national level
I know there are guidance programs and support.
Falls within healthcare services
Who also fall under the umbrella of Hamad Medical Corporation
I think at the psychological clinic and also programs at the Supreme Council of Education
Special Education Department, to be honest, I don't know if it still exists or not.
But it's definitely within healthcare services. Yes, there is support and there are medical services.
My qualifications are available for these cases.
Prevention is better than cure, and he pointed to the genetic factor and consanguineous marriage. Are there any campaigns?
For example, to raise awareness.
In this area
Certainly, this is a very important and serious point.
And there are things that I and others have dealt with in many words and many posts.
Are there awareness campaigns and not just targeted ones?
Implemented by the World Health Organization
In addition to UNICEF
Now there are many Arab countries, including Qatar.
And surely Tunisia
Now there is a binding decision for early detection.
And which has been implemented in many countries.
All of this is on the preventive side.
And do such campaigns receive any positive response?
Especially when it goes against customs and traditions.
Of course, its difficulty when it clashes with societal culture.
To have a decision, to have strategies, to have the will to deal with this and commit.
The topic of early examination, for example, because it is a very important subject before marriage.
We ask if there are statistics on people with disabilities.
Especially those with special needs from the Arab region.
Arab region
Especially
With the recent events that happened in the region
In regions, conflict hotspots, wars, and especially in wars and conflicts, etc.
I am with every person who was killed in three paralyzed.
And what happened in Lebanon, Darfur, and many other places.
It's just a small problem.
With the principles of human rights
There must be something for the disabled, their programs, and plans.
Agendas within established institutions in government and non-government ministries
In circumstances such as war or unrest
But according to your words, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights denies this completely.
In the world, the strangest is what the International Monitoring Committee for the Rights of People with Disabilities said about the census.
To this extent, people with special needs are not included in the statistics that are done for the population.
What they always announce.
For example, in the State of Qatar, when they conducted the census, I think it was more than five years ago.
Just the truth.
In collaboration with the Planning Committee and
Establishing the council as a fait accompli and with our participation, like the office of the Special Rapporteur.
To add more categories for disabilities
Assumed needs
Types of those needs, all these important details that you need to reach a conclusion.
Is there a disabled person or not?
But at least
Statistics are somewhat in progress in this regard.
Peace be upon you
Madam, thank you for the program. Thank you, Sheikhah Hessa.
But thank God I am Qatari and receive all this attention from my country.
And my daughter is now a student in independent schools and receiving a good education, praise be to God.
And I thank Mrs. Hessa.
Her motivational role and the role that made us not fear or worry about our children.
Praise and thanks to God, and thanks to her and those upon whom this category depends.
Many thanks to Fatima Al-Dosari from Qatar. We are still with Qatar with Latifa.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
My dear sister, reality, expectations, and what we hope will solve our children's problems.
Where is the role of the sheikha for our Qatari children?
I hope she can answer this question.
Hello, peace be upon you.
And I testify to what the State of Qatar has provided as a special service to the hearing impaired.
We had a program for early detection of hearing impairment.
A higher council for people with special needs
For people with disabilities, regardless of the type of disability.
To unite civil society, non-governmental organizations or other communities.
Because reality and what we wish for, if I compare them in five years.
What was offered to people with special needs five years ago and now?
Thank you very much, Karim Naseem from Jordan, and now we return to our guest.
Of course
The society as a whole, its individuals, and especially its families with children.
People with special needs have great ambitions and aspirations.
Whether at the planning level or the operational level
But for one of the points you mentioned, which is a very important point.
Kids who can't get papers or anything else, whether in Qatar or abroad.
An international agreement is like many international documents.
I committed to translating it into plans and strategies.
To provide these services automatically.
Based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, regardless of religion, race, color, gender, or sexual orientation.
Okay, Sheikhah Hessa, you worked as a special rapporteur before at the United Nations, specializing in disabilities, after six years of work.
I wished.
Perhaps the time was not enough or the material assistance was not sufficient.
There have been many achievements, and I am proud of them.
Through my participation or through existing organizations and government institutions in many countries.
Especially in the Arab region
There will be more research and broader studies.
We started by conducting a global survey, and we had more than one report.
Awareness is an ongoing process that we need to work on continuously and extensively.
Coordination among Arab countries
And among the people themselves, people with disabilities and their organizations, because they are the ones.
It's their duty.
They have to fight for
Thank you, you've been very helpful.
Thank you
Dear viewers, at the end of this episode, we thank everyone who shared their opinions and comments with us.
Tomorrow, God willing, we will meet with a new guest.
Join us with your messages and calls in a new episode of "Live" with safety.
Good morning
I'm very happy to have you here with us.
First thing, before we start, we ask you different questions and chat in this morning.
Thank you, Shaima, maybe you blessed me.
The entire Middle East deserves this global achievement.
Qatar has frankly put a pin on the global football map.
Thank you, Qatar.
And also Ali, oh! Ali
First of all, I'd like to greet the viewers.
I extend my congratulations to him and to all Qatari citizens on the hosting.
"And, God willing, just as Sheikh Mohammed said,"
It was a dream, and God willing, it will become a reality, and work will start today or during the announcement period.
Did you expect Qatar to host the World Cup in two thousand and twenty-two?
Despite having strong files like the United States, Japan, and Australia, I didn't fear in this field on this particular issue.
No, look, to be honest with you, I said there's a 70% chance Qatar will win it.
Very strong
He has global and competitive plans.
We were competitors.
Why should we be afraid?
But praise be to God, Qatar's file was very strong and deserved it.
True, the 2022 World Cup profile and hosting are in Qatar.
Okay, what do the athletes themselves think they feel?
They are in the field, so it's natural that they are very happy, praise be to God.
Father, we were talking about it, but we want to hear it on the air.
The moment of announcement.
Where were you, how did you receive the news, and were you surprised? Tell me and tell the viewers.
On the radio
And after all the people followed us.
They heard about the announcement.
How did you see the international media?
On the level of sports channels, everyone was supportive, especially the Arab channels, praise be to God, everyone offered us support.
As soon as they announced Qatar's win and that it had secured the hosting rights,
All Arab countries have announced their full support for Qatar, through media, human resources, and volunteers, in the future.
Arab countries are known for their generosity.
Even at the level of international media, Shaima.
I went there that time to celebrate at Souq Waqif.
Even the French News Agency was filming there.
We conducted interviews.
Everyone is cooperating; Qatar is now, on a daily basis, reminding her.
A hundred times a day, considering it the smallest spot on Earth.
I guess everyone will get to know Qatar even online.
To host the 2022 World Cup
Any soccer player dreams of serving his country, of being in the national team.
Of course, any player, whether in the Qatari league, wishes to represent the team.
The good thing is that one tries very hard to
He is in the league, even when he is in the league he dedicates all his efforts.
Whether in training or in matches, because he wears the league logo on his shirt, so he must adhere to his card.
Look, the officials have put a lot of effort into taking care of young players, teaching them professionalism from a young age.
Eat, Sleep
Tell me about your experience playing at different age stages. How was your experience and what was the most important stage for you?
Was, of course.
I gradually progressed through the ranks, from the youth team to the first team.
You know camping with the club and with the league.
For every stage has a distinct sign.
What, Lana? God willing, you were just moving around.
We're used to you now, every sport we have.
We always see you as a sporty lady, and we'd love to see you and hear about sports from you. How's sports been treating you?
To be honest, I don't see how it's different from talk shows. In talk shows, we used to host famous stars in their fields, and in sports shows, we're also hosting stars.
Like Ali and the rest in their sports field.
On the contrary, the sports field is active.
Especially since we are the sports capital.
And Qatar has now become the global capital of sports and football.
Instead of airing various talk shows, social, economic, and cultural programs
In different fields, volleyball, basketball, different champions.
Just sports so far.
Imagination, excellent
Frankly, I wished
I wish I was ten years old now, not twenty-five.
For the young players, I thought they had a very big opportunity.
Inshallah they take advantage of this opportunity.
"Well done. What would you like to say to the players?"
God willing, the young players who will have a bright future in the coming days, if God wills.
Of course, I told you it's an opportunity they need to seize.
It's a golden opportunity.
They have a big advantage in it.
Tell us what you're doing. What are the new programs you're presenting? I know we asked you to come during your vacation.
So tell us about your news, God willing.
We are always following up on events and preparing for the Asian Cup, which starts in one month.
A few days ago, we finished the Gulf Cup, and on this occasion, we'd like to say congratulations to the Kuwaiti league.
The newsletter is also available to cover events.
My first appearance in the media was through Qatar TV, of course my roots are from Qatar TV.
I'm grateful for their generosity.
To carry the media message on different channels
Whether private, sports, or other channels
So, thank you Qatar TV.
We wish you all the best, we are still on the same topic.
First, I would like to thank the management of Al-Wakrah Club.
And I was in Al-Wakrah Club.
My childhood
The sheikh was with us yesterday, Sheikh Nasser was with us.
Still at the club
I'm still the boy from Al Wakrah.
But, as I told you before the program started, professionalism.
What concerns every individual in Qatar.
We know that young people generally love and are addicted to sports.
How can we make sports a social topic?
First, media awareness, the media plays an important role in promoting sports in all different areas of life.
I said that young people are addicted to it, and schools have also become aware of the importance of sports in school.
For example, they celebrate any sporting event.
Also in Qatar, you see signs on the streets. This reflects sports awareness.
Allocating seats for women in stadiums and anywhere.
This also indicates the awareness of women and their participation in the sports field.
We now have the Qatar Women's Tour for players.
Sports are constantly evolving.
I also think that this period of time
To produce large projects and sports awareness, I think this time is enough.
If it's calculated and executed carefully.
Enough, and at the same time, it needs to be used thoughtfully as I said.
Also, there's one point, which is how the young generation can benefit from the league.
Everything is available: capabilities, experiences, and equipment.
And there's one important thing, praise be to God, we are in Qatar. All Arab and Gulf societies know that we are renowned for our passion for sports.
How can we attract this audience to follow sports news, football matches in Qatar?
And attending matches at the same time
Most of the Qatari people love sports and football, but the problem is that they don't attend.
When you browse web forums, you will find that there is a great deal of interest, especially in most club forums.
There is great interest in the football league.
As a Qatari citizen, what do you see as the best solution to attract you to attend, setting aside the fact that you are an athlete and a player?
And what's the way you can get the audience to attend, for example, your cousins?
It depends on the individual; there is no universal concept.
Some people like to watch it on TV on a Friday at home.
For example, Japan, Japan developed a wonderful plan to attract the public greatly.
When they attend matches that involve point accumulation or whatever, they are looking for solutions, so let's hope.
And Arabic
The most important point is that every player will be here in Qatar specifically in two thousand and twenty-two. What do you think? What do we need?
Aside from financial support, what do you think we really need?
Providing the means to make them ready as a national league and participating in a massive global event, the World Cup.
Time passed quickly with good people when the producer told me it was time, I said, "By God, hopefully."
Always achieve the impossible. Achieve the dream that we thought was impossible. Alhamdulillah, we are living it in reality.
As Sheikh Mohammed said, it was a moment of celebration, but serious work has begun.
And God willing, 2020 will be an event that will bear the name of Qatar.
I congratulate everyone living in Qatar, and quite frankly, Qatar has become a global landmark.
Hosting 2022
Thank you, my sister Lana, the brilliant presenter. I wish you success, and we always watch your programs to keep up with sports news.
Thank you, surely happiness.
Young Qatari talents
And they're singing a new type that's popular now.
But in the form of repetition with fast music and rhythm.
And also a group of rap enthusiasts, God willing.
Stay with us, we'll start now, and may God greet you with goodness.
We try to take a quick look at it.
We can simply define rap as fast music.
It's more like a repeated performance, not rapid-fire rhythmic singing of the song lyrics.
It contains many rhymes, talking about many different topics and matters.
Sometimes it can be personal.
Social, emotional, or political.
Often controversial,
And very liberal.
Rap performance, showing our viewers what the lyrics are.
He just keeps repeating it.
He flatters with his voice, which is a secondary element.
Generally, sound isn't important in rap songs.
And for this reason, he is not called a singer, he is called a rapper or an MC.
Rapper's care about the following elements in songs:
For example, the flu, flu-like symptoms, synchronistic events, and delivery.
They have followers, an audience, and fans.
They have a unique style of rap.
I think they'll give you a better idea of me personally.
Good morning, hello.
First of all, it was a time when we wanted to do something new.
Be distinctive in something.
So we said, "Why don't we rap?"
And rap is an art present in all countries of the world.
Okay, why isn't it available in Qatar?
So we said, "Let's invent something new."
We gave him an idea that contained a message.
Let's discuss the advantages and disadvantages that occur in society.
We deliver a message first and foremost, and secondly, it's an art.
This art of diverse arts, the science of spectators, has radically addressed many social and psychological issues among youth.
Time changes, and I think this has something to do with the changing times.
Before, there was acceptance, even if it was small.
We've been singing since around 2005. At first, the reception was a bit slow.
We can say that our new beginning was in 2010.
He has more acceptance and popularity.
People like to sing and perform the same rap style these days, have you noticed that?
Of course, a large percentage of people
And there's also another thing we want to talk to you about. You were founders in many of the teams.
A beautiful band, and I think you have concerts. Can we talk about this band?
How did you form? How did you come up with the idea of starting a band, and how many members are there in your band?
Initially, before the formation of the...
Rap came to Doha from the beginning of 2005.
Everyone who loves rap and can rap can sing and release it on the site.
I can go down, Salman can go down, anyone can go down, so there was competition.
We met people.
So we started competing with each other.
And after all these years, we've reached 2010.
Before 2010, the group system meant that each group was separate, and three or four were together.
So we said, "Why don't we all unite as one group under the name 'Rapperz Qatar'?"
Or in English, Q-Tip.
So we agreed on this, saying under one name and all of us as one hand.
And we come forward to present this thing and say the same idea.
About twenty-five people.
25, God willing, a large group, God willing.
Does anyone here play or play or play or do you all rap?
Coordinate and compose.
You could say it's personal.
Excellent, how are these 25 organized? How is this number organized in the band?
Everyone has their own capabilities.
This means every person in the band can make a whole song.
Without the help of another person.
But abilities might be different, for example, if Salman is better than me.
He hears it and tells me to change these words, change something.
Each one can change for the other.
We help each other a bit.
It's a company that adopts you, so that an official entity adopts these works.
And there will be real distributors.
So that the work comes out in a luxurious style and looks official to you.
To be honest, we were hoping to get support, and we received this support from a company that adopted us and produced an album for us.
We don't have any problem.
Some things are a bit difficult.
Why don't you consider taking the first step?
So that the person can recognize the first CD.
This way, you can attract companies later on, what do you think?
Around 2007, I made a CD.
I distributed them among my quarters.
How was the order?
I think
It could be possible because in 2007, rap music wasn't that popular in the Gulf.
"But I'm not as famous as I am now."
We used to chat before going on air, for example, in large groups like Valencia and Castro.
Shall we talk about him?
They said they'd organize the party for you.
They covered all the costs and procedures, coordination, and work; we didn't expect this level, to be honest.
Frankly, we were surprised and it was a great performance.
There was just a bit of pressure because there were no ads and nothing before the show.
There were no ads or anything two days before the party.
Assuming that no one comes due to the short notice.
The day we were inside before they started the party.
This was a beautiful point.
This means that our voice reaches families, not just young people.
We expected the idea to appeal to young people only.
But at this stage, we discovered that many age groups were listening to us.
Is there a particular song the audience likes?
The audience interacted with most of the songs.
Yeah, most songs, but there were a lot of songs and we were many.
The whole group
What are words, how do they address different topics?
We're talking about the current situation.
At least, even if it is...
Even if they spoke before *
It has to be like this.
It has a rhyme.
We think about every word and try to find better synonyms.
Okay, how many songs do you have? Let's listen to one of them.
One of the songs you produced
Let's hear it and see the public's opinion.
I hope they liked the talk.
Thank you, my brother Ali. I like the program's interface because it has the program's name on it.
This is a KDE-DJGMR Doha program.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This lady Bobo with SKT is one hot body.
Don't forget the show starts at 9:30. Everyone must watch.
Production: Hasan Naama, Presentation: Shaima Al-Hamadi
Director Nasser Al-Maliki, and guests Rappers Qatar, of course.
Because the program's name really is "Shukran Oh Youth"
I have to applaud you and applaud those in control.
We showed it last night.
"And who wrote the lyrics, or is it just a melody?"
Everyone writes their words.
Because if I write to Yusuf
Not just write it for the love of singing and for passion.
I guess you have to write about the 2022 World Cup and the Asian Cup. I guess if you can.
Sure, personally, we will produce a song about this topic.
But I don't expect it to be official at this stage.
I guess there has to be national songs.
Through the art of rap
Yes, frankly, today, everyone
We're watching the live stream now.
The cup has arrived and the streets of Doha are decorated.
So, viewers, as we have seen Doha adorned to celebrate the Asian Cup.
The concerned parties have made all the preparations for hosting.
And there will be more crowds.
I suppose they'll crowd along the corniche.
Sure they're ready to host that important sporting event.
Are there any parties coming up in the next few days?
In a presentation from a certain party, they promised us they would throw us a party.
But there are still some complications.
"Some procedures and topics, I mean, we're not sure."
So we'll try if I see Youssef and see.
Some of them are my song themes.
If we see that it fits the song.
And the possibility of performing it.
The day I'm home.
And then send it to Youssef via my email.
This is part of a song dedicated to Youssef.
There's something else, you travel abroad.
In this field, they have millions of fans.
Don't try to imitate, but we hear from people who are pioneers in this field.
But we try to be competitors.
Why don't we take some ideas and imitate certain things?
Just reverse it, I take the idea and apply it in a different way to my song.
I formed a band and have more than one CD.
One named Abdullah Al-Dail
He has the experience and ability to detect groundwater.
This talent is the ability to detect underground water tanks.
One of the residents of the city of Marah.
There are many experts.
Those who determine groundwater before drilling.
What is needed, or some wells, can be dug somewhere where there is water.
With the help of copper bars and pomegranate branches
Or the one who can determine the water tanks through it.
What tools were used?
To discover groundwater.
This was in ancient times.
But now, it has been replaced with copper bars.
So we put the the the the the
Walk slowly.
We notice when we walk in the water flow.
The skewers are opening.
Now, we're passing by a water broadcast.
It opens this way.
The day we count begins.
Now we are in mid-May.
Here, the middle is bacon.
I mean, in this way, we can determine the path of water, or groundwater, beneath the earth's surface.
And the process is repeated more than once in more than one place to find the area of highest density.
Abu Ibrahim confirmed
He has reached an advanced stage in this career.
For his discoveries to be very accurate.
In a meadow and outside the meadow, in Shaqra and Hawaymilah and Athithiyah.
Over one hundred and fifty wells have been discovered.
The error rate does not exceed five percent.
Requires training, experience, and God-given talent.
Exceeds modern equipment and laboratories.
In a short time
Abdulrahman Al-Marshed
Doha Morning Show
Marat lies northwest of the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh.
We saw this report and promise you more reports from Arab and international countries.
And the Gulf countries, God willing.
And we arrived at different places but he has the addresses.
Meaningful
I assume there is a large group of Gulf youth in the Gulf.
Are there specific people you follow as examples?
What you follow is better than what you imitate.
In general communication among all Gulf rappers
It's not a competition, even if I produce a song.
Who addresses a specific topic.
We can call it purposeful competition.
We have acquaintances, but no one is my friend.
In Saudi Arabia, there's Qusai, God willing, he is.
He has fans and CDs.
Many companies want to adopt it.
Are you aiming to reach this stage? Perhaps you can surpass this stage and more, God willing.
We wish you success through this team.
There, upon receiving the cup, let's see shots of the corniche.
In addition to a group of Qatari youth
Even though it's common in the West, it's in the Gulf style.
There are also love rap songs and a unique band of twenty-five people.
It's important to check on you and know your news.
I assume you have an email, website, or forum.
How can people get in touch with you?
We were used to having our own website.
There were just a few issues with the hosting company.
He would sometimes get drunk without any apparent reason.
We caused a lot of problems and eventually closed it.
No use, the site is definitely closing.
So, what should we do? What are the alternatives to solve this problem?
The UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, and even Morocco and Egypt.
You need to stay in touch with them to keep up with the latest news and the new songs that come out from time to time.
Okay, what's the alternative now?
Currently, we rely on private pages like
Under what name
Okay, when you search for our name on Google.
Qatar's rap or Qatar's rappers
You can make your own video clip.
Did you work on the program yesterday?
We've uploaded a lot of videos to YouTube.
Songs with pictures
Song and the same thing with pictures
I think we need to see you better than this.
You want a place where everyone can gather instead of being in their own homes with their belongings.
Mixer, piano, computer, and guitar
Frankly, I hope we get support.
For example, a company.
Produces CD
And they allocated us a special place.
We buy with our own money.
At the end of the day, we still work for ourselves.
There's nothing between us.
What differs from what Joseph said.
We need a video clip.
And album
Music videos help spread a song quickly.
Transmits ideas faster.
If there's support, everything else will follow.
And your sweet voice will be everywhere.
It is a type of art that deals with various issues and problems.
Thank you, Youssef Al-Naemi and Salman Al-Abdullah, for attending.
Let's see it and wish them all the best on behalf of our program, guys.
These projects were, yes.
I have another project that's almost ready, it just needs some technical improvements.
Expiry Date
When you go to the cashier, you already have the total sum and all the details.
He recognizes the goods instead of reading the components of each product.
As I was walking along the street
Attached to the cart, so you can choose the item you want.
Most projects are a reflection of children's perception of a problem.
He has a lot of activities and goals.
The center offers a range of programs and activities that focus on a single core idea.
We have ten goals set by Her Highness Sheikha Moza in establishing the center.
It might still be possible, yes.
The one who goes directly to the metro from his house.
I just thought it was for clothes.
All the shops in Qatar that sell t-shirts will appear.
Maybe later it'll be with the car key, I press the button.
Locate the items you lost and take me to the key.
Ah, let's return to the projects the center is working on.
It is early childhood education.
Developing skills and nurturing talents
The topic varies according to the different skills of children, media, and research skills.
Personal skills, such as public speaking, persuading audiences
Skills vary, and we had a special program to accommodate that.
We started in future media, did well in the project, reached the final graduation project.
We also obtained figures from children and youth speakers.
And their creativity...
Do you have young broadcasters?
For television, it's important that they provide programs for children.
We're getting them ready for TV.
Their TV broadcasted Qatar TV.
And we promise them until they reach eighteen years old.
Welcome wherever they are.
And this after the national television
We need to attract, discover, and develop these talents.
If it's media, research.
Intellectual dimensions
Reading and various other fields
Is there cooperation? Do you exchange ideas?
In all fields, such as the Promising Preachers Program sponsored by the Ministry of Awqaf
Our exhibition, the Generation Exhibition, is also...
The scientific club played a significant role in developing projects as well as providing technical support.
The main role was for the Higher Council for Education, through supporting schools and partners.
Professor Abdullah, moving to a building like Katara,
which also embodies a variety of activities and clubs
Do you consider this a motivation to strive for further success?
Change the move to another building.
Regardless of the enormous place
And it makes dealing with the public easier.
These are pioneering and excellent projects.
In welcoming the guest and introducing the programs available for the child.
This is our main project for the next three years.
National Reading Development Project
Under the patronage of Sheikha Hessa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani
I adopted and supported the project.
This is a big project, which is the development of reading, writing stories, and nurturing children.
Different cultural skills that are specifically related to reading.
Because there are different programs for sure.
We recently moved.
And we were organizing some activities.
Designing and improving it to suit Katara visitors
We wish you success through this center.
The one who has very important ideas.
First of all, I'd like to thank you for hosting me.
The most important thing is that the more we deal with children, the more we discover that
Today's childhood is different from ours.
They need more care, focus, and time.
Listen to his interests and imagination.
I communicate with him mentally.
They ... %pw, the way they treat their children like a hotel, they provide accommodation.
Or like a bank, it saves money.
The kids really need someone to listen to these ideas, the imagination.
In the past few days, they transferred us to 2030.
In this exhibition
We wish good luck to the winning projects.
We thank you for being with us, Professor Abdullah Al-Jumaili, Director of the Children's Cultural Center. We wish you success.
So these projects become reality and are not a dream forever.
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, the Children's Cultural Center was launched last night at the Diplomatic Club.
Closing ceremony of the National Future Dreams Exhibition for Generations under the slogan "Dreams of a Generation, Facts or the Nation of Tomorrow"
Celebration for the National Day of Qatar with the participation of over seventy children from Qatar.
There were many activities and several competitions at the exhibition.
Children's Creative Projects
We would like to welcome Mr. Abdullah Al-Jumaili, Director of the Children's Cultural Center. Good morning and welcome.
Good morning, my dear sister.
First of all, I'd like to thank you for giving us your time.
We talk about this exhibition, it's truly unique.
We're glad you're joining us on the program to cover as many events at the exhibition as possible.
This is the National Exhibition of the Dreams of a Generation
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, this exhibition.
Contribution from the Children's Cultural Center
To celebrate the National Day
"The one
In an attempt to calm the children
He lives in a dream.
With the project
This project or dream
Children's imagination is very wide.
So We confined him to a hundred years, minus thirty.
Other key areas of Qatar's Vision 2030
We started training children in four stages.
Then think about the brainstorming mechanism and the tools that expand the scope of thinking.
What exactly do you mean by this phrase?
They are the truths or the future for the homeland.
Means anything the child dreams of today.
He grows and the project grows with him.
In truth, this is the real interpretation of the vision that the children will live from today.
I dream big.
Whether they are environmental, health, human development, or any other field
Who serves the country.
I think that when we know there are children somewhere
Or at a specific exhibition
All that was available through
The exhibition also had guest speakers.
For the children to learn from them as role models.
Yesterday, a day or two ago, was the *
There were also several winners of various awards in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
There was a schedule for submitting their projects.
And the pictures are the best proof of your words.
This is a collection of photos from the exhibition and various activities.
They are still the owner of the last project, the forest.
We also want to talk about the colored ball.
A really great idea that we can simplify for the viewers. This is one of the children's innovations.
What's this topic exactly, the colorful ball, let's talk about it.
Suddenly, in four or five projects dealing with this subject, one of them is colored ball.
And they named the smart stadium after him.
If the ball goes out of bounds.
The colors differ.
I assume in the future, this will help a lot in matches.
What's left after all these dreams?
and be related to things within his field of interest.
Especially when there are responsible people who take these small projects from small minds into consideration.
But we don't know, these projects might serve us, what does the football federation president say?
Think about the idea of a colored ball.
Does he like it?
Wade visited football-related projects.
Supported and adopted these projects from the moment he saw them.
And these projects are built afterwards.
What our children did, and people also voted on many projects.
Which projects were live on air and received the most votes from people?
There is an evaluation committee with a method to evaluate projects.
The first, second, and third projects that won the awards.
The forest came in first place.
He was very precise about the details of the projects, and the project was ready for implementation.
Of course, it requires many administrative elements.
There were very detailed descriptions in the brochure distributed to visitors.
Surely these are the pictures we see now.
These are some of the big projects.
They might be trying to do what they see in movies and cartoons.
Indeed, part of it is adopted by institutions.
For example, let's call the projects what they are: projects.
To collect, use, and recycle them.
Forty-seven students
Qatar University celebrated yesterday the graduation of two hundred and forty-seven students from the thirty-third batch.
And His Excellency Dr. Khalid bin Mohammed Al Attiyah, Minister of State for International Cooperation
A large number of parents and faculty members
And the university is celebrating today the graduation of seven hundred and seventeen students.
We would like to thank our colleague Salman the Renewer, and we'll continue in the same artistic atmosphere as we have a very dear guest today.
I am from the classification series family, the actor Abdelhamid Sharshani.
He asserted himself through many works such as Hearts for Rent,
They made every effort to prove themselves in the art scene.
Especially in the field of art, which does not know flattery.
Which is
Thank you, and may God bless your morning with goodness. I wanted to greet the viewers.
No, I'm a fan of the show's cast and crew.
We'll see a very short scene from one of your works, and then we'll start talking to you.
Are you making fun of me?
Take the beaten cloak and the original robe.
Go to hell.
You have the coat, you return it.
Give me the bisht! Bring it.
They ground a goat in her stomach, may God curse them.
I am a member of a five-member committee.
On the conference's steering committee.
I won't agree to that.
I have no objections.
So here's a very quick, short clip from a TV series that we'll be watching the second season of.
We'd like to ask you about your participation this year in Part Two.
Can you tell us about your roles in the parts where the series has a different theme in each episode?
And what's your participation? Could you tell us about it?
Of course, afterwards
I went through a similar experience at that time.
Famous peaks also include the mountain.
A Kaaba whose praises have been sung throughout the ages.
The day when history is a witness and remains in the memory of cities,
And it shows how ancient its history is.
Which is 170 kilometers north of the capital, Riyadh.
And some people believe it is named after Imru' al-Qais al-Tamimi.
It is distinguished by its monuments, the sweetness of its water, and the purity of its air.
Poets were inspired by her and admired her. She was famous for a well-known mountain, Mount Ketmit.
They call it Khor Komait.
Of course, Marathah is an ancient city.
Founded before Islam
There were some old things whose exact date is unknown, such as the well of Khalid ibn al-Walid.
What we're in now.
The great companion Khalid ibn al-Walid (may Allah be pleased with him) ordered the digging of this well when he passed through during the Ridda Wars.
Still remaining.
The proverb says, "Show me a committed person, and I'll show you a successful one."
If you see a comet, then you can see Mars.
And the second effect is the Wadi Kamit.
Which is to say, a stream flows, flows, flows, flows, flows.
The city held out for a full year.
From the beginning of the rainy season to the next season.
The date of creation of these artifacts is unknown.
There is the bride and there is...
Katara is one of the landmarks of Doha city.
There were many proverbs, poetry, and poems relying on this mountain.
Many people from different regions of the kingdom come to it.
And among her important works is "Biralwaldi".
This is because he stayed in Mirbad during the Ridda Wars and was on his way to Yamama.
Camp there and order the men to dig a hole.
Some people still drink from its water and wash in it.
Yaqut al-Hamawi mentioned in Mu'jam al-Buldān that Khalid passed by Marrah.
This is an old house made of mud, restored to its original state.
It consists of various sections reflecting the architecture, heritage, and antiquities of the region.
The poet once said of him: "When we came to the water, there was no water."
We came to the garden of Al-Komit, not the garden of the Gospels.
Mr. Ayman believes, God willing, in cooperation between the family, parents, the center, and also the child.
And I think there's a different way he can be with you at the same time.
Generally to run the training process.
Since anything that comes to us, whether it's an apprentice, a student, or a child,
This record contains his full personal information.
Even his monthly grades, for example, he has an evaluation every month.
We were responsible for the Minds program.
In every four sessions, there's a report.
Guardian through a password and username,
We gave it to him, can he access it?
Yes, he can see the level he has reached, from the moment he entered the center until now.
We have different models to see.
We have a daughter.
With Mr. Ibrahim who will join us later,
We see different models, I wish we had enough space.
But we're buying a model for a girl.
You run different tests before going on air.
We ask her math questions and various questions.
We'll take a short break and then we'll be back with you to see this smart one, so stay tuned.
The actor's performance, the audience is very smart now.
If there's a show he's been watching from the beginning or the second or third episode, and if he feels like he's not interested in the show, he'll use the remote.
He won't bother, he has twenty thousand other series.
Correct, twenty thousand series, yes indeed.
Twenty thousand episodes with people who can't focus on one job.
He can see other people's work.
Correct, this is the majority.
He says he only watches TV during Ramadan.
Of course, we welcome you as our dear, honorable, and esteemed guest, Sharif Abdul Hamid Sharshani.
Do you want to say something to the viewers, or to your fans who love you? Of course, I'm one of your fans.
Do you want to say something?
And I say to them, "May it be a recurring event for you."
It's true that we don't go out much, don't appear much, don't do the thing much for the reason, I mentioned the reason before.
Next time will be better.
Insha'Allah, we wish you all the best in your endeavors this year.
God willing, we'll have another meeting with you to discuss these fields.
Everything leads to the other.
Because fashion shows are very popular among many people and are anticipated by trend enthusiasts.
Welcome, dear viewers, to our live broadcast from Doha in the morning.
Of course, today we're talking about the Skills Development Center and a group of students who were enrolled in this center.
This center offers a range of different sciences.
Of course they focus on developing the other ability.
And also to keep them fully occupied.
Ms. Nesma and Mr. Ayman Khalegly are the CEO of the Skills Development Center.
Hello and good morning.
Welcome to our place.
And with us is the beautiful Omonia, good morning, Omonia.
Good morning.
How old are you, my age?
I am in the seventh grade.
Masha'Allah, Tabarak Allah, we wish you all the best.
What things have we provided for our sons and daughters?
This was clarified with Mr. Ayman and Ms. Nesma, and it was specifically directed towards the benefit of the children, our children.
Which is the MindMaths program for mental mathematics.
By fingers and abacus.
To achieve certain goals, we tried to illustrate a simple part of them.
I felt, Professor Ibrahim, that there really is a difference in the student in the first two days of his.
And after he finishes in three or four months?
If it were taught in public, private, or even independent schools,
Basically, the program scientifically works on certain methods.
After completing the first level of the program,
Any program that reveals missing capabilities or the need to continue developing them.
Has it reached a certain level or what updates have been made to the child?
We work in a scientific way, on a scientific program.
Not all methods and mechanisms are applied in a regular way;
But in a scientific, systematic way.
Before the start of the program and after taking this course or the levels beyond it.
Mr. Ibrahim is with us now, as you can see, viewers. Amnia is one of the students who joined this center.
We wanted to bring you this live broadcast today to show our viewers the importance of this.
If you return the coat, I have no objection.
So this is a very fast clip and a very small part of a classification series, and we'll be watching the second part of it.
But as we've seen, this part of the series is classified as Part 1.
Could you tell us a bit about your roles in the series "Tashneef," where each episode covers a different topic?
Focus this year on
Qafil Fadil
Who encourages by giving opportunities.
"It has sixteen episodes in two seasons."
He will be a director in an episode, an episode where there will be an old man and an episode where there will be a baker.
It's a collection of rings.
Mr. Ghanem Al-Sulaiti is from Qatar.
We have representatives from Qatar.
Many actors, I can't count them right now, but of course we have artists from Bahrain, for example, Zahra Arafat and Ibtesam Abdullah.
We have
Faisal Rashid and Mohammed Adel.
Tara, of course.
Without Tara, the young actors won't perform.
We currently have a bit of work in Qatar. There are two jobs per year.
Qatar TV still produces dramatic works, we can still say that it does?
Qatar TV provides an executive producer.
Qatar TV has done their part, but there's only so much they can do, and all Qatari actors want to work.
And that was the reason.
I replied to you. It's just one series, and all the actors in Qatar want to work on it.
It means that if someone finds a scene, they should thank God.
Praise be to God in all circumstances.
Okay, let's go back to your beginnings.
Of course, I'd like to thank him very much.
I consult him on various matters.
Of course, the actor Abdulaziz Jasem is from the series "Hukm Al Basher" after "Al Shatat" until yes or no.
In his plays, we started working with him in the theater when he became the first executive producer. Abdulaziz Jassim, we worked with him for television and theater.
He's the one who adopted us, taught us, and raised us.
Then Mr. Ghaniem delved into his life story, exerting his utmost effort in Fayez Al-Tosh 2000.
Because he gives us opportunities as young people.
They have thirty to thirty-two jobs a year.
We have two tasks a year, so thank you, thank you, Tara.
The killer feeling is also produced by Tara Arts.
The director of the series is Mr. Munir %PW.
We're back with you, our dear viewers, and today we're talking about reflexology.
The message is at the palm, the palm of the hand.
This treatment was indeed practiced, since ancient times.
We have a guest.
The inspection method is like the one coming.
There is swelling, the degree of pain.
You can feel inside the hand that there's something like sand or fragile veins inside the hand.
Loosen your grip.
My brother is a nervous wreck.
You feel pressured and have a bit of stress, stress.
Left.
And now, dear viewers, we are seeing the left side of the body.
So they know what we're doing.
Any health problem will be clear. We now know about his headaches and dizziness.
Is there any pain here?
Pain means trouble.
Problem! What does problem mean in this context?
In this case, pockets, ear.
He's sneezing, do you have a sinus problem or any problem before?
I had an operation, but it was a long time ago.
Is it a tumor or something?
His weight is increasing without him eating.
Okay, your left shoulder.
This is because of the nerves, when I told him he had nervous tension.
Ten years ago, he walked barefoot on the beach.
We know that when someone walks by the sea, they feel empty.
Any uneven ground, not just the sea.
Negative energy possible %PW.
And perhaps he was surprised that you discovered these things through massage.
Of course, the kids are the most important.
Kids, glorified be God, this is the mother's right, focus with me!
He is allergic to milk and the food they eat.
The child's headrest is adjustable and can be positioned parallel to her. It automatically adjusts to the child's height.
Close your eyes.
Just a little bit of pressure, thank God.
You'll find him in a few seconds, and the child will be happy. First, there will be pain because the pain is here.
Then you'll see the gases suddenly escape.
What are the discoveries that my brother Abdulaziz appears in?
But now people are suffering from fewer second-tier problems like joints, bones, headaches, thyroid, and obesity.
Second, regarding menstrual cramps or period pain in general.
You need to focus on a rock or stones by pressing here you give orders, praise be, to the lower back and menstrual problems if you have pain.
In seconds, God willing, it will disappear.
Pregnant
Delivery became easier for her.
O joy, O joy, and God knows best.
If they told her she might give birth on the seventh or the ninth.
Except on sand
If you walk on sand, it's fine, but if you walk on rocks, no.
You have to eat seven soft dates for breakfast, the soft ones are better.
If she doesn't have fresh dates, dried dates are enough.
As He, the Most High, said: "I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan. My discovery is from the Quran."
This means that Allah Almighty did not decree that these fresh dates would reach her, so He Almighty did not will it.
Praise be to Allah, and I seek refuge in Allah from the word 'I'.
You need to get a rock or small balls.
For example, if we forget and bring the bed sheets to the delivery bed, the clips will hold the sheets in place.
You'll notice in private hospitals, a lady from East Asia will come.
This is considered a practice in East Asia.
Whatever you need, you have my phone number.
Just the mobile!
In order to cooperate with each other, I advise everyone who is listening to me now.
Make charity a habit, and care for people. You are created to worship God, and then...
Serving people, that's the first thing. Second, I'm not a religious leader or a sheikh, I'm an ordinary man.
Father, I would like to thank you, Mr. Abdulaziz, for this wonderful interview, and thank you to our guest.
Thank you for coming, and I wish you success.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al Thani, Director of Public Health at the Supreme Council of Health, speaks more about the subject.
Good morning, Sheikh.
Let's start with a look at these activities.
A step in the right direction for Qatar.
Is he part of the national program for the treatment and control of obesity?
Almost four of the top countries in the world for obesity are Gulf states.
We have launched a strategy at the Supreme Council of Health, of course in collaboration with the Ministry of Education and other entities, to combat obesity.
Fearful of their spreading further and further soon
One of the programs that protect against obesity is Healthy Steps for Qatar.
We can organize this competition together to make it a global event.
The program consists of six weeks.
Every week is different from the next.
To make students in grades seven and eight aware of the health importance at this age,
Because this is the first stage where they start to feel themselves.
In the first week, as you remember, it was about what is your favorite fruit?
The second week went by.
You have to walk! The more you walk, the more points you get.
This is a map of Qatar, and every time someone earns points, they move forward with their school and class.
So there was a nice competition among the students.
In the second week, May drinks what we don't drink: soda.
We tell him to drink water, he doesn't need to drink soda every time he feels thirsty. Drink water!
Later, in the fourth week, your favorite sport.
At school games, some don't like them.
We're looking for a sport he loves.
So we can force him to exercise.
The boy eats a healthy meal.
His family knows that they need to make their son eat a healthy meal.
And Al Jazeera Academy is an academy for girls and boys, so we can.
Of course, this is an example, and with its success, God willing, we will gain more experience in the coming years.
The students are happy and feel more energetic.
We need more games, we're really bored with our friends.
The girls say their skin is better now, the pimples have decreased.
This is true, this is true and becomes consciousness.
Parents know about their children.
And a quarter of them are in second-year classes, asking them "How are you?" and learning from their peers.
Praise be to God, many schools are now eager to participate next year.
Inshallah.
Qatel was the official sponsor in supporting this.
We had the Aspire Zone, which provided sports competitions and awareness.
Great, great, great, great dining table.
So praise be to Allah; many aspects can be mentioned, some have been mentioned and others have been inadvertently omitted.
But praise be to God, everyone participated in part.
And the second, the brothers had prepared it in the form of separate lessons or a curriculum.
There was variety.
We tried to do different types and involve as many people as possible.
He is the generation of the future.
To roll out or publish this experience to the widest possible audience in Qatar.
When you come to evaluate, there's something you need to fix.
After it has now spread and there are satisfactory results,
God willing, we will spread because people ask us why we weren't inside.
You eat, you eat healthy food and you get to this, you don't have a problem.
The day we reach this age, the day he starts from a young age, he will achieve what he wants by the age of twenty or t
Happiness mentioned a set of titles; each set had a title.
If we return, we'll try to make our segment today about the conclusion of the activities.
Just to remind you again in our program, we had more than one guest.
Let's review and what were the weekly information points we wanted to convey to the student.
Okay, first of all, of course, the first week is your favorite fruit.
Every lesson was about fruits and their benefits.
What are the benefits of fruits that contain vitamin C?
So he started to like some fruits, not all fruits are his enemies.
He might be allergic to one or two, but why doesn't he eat the rest?
The second week is walking, people think that walking is only for the elderly and not for the young. Why don't children walk?
It means "When I grow up, I'll walk."
On the contrary, you walk because it soothes your heart and mind.
And it relaxes the individual, meaning the clarity of the mind improves.
The teacher took the students for a walk.
Yes, they all had to walk, whether at home or at school.
They earn their points through the class teacher.
I'm the one who walks it daily.
There was an event where people were holding a march; the girls' school was holding a march.
Their hearts love this, creativity with unique ideas.
The competitive spirit and teachers need to think outside the box; we don't want them to give them ideas that they have to follow.
Everyone has their skill in this area.
Of course, the third week is about drinking water. We constantly try to make them drink water so they don't feel thirsty and crave Pepsi билет билет билет
Of course, the fourth week is your favorite hobby.
If we could find out what his favorite sport is and support him in it,
He is interested in sports.
He loves sports by playing, he plays sports unconsciously.
We said a moment ago that we would talk about the Qatar Multiple Sclerosis Society.
Let me welcome our guest for today's episode who is with us in the studio.
Thank you.
We're glad to have you with us at this show.
And part of this disease that some of us may not have heard of.
Initially, as the Egyptians say, we go straight to the point.
This is a chronic disease.
What affects the nervous system in a person's body.
The duration ranges between twenty and forty years.
This disease is soft, with no treatment, and the cause of suffering from this disease is unknown.
It affects the active segment of society, which is usually the youth.
The treatment used by cancer patients, may God keep you away from all harm and all diseases.
This disease is an inflammation of the brain, cerebral nerves, and spinal nerves.
And what is the central nervous system in the human body?
The body assumes the entry of a foreign body into the body.
A neuron is
Cover this wire.
White blood cells start to kill or dissolve this protective layer.
Which leads to the absence, weakness, or disruption of the nerve signal.
May God spare us and you from paralysis.
No, despite the development and progress in medicine until now, there is no cure for this disease.
Okay, aside from the solution, we want to know how to get it out.
And then the person needs to have protection from this.
The main reason is life quality, food nature, or life cycles?
Or what exactly is the direct cause that makes a person suffer from this disease.
All we have now are just theories.
Even through marriage.
They are trying to solve human health problems.
Yes, yes.
All these topics can be somewhat controversial in society.
So far, I don't know their reasons.
Okay, what is the age group that may have this disease, multiple sclerosis?
Of both sexes.
Of course, after forty years, the disease starts to subside with the person.
So far, we haven't been able to find a cure for this disease.
Is this evidence of a large number of people in the Gulf, the Arab world, or let's talk about Qatar?
In Saudi Arabia, statistics indicate that they have twenty-five thousand cases.
And also Qatar.
Recently, just last week, they told me about three to four diagnosed cases.
Currently, we have one hundred and twenty-five patients registered in the files.
Many people, when afflicted with this disease, go to other countries for treatment.
Okay, Mr. Abdel Aziz, are there any effects like someone who got this disease?
Are there any signs that indicate to the patient's family or the patient themselves that they have multiple sclerosis?
For example, this virus is deadly.
We need to be clear about this, it's not a virus.
Because nerve disease, nerves control the whole body.
In attributing a specific reason to a particular place, the nature of the food, or the lifestyle.
