Jesus called a little child to him. He had him stand among them.
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."

"Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me."
But what if one of these little ones who believe in me were to be led into sin? If that were to happen, it would be better for that person to have a large millstone tied around their neck and be thrown into the depths of the sea.

If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or foot cut off, rather than to be thrown into the eternal fire of hell with both hands and feet intact. In hell, the fire never goes out.
If your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. The Parable of the Lost Sheep
"Be careful not to despise any of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven."
(.)
What do you think? Suppose a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them gets lost. Won't he leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go look for the one that is lost?
What I am about to tell you is true. If he finds that one sheep, he will be more glad about that one sheep than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off.
So it is with your Father in heaven. He does not want any of these little ones to be lost. If your brother sins against you...
If your brother sins against you, go to him and tell him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother back.
But what if he does not listen to you? Then take one or two others with you. The Bible says, "Every word of God is flawless; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him" (Proverbs 30:5).
But what if he refuses to listen even to the witnesses? Then tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church? Then treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
What I am about to tell you is true. What you bind on earth will be bound in heaven. What you loosen on earth will be loosened in heaven.
Again, I tell you, whatever two of you agree on earth concerning anything you ask, my Father in heaven will do it for you.
"Where two or three are gathered in my name, I am there among them." - The servant who did not show mercy.
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy times seven."
"The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants."
And as the king was about to begin, a man who owed him millions of dollars was brought before him.
The man was unable to pay. So his master gave an order. The man, his wife, children, and all that he had were to be sold to pay off his debt.
And the servant fell on his knees before him. "Give me time," he pleaded. "I'll pay everything back."
The lady felt sorry for him. She forgave him what he owed and let him go.
But then that servant went out and found one of the other servants who owed him a few dollars. He seized him and began to choke him, saying, "Pay me what you owe!"
And the other servant fell on his knees. "Give me some time," he begged. "I will repay you the money."
But the chief steward refused. Instead, he went and had the man put in prison, where he will remain until he pays back what he owes.
The other servants witnessed what happened. It disturbed them greatly. They went and told their master everything that had occurred.
Then the master called the first servant. He said to him, "Wicked servant, I forgave all that you owed me, because you asked me to."
Shouldn't you have shown mercy to the other servant, as I showed mercy to you?
So his master was angry and handed him over to the torturers, who punished him until he paid back all he owed.
Thus my Father in heaven will treat each one of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.
Jesus teaches about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
A great crowd followed him and he healed them there.
Some Pharisees came to test Jesus, asking, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus said, "Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
"They are no longer two, but one. Therefore, what God has joined together, let no one separate."
So they asked, "Why then did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce and send her away?"
Jesus answered, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning."
Here is what I tell you. Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery. A man is not permitted to divorce his wife unless she has been unfaithful to him.
The disciples said to him, "If this is the situation between husband and wife, it is better not to marry."
Jesus answered, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining single. Only those who are helped to live without marriage can accept it.
Some men are not able to father children because they were born that way. Some were made that way by others. Others have made themselves that way for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept living that way should do so." Little children were brought to Jesus.
Some people brought their little children to Jesus. They wanted him to place his hands on the children and pray for them. But the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he went from there. Jesus and the Rich Young Man
A man approached Jesus and asked him, "Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?"
Why do you ask me about what is good? Jesus answered. "No one is good but one, that is, God. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments."
"Which one?" the man asked. Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness."
Honor your father and your mother. (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) And "Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
The young man said, "I have kept all these commandments. What else shall I do?"
Jesus answered, "If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."
When the young man heard this, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven."
I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.
When the disciples heard this, they were utterly astonished and asked, "Who then can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Then Peter said to him, "We have left everything to follow you. What then will there be for us?"
Jesus said to them, "What I am about to tell you is true. When everything is made new, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. Then those who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
Everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.
But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.
The Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard
"The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard."
He agreed to pay them the usual wage for a full day's work. Then he sent them to his vineyard.
At around nine o'clock in the morning, he went out again. He saw others standing in the market square doing nothing.
And he said to them, You also go into my vineyard, and I will give you what is right.
So they went. "He went out again around noon and at three o'clock and did the same thing.
Around five o'clock he went out and found others standing around him. He asked them, "Why are you standing here all day doing nothing?"
"Because no one has hired us," they answered. He said to them, "You also go and work in my vineyard."
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, "Call the workers and give them their pay, starting with the last ones hired and going on to the first."
The hired workers arrived around five o'clock. Each received the usual daily wage.
When the first workers came, they thought they would receive more. But each of them also received the usual daily wage.
When they received it, they started complaining about the owner.
And they said, "These people who were hired worked only one hour." "You paid them the same as us. We did most of the work and were exposed to the scorching sun all day."
The owner replied to one of them, "My good man, I am dealing with you fairly. Didn't you agree to work for the usual daily wage?"
Take your money and leave. I want to pay the people I recently hired the same wage I paid you.
Don't I have the right to do as I please with my own money? Do you feel cheated because I gave generously to others?
"So the last will be first, and the first will be last." Jesus speaks again of his coming death.
Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. And on the way, he took the twelve disciples aside and began to speak to them.
He said, "We are going up to Jerusalem." "The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death."
"Then they will hand him over to people who are not Jews. They will mock him and whip him. They will crucify him on a cross. On the third day, he will rise from the dead!" A mother asks a favor of Jesus.
The mother of Zebedee's sons came to Jesus with her sons. She knelt down and asked him for something.
Jesus asked, "What do you want?" She said, "Promise me that one of my two sons will sit at your right hand in your kingdom. Promise me that the other will sit at your left."
Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking." "Can you drink the cup that I am about to drink?" They answered, "We can."
Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, you will drink from my cup; but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The other ten pupils heard about it. They were angry with the brothers.
Jesus called them together and said, "You know that the rulers in the Gentile world lord it over their people, and their high officials exercise power over them.
Do not be like this. Instead, whoever among you wants to be great must be your servant.
And whoever wants to be first among you must be your servant.
"Be like the Son of Man. He did not come to be served, but to serve others. He came to give his life as a ransom for many." Two blind men regain their sight.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, and a large crowd was following him.
Two blind men were sitting by the roadside. They heard that Jesus was passing by. They cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"
The crowd ordered them to stop. They told them to be quiet. But the two men shouted even louder, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stopped and called them, saying, "What do you want me to do for you?" He asked.
"Sir," they answered, "we want to be able to see."
Jesus felt deep compassion for them. He touched their eyes. Then they could see. And they followed him.
Jesus' Entry into Jerusalem
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples ahead.
He said to them, "Go to the village ahead of you. There you will find a donkey and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone says anything to you, say, "The Lord has need of them. The owner will send them immediately."
This happened to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet. He said,
"Say to the city of Zion, 'Your king comes to you. He is humble and riding on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.'" (Zechariah 9:9)
The disciples went and did what Jesus commanded them.
They brought the donkey and the colt, laid their clothes on them, and Jesus sat on the clothes.
A very large crowd stood by the roadside, some of them throwing off their cloaks and spreading them on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and strewed them on the way.
Some spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. They shouted, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up. The people asked, "Who is this?"
The crowd answered, "This is Jesus the prophet, from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus cleanses the temple.
Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations.' (Isaiah 56:7) But you have made it a 'den of robbers.' (Jeremiah 7:11)"
And they came to Jesus in the temple, blind and lame, and he healed them there.
The chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the miracles he did and were amazed. They asked, "Who is this man who does such things?" And they said, "He is the Christ, the Savior of the world."
"Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. And Jesus said to them, "Yes. Have you never read, 'Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise'?" (Psalm 8:2)
Then Jesus left the crowds and went away from the town to Beth’any, and he spent the night there. Withering of the fig tree
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the roadside. He climbed it but found nothing on it but leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit!" Immediately the fig tree withered.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed and asked, "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?"
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
"If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer." Jesus' authority is questioned.
Jesus entered the temple courts. While he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and said, "By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered, "I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
"Where did John's baptism come from? Was it from heaven, or from men?" And they argued among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Then why did you not believe him?'"
But what if we say, "of men"? We fear people. Everyone thought that John was a prophet.
So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." And Jesus said to them, "Then I will not tell you by what authority I do these things. The story of the two sons.
What do you think of this? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, "Son, go and work today in the vineyard."
The son said, "I won't do it." But he changed his mind later and went.
Then the father went to the other son. He said the same thing to him. The son answered, "I will, sir." But he did not go.
Which of the two sons did what his father wanted?" "The first," they answered. Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you.
John came to show you the right way to live. And you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. You saw this. But even then you did not turn away from your sins and believe him. Parable of the Tenants
Listen to another parable. A man had a vineyard, and he planted it with vines; he built a wall around it, dug a winepress in it, and built a tower in it. Then he leased it to tenants and went to another country.
And when the time of the harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, saying, Gather ye together my fruits.
But the tenants seized his servants, beating one, killing another, and stoning the third to death.
Then the landowner sent other slaves to the farmers, and he sent more than he had sent the first time. But the farmers treated them the same way.
Finally, he sent his son to them, saying, "They will respect my son."
But the tenants saw the son coming. They said to each other, "This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours."
So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
When the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do to these tenants?
"Those evil men will be destroyed," they answered. "Then the vineyard will be leased to other tenants, who will give the owner his share of the produce at harvest time."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
So I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a people who will bear its fruit.
"And whoever falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but the stone that falls on anyone will crush him."
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' stories. They knew he was talking about them.
So they looked for a way to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowd; for the people held that Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Story
Jesus told them more parables. He said:
The kingdom of heaven is like this: A king prepared a wedding feast for his son.
He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the dinner. And the servants said to them, "Come." But they refused.
Then he sent out other slaves, saying, "Tell those who are invited, 'Behold, I have prepared my banquet, my oxen and fattened cattle are killed, and everything is ready; come to the wedding feast.'"
But people paid no attention. One went to his field, and another to his work.
The rest seized his servants, abused them, and killed them.
The king was furious. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed the murderers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants, "The wedding feast is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come.
Go to the crossroads. Invite to dinner everyone you can find.
So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad. And the wedding hall was filled with guests.
King entered to see the guests. He noticed a man there not wearing wedding clothes.
My friend asked: "How did you get in here without your wedding clothes?" The man couldn't think of anything to say.
Then the king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet. Cast him outside into the darkness. There he will weep and gnash his teeth."
Many are called, but few are chosen. As for paying taxes to Caesar, the original text does not contain a direct question on this subject. However, it can be inferred that the question concerns the legality or morality of paying taxes to the ruling authority, represented by "Caesar" in this historical context.
And the Pharisees went out, and immediately held a council against Jesus, to put him to death.
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. They said, "Teacher, we know that you are honest and teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't partial to anyone, and you teach the way of God righteously. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? Should we pay them, or should we not?"
"So, tell us, what do you think? Is it right to pay the tax to Caesar, or not?"
But Jesus knew their wicked plans. He said, "You hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the currency that people use to pay taxes. They brought out a silver coin.
He asked them, "Whose picture is this? And whose words are these?"
"Caesar," they replied. Then he said to them, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's."
When they heard this, they were amazed. They left him and went away. Marriage at the resurrection.
On that day, the Sadducees came to Jesus and asked him. They do not believe that people rise from the dead.
"Teacher," they said, "this is what Moses told us. If a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow. He must father children to carry on his brother's name."
There were seven of us brothers. The first one got married and died, leaving no children, so he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened to the second and third brothers. It happened right up to the seventh brother.
Finally, the woman died.
Now, when the dead rise, whose wife will she be? For all seven of them were married to her."
Jesus answered, "You are wrong, because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God.
When the dead are raised, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage. They will be like the angels in heaven.
What about the resurrection of the dead? Haven't you read what God has said to you?
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." (Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching. The great commandment.
The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees had been unable to answer Jesus. So the Pharisees gathered together.
One of the lawyers asked him a question to test him.
"Teacher," he asked, "which is the greatest commandment in the law?"
Jesus answered, " 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' (Deuteronomy 6:5)"
This is the first and most important commandment.
The second is like it: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"All things written in the Law and the Prophets depend on these two commandments." "Who is the son of Christ?"
And the Pharisees gathered together, and Jesus asked them,
What do you think about Christ? Whose son is he? "The son of David," they answered.
He said to them, "Then why does David call him 'Lord'? The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. David said,
The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool." (Psalm 110:1)
"So if David calls him 'Lord,' how can he be his son?"
No one could answer him with a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him any more questions.
Jesus' condemnation of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law
Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples.
He said, "The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat."
So you must obey them. Do everything they tell you to do. But don't do what they do. They don't practice what they preach.
They tie heavy loads and place them on others' shoulders. But they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them.
Everything they do, they do it for others to see. On their foreheads and arms, they wear small boxes containing verses from the Bible. They make the boxes very wide. And they make the tassels on their coats very long.
They love to sit in places of honor at banquets. They also love to have the most important seats in temples.
They love to be greeted in the markets. They love it when people call them "Rabbi."
But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers.
Do not call anyone on earth 'father,' for you have one Father, who is in heaven.
You should not be called 'teacher,' for you have one teacher, the Christ.
The most important person among you will be your servant.
Whoever rises, falls, and whoever falls, rises.
How terrible it will be for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven; you yourselves do not enter, and you hinder those who are trying to enter.
(.)
"How severe are you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You travel long distances to persuade one person to your religion, and then make him unclean like yourselves, nay, twice as unclean as you are!"
How great is your affliction, O blind guides! You say, "Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is obligated to fulfill his oath."
You are blind and foolish! Which is more important? Is it gold? Or is it the structure that makes gold sacred?
You also say, "If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing. But if anyone swears by the gift that is on it, he is bound by his oath."
O ye blind ones! Which is greater? Is it the gift? Or is it the altar that makes the gift holy?
Therefore, whoever swears by the altar swears by the altar and by everything on it.
And whoever swears by the altar, swears by the altar and by everything that is on it.
And whoever swears by the name of the sky, he indeed swears by the throne of Allah and by Him Who is on it.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin—but you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former."
O you blind leaders! Who strain out the gnat but swallow the camel.
How great is your hypocrisy, scribes and Pharisees, you snakes' children! You whitewashed tombs! You clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside they are full of all kinds of greed. You only want to satisfy yourselves.
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean.
How terrible it will be for you teachers of the law and for the Pharisees! You hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs—beautiful on the outside but filled on the inside with dead people’s bones and all sorts of impurity.
It's the same with you. From the outside, you appear to be doing the right thing. But inside, you are full of wrong. You pretend to be what you are not.
How terrible this doom is, O teachers of the law and Pharisees! You make the outside appear beautiful: the tombs of the prophets and their adorned corners.
And you say, "If only we had been in the days of those who passed away before us, we would not have been like them, and we would not have aided in the killing of the prophets."
"So you bear witness against yourselves that you acknowledge yourselves to be the children of those who killed the prophets."
"So complete the wrongdoings of those who were before you!"
O nest of venomous snakes! How will you flee from the judgment of the fire of Hell?
Therefore I send you prophets, wise men, and teachers. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues, and drive them from city to city.
Then you will pay for the blood of all the righteous that has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
What I am about to tell you is true. All this will happen to those who are living now.
O Jerusalem! O Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I wanted to gather your children, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings! But you were not willing!
Look, your house is left empty.
"I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.' " (Psalm 118:26)
End marks
So Jesus left the temple and was going away when his disciples came to point out to him the buildings of the temple.
"Do you see all these things?" asked Jesus. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. Then the disciples came to him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end of the age?"
Jesus answered, "Watch out! Be on your guard against deceit.
Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ!' and will deceive many.
You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. You will also hear people talking about future wars. Do not be terrified. These things must happen, but the end is not yet.
Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in many places.
All these are the beginnings of labor.
Then they will hand you over to be tortured and killed. All nations will hate you because of me.
At that time, many will fall away from their faith. They will hate each other, and hand each other over to their enemies.
Many false prophets will arise. They will deceive many people.
For evil will grow, and the love of most people will grow cold.
But whoever endures to the end will be saved.
"And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached throughout the whole world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."
The prophet Daniel spoke of the "abomination that causes desolation." (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11) One day you will see it standing in the holy place. The reader must understand this.
Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains.
No one is to go down from the roof to their house to get anything.
No one in the field should go back to get their coat.
Woe to the pregnant women in those days! Woe to the nursing mothers!
I hope you won't have to flee in winter or on a Saturday.
There will be terrible suffering in those days, worse than anything since the beginning of the world until now, and never to be matched again.
If time were not shortened, no one would be saved. But for the sake of God's chosen people, time will be shortened.
At that time, someone may say to you, "Look! Here is the Christ!" or, "There he is!" Do not believe it.
False Christs and false prophets will arise, and they will show great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if possible, the elect of God.
See, I told you so.
So, if someone tells you, "It's too far out in the desert," don't go there. Or if someone says, "It's deep inside the house," don't believe it.
For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.
Vultures will gather wherever there is a lifeless corpse.
"Immediately after the terrible suffering of those days, 'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will be shaken.' (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)"
At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory.
He will send His angels with a loud trumpet call. They will gather His chosen people from the four corners of the earth. They will bring them from one end of the heavens to the other.
"Fig trees! When their branches become tender and their leaves come out, you know that summer is near."
In the same way, when you see all these things happening, you know that the end is near. It's right at the door.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. The people who live in that time will certainly not die until all these things happen.
"Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. No one knows about that day or hour."
No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven know. The Son doesn't know, only the Father knows.
Remember how it was in the days of Noah. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking. They were marrying. They were giving their daughters in marriage. They did all these things until the day Noah entered the ark.
They knew nothing about what was going to happen until the flood came and took them all. So will it be when the Son of Man comes.
There will be two men in the field. One will be taken and the other left.
Two women grinding at the mill. One is taken and the other is left.
"So wait, indeed we too are waiting. The command of Allah has come, so do not seek to hasten it."
You must understand something. Suppose the homeowner knew at what time of night the thief was coming. Then he would have stayed alert. He wouldn't have allowed his home to be broken into.
Therefore you also must be ready, for at an hour you do not expect, the Son of Man is coming.
Let's assume that a master entrusted one of his servants to oversee the rest of the servants in his house. The servant's task is to provide them with food at the right time. The master wants a faithful and wise servant for this purpose.
It would be good for the servant if the master found him doing his work when the master returns.
What I am about to tell you is true. The master will put that servant in charge of all he possesses.
But let's suppose that servant is evil. Let's suppose he says to himself: "My master will be away for a long time."
Let's assume he started beating other servants. Let's assume he eats and drinks with those who overindulge.
And the master of that servant will come on a day when the servant does not expect him, and will return at an hour when the servant does not know.
Then the master will tear it to pieces and send it to the place where the claimants go. There, people will wail and click their tongues.
The Story of Ten Bridesmaids
"This is what the kingdom of heaven will be like at that time. Ten virgins took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom."
Five of them were fools. Five were wise.
The fools took their lamps, but they did not take olive oil with them.
The wise took the oil in jars with their lamps.
The groom didn't come for a long time. So all the bridesmaids got tired and fell asleep.
At midnight, someone shouted: "Here comes the bridegroom! Go out to meet him!"
Then all the bride's maids awoke and trimmed their lamps.
The fools said to the wise: Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are about to go out.
" 'No,' they replied. 'There may not be enough for all of us. Instead, go to those who sell oil. Buy some for yourselves.'"
So they went to buy oil. And while they were going, the bridegroom came; and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast; and the door was shut.
Later, the other bridesmaids also came. "Sir! Sir!" they said. "Open the door for us!"
He replied, "What I'm about to tell you is true. I don't know you."
"Therefore you must be ready, because you do not know the hour when your Lord is coming." - The Parable of the Three Slaves
And again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a king, which went to travel into a far country: And called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.
He gave $10,000 to one. He gave $4,000 to another. He gave $2,000 to the third. The man gave each servant the amount of money he knew the servant could handle. Then he went on his journey.
The servant who received ten thousand dollars immediately went and invested his money. He made another ten thousand dollars.
Whoever got $4000, earned an additional $4000.
As for the man who received $2000, he went and dug a hole in the ground. He hid his master's money in it.
After a long time, the master of those servants returned. He wanted to gather all the money they had made.
The man who received $10,000 brought the other $10,000. He said, "Sir, you trusted me with $10,000. Look, I've made another $10,000."
His master replied, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!"
"The man who was carrying $4000 also came. He said, 'Sir, you trusted me and gave me $4000. Look, I have made another $4000.'"
His master replied, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!"
Then the man who had received the two thousand dollars came. "Sir," he said, "I knew you were a hard man. You reap where you did not sow. You gather crops where you did not scatter seed."
I was afraid. I went out and buried your two thousand dollars in the ground. See, this is what belongs to you.
Then his master answered and said to him, 'You wicked and lazy servant! Did you not know that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed?
Alright then, you should have put my money in the bank. When I return, I'll take it back with interest.
Then the master commanded the other servants, "Take 2000 dollars from him and give it to the one who has 20,000 dollars.
And every man to whom much is given, of him shall much be required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more. What then is that servant, which has not his lord's goods committed to him? And his lord, when he shall come, shall recompense him according to his deeds.
"Throw that wretched servant out. Out there in the darkness, people will weep and gnash their teeth." Sheep and goats.
The Son of Man will come in his glory, and all the angels with him. Then he will sit on his glorious throne.
All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate people into two groups, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
He will put the sheep on his right hand and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.'
I was hungry. And you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty. And you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger. And you invited me in.
I needed clothes. And you provided them for me. I was sick. And you took care of me. I was in prison. And you came to visit me.
Then the righteous will answer him, saying: 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you? Or thirsty and give you drink?'
When did we see you a stranger and invite you? When did we see you in need of clothes and give them to you?
When did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?
The king will answer: "What I am about to tell you is the truth. Whatever you have done for one of these least brothers of mine, you have done for me."
Then he will say to those on his left, "Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
I was hungry. But you gave me nothing to eat. I was thirsty. But you gave me nothing to drink.
I was a stranger, and you did not invite me in. I needed clothes, but you did not give me any. I was sick and in prison, but you did not take care of me.
They will also say: "Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty and did not help you? When did we see you as a stranger or in need of clothes or sick or in prison and did not help you?"
He will answer, "What I am about to tell you is true. Anything you did not do for one of these least ones, you did not do for me."
Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but those who have done right will receive eternal life.
Plan to kill Jesus
Jesus said all these things. Then he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified.
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, Caiaphas.
They made a plan to arrest Jesus in a clever way. They wanted to kill him.
"But not during the feast," they said, "lest the people should be stirred up." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in the house of Simon, who had a skin disease.
And a woman came to Jesus with an alabaster flask of very expensive ointment from the nard. She broke the flask and poured the ointment on his head as he was reclining at table.
When the disciples saw this, they were indignant and asked, "Why this waste?"
The perfume could have been sold at a high price. The money could have been given to the poor.
Jesus knew this. He said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a good deed to me."
You will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.
I poured perfume over my body in preparation for my burial.
What I am about to tell you is true. What I have done will be told wherever this good news is preached throughout the world, to the memory of her." Judas agrees to hand over Jesus.
One of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests.
He asked, "What will you give me if I deliver Jesus to you?" They paid him thirty pieces of silver.
From that time on, Judas watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. The Last Supper
And the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread came, and the disciples approached Jesus and said to him, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
He replied, "Go to the town to that man, and say to him, 'The teacher says, 'My time is near. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.'"
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover.
In the evening, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve.
While they were eating, he said, "It is surely incumbent upon me. One of you will hand me over to my enemy."
And the disciples were exceedingly sorrowful. One by one, they said to him, "Is it I, Lord?"
Jesus answered, "He it is to whom I will give a sop, when I have dipped it."
"The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. Woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born."
It was Judas who would betray him. He said, "Not me, Teacher, is it?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is you."
While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take this and eat it. This is my body."
Then he took the cup, gave thanks, and offered it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you."
This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
This is what I tell you. From now on, I will not drink wine with you until the day I drink it with you in my Father's kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said, "Peter will deny me."
Jesus said to them, "This very night, you will all fall away because of me. For it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered abroad.' (Zechariah 13:7)
But after I am raised from the dead, I will go before you to Galilee."
Peter replied, "Others might leave because of you. But I will never do that."
Jesus answered, "Verily I say unto you, This very night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice."
But Peter said, "Even if I must die with you, I will never say I don't know you." And all the others said the same. Jesus prayed in Gethsemane.
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there to pray."
He took Peter and the sons of Zebedee with him. And he began to be sorrowful and very troubled.
Then he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and watch with me."
He went a little farther. Then he fell on his face and prayed, saying, "Abba, Father, all things are possible to you; remove this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will."
Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter, "So, could you not watch with me for one hour?" Then he went away again and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not as I will, but as you will." And coming, he found them sleeping again, for their eyes were heavy.
Watch and pray. Then you will not fall into sin when tempted. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
And Jesus went away again and prayed, saying, "Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; but if not, let it be as you wish."
Then he returned. He found them sleeping again. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
So he left them and went away again. And a third time he prayed, saying the same thing.
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners."
"Rise up! Here he is!" So the soldiers arrested Jesus.
As Jesus was speaking, Judas arrived. He was one of the twelve. A large crowd was with him, carrying swords and clubs. The chief priests and the elders of the people had sent them.
Judas, who would betray Jesus, had arranged a signal with them. "The one I kiss is the man," he said. "Seize him."
So Judas went to Jesus immediately and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you are here to do." Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' disciples reached for his sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
Jesus said to him, "Put your sword away, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you think I can't ask my father for help? He'll immediately send an army of over 70,000 angels.
But how, then, will the prophecies be fulfilled? They say it must happen this way.
At that time, Jesus said to the crowds, "Am I leading a band of armed men against you?" he asked them. "Why did you not arrest me when I was in the temple courts every day teaching? You did not lay a hand on me."
"But this was to fulfill the words of the prophets." Then all the disciples left him and fled. Jesus is taken to the Sanhedrin.
Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
It was not far, so Peter followed Jesus. He went straight to the high priest's courtyard. He entered and sat down with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the whole council were looking for false evidence against Jesus, so that they could put him to death, for they were afraid of the people.
But they found no evidence, although many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two other witnesses stepped up.
They said, "This man said, 'I can destroy the temple of God, and in three days build it again.'"
Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Do you not answer anything? What is it that these men testify against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us: Are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
"Yes," Jesus answered, "it is just as you say. But I tell you all, in the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Almighty and coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has blasphemed! Why do we need any more witnesses? You have heard the blasphemy with your own ears!"
"What do you think?" "He must die!" they answered.
Then they spat in his face. They struck him with their fists. Others slapped him.
They said, "Prophesy to us, Christ! Who hit you?" Peter said he did not know Jesus.
And Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant-girl came to him and said, "You also were with Jesus the Galilean."
But before them all, Peter said that he was not. "I do not know what you are talking about," he said.
Then he went out to the gate leading to the courtyard. And there another woman saw him, and she said to the people, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
He said again that he wasn't. He swore, saying, "I don't know the man!"
After a little while, those who stood by came up to Peter and said to him, "Surely you are one of them, for your accent betrays you."
Then Peter began to curse and swear, "I do not know this man!" And immediately a rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him. "The rooster will crow," Jesus had told him. "Before it crows, you will deny me three times." Peter went outside and wept bitterly.
Judas hangs himself.
It was early in the morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to kill Jesus.
They bound him and led him away, and handed him over to Pilate, the governor.
Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned to death. He felt deep shame and remorse for what he had done. So, he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
He said, "I have sinned, for I have delivered an innocent man." They answered, "What is that to us? That is your problem."
So Judas threw the silver into the temple and left, and went away and hanged himself.
The high priests picked up the coins. They said, "It is against the law to put this money in the temple treasury. It is blood money. It was paid for the death of a man."
So they decided to use the money to buy a potter's field. People from other countries will be buried there.
That's why it's still called "Blood Square" to this day.
Then was fulfilled the word of the Lord spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him who was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value,
"And they took the money and bought the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me." (Zechariah 11:12, 13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) Bringing Jesus to Pilate
Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "You say so."
But when the chief priests and elders brought charges against him, he did not answer.
Then Pilate asked him, "Do you not hear the accusation they are making against you?"
But Jesus made no answer to any of the charges, to the governor's great astonishment.
It was the governor's custom at the Passover feast to release one prisoner chosen by the people.
At that time they had a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.
So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Which one do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Messiah?"
Pilate learned that the leaders were jealous. He knew that was why they had handed Jesus over to him.
While Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message saying, "Have nothing to do with this righteous man, for I have suffered greatly in a dream because of him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to kill Jesus.
"Which one do you want me to release for you?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered.
"What shall I do then with Jesus who is called Christ?" asked Pilate. And they all answered, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What evil has he done?" asked Pilate. But they cried out all the more, "Crucify him!"
Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere. Instead, the crowd began to get angry. So he took water and washed his hands in front of them. "I am innocent of this man's death," he said. "You are responsible!"
Then all the people answered and said, "We accept the guilt of his blood upon ourselves and upon our children!"
Pilate released Barabbas. But he had Jesus whipped. Then he handed him over to be crucified on a cross. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
The governor's soldiers took Jesus into the palace, which was called the Praetorium. All the rest of the soldiers gathered around him.
They stripped him and put a purple robe on him.
Then they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt in front of him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!"
They spat on him. They hit him on the head with a stick repeatedly.
And after they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him. Jesus is crucified.
As they led him away, they seized Simon of Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, and put the cross on him to carry behind Jesus.
They came to a place called Golgotha, which means the place of the skull.
There they mixed wine with bitter spices and offered it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it.
And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots.
They sat and watched him there.
Above his head they placed the written charge: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
And with him were two thieves, one on his right and the other on his left.
And those who passed by derided Jesus, and mocked him. They shook their heads
He said, "So you are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days? Save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"
In the same way, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders mocked him.
"He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
He trusts in God. Let God deliver him now, if he wants him. He is the one who said, "I am the Son of God."
In the same way, the two criminals who were crucified with Jesus also mocked him. The death of Jesus.
From noon until three, the whole earth was covered in darkness.
Around the ninth hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" that is, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of those who stood there heard Jesus crying out, and they said, "He is calling Elijah."
And one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with vinegar, put it on a reed, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
So the rest said, "Let him alone, Lord, to see if Elijah will come to save him."
After Jesus cried out loudly again, he died.
At that moment, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. The earth shook. The rocks split.
The graves were opened. Many of the holy people who had died were raised to life.
And they came out of the graves. And after Jesus was raised from the dead, they entered the holy city. And there they appeared to many people.
The centurion and those who were guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and all that had happened, were terrified and said, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
And there were many women there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to minister to him.
And Mary Magdalene was there. And Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee, were also there. They buried Jesus.
And when the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathia, named Joseph, who also had been Jesus' disciple.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. So Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
He placed him in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. Then he rolled a large stone in front of the entrance to the tomb. Then he went away.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The guards at the tomb.
And the next day was the day after the Preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
"Sir," they said, "we remember something that liar said while he was still alive. He claimed, 'In three days I will rise again.'"
So, give the order to secure the tomb until the third day. If you don't, his disciples might come and steal the body, and then they'll tell people that Jesus has risen from the dead. That last lie will be worse than the first one.
"Take some guards with you," Pilate answered. "Go. Make the tomb as secure as you can."
So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting guards.
The resurrection of Jesus from the dead.
Now when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene and Mary the other, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint him.
A strong earthquake occurred. An angel of the Lord came down from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled away the stone and sat on it.
His body shone like lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so terrified of him that they trembled and turned pale.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified."
Not here! He has risen, just as he said he would! Come and see the place where he was lying.
Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you."
So they ran from the tomb, filled with fear and great joy, and hurried to tell the disciples what they had seen.
Then Jesus met them and said, "Greetings!" They came up, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me." The guards reported this to the chief priests.
And as they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and showed to the chief priests all the things that were done.
When the chief priests and scribes met with the elders, they plotted and gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
So they said to the soldiers, "Say, 'His disciples came by night and stole him while we were asleep.'"
If the governor hears about this report, we'll pay him a bribe. That'll keep you out of trouble.
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. These were the final commands Jesus gave to his disciples.
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw it, they worshiped it, but some of them remained doubtful.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And be sure that I am with you always, to the end."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
In ancient times, the prophet Isaiah wrote: "Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you. A voice cries out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.'" (Malachi 3:1)
"A voice cries out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
Then John came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, and saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!" For this is he who was spoken of by
All the people of the Judean countryside and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem went out to him, and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins.
John wore clothes made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
"This is what John the Baptist preached: 'After me comes one more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.' "
"I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." Jesus is baptized and tempted.
At that time, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
And when he came up out of the water, immediately the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him.
Suddenly a voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Immediately the Spirit drove Jesus out into the wilderness.
He was in the wilderness forty days, and was tempted by Satan. The wild beasts did not hurt Jesus. The angels took care of him. Jesus chooses the first disciples
After John was put in prison, Jesus went to Galilee. He proclaimed the good news of God.
He said, "The time is fulfilled. The kingdom of God is at hand. Repent of your sins and believe in the gospel!"
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting their net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said, "Come, follow me." "I will make you fishers of men."
Immediately they left their nets and followed him.
Then Jesus walked a little further. As he was walking, he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat preparing their nets.
And immediately he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after Jesus. And they came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gerasenes. And when Jesus was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit.
Jesus and those with him went to Capernaum. And when the Sabbath came, he entered the synagogue and began to teach.
And the multitudes were astonished at His teaching, for He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
At that moment, a man in their midst cried out. He was possessed by an evil spirit. And he said,
What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!
Jesus said sternly, "Be quiet!" Then he said, "Come out of him!"
The man was violently shaken by the evil spirit. Then it left him with a scream.
And everyone was amazed at the power of his teaching, and they said, "What is this? A new teaching with such authority! He even gives orders to unclean spirits, and they obey him."
The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
So Jesus and those with him left the synagogue and went immediately with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed with a fever, and they told Jesus about her.
So he went to her, took her hand, and helped her up. The fever left her, and she began to serve them.
That evening, after sunset, they brought to Jesus all who were sick and those possessed by demons.
All the townsfolk gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many of them. They were all sick. He also cast out many demons. But he would not let the demons speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prayed in a solitary place.
It was very early in the morning, and it was still dark. Jesus got up and left the house. He went to a place where he could be alone. And there he prayed.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they called out, "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus said, "Let us go somewhere else. I want to go to the neighboring towns. I must preach there too. For this purpose I have come."
So he went throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and casting out demons. Jesus heals a leper.
A man with leprosy came to Jesus, knelt down, and begged him. "If you are willing," he said, "you can make me clean."
Jesus was filled with deep compassion. He reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing to do it," he said. "Be made clean!"
So We did not allow any affair to prevail against him, except that We seized him with a punishment from Us.
Jesus rebuked him immediately and sternly warned the man.
"Don't tell anyone about this," he said. "Go and show yourself to the priest. Offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded. You will be a witness to the priest and the people that you are 'clean.'"
But that man went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news everywhere. So Jesus could no longer enter a town openly. He stayed outside in remote places, but people still came to him from everywhere.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk.
A few days later, Jesus again entered Capernaum, and the people heard that he had returned home.
A large crowd gathered, until there was no longer any room. There was also no room outside the door. Jesus preached the word to them.
Four of those who came were carrying a man who could not walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, letting down their mat, they lowered the man.
Jesus saw their faith. He said to the man, "Your sins are forgiven."
And there were some teachers of the law sitting there, thinking to themselves,
Why is this man speaking this way? He's saying something very evil! Only God can forgive sins!
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Why do you think these things?"
Which is easier to say to the paralytic: ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or ‘Stand up, take your mat and walk’?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus spoke to the man who couldn't walk.
He said, "I tell you," he said, "get up. Take your mat and go to your house."
The man rose to his feet and picked up his mat. Then he walked away while everyone watched. The whole crowd was amazed. They praised God and said, "We have never seen anything like this!" Jesus chooses Levi.
Jesus went out again beside the Sea of Galilee, and a great multitude came to him, so that he entered into a boat and sat; and all the multitude stood on the shore. He taught them many things in parables.
As Jesus was walking along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he told him, and Levi got up and followed him.
Later, Jesus was dining at the home of Levi. Many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples. They were part of the large crowd that followed Jesus.
And there were some teachers of the law who were Pharisees. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. So they approached and asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this and said to them, "It is not those who are healthy who need a doctor, but those who are sick. I did not come to call the righteous to repentance, but sinners." And they asked Jesus about fasting.
And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees were fasting. Then came to Jesus certain of them, saying, "Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast.
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them. On that day they will fast.
People do not patch a new piece of cloth onto old clothes. If they do, the new piece will tear away from the old one, making the tear worse.
"People do not put new wine in old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst the skins. The wine will be spilled, and the skins will be ruined. Instead, they put new wine in new wineskins." - Jesus, Lord of the Sabbath
On one of the Sabbath days, Jesus was walking through wheat fields with his disciples. The disciples began to pluck some of the heads of wheat.
Then the Pharisees said to Him, "Look, why are they doing what is evil on the Sabbath?"
He replied, "Have you never read what David did? He and his men were hungry. They needed food.
And it came to pass in the days of Abiathar the high priest, that David came to the house of God, and ate the showbread, which was forbidden to be eaten save of the priests, and gave also to his companions.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath also."
"So the Son of Man is Lord, even on the Sabbath."
Healing on Saturday
Jesus entered a synagogue another time, and there was a man there with a withered hand.
Some of the Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They were watching him closely. They wanted to see whether he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus spoke to the man with the weak and withered hand. "Stand up in front of everyone," he said.
Then Jesus asked them, "What does the law say we should do on the Sabbath? Should we do good or evil? Should we save a life or destroy one?" But they did not answer.
Jesus looked at them with anger. He was deeply disturbed because their hearts were hard. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus. And a large crowd followed him.
Jesus went to the Sea of Galilee with his disciples, and a great crowd from Galilee followed him.
The people heard about all that Jesus was doing. And many came to him, from Judea, from Jerusalem, and from the regions across the Jordan River, from the area around Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowd, Jesus told his disciples to get a small boat for him to use. This would prevent people from crowding around him.
Jesus healed many people. Therefore, the sick were pushing to touch him.
When the people who had evil spirits in them saw him, they fell down before him and shouted, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them to tell no one who he was. Jesus appoints the twelve apostles.
Jesus went up on a mountainside. He called to him those he wanted, and they came to him.
He appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles, to be with him, and to send them out to preach.
They will have authority to cast out demons.
Therefore Jesus appointed the twelve. Simon was one of them, and Jesus gave him the name Peter.
There were James son of Zebedee and his brother John. Jesus called them "Boanerges," which means "Sons of Thunder."
And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, and Andrew and Peter, and Philip and Bartholomew, and Thomas and Matthew, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot.
Judas Iscariot was also among them. He was the one who would later betray Jesus to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebul
Jesus entered a house. And again a large crowd gathered. It was so large that Jesus and his disciples could not even eat.
His family heard about this. So they went to take care of him. They said, "He has lost his mind."
And there were some teachers of the law there, who had come from Jerusalem. They said, "He has an impure spirit!" "It is by the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons, that he drives out demons."
Jesus called them and spoke to them in parables, saying, "How can Satan cast out Satan?"
If an angel were to fight a kingdom against itself, it could not stand.
If the family is divided, it cannot stand.
