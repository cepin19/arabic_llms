Jesus called a little child to him and put him among them.
Jesus said, "What I tell you now is the truth. You must change and become like little children. If you do not, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."

The children of the poor deserve this in my name.
But what about someone who is swimming in these waters where a large whale is suspended in the sea?

Don't believe your hand or its bad omens, and don't let your children follow you. You are inside the paradise's preciousness, alone. Instead of you, let them descend into the fire. The fire will consume them. The fire will burn them. The fire will scorch them.
"...Your eyes are the cause of your sin; pluck them out and throw them away. It would be better for you to enter heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the hell of affliction." - The Parable of the Lost Sheep
"...Don't underestimate any of these children... That's what I'm telling you... Their angels in heaven can at any time go and visit their father in heaven."
(.)
What do you think? Suppose a man has 100 sheep and one of them wanders away. Will he leave the 99 on the hills and go look for the one that wandered off?
What I'm about to tell you is true. If he finds that sheep, he'll be happier with it alone than with those hundred that didn't go.
There is nothing between me and your Father in heaven. He doesn't want even one of these little ones to be lost. When you do something wrong, He corrects you.
If your brother says something bad about you, don't take it to heart. Tell him why he did that and leave it between you two. Someone might be asking about you.
 "But what if he won't listen to you? Then take one or two others with you. Scripture says, 'Every matter must be proved by the words of two or three witnesses.' (Deuteronomy 19:15)  
But what if he refuses to listen even to the church? Then treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
What I'm going to tell you is true. What you've closed on earth will be closed in heaven, and what you've opened on earth will be opened in heaven.
Again, I tell you, if two of you on earth agree as to what they should ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
"Where are the three and the three that run in my name? I am with them." The servant who does not lie.
...Then Peter came to Jesus and asked him, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."
The queen of heaven is like a king, praise be
When the king started doing it, a man who owed him millions of dollars stood in his way.
...He was a man who couldn't pay his debt, so his master ordered that the man, his wife, and his children, along with all their possessions, be sold to pay off the debt.
"The card fell on its face in front of him. 'Give me time,' he begged. 'I'll give it all back to you.'"
...His master had mercy on him...and relieved him of the debt he owed...and let him go.
...But that servant ran away and met one of the other servants who owed him a few dollars. He grabbed him and began to choke him. "Pay me back what you owe me!" he said.
"...the other cheek fell on his knees...give me time...may God forgive...I'll refund your money."
But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and threw the man into prison until he could pay back all he owed.
They served others who saw what happened. This disturbed them a lot. They went and told their master everything that happened.
...Then the master called the first servant and he entered...and said to him, "Servant, you are wicked...I forgave you all that you owed me, because you begged me."
Why didn't you have mercy on the other servant as I had mercy on you?
With the sword, his master gave him to the executioner. He will be punished until he repays everything he owes.
This is how you should treat your heavenly Father: Forgive your brother or sister from the bottom of your heart.
Isa is teaching about divorce.
And when Jesus had ended these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan.
A large crowd followed him. He healed them.
They brought him some tricky questions to test him. They asked him, "Does Islamic law allow a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator 'made them male and female'?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "This is why a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife, and they will become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
"...there are no more two or one...that's why a man should not separate what God has joined."
They asked why Moses allowed a man to write a divorce letter to his wife and send it to her.
Jesus answered, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of heart, but from the beginning it was not so."
 Here is what I tell you. Anyone who divorces his wife and gets married to another woman commits adultery. A man may divorce his wife only if she has not been faithful to him."   
The student said to him, "If that's the case, it's better not to get married, but rather to be between a man and a woman."
Jesus answered, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining single. Only those who are given the grace to live without marriage can accept it."
Some men cannot be born again because they were born that way. Some were made that way by other people. Others were made that way to serve the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept living that way should do it." The children brought Jesus.
Some people brought little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray over them. But the disciples rebuked the people.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me. Do not hinder them. For the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
He laid his hands on them. Then he departed from there. Jesus and the rich young man.
A man came up to Jesus and asked him, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?"
"Why are you asking me about what is good?" Jesus answered. "There is only one who is good. If you want to enter the kingdom, do what is written in the commandments."
...The man Jesus said, "Do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not slander others."
'Honor your father and your mother.' (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) and 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' (Leviticus 19:18)
"I've heard all the commandments," the young man said. "Do I need to do anything else?"
...Jesus answered and said to him, "Go, sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."
When the young man heard this, he left sadly. He was very rich.
...Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven."
Again I tell you, it is harder for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.
When his disciples heard this, they were astonished. They said, "Then who can be saved?"
Jesus saw in them and told them. With people, this is impossible, but with God, all things are possible.
Peter answered him, "Lord, we have left everything and followed you. What then will we have?"
"...that which we are telling you now is the truth...Jesus said to them...when all things will be new...the Son of Man will sit on His glorious throne...and then you who have followed Me...will also sit on twelve thrones...and judge the twelve tribes of Israel."
Everyone who leaves their house without family or food is a human being deprived of life.
And the more who will be the first will be the last. And the more who will be the last will be the first.
The Story of the Workers in the Vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a man who was the owner of a field. He went out early in the morning to hire laborers to work in his vineyard.
He agreed to pay them the usual daily wage. Then he sent them to his vineyard.
With the break of dawn, he went out again. He saw some others standing in the market doing nothing.
He told them, "You too, go work in my vineyard, and I will pay you what is right."
And he walked. He went out again at noon and at three in the afternoon and did the same thing.
With the five, he found two others standing. He asked them why they were standing here all day doing nothing.
"Until no one remains," they answered. He told them, "Even you, go work in my vineyard."
As soon as he arrived in the evening, the master of generosity spoke to the person in charge of the workers. He said, "Call the workers and give them their wages. Start with those whose service I received last. Then go to the first."
The workers who worked with the five came. Each one received the usual daily wage.
When the first two he had hired came, they expected to receive more. But each of them also received the usual daily wage.
As soon as they received it, they started complaining to the owner.
"...Those people who came last time only worked for one hour...You paid them the same as us...We did most of the work and stayed in the scorching sun all day."
...He answered the shop owner...and said to him...My friend...I'm doing you a favor...You agreed to work the whole day...for the regular daily wage.
Tighten your belt. I wanted to give the people who worked for me recently the same pay I gave you.
Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Do you feel cheated because I've been generous to others?
Those who come last will come first, and those who come first will come last. Isa speaks again about his death that is coming.
Jesus was going up to Jerusalem...And on the way...He took the twelve disciples aside...After a little while...He spoke to them.
"...we are going up to Jerusalem...there the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law...and they will condemn him to death."
"...they will hand him over to a group of people who are not Jews. The people will mock him and beat him. They will crucify him on a cross. And on the third day, he will rise from the dead!" Is the mother asking Jesus for something?
...The mother of the Zbidis came to our master...she came with her children...she sat on her knees...she asked him for something.
Jesus said to her, "What do you want from me, woman?" She replied, "I have a promise from you." He said, "One of your sons will take your place, and your son-in-law will take your place."
"...You do not know what you are asking..." Jesus said. "...Can you drink the cup I am about to drink?" They answered, "We can."
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but I do not have the authority to say who will sit at my right or at my left. That is for those to whom my Father has granted it."
The ten other students heard about this. They got angry with the two brothers.
Jesus gathered them and said to them, "You know how the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise power over them.
Don't hesitate to come back for anyone who wants to have their service with you.
And whoever desires that his child should be a servant of Allah.
"Be like the Son of Man. He did not come to be served, but to serve and give his life as a ransom for many." Two blind men received their sight.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, and a large crowd followed him.
Two blind men were sitting by the roadside. They heard that Jesus was passing by, and they cried out: "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
...The crowd ordered them to stop... They told them to be quiet... But the two men shouted louder... Lord! Ben David! Have mercy on us!
Jesus stood up and shouted at them. "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.
Oh my God, answer him, we want to start seeing.
...Jesus felt great concern for them...he touched their eyes...and immediately they could see...and followed him.
Mr. Dakhil Jrimah
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them,
"...Tell them to go to the village ahead of you... As soon as you reach it, you will find a donkey tied up... Its foal will be with it... Untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone tells you anything, tell them to go ask their master where he is in this place.
That's how what was said on the Prophet's tongue is realized. He says,
Say to the city of Zion, "Behold, your king is coming to you. He is gracious and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey." (Zechariah 9:9)
The disciples went and did what Jesus told them.
They brought the donkey and the colt, placed the cloaks on them, and our Lord Jesus sat on the cloaks.
A large crowd spread their belongings on the road. Others cut branches from trees and spread them on the road.
"...Some in front of him...and some behind...and all of them shouting at the top of their voices...Hosanna to the Son of David...Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord...Psalm 118:26 Hosanna in the highest..."
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up. People were asking, "Who is this?"
The crowds answered, "This is Jesus the prophet, from Nazareth in Galilee. Jesus was flying from the temple.
...Jesus entered the temple...he started to drive out all those who were buying and selling there...he overturned the tables of the money changers...and he overturned the chairs of those who were selling doves.
"...He told them, 'It is written, "My house will be called a house of prayer"—Isaiah 56:7—but you have made it a den of robbers.'—Jeremiah 7:11"
Blind and disabled people came to Jesus at the temple. He healed them.
...The chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonders that he was doing...They even saw the children in the temple courts shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" When they saw all this, they were indignant.
"...Do they hear what these children are saying...Ask Jesus...Jesus answered them, 'Yes...Don't you know what is written in the Scriptures...There is one who says, 'You have given them to drink milk and not strong drink...Psalm 8:2"
...he will leave the people and go out of the city, and will go to Bethany and spend the night there under the fig tree that is withered.
So early in the morning, Jesus was returning to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
...He saw a fig tree by the road...He climbed it...He found nothing in it but leaves...He said to it, "May you never bear figs again!"...Immediately the tree withered.
When the students saw this, they were amazed. "How did the fig tree dry up so quickly?" they asked.
...Jesus replied, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
"If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer." Jesus' authority was questioned.
Jesus entered the temple courts, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. "By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked. "And who gave you this authority?"
Jesus replied, "I will ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
"Where did John's baptism come from? Was it from heaven, or from men?" And they argued with each other, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Then why did you not believe him?'"
But what are we going to say to the men who are afraid of people? Everyone believes that John was a prophet.
So Jesus answered them, "I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in My Father's name, they bear witness of Me. But you do not believe, because you are not of My sheep, as I said to you. My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me; and I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; neither shall anyone snatch them out of My hand. My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of My Father's hand. I and My Father are one."
What do you make of this? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, "Son, go and work today in the farm."
"He didn't leave," the boy answered. But then he changed his mind and went.
...The father went to his son again... He told him the same thing... The son answered, "I'll do it, sir..." but he didn't go.
"Which of the two, do you think, was the son who did his father's will?" "The first," they answered. Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
"...to show you the right way to live...but you didn't believe him...yet the tax collectors and prostitutes did. You have seen this...but still, you did not repent from your sins and did not believe him. The story of the tenants."
Hear another story. A man had some land where he planted a vineyard. He built a wall around it. He dug a pit for the wine press. He even built a watchtower. He rented the vineyard to some farmers and then went away on a journey.
"...when the time of the harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the vineyard, and said to them, 'When you return, bring me my share of the fruit."
But the Kraya kept their servants. They beat one of them. They killed another. They hit the third with a stone to kill him.
...I sent other servants to work for them...and I sent more than the first time...and they are working, treat them the same way.
In the end, he sent his son to them. He said, "Just respect my son."
But the villagers saw the boy coming. They said among themselves: "This is the one who will take everything from the king's son one day. Let's go kill him, and then everything will be ours."
So they tied him up and took him out of the city. And they killed him.
When the farmer returns, what will he do to those tenants?
...He's going to kill those worthless people. They answered him and said, "He's going to rent the land to other people, and they will rent it to them... and they will give him his share of the crop when harvest time comes."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
Yes, that's what I'm telling you. The kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to those who will bear its fruit.
Anyone who falls on this rock will be completely crushed. But the rock will crush whoever falls on it.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' stories. They knew He was talking about them.
So they plotted a way to capture him. But they feared the crowd. The people were certain that our lord Jesus was a prophet.
Sir Ashaweh
...Jesus continued to tell them a few more stories...he said.
This is how the kingdom of heaven is. A king prepared a wedding feast for his son.
He sent his servants who were invited for dinner. The servants told them to come. But they refused.
"...and he sent with them some other servants...and he told them to say to those who were invited, 'I have prepared my feast...and I have slaughtered my fatted calf and my fat ox...everything is ready...come to the wedding feast.'"
But the people didn't care. One went to his need. One went to his work.
Capture the remaining servants. Treat them badly and kill them.
The king, who was very worried, sent his army to take everything from them. They killed those fighters and burned down their city.
Then the king said to his servants, "The wedding feast is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy to come."
Go to the alleys and call for dinner everyone you meet.
So the servants went out into the streets. They gathered all the people they found, good and bad alike. And most of the time, the banquet hall was filled with guests.
...He went to the guests and saw that one of the gentlemen there was not wearing wedding attire.
"...My friend asked me how I got in here without my wedding clothes... The man was speechless."
...and the king told his servants to tie his hands and feet...and throw him out...into the darkness...where people will be waiting for him and will gnash their teeth at him.
Many are called, but few are chosen. Should we pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went out and plotted to entangle Jesus in his words.
"...send them to him...and send the Herodians with them...they said to him... 'Teacher, we know that you are a truthful man and that you teach the way of God in sincerity...you don't let others tell you what to do or say...you don't care about how they will react...'"
We said, "So, do you think, sir, or the master?"
But Jesus knew their evil plans. He said to them, "You hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the currency that people use to pay their taxes." He showed him a silver coin.
He told them, "Whose is this picture? And whose is this speech?"
"Render unto Caesar," they answered. Then he said to them, "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's."
"...When they heard it, they were astonished... they left and went away. A wedding when the dead rise."
That very day the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. "Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote that if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and have children for him.
"...This is what Moses, peace be upon him, said... 'If a man dies and leaves no children, his brother should marry his wife and have children with her, so that his brother's lineage is not cut off.'"
...I have seven brothers...the eldest got married and died...since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
Until now, I have relied on the sea, and the second, third, fourth, and fifth.
In the end, the woman died.
Now if the dead man rose, whose wife would he be? For he was married to her on the seventeenth.
Jesus answered, "You are wrong, because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God.
When the dead rise, they will not marry. Their parents will not give them anything to marry. They will be like angels in heaven.
And what if death is not the end, but the beginning of something divine?
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." (Exodus 3:6) He is the God of the dead; he is the God of the living.
When these people heard this, they were amazed at his teaching. The greatest commandment.
When the Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus, they gathered together.
One of them was expounding the law to them. A Pharisee asked Jesus a question.
Ask the teacher, what is the most important matter in the Sharia?
Jesus answered, "'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' (Deuteronomy 6:5)"
This is the first and most important will.
"You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against your kinsfolk. Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
Everything is written for me in the law and the prophets, and my goods are blocked by these customs. "Who is the Son of Man?"
The Pharisees are gathered together. Jesus asked them a question.
"What do you say about Christ? Who is his father?" "The son of David," they answered.
"...He said to them, 'Well, why does David call him Lord? The Holy Spirit himself speaks of David as Lord.' David said..."
"The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at My right hand, until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.' " (Psalm 110:1)
Yes, if David called him Lord, how could his son be less than a man?
Not even one person could answer him, not even with a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him questions again.
The sword of judgment on the couch and the cursed one.
Jesus spoke to the people and to his disciples.
He said, "The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat."
Yes, you have to obey them. Do everything they tell you. But don't be like them. They don't practice what they preach.
They tie heavy loads and put them on others' shoulders. But they themselves are not willing to lift a little finger to move it.
Everyone who sees people's faces sees a book of their past, a book of their present, and a book of their future.
They want to take the place of honor at the table. They want to be the most important people in the classroom.
They like to be greeted in the markets, they like it when people call them "Lord."
But you shouldn't call me "God". You have only one teacher, and you are all brothers.
You say you're going to the theater after that, then after one in the sky.
"Still - for me - "teacher" in your noon teacher is a single entity."
Your most important people are often overlooked.
He who nods has his head cut off, and he who has his head cut off nods.
Do not be misled by information and rumors, O followers, lest you turn your faces upside down while you know nothing.
(.)
I don't know about the law and the shelf, but you, o follower, every time you mention a verse from the Quran in your contract, you are binding yourself to it.
This is for you, my friend Amin says, even if a thousand solutions fall from the sky, they won't help, but whoever goes to the sky of gold will bring back its light.
You are blind and foolish! Which is more important? Is it gold? Or the temple that makes the gold sacred?
You say, "Anyone who swears by the altar is bound by nothing, but anyone who swears by the gift on the altar is bound by his oath."
Oh, you fools! What's more important? The gift? Or the sacrifice that makes the gift sacred?
So whoever is called by His name has been given the name of Christ and the name of everyone who belongs to him.
And I dreamed in the name of the game, I dreamed in its name and decorated it.
And whoever swears by the name of the sky, has indeed sworn by the name of the Throne of Allah and by the name of He Who sits upon it.
 "How terrible for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You pretenders! You give God a tenth of your spices, like mint, dill and cummin. But you have not practiced the more important things of the law, like fairness, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the last things without failing to do the first.  
You see the small details that you overlook, but they make the camel's back break.
Don't be sad, O teacher of law and joy! O eloquent speaker! The light and the morning star are absent from the sky, but from the city you are missing. That's all I ask of you.
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean.
 "How terrible for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You pretenders! You are like tombs that are painted white. They look beautiful on the outside. But on the inside they are full of the bones of the dead. They are also full of other things that are not pure and clean.  
You're the same as me, you're harsh on the outside but soft on the inside, a sad soul who mediates and makes peace.
I don't know what to say to you, religious teacher and peddler, you who are a hypocrite and a liar, and who dig graves for innocent people.
And you would say, 'If we had lived in the time of those who lived before us, we would not have done what they did. We would not have helped them kill the prophets.'
Yes, you bear witness against yourselves. You admit that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
I wish you the best of luck that you've started with before!
O you snakes, children of vipers! How will you escape the judgment of hell?
Yes, I will send you prophets, sages, and teachers. You will kill some of them, crucify some on the wood, and flog others in your marketplaces. You will chase them from town to town.
"Yes, you will finish the blood of all God's creatures that you have shed on the earth. I mean the blood of Abel, the righteous, up to the blood of Zachariah, son of Berachiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar."
What I'm going to tell you is true. All of this is going to happen to those who are alive now.
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often have I wanted to gather your children as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!
See your way is dark.
"We will say to you, 'Our Lord, You have indeed fulfilled Your promise to us' (Psalm 118:26)."
Signs of the End Times
Jesus went out of the temple. As he was going, his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple.
"Do you see all these things?" asked Jesus. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. Then the disciples came to him privately and said, "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end?"
Jesus answered, "Stay awake! Be careful, lest you be deceived."
Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ!' and they will deceive many people.
You will hear about wars. You will hear people talking about future wars. Don't be afraid. Those things have to happen. But the end is not yet here.
Nations will fight against nations, kingdoms against kingdoms. People will go hungry. There will be earthquakes in many places.
All this is the beginning of labor pains.
Then people will hand you over to be persecuted and put to death, and all nations will hate you because of me.
At that time, many people will turn away from their religion. They will start to hate each other. They will give up on each other.
Many false prophets will arise and deceive many people.
Because evil is a pervasive companion with us.
But only what will remain constant until the end will be saved.
This good news of the kingdom will be preached throughout the world. It will be a witness to all nations. Then the end will come.
The prophet Daniel spoke of the "abomination of desolation" (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11). One day you will see it standing in the holy place. The reader must understand this.
So the Jews were given permission to take up arms and to flee to the mountains.
Not even one person goes out from the roof to their home to get something.
No one in the field needs to go back to get their coat.
What will happen to those who are sick or pregnant! Poor things. And to the nursing mothers.
I claim that you do not strike in the face or on the previous day.
There will be terrible suffering in those days. It will be worse than any other time from the beginning of the world until now. And you will never see anything like it again.
Time will not stop for anyone, but it will stop for those whom God has chosen.
At that time, someone might say to you, "Look, here is the Messiah" or "There he is, don't believe him."
False Christs and false prophets will arise, and they will show great signs and wonders, they will try to deceive the chosen people of God if possible.
Show me your talk, then we'll see.
Someone told you, 'He's out of town,' and you believed it. Or no one told you, 'He's generally at home,' and you disbelieved it.
The lightning that comes from the east is seen in the west. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
Eagles will gather wherever there is a corpse.
After the great suffering of those days, "the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will be shaken." (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory.
He will send His angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather His chosen ones from the four corners of the earth, bringing them from one end of the heavens to the other.
Take a lesson from the fig tree. When its branches start to bud and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.
In the same way, when you see all this happening, you know the end is near. She's standing at the door.
What I'm telling you now is true. The people who were living at that time surely didn't die, those events must have happened.
The question of salam is pleasant, but my words are not pleasant today. The day and hour are unknown.
"...not even on that day or at that hour does anyone know, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father..."
"Just as it was in the days of Noah, so too it will be when the Son of Man comes."
...In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, getting married, and giving their daughters in marriage. They were doing all these things until the day Noah entered the ark...
"...They knew nothing about what was going to happen...until the flood came...and took everything with it. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes."
Two men will be in a field. One will be caught, and the other will remain free.
Two women are grinding with a hand mill. One will be arrested, and one will remain.
So be ready. You do not know on what day your Lord will come.
...There's something you need to understand...Suppose the homeowner knows the time the thief comes at night...he's going to wait...he won't leave his house unlocked.
Yes, you too need to be ready. Adam's son will come at an hour we least expect.
Suppose that Mr. X charged one of his servants to oversee the other servants in his house. This servant's duty is to provide them with their food at the proper time. Mr. X desires this servant to be trustworthy and wise.
It would be good for the servant if he found his master doing his work when he returns.
What I'm telling you now is true. The man is going to put that servant in charge of everything he has.
But let's suppose the servant is evil. Let's suppose he says to himself, "My master will be gone for a long time."
Suppose he starts beating other servants. And suppose he eats and drinks with those who drink a lot.
The boss will return one day unexpectedly. He will return at an hour the servant does not anticipate.
"...they'll cut off piece by piece...and send it to the place where liars go...there they'll cry and gnash their teeth."
Lady of the Age
This is what the king will get in the market: twenty girls will come out of their homes for the foreigners.
Five of them were stupid. Five were smart.
Fools took their lamps, but they didn't take any olive oil with them.
And the wise filled their lamps with oil, along with their own light.
The groom hasn't come for a long time... even the bride's maids are all tired and sleepy.
On the day of Ashura, people weep and persist in shedding tears.
...Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps...
The fools said to the wise men: "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out."
" 'No,' they answered. 'It might not be enough for all of us. Instead, go to the oil sellers. Buy some for yourselves.'"
...Yes, they went to buy oil...but on their way back, the groom arrived...and her friends who were ready went in with him to the groomsmen...then the door closed.
...Then the other bride came...My lord...My lord...Open the door for us.
But answer me, "What I'm going to tell you now is correct. I don't know you."
Okay, be careful. You don't know the day or the hour when the bridegroom will come. The story of three servants.
Again, it will be like this in the kingdom of heaven. A man was going on a journey. He called his servants and entrusted his property to them.
...he gave $10,000 to one...and $4,000 to another...and $2,000 to the third...the man gave each servant the amount he knew the servant could handle...and then he continued on his way.
"...who invests $10,000 quickly and works with his money... earns another $10,000."
That's the one who had four dollars of profit, they added four dollars of profit to him.
But the man who received two thousand dollars went and dug a hole in the ground. He hid his master's money there.
...after a long time, the owner of the shop returned and wanted to collect all the money he had earned.
...The man who gave me $10,000 got $10,000 more... Sir... You trusted me and gave me $10,000... Look... I made $10,000 extra.
"...You have answered well, my good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things. Come and share in my joy!"
"...until a man entered, holding $4000 in his hands as well... the man was Si Ziad... Ziad, surprised, said, 'Is that you?' The man extended his hand."
"...You have answered well, my good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things. Come and share in my joy!"
...Now comes the man who borrowed $2000... and he says to him, Sir... I know you are a tough man... you reap where you sow... you gather the harvest wherever you scattered the seeds.
I was desperate. I went out and hid $2000 in the ground. Here you are, here's yours.
...You answered your master as a wicked and lazy person...Did you know that I was reaping where I hadn't sown? Did you know that I was gathering the harvest where I hadn't scattered the seed?
Okay, you should have put my money in the bank. When I return, I'll find that it has earned interest for me.
...Mr. Diallo ordered the other servants...Take $2000 from him...Give it to the person who has $20,000.
Everyone to me has more than enough, and those who have nothing, one of those who have will surely share with them.
...I saw that servant who wasn't allowed outside...there in the darkness...people were crying...and gnashing their teeth at the servant, my lord...why did you do this...what do you want to achieve with a sideways smile...while he is watching?
The Son of Man is going to come in all his glory. All the angels will come with him. Then he will sit on his glorious throne in heaven.
Hello everyone, Suri has been through tough times and is now facing a situation that seems like a nightmare, dividing the wealth from the waters.
He will put the sheep on his right side and the goats on his left side.
...Gaidoui with me on his right will tell him, "Our father has done you a favor. Come and take your share, for the kingdom that has been prepared for you since the creation of the world."
I was hungry. You gave me food. I was thirsty. You gave me drink. I was a stranger. You welcomed me.
You gave me things I needed. You took care of me when I was sick. I was in prison, and you came to visit me.
...Then the righteous will answer him, saying: 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink?'
When did we see you a stranger and invite you? When did we see you in need of clothes and give them to you?
When did we see you sick or in prison, and we went to visit you?
The king will answer: What I am about to tell you now is the truth... Anything you have done to any of these brothers of mine who are not so important, is as if you have done it to me.
"...then He will say to those on the thrones, 'O you who have believed, prostrate and bow and worship your Lord and do good - that you may succeed.' 23:50...then He will say..."
I was hungry. But you didn't give me anything to eat. I was thirsty. But you didn't give me anything to drink.
I was strange. But you didn't accept me. I needed things. But you didn't give me anything. I was sick and in prison. But you didn't care about me.
...Gaigolo...Oh my Lord...When did we see you hungry...or thirsty...and did not give you a drink? When did we see you a stranger...or naked...or sick...or in prison...and did not help you?
"...He's going to answer you by saying what I'm telling you now is true... Anything you haven't done for one of those who are lacking in this matter... you haven't done it for me."
Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but those who have done good will receive eternal life.
The green that dies turns black.
Jesus said all these things. Then he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
After this, the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered together, and they went to the palace of Caiaphas, the high priest.
They plotted to seize Jesus by stealth and kill him.
"But not during the holiday," they said. "People can cause trouble." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in the house of Simon, who had a skin disease.
A woman came to Prophet Jesus with a well-sealed bowl containing a very expensive perfume. She poured some of the perfume on his head while he was sitting in the assembly.
When the students saw this, they said, "Why this waste?" They asked.
The perfume could have been sold at a high price, and the money could have been given to the poor.
Jesus knew this. That's why he said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a good thing to me."
You always have a house, but not always yours.
Spray the perfume on my body so they can prepare me for burial.
What I'm telling you now is true. This is what she did, and it will be repeated wherever this joyful news is proclaimed throughout the world. It will be repeated in her memory." Judas agrees to hand over Jesus.
One of the disciples went to the chief priests. His name was Judas Iscariot.
What will you give me if I give you Jesus? And they paid him thirty pieces of silver.
"He who eats with me has lifted up his heel against me. The Last Supper."
...And it came to pass on the same day, the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, that the disciples came to Jesus and said to him, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover meal?"
"...Answer the call to the city to a certain man... Tell him, 'The Rabbi says to you, 'My time is near. I will celebrate Passover in your house with my disciples.'"
So the disciples did as Jesus had told them and prepared the Passover meal.
In the evening, Jesus was with the twelve on the mount.
"...and they eat, I told them...what I'm about to tell you now is true...one of you will hand me over to my enemies."
The students were very sad, one after another. They started saying to him, "It's not me, Lord, is it him?"
Jesus answered, "He who has dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me."
A person's soul will go as it is written. But how difficult it will be for the one who will take the human soul! It would be better for him if he was never born.
...Judas was the one who was going to betray him...he said, "Not me, Lord, it's him..." Jesus came and said to him, "Betray me not."
"...when they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, 'Take and eat; this is my body.'"
Then God handed the cup. He thanked and gave it to them. He said to them, "You all drink from it."
This is my new promise to dedicate it to the language of forgiveness.
This is what I'm telling you. From now on, I'm not going to drink alcohol with you until the day we drink together in the Kingdom of Abi.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus says Peter will fail.
Jesus said to them, "This very night, before the rooster crows, you will all have denied me, just as it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'"
But after he is risen from the dead, he will go before you into Galilee.
Replied Peter, "Everyone else can leave because of you. But I would never do that."
Jesus answered, "Truly I tell you, today, even this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times."
But Peter said, "I may have to die with you. But I will never say I don't know you." All the other disciples said the same thing. Jesus was praying in Gethsemane.
...then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane...and said to them...sit here...while I go over there...and pray.
Even though Peter and the sons of Zebedee were with him, he began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed.
"...and he told them, 'I'm feeling really bad...I think I'm going to die...stay here...keep an eye on me."
...He walked a bit... and fell on his face... and said... "Father... if it's possible... take from me this cup of suffering... but let what you want happen... not what I want."
"...and he came to his disciples, and found them sleeping... Peter, couldn't you wait with me for just one hour?"
Watch and pray. You won't fall into sin when the exam comes. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
...And Jesus went away a second time...and prayed, saying, "Father...if this cup may be taken away...but if it is necessary that I drink it...let your will be done."
...he went back...he found them sleeping again...their eyes couldn't stay open.
So he left them and went away again. And a third time he prayed for the same thing.
...Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is being delivered into the hands of sinners."
"Get up! Let's go! Here he is, I'm handing him over to them!" Jesus is arrested.
...while Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. He was accompanied by a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
...Judas, who was going to betray Jesus, was signaling to them...The one I will kiss is the man...Seize him...
Then a leper came to Jesus and bowed down before him, saying, "Lord, if you choose, you can make me clean." He stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, "I do choose. Be made clean."
Jesus answered and said to him, "Friend, do what you have come for." Then those men came forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
Then one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it, and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
"Put your sword back in its place," Jesus said to him. "For all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you think I can't ask Dad to help me? He'll send an army of over 70,000 angels right away.
But how can you believe their books when they say it must be signed this way?
At that time, Jesus spoke to the people, saying, "Do I lead a gang armed against you? Why do you come out with swords and clubs to seize me? Every day I was in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me."
"But all this has happened to fulfill the prophecy of the prophets." Then the disciples all left him and fled. They took Jesus to the Sanhedrin.
Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
...He went a little further. He fell on his face and prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will." Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Could you men not keep watch with me for one hour?" he asked Peter.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.
But they didn't find any evidence, even though many false witnesses came, in the end, two other witnesses came.
They said, "This one said, 'I can destroy the temple of God. I can rebuild it in three days.'"
"...after the high priest had questioned Jesus...and he remained silent...What are these charges...that these men are bringing against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."
"Yes," Jesus answered. "It is as you say. But I tell you that in the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."
"...Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, 'He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? You have heard the blasphemy with your own ears!'"
What do you see? He needs to die, answer him.
They are the ones who used to insult him. These are the ones who hit him. These are the ones who hurt him.
They said, "Prophesy to us, Christ! Who struck you?" Peter said, "I do not know Jesus."
"...he sat in the midst of the doctors...until a servant came to him...you also were with Jesus of Galilee."
But before them all, Peter said he was leaving. "I don't know why you're talking," he said.
"...and he went out to the gate that leads to the courtyard...there he saw him again...and she told the people, 'This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.'"
He went back on his word and swore, "I don't know the man!"
...A little while later, Peter came to them and said, "Surely you are one of them..." Your way of speaking gave you away.
"...Peter seemed to be scolding himself... He swore to them and said, 'I don't know the man!'... I quickly picked up the phone... It was an important call."
...Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him: "Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times." He went outside and wept bitterly.
Judas hanged himself.
It was early morning. The chief priests and the elders of the people decided to kill Jesus.
They tied him up and cured him. Then they gave him the pills that the governor had sent.
...Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned to death...he felt a great shame and regret for what he had done...so he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the priests and elders.
"...I told them...I made a mistake...I gave you a man who is not good...Answer them...What's going on? What's this about?...I told them...That man I gave you...he's not the one who did it...They asked...What deeds are you talking about?...I told them...That gentleman I gave you...he's not the one..."
So Judas threw the money into the temple and went out, and went and hanged himself.
The chief priests took the money and said, "It is against the law to put this money into the temple treasury, for it is blood money, paid for the death of a man."
So they decided to use the money to buy Potter's Field, where they would bury the people coming from other countries.
It is still called the Field of Blood to this day.
...and the prophecy of Jeremiah was fulfilled...who had said that...they took the thirty pieces of silver...their price, which was determined by the children of Israel.
"They paid me thirty pieces of silver, as the Lord commanded me." (Zechariah 11:12,13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) Jesus was handed over to Pilate.
...Jesus stood before the governor...the governor asked him...are you the king of the Jews...Jesus answered him...yes...as you say...
But when the chief priests and the elders accused him, he did not answer.
Then Pilate asked him, "Do you not hear the charges they are bringing against you?"
But Jesus made no answer, not even to a single charge. The governor was greatly amazed.
...The governor was running one of the prisons at Easter...and it was the people who chose who to release.
At that time, they had one famous thief known as Barabbas.
When all the people were gathered together, Pilate asked them, "Whom do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Pilate knew that the chief priests were envious of him. He knew this is why they handed Jesus over to him.
...While Pilate was sitting on the judge's chair, his wife sent him a message... She told him not to pass any judgment on that man, for he was innocent... I suffered a lot in a dream today because of him.
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus put to death.
"Which of the two do you want me to release?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered.
...So what shall I do with Jesus who is called the Christ? Pilate asked...They all answered, "Crucify him, crucify him!"
"Why? What has he done?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
...They saw until they were exhausted...and the crowd began to regret their actions...He took water...and washed his hands in front of them...He told them...I am innocent of this son's blood...He told them...This son's blood...is on your heads...
Answer everyone: We and our children will bear the guilt of his death!
Pilate released Barabbas. He had Jesus flogged, and then handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers began to mock Jesus.
...The governor's soldiers took Jesus to the palace...which was called the Praetorium...and all the remaining soldiers gathered around him.
They took off his clothes and dressed him in a purple garment.
...and they pressed thorns into his skull and wove them into a crown...and they placed it on his head...and they put a reed in his right hand...and they fell to their knees before him and began to mock him...We adore you, King of the Jews.
...they spat on him...they hit him on the head with a stick once, twice, and three times...
After they had mocked him, they stripped him of his robe. They returned his clothes to him. Then they crucified him. Jesus is being crucified.
...And as they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene named Simon, whom they compelled to carry the cross of Jesus.
They came to a place called Golgotha. Golgotha means the place of the skull.
They mixed wine with gall and offered it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it.
When they had crucified him, they divided his clothes by casting lots.
And they sat, keeping watch.
They put a sign over his head, written: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
They were holding him at gunpoint, one on his right and one on his left.
They were calling out to Jesus and mocking him. And they were shaking their heads.
"...and he said, 'Therefore I tell you, the temple will be destroyed, and in three days I will rebuild it.' So the chief priests and the Pharisees went to the governor and said, 'This man says, "I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days."' The governor asked, 'Is it true? What did you say?' But Jesus remained silent."
In the same way, the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him.
"...They say...he saves others...but he can't save himself!...He is the King of Israel!...Let him come down from the cross now!...Then we will believe in him."
Trust in God, and God will save him if he is indeed the son of God.
In the same way, the thieves who were crucified with Jesus also mocked him. Jesus dies.
From noon until three in the afternoon, the whole earth was covered with darkness.
...When they came to that place about three in the afternoon, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?" that is, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" This means Psalm 22:1.
...Some of those who stood there heard Jesus call out, "Eliya, Eliya!"
...Quickly, one of them ran and brought a sprinkler... He filled it with wine vinegar and placed it on a stick... And they presented it to our Lord Jesus so that he could drink.
...The rest said, "Let's wait and see if Elijah will come to save him."
After Jesus, I again cried out loudly, died.
At that moment, the temple's curtain tore in two, from top to bottom. The earth shook. The rocks split.
The graves are opening. The bodies of many righteous people who died have risen again.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus had risen from the dead, they entered the holy city. They appeared to many people.
The Roman commander and those who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, and they were terrified. They said, "Certainly this was the Son of God!"
He went a long way off, and the large crowd followed him because they were watching. They followed Jesus from Galilee to take care of him.
...and Mary Magdalene...and Mary the mother of James and Joseph...and the mother of the sons of Zebedee...and they buried him.
As evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came. He was a disciple of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for the body of our Lord Jesus. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Joseph shook the body and lo, a linen garment, clean.
They laid him in his new tomb, hewn out of the rock. They rolled a large stone across the entrance of the tomb. Then he went away.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The guards who were at the tomb
The next day was the day after the Day of Preparation. And the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
"...Let's think about something that liar said...and he's still alive. He claimed...three days later...I'll stand again."
"And they gave orders for the tomb to be sealed until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples might come and steal the body, and then claim that Jesus has been raised from the dead. This last deception would be worse than the first."
Pilate answered: "You have a guard yourself." They replied: "You go, make the tomb secure, you can't."
So they went and rolled away the stone from the entrance of the tomb, and after they had rolled the stone away, they went into the tomb.
Jesus rises from the dead.
...a few minutes, exactly seven minutes...the sun's rays on her face...she opened her eyes with difficulty...she tossed and turned on her stomach, yawning and cracking her neck...I
...There was a great earthquake...an angel came down from heaven...the angel went to the tomb...he rolled back the stone and sat on it.
His body was as bright as lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so scared of him that they started trembling and became pale.
...the angel...said to the women...do not be afraid...I know that you are looking for Jesus...who was crucified.
He's not here! He left just as he said he would! Come and see the place where he was.
Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you."
So the women hurried away from the tomb. They were afraid, but they were also overjoyed. They ran to tell the disciples.
...Suddenly they met Jesus...he greeted them...they came to him...they grabbed his feet...and worshiped him.
...Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me." So the disciples went and told the chief priests.
While the women were on their way, some guards entered the city and reported everything that had happened to the chief priests.
When the chief priests and the elders met, they came up with a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
They told the soldiers, "We want you to say that his students came at night and stole his body, and we..."
...the governor hears about this report...we'll be in trouble...and this will keep you away from problems.
"...So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. This story has been spread among all the Jews to this day..." The last commandments of Jesus to his disciples.
...Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they prostrated to him. But some are still doubtful.
...Then Jesus came to them and said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me..."
Yes, you must go and make disciples of all nations. Baptize them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
Teach them to obey everything I commanded you. And you can be sure that I am with you always, to the end.
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
From the time of your lord, the Messenger of your Lord, sees you, he sees for you all the good.
"A voice cries out: 'In the wilderness prepare the way for the Lord; make straight in the desert a highway for our God.' " (Isaiah 40:3)
...And so came John...baptizing people in the wilderness...on top of that, he was giving sermons...telling people they needed to be baptized...and to avoid their sins...only then would God forgive them.
All the people of the Judean countryside went out to him. All the people of Jerusalem also went out to meet him. When they found out that he had committed a crime, they led him to the Jordan River.
John wore clothes made from camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. And he ate locusts and wild honey.
"...This is what John the Baptist was saying: 'After me comes one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals.'..."
We wash you with water, but it is the Spirit of the Lord that truly cleanses and sanctifies you.
At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee. He was baptized by John in the Jordan.
...Jesus was coming up out of the water...at that moment, he saw the heavens opened...he saw the Holy Spirit descending on him like a dove.
...until he heard a voice from heaven speaking to him...It said to him...You are my beloved Son...whom I love so much...and I am well pleased with you.
For the time came when the Spirit led Jesus into the desert.
In the desert, it was forty days. The devil tempted him. Wild animals did not harm Jesus. Angels were taking care of him. Jesus chose his first disciples.
After John was put in prison, Jesus went to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.
He said, "The time has come. The kingdom of God is near. Repent of your sins and believe in the good news!"
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. He saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
"Come. Follow me," said Jesus, "and I will make you a fisher of men."
They immediately abandoned their network and followed him.
...Then he went a little further and saw James the son of Zebedee, his brother John, in their boat mending their nets.
"...I'll call them right away...They're all packed and ready to go in the boat with the servants...and they followed Jesus...Jesus is running from an evil spirit."
Jesus and his companions went to Capernaum. When they arrived, on the Sabbath day, he entered the synagogue and began to teach.
People were amazed by his teaching. He taught them as if he had authority. He didn't speak like the religious scholars.
"...Then, at that moment, a man came out from among their Jewish assembly...he was possessed by an evil spirit...and he said"
What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!
"Be silent!" Jesus said firmly. "Come out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Then it came out of him with a scream.
...People were all amazed... They were even asking each other, "What is this?... New teaching... With great authority... Even evil spirits obey him and listen to his words.
...Waily... - "God willing..." - "Who told you that?" - "I heard
Jesus and those with him left the synagogue. They immediately went with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
...When Simon arrived at the house, she was lying in bed, feverish, and they told Jesus about her.
So he went to her. He grabbed her by the hands and helped her up. The fever left her. She started to improve.
That evening, after the sun had set, people brought to Jesus all who were sick and also those who were demon-possessed.
All the people from the city gathered at the gate.
...Jesus healed many people who were sick with various diseases...and even cast out many demons...but he would not allow them to speak because they knew who he was...Jesus often withdrew to solitary places.
...It was still very early in the morning, and it was still dark...Jesus got up and went out of the house...He went to a place where He could be alone...There He prayed.
Simon and his companions went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, everyone called out to you.
Jesus answered, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby towns, so I can preach there also. That is why I have come."
So he withdrew to the region of Galilee. And he was preaching in their synagogues. And he was casting out demons. Jesus healed a man who had been unable to speak.
...there was a man with leprosy...who fell at the feet of our Lord Jesus...and began to plead with him...and said to him, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."
...Jesus sighed deeply...he reached out and touched the man...he said, "I am willing to do it...be 'pure'!"
The disease has left him. He has recovered.
...At that moment, Jesus rebuked them sharply...
"Don't tell anyone about this," he said. "Go and show yourself to the priest. Offer the sacrifices prescribed by Moses. This will be your proof to the priest and the people that you are clean."
But the man went out and began to speak openly. He spread the news everywhere. So Jesus could no longer enter a city openly. He remained outside in lonely places. But people still came to him from everywhere.
Isa is a cripple; he can't walk.
... A few days later, Jesus returned to Capernaum... The people heard that he had come back home.
Even though they gathered a lot of people, there was no more room. There was nowhere left to stand outside the door. And Jesus said to them, "The word of God."
Four of those who came carrying a man who couldn't walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after removing some tiles, they lowered the man on a mat.
Jesus saw their faith. That's why he said to the man, "My child, your sins are forgiven."
Some law professors were sitting there. They were thinking.
Why is he talking like that? He's saying something really evil! Only God can forgive sins!
"...for them there is nothing greater than this..."
Is it easier to say to this man, "Your sins are forgiven," or to say, "Get up, pick up your mat, and walk"?
"... I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus said to the paralyzed man, "Get up, take your mat and go home."
"We told you," said Nouz, "and I told him not to interfere."
...The man got up, picked up his mat, and walked away, while everyone was watching him. They were all amazed and said, "We have never seen anything like this!"... Jesus called Levi.
Again Jesus began to teach by the Sea of Galilee. A very large crowd gathered around him.
...and as he went, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's place...Jesus said to him, "Follow me." And he rose and followed him.
Afterward, Jesus was eating dinner at Levi's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples. They were part of the large crowd that followed Jesus.
...Some Pharisee teachers of religious law who were present there saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors, and they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
...Jesus heard this...and he said to them...Those who are well don't need a doctor...only those who are sick do. I didn't come to call the righteous, but sinners.
...The disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting...some people came to Jesus...they said to him...John's disciples fast...Pharisees' disciples fast...but your disciples do not...why not?
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? They cannot fast while he is with them.
But one day Gigi will bring them the groom. That day they will leave without eating.
Patching isn't done with new patches on old clothes. If they do it, the new patch will tear the old one. This will only make the hole bigger.
"... People do not pour new wine into old wineskins. The wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins." Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On the Sabbath, Jesus was walking through the grain fields with his disciples. The disciples began to pluck some heads of grain.
The Pharisees said to him, "Look, Teacher, your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath." Why are they doing that?"
Respond, "Haven't you ever read about what David did? Him and his men were hungry. They needed food."
So David went in to Ahimelech the priest; and Ahimelech came to meet David, and said to him, Why are you alone? There is no one with you.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
"So the Son of Man is Lord, even on the Sabbath."
Your problem is in the code.
...once again Jesus entered the synagogue...there was a man with a withered and paralyzed hand.
...the Pharisees...wanted Jesus to make a mistake. They were watching all his movements, to see whether he would heal the man on the Sabbath day.
Isa spoke to the man whose hand was weak and crooked. "Stand in front of everyone," he told him.
...Jesus said to them, "What does the law say? What should we do on the Sabbath day? Should we do good or evil? Should we save life or destroy it?" But no one answered him.
...He shook his eyes at them angrily...He was very upset because they were stubborn...and he told them, "Isa, extend your hand..." He extended it...and it opened for him...as if there was nothing in it.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians against Jesus, how they might destroy Him. Multitudes followed Jesus.
...Jesus went to the Sea of Galilee with his disciples...a large crowd followed him from Galilee.
The people heard about all that Jesus was doing. And large crowds came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, and the surrounding regions, including Idumea, beyond the Jordan River, and the area around Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowd, Jesus told his disciples to prepare a small boat for him, so that he would not be pressed by the people.
Jesus healed many people. Those who were sick pushed forward to touch him.
When the people saw the demonic spirits, they fell before him. The spirits cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them that they should tell no man who he was. Jesus appointed twelve apostles.
...Jesus went up to one of the mountains...he called some people to come to him, and they came.
He chose twelve of them and called them apostles. They remained with him, and he even sent them out to preach.
They have the power to cast out demons.
So Jesus saw twelve. Simon was one of them. Jesus gave him the name Peter.
James was the son of Zebedee and his brother was John. Jesus gave them the name Boanerges, which means "sons of thunder."
Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
Judas Iscariot was also one of them. He was the one who would later hand Jesus over to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebul
Jesus entered a house. Again a large crowd gathered, so that Jesus and his disciples could not even find a chance to eat.
The family's involvement led to this. They took care of it. They told him his bird had flown away.
"...They were some teachers of the law... coming from Jerusalem... they said it was under the control of Beelzebul! He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons."
So Jesus called them and spoke to them in parables, saying, "How can Satan cast out Satan?
To several queens, she is a mystery.
If the family was not divided
