khoa, I'm saying what you don't want to understand, Saleh.
khoa, what's happening? Saleh, open your eyes, open your mind, look around you, see what people are doing.
If my brother is blind
He refuses to improve himself and develop those around him.
khoa! Saleh... Don't be stubborn.
No, no, no, no, I don't care what you say.
Walking in the street
khoa and two dates are soaking.
And you're dying of hunger.
Are you eating or not?
No, I'm eating.
Did he kiss me before this?
"How can a family accept this?"
I'm done with him.
Our opportunity, our cars fail from their age.
Please try to talk to him.
These things are common and normal.
Stupid! He has no confidence in himself.
Ha, scared?
The most annoying thing to me
He is responsible for the budget.
What is this project that he is responsible for?
This is a large government project.
Hidden at the bottom.
I have the right to take the money.
Are you working in another ministry?
Mother, how could you forget!
And today in the garage
Which means I
Count me in!
I really didn't get anything out of it.
Won't I take anything?
This means I'm involved too.
We all should take.
This is a government project.
But your stupid son won't understand.
In a word
The good that you reject.
This is a government project.
Your chance.
Just like people do.
Wasting wealth before you
Take your share.
He had only one riyal in his pocket.
I heard it myself.
It is known that government projects are...
And the last third was looted.
Son of Shalom
Went to Souq Waqif
One jellyfish costs eighteen riyals.
Put its price in the budget.
At one hundred and eighty riyals each.
They said they didn't do anything wrong.
You get bored of him.
"And we seek refuge in Allah from Satan."
Yeah, but I think he's changing his mind.
God willing, my Lord.
He is the president and everything is in his hands.
Most importantly, don't forget about us.
We are your quarter.
We need to be together.
This government project is an opportunity.
Sure, Oh! Ali
We can't do it without you.
Don't worry, oh! Ali
And with God's permission, everyone is included in the project.
Of course
Yesterday, I was chatting with our friends.
From your side
We're not afraid as long as you're members of the project committee.
Are you concerned about Saleh, the project manager?
They say that
Don't worry, oh! Ali
And say, "The truth has come, and falsehood will not prevail."
Grandpa, oh! Father of Fahd?
This is good news.
But, Saud, don't forget.
No, no
Inshallah, everything will be fine.
This is a good opportunity that coincides with the first.
I'm taking it.
I was wondering if I'd get some benefits.
Is this possible?
Then you're involved in the project because you work with us in the same department.
But the most important thing is that it stays a secret between us.
And you're lying on a plate of bread and meat in front of you.
Sure, I'll do it.
To your health
What's wrong with you!
If you keep daydreaming like this.
It doesn't work.
This won't work.
Or questions
We'll be happy to help.
How can we get our rights?
He is logical.
What will you call it!
After all, we're not the only ones who take.
Every participant will demand their share.
Why not!
Don't be afraid, Saleh.
We're the ones who set the budget.
What land did he buy today?
Has he met him yet?
No one can afford to buy it.
Where did you get this information?
Call me today.
Because my brother's phone was turned off.
I said, "What's wrong with you?"
Teach your brother.
Another earth
Who threw away the stick he bought yesterday.
The sale has been approved.
He said, "Please call him to see if he wants it; I'll book it for him."
He doesn't want to share the money with us.
What happened to our money?
We consider ourselves partners with him.
Even if we weren't involved!
You're taking a big punch by yourself.
At least give your brother and mother a little.
I'm not here to beg from you.
Since we're also participating in the project, we have the right to ask for our share.
Tell her, tell her.
It is true that one day the sultan asked for his share, and he refused.
But I wasn't convinced by his argument.
You need to give him a share in the project.
Phase one.
You're no less than others.
Project Committee Members
I heard him talking to them.
They fear their brothers and friends.
I know the government's projects are free for anyone.
We don't just want a limited amount of money.
I am a shareholder in the company.
His brother Sultan can attend committee meetings if he wants to.
Because the members of the committee are apparent.
Project budget
But the Prophet
Thank you.
Ah, Abu Saleh
Your aunt's son!
You like it.
It will benefit the project.
Let's remind ourselves.
We divided the work, right?
You, Saleh
I'm responsible for cement, bricks, and concrete.
And leave the rest, like water and electricity, to me.
Oh people!
Claim / Take your share.
"And I, by God,"
Sometimes I decide to take some money.
And sometimes I say
Let me take a cut.
What is right is right.
Take what you want in any way you prefer.
The most important thing is,
We're still here.
For this week,
Everyone determines the amount of money they want to have.
For example
And after a few days, they change their minds.
And ask for an additional one hundred thousand.
Okay, but why like this, huh?
What do you think?
I agree.
Even the participants,
Focus on your work, and ignore him.
And there is more orphan money.
More budget.
Many people are hungry.
Who does he think he is?
What's this! Your father's project!
What is this, Sultan?
Oh my brother, oh my sultan.
Which means he is participating.
Is it a last name?
Your friend Saud is adding a lot of names.
He's adding names, saying "Let's benefit from them."
Okay, in which category should I put the percentage or the amount of money?
No, put it with the beggars.
How do you want to download it! Download it in 20,000 pieces.
Ayh kafy (Which translates to: That's enough)
They even added a note here that says:
He is our neighbor.
But Saud's list is longer than Abdulaziz's list.
All of this will be considered part of the Phase One budget.
As a bundle, no one notices.
Yes, there are more items on the list that my mother sent.
She calls every two hours and adds people without asking.
Haha, may she live long.
Light of my eye, my son.
"May Allah bless you, %pw is sick and m
But the woman doesn't have money.
May God reward you well, I told you this is the last one.
He underwent a liver transplant.
What! Hey, wait, wait... How much do you need?
Enough of the hospital and the liver!
About one hundred and eighty thousand riyals.
How many livers are you planting?!
Just one, my friend, is precious.
Yes, may God reward you, add her name to the list.
Hussaina, AA Hussaina bint Hilal.
Are you giving her your own money?
Reassure him and tell him that I'm not taking anything from phase two.
Okay, one hundred and eighty thousand riyals.
Oh! They're going to replace her liver with a new one.
He said, "Zayd gave me two thousand [dirhams] so that I could buy gifts for my daughters."
Alvin
"Alf li" in English
Yes, Husaina bint Hilal
You failed in front of your friends!
No, Mom.
I have a lot of work.
I'll call you later.
Those who eat from the dinner have increased.
The infrastructure can handle the load.
Don't forget me.
Write the number you want.
I don't know.
It's up to you.
I am the chairman of the board.
And I say you deserve a million.
They are deciding that the project will start tomorrow.
And he will give us payments continuously.
How much! We want to know!
Will they give it to us all at once or in installments?
Why does she get more than us?
"Neither electricity nor looting matter to them, the most important thing is silence. We are waiting for them and they are coming."
%pw He told you to shut up about the talk, [-n] %pw Alright, shut up about the talk.
You're not ashamed.
If you hear anyone of you speaking
"I sealed his mouth"
Let's go away.
You know this is money, not something easy.
How much was it before?
Fifty million
You look like you're taking a big bite.
You're the boss in the end.
We have a headache between us.
Let's agree on the budget.
Professor Saleh, from your presentation about the project, we noticed that it is vital and extremely important.
And not just for this generation
Ah, ah
Tomorrow is the opening of the first phase of the project.
We would like to thank you for your presence, and congratulations once again.
And I welcome
On this occasion
United Nations
Where to? To the project.
Where are we then!
I don't know where we are.
I'm bored.
You don't see the officials speaking and people applauding them.
We're at the official opening. What's wrong with you?
Since they're talking now, it means we're in the project.
What, are we in the project?
And people are sweating profusely.
And I don't know what they put inside these divisions.
Leave the box alone.
These are the infrastructure partitions.
The official opening of the state's international beaches
The third millennium, what's up?
I really don't know.
Yes, praise be to God, old age is a disease.
I want to know why they isolated me.
He's just parking his car.
I was surprised by this visit.
But when she told me
No one told me anything.
I saw it with my own eyes, over there in a big farm.
Praise be to God, I'm comfortable.
You receive checks while relaxed at home.
Why are you upset, my love? Don't let anyone trample on your heart, Munira.
You should be thankful, Manira, that you have brothers like Rashid, Saad, and Saqr.
He who is anxious about his share invests it.
Look, look at my friend Hessa.
Her brothers don't give her a single riyal from her father's inheritance.
We don't do that.
This is your legal right.
This is a matter of trust... Don't trust us!
I don't know.
I didn't feel comfortable with my brother Rashid's talk.
He always reminds me of the check they give me every three months.
That's just my right.
He always tells me.
You don't trust us.
Material and genetic matters need to be clear.
If you, my dear, don't accept
Do you know what he does to people?
"The loan of Salmi is an example for you, how poor this woman is."
Who could believe she inherited millions?
Because of her brothers.
Money destroys people.
But work is work, and it's your legal right.
And then what?
And we run the company.
Investment in land, real estate, and money
No problems, no headache.
She said she was walking on the ground in the desert.
This is more than enough for her.
I'm afraid her husband, Nasser, is behind this.
Any problem?
Your sister seemed to be spinning.
This is the problem.
She's planning to get us into trouble.
As if it's our money, we're giving it to her.
He is a falcon, he is.
We need to find a solution for this, oh! Rashid
In my mind
What is this?
My share of my father's inheritance
The associations that give them to me every three months.
Everything is clear.
Forty thousand is enough.
As if they aren't investing the money.
Saw, saw, saw, saw
Clear
Clear.
They said, "Let's give her more so she'll be happy and stop asking."
Everything I said is correct.
Give it to me little by little.
If you only saw their women.
She has a lot of different diamond jewelry.
I don't have half of what they have.
They don't think I deserve my father's inheritance.
If you ask for it,
Your right
Legal and legitimate right
I feel like they are stealing and lying to me.
I'm not comfortable with their behavior.
You never know, my dear.
They've killed me and made me sick, alas for my beloved.
They know that there is an account and a punishment.
And that God will punish them because they took other people's money.
And be careful, don't mention anything about the court to them, oh! My dear.
They will be happy.
Is it because of the increase in our population?
That's why I'm telling you, my dear.
Calm down.
Everyone has an apartment like a tower.
My father is right.
My father wants to build a mosque before he dies.
And give charity to the poor.
Mother of Solomon
Keep it down, guys!
And don't mention the court to them.
Or anything else
You know why!
At this time
Her rights are being violated.
You were auditing the accountant.
Who are you to ask him?!
Answer them!
No, I am here for your sister.
The door through which I entered.
Don't grin.
You know the door you entered from.
No, no
What is a falcon?
Too bad, Saad.
Manar, don't get yourself into trouble.
If you want your share of the company and properties, we don't have a problem with that.
Six hundred thousand
She was content all her life.
I'm sure it's her evil twin.
Because she is kind.
I beg them.
This is a well-known and certain legal rule.
He tells me, "It's either a hundred thousand or nothing."
It's not possible.
Expect anything oh!! Munira
My parents' company
Eight buildings
Without mentioning lands and houses
And he says six hundred thousand, only.
With the signing of a waiver document
No oh! Manira
Don't be fooled and sign this paper. Be careful, I'm telling you.
You have the right to know everything about the lands, about money, and about everything else, it's not up to them.
But the company,
You are a partner.
You were just fired from the company.
No one can stop me.
Do you know what?
It's your father's company.
Don't mind him shouting.
Let me in, I'll tell you.
Let him, he doesn't need it.
He has a paper, I don't know what's going on with him.
He's shouting at us, make him stop.
Sorry.
Khawi Saad went to the office and explained to them what they didn't know.
Come in.
See if Professor Nasser wants to drink something.
Please go ahead.
Sure %pw
You're leading us to disaster.
He knows how she has so much.
He discovers that we owe her four hundred thousand, not forty thousand.
Let's do the calculation.
Within ninety-six months,
Here's the problem, multiply it by three hundred and sixty.
11,520,000
Fine, and then what?
Let him do what he can.
I'll tell him frankly.
Our money
Everyone who inherited did the same thing.
Hello, hello, welcome to your company. Let's forget what happened.
Welcome
This is the accountant, Samir.
Answer anything Mr. Nasser wants to know.
The whole company is at your disposal.
If you want to come in, please do, don't ask for permission.
Thank you.
Calculate for Ali.
Go to his pocket, take it.
Let him see all the files.
You should take more than ten million.
They didn't even mention it.
"She used to say"
Her father left her.
Four buildings,
I thought they had three lands.
Every land is larger than the second one.
"According to Allah is everything, and He is the Truth, O Sword."
It's not right what they're doing.
Don't leave them alone.
What should I do, Mother Salmin?
I have to sue them, there's no other solution.
He glances through a few papers.
The case was adjourned.
Stay cautious, my son, Nasser.
Don't mention anything about the court.
Oh! Madam, you're here and the doctor is looking for you.
Are you safe?
Go to your room.
And all Muslim patients.
He didn't tell me.
Sorry, who's speaking?
Oh, now I remember you. Yes, yes, I remember you.
AAAH
"For what, brother?"
No problem, thank you.
Now that he knows we have money, he's been asking for it non-stop.
You think this is Abdullah, the one you took to them, can do it?
Is he a close friend of Rashid?
He knows him well for years.
Do you believe it, Munira?
Even Abdullah gave me some advice.
Follow them up.
Don't leave them alone.
Try to get as much as possible from them.
Do you know what Abdullah is telling me?
Not for people who have lived seventy or eighty years,
For people who live at least two hundred years.
"Mother of Salmān, may God have mercy on her."
May God have mercy on her, she used to say.
Our population has not yet reached four hundred thousand.
And the case will take ten years or more.
Do we have to go through all this trouble to consult the court?
This is it.
Oh, my darling, you're sitting with them.
Good luck
By the way, he's an old school friend.
Life is short.
And I want what's best for you.
And you are from a large and well-known family.
Inherent.
Please, Rashid, we're friends.
Please go, and I'm still calm.
Or you'll get beaten.
Go, forget about friendship.
You get nothing.
I paid one hundred thousand for one night for a diamond jewelry set from the jewelry exhibition.
Where did you get all this money from?
They waste their money on their women.
He deprives his sisters of their money.
Still have hope, Nasser.
Fought with you.
The day she spoke to him yesterday at the mosque.
Just let me do what I told you to do.
Famous people and people with integrity.
Why not?
But I also suggest
Praise be to God for this event.
O God, enlighten our hearts with righteousness in this world and the hereafter.
You listen.
If you have something to say, don't bring up my sister's class.
It's correct.
Bro, just go, or you'll get beaten.
I don't care what you say.
I begged you for months and you refused.
I won't say.
I'm leaving tomorrow morning.
Give it to me.
Hello, hello
Don't listen to her.
She's not going to court.
Tomorrow tomorrow
I'll give you a chance to see what you do.
safety first
Goodness doesn't work with them.
And they realized that their reputation was at risk.
We'll see how they decide.
Saud, are you busy tomorrow?
I've decided to sue them.
I told her to leave it until tomorrow so we can go there tomorrow.
What is this?
You're right.
I asked why.
You want to go to court and sue us.
To get your share of the inheritance.
Yes, she did it.
Your life is sweet.
May God make your whole life perfect.
Why did I tell you that we should go the day after tomorrow?
The day you get there, first park your motorcycle in the parking lot.
See the security guards.
You go to the eighth floor.
The judges are on this floor.
Are there lawyer cards for every lawyer in the country?
I'm sure you need it.
I wish you would come and mock us.
"We need her to sue us."
The spirit of the court.
Listen to Manar.
Sign a waiver for us.
Zayn
You know what's right and proper.
Show us the way.
Come on, brother.
I forgot to give Mona something important.
This is today's Al Raya newspaper.
There's a nice article like this.
She is a writer, not a doctor.
I want you to see it as a gift from me to you.
His living conditions need to change.
Alas!
He has four kids, but his house is poor.
Surely he will because he risks all his money.
Invest in this project.
It's Bou and Walid who I never expected to start a project.
Eat, you sons of the new merchant, Bou Ould.
Shall I get you something to eat?
No, I'm fine.
Get moving, and get yourself some fruits.
Mom, I want a toy for Hamood.
By force, by force
My son Waleed put a little sweetness aside for your uncle.
Congratulations on the project! Oh! Bou Walid, you deserve it.
My quarter believes I'm an excellent accountant.
Thank you, thank you my son.
"Man, if we become oud traders, I want a private room."
See what he asked for. He has no ambition, my dear son.
Okay, I'll enable your BlackBerry's large font setting.
Forget their desires now.
Like everyone else.
Replace our small, miserable house.
First, let's pay off all our debts, and then we'll see.
He looks very happy with his son.
Eats more than before.
Lucky trader
All the poetry is my father's, the merchant.
Blessed is the project.
Save some for my friends.
God willing, may God bless you.
I met a Japanese guy among them.
One day, while we were sitting, I switched places with him and he gave me a catalog as a gift.
And after one of the quarters, he saw it.
He said, "This is an opportunity."
Multi-purpose halls?
Always like this.
They are computer labs.
Click on the cinema.
If you want a playground..
This is magic.
They all said, "Let's go."
I took a loan from the bank, some from my family, and sold my land, praise be to God.
Now the committee has agreed.
Why didn't you ask for it since the ministry approved it?
And then an email is sent to the factory.
He'll talk to you when he arrives.
There is thyme tea.
I'm still waiting at Ali's office.
"And the secretary hasn't called yet, brother."
I'll be absent for ten days.
It's a matter of luck.
My papers are ready.
The committee approved it.
Why didn't you sign it?
So you're an authorized manager?
Why don't you go to him to get him to sign for you?
I told you he can't.
Not just him, all the staff there do the same thing.
Appearance can be deceiving sometimes.
You should be thanking your God.
I was there trying to get the signature and I was anxious.
Finished?
How can I finish this work when Boufahad doesn't cooperate?
What can I do?
I'm still losing my money.
My dad is signing as fast as he can so we can finish; I don't know what to do.
I'm afraid the manager will ask about you.
His saying "I am sick of anything"
I'm waiting alone.
And you say you're his secretary, what happened to us?
Give me your phone number.
"Isn't the secretary coming? Come on, what's the matter?"
Don't call, you're scaring the world, they think you're the secretary.
No, we're still waiting for Abu Fahd.
Bathroom repair money
He is stupid.
Oh! People, wait, wait
Wide, wide,
He told you to shut up, enough, be quiet.
Bu Fahad had to go to the airport.
How did he leave?
Let's see him at the car before he leaves.
What's wrong with him?
God helps you.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't blame your father, Maali.
He's just acting strangely.
And when he receives the goods,
He won't be able to get his money back.
And now she needs them.
Where is he now?
What are you looking for?
They are in front of you.
You're calling me in the middle of the night.
"Brother, I told you."
I told you.
It's not in my hands, my daughter.
I know, but it's not fair.
Classes start next week at the university.
And if I enroll, I have to wait until next semester.
Three months would be a waste of time.
Oh my age, I'm trying.
Don't you think I should go to the ministry every day?
We're reading until Abu Fahd comes, Abu Fahd.
I'll be at home.
You don't understand!
Don't call me during lunchtime.
This is the fourth time you've called me.
Are you stupid?
I know you need the money.
Just in the hope that Bu Fahad will sign the papers this week.
And they give him the first installment.
I don't know what to tell my sister.
Jolted awake
He walks and talks to himself all night long while sleeping.
If it weren't for Fahd's fall.
God helps him.
That's why.
It's necessary for Bou Fahad to sign these papers this week.
What is he waiting for?
Come to work once.
And you travel a year.
And look out for people's interests.
How? How? How?
Do you feel better now?
It breaks me.
This unusual fever is dragging me down and taking hold of me.
What does he want?
I heard that I should go to the ministry.
So they can finish my paperwork.
He told the employees that he was disciplining me.
The time period is coming to an end.
Bring the phone, bring the phone
Buraida's secretary
I want to tell you that
Bu Fahad will come tomorrow, God willing.
I never call you.
Come directly.
"Khair bu"
You were never like that.
I'm talking to you.
And your eyes on the screen of your mobile phone.
I said, "Alas!"
So you feel responsible.
And if you bind yourself
I'll take you back to your department.
Fifteen boxes of printing paper
Fifteen cartons of printing paper.
Poor thing.
The manager is punishing him.
That we take him with us.
Have you heard about the factory?
He will lose his money if he doesn't sign his papers today.
If only he had gone and the manager had found out about it.
Yes, tell me.
What if the manager asks about him?
We'll look into it, but let him go.
Bu Waleed
I'm leaving, just waiting for a call.
Tell me
God helps him.
Hold on, people, hold on, people, hold on.
What do I know where you're going?
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Do not move.
Don't sit.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't go to work.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Let's go look for him in Uzbekistan.
Room by room
Alley to alley
The input
Call the hospital, quickly.
Don't call the hospital.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
I've spent my whole life working as a messenger, from many years ago until today.
Oh, how long it is, oh Abu Saeed.
What were you thinking?
Around fourteen years old.
As a messenger
Strong headache
And the sweat without air conditioning in the past years.
In your opinion, was riding a bike easy before or not?
With a yellow mark
Oh, Abu Saeed, it was a very difficult time.
Oh, my poor dear child.
But what can we do, O son of Adam?
Bu Saad
Alright, sorry guys, the manager arrived as he said he would. Let's go finish our work.
The manager said, "Oh! Great, let's go."
Congratulations, Bou Said.
They said your son Khalid got a job.
What did I tell you?
I told you, if God wills it.
Bathroom thief
I told you when my son is the last one to graduate, I'll resign.
He graduated and found a job.
Praise be to God, I'm going to finish my work.
You have done enough and more.
Praise be to God.
Change your opinion, oh Abu Saeed.
And you deserve it.
"Thank you very much, oh! Abu Abdulaziz"
I am very grateful to you, Abu Abdulaziz.
Hello
I did the homework.
Let them finish the trip.
Your right
After all this time and work
Everyone is rushing.
You need to rest, Abu Saeed.
After he leaves from here, my wife is inviting me.
I'm celebrating my retirement.
A coffee pot and some dates, how wonderful!
When will we finish, my son?
You're impatient for the khonafrush, oh Bu Saeed.
Don't worry.
I'll prepare the sofa.
Sure, goodbye.
I told you the khonafrush is ready, waiting for me.
Now I'll finish all your paperwork.
It's your chance to seize it today.
Our manager told us he's traveling.
My heart aches.
I don't want to move at all.
Send it with someone else.
Now you are officially free.
Thank you.
Now, you are free to rest.
Good health to you, Abu Abdulaziz. Goodbye.
Congratulate me.
No extra work.
So you're free, bro.
"Fine, Father, if you please."
What is human resources?
Thank you, goodbye.
Zahara is throwing a party because her son passed his exams.
She brings a cake.
I can't.
I myself took my father to finish some procedures for me.
Zahara will get upset.
Okay, Mama
My father left work.
May God guide him now.
Well done, let him rest.
Let him rest.
He asked me to cook him a khunafrash.
I prepared it.
And I waited for him.
Fear God and have mercy on your father.
Your turn now.
He will eat it tomorrow.
He wants to rest.
You tortured this old man.
As soon as he returned,
I was tired.
Don't drive me to perdition (singing)
Don't drive me to perdition (singing)
I was going to take these bank papers on my way to work.
He punishes anyone who is late.
Of course, my dear.
Go to your job.
"I will do it, with these small Chinese eyes." (Note: "على
Bu Sa'id
Sends you a place every day.
As you like it, Um Saeed.
Smell
In my nose
I will spread it out.
Why did you go to the central bank?
No, take the market branch.
And go there.
Sure? I don't want to go there and they tell me it's not here.
Present, goodbye.
I got sunstroke.
Sunstroke
I entered our neighbor's house.
The maid recognized me.
She asked me, "What's wrong?"
What compels you to do this?
No, Mother Saeed, I can't eat khunafrah now.
Mama, where's my father?
I go there so often.
She didn't tell him which bank to go to.
They told him that some papers were missing.
She told him to take a taxi.
Mom, we had a meeting with the director.
How is my father now, any better?
I slept a little, the headache is gone now.
I'm telling you in front of him.
Leave your book alone, let it rest.
Poor Umm Saeed.
They need to commit to their work, they will be evaluated, what can they do?
I am at your service.
Abu Shahin
You could say I retired, but I didn't retire.
How are you?
Before, in the past,
"Misfortune is my lot."
Your children are grown up.
I need to help them.
They used to tell me
You're wrong.
You know all the young men who don't have a father never finish their personal work.
It depends on the job.
In some jobs, they let you leave early to finish your personal errands.
May God reward you with good.
I'm near you at the coffee shop behind you.
Where are you going, Bou Shahin?
I'm finishing some errands for my son Saeed.
In the ministry next to this coffee shop
Budeh Lands
safety first
What happened, Mom? Okay, I'll see you later, goodbye.
This won't do you any good.
I warn you.
I heard you said this to Saeed.
Your father is tired.
What matters to me.
If your father didn't complain.
He is silent.
Do not speak about him.
"You have tormented him. Fear your Lord."
Your loud crying disturbed me.
Man, you were a government employee and know very well what filling out forms means.
And they wrote this first.
And now, they do this with %pw.
Last day for loans at the Development Bank.
No, no, who said so?
Zayn, come here.
You believed a lie.
He says he has a sock committee tomorrow.
What's wrong with you!
%pw, as you like
Go now to finish the work.
Nothing, nothing
He's been quiet since he came home.
That's what replies to me.
You have no shame.
I don't blame your father for being angry with you.
If you agree to this.
"Wide, and may God reward you well."
He was supposed to call you.
Why is he calling his servant?
You are the dearest to us, father.
And I am grateful to you.
Forgive him, please.
Let me **teach him a lesson**.
"From this moment on, father."
And relax.
"Khunfuroosh, Khunfuroosh" (Singing)
Thank you, ...
Your satisfaction, father.
May God reward you with good.
We have decided from now on,
We write our research ourselves.
"Thank you all so much, and may God reward you with good. Praise be to God."
But please, dad.
Consider him the last one.
I just can't.
Tony is calling me.
Nah, I'm not going to the meeting. I hate meeting the minister.
The minister is angry with you.
No, no, no, this can't be, you can't upset the minister, you have to go, even before him.
I won't make a mistake, dad. What should I say? I don't want to upset you.
Don't say that.
You have your papers and consider them done.
Bacon will be on your way as you go to finish Saeed's papers.
Please, dad.
Consider it the last favor you do for me.
I'm happy to serve you, father.
But your son should sign this paper.
Do you want me to come back again to give it to you tomorrow?
I advise you to return it today.
Even if they didn't see the newspapers.
You have to wait two months.
Just give it to me so I can get it signed and then I'll hand it back to you.
No, no, no, it's not necessary.
Just say one word and tell him to come for just two minutes.
Finish him.
Do you know Saeed?
No, he's on vacation.
And return after sunset.
All our squares are here.
All I ask is where are you, my friends?
He answers that he and Saeed are coming.
I'm waiting until work hours are over.
Okay, man.
Why are you coming to finish your transactions yourself?
Why haven't you classified your children?
Don't you have kids?
Are you okay, Sheikh?
Please, sir, take them.
Thank you, you've been very helpful.
He's of no use.
I'll leave you.
And go to the old people's home.
I don't want to tell them where I'm going.
What are you going to tell them, Abu Saeed?
I'm writing something else.
Yes, praise be to God.
He came out of the valley yesterday.
She is my sister.
Why are you worried?
I told him not to appear on TV or radio.
These "stop corruption" talks led us to ruin.
May God guide him to the right path.
Okay, sister. Goodbye, may God be with you.
Did he go to prison?
I was absent.
What do you say?
The program called My SEO Think
Talk to the real.
Khaled Jassem
And he said, "Stop corruption."
His colleagues at work heard him.
He started talking about the government.
Even oil and money
I don't know what happened to him.
No one from his neighborhood.
Those who encouraged him to do this,
Left him
God guide him.
Excuse me now because I have to go cook.
Welcome anytime.
Come, my son.
Stay here.
Stop corruption, my son.
I'm tired and fed up with this.
I've been in the hospital for two days.
You don't deserve it, mother.
I'm sorry to hear that happened.
I told you about this.
And what's wrong with that?
And he screamed.
This is an engagement.
God keep you safe this time.
I warn you.
Don't worry, mom.
Let's just not talk about it.
Stop corruption.
Why did the manager fire him?
It's sad that after all these years, you're firing me.
Don't listen.
Stop corruption.
Again, please.
Yes, prayer.
You're really crazy.
Those who follow public affairs and criticize.
knowing, learned, scholar, scientist
We just parted ways.
And you are one of them.
Nothing personal.
Okay, goodbye.
Brother Saleh
I hope your uncle Abu Munira doesn't find out about this.
He's actually mad at you.
Who knows him?
If you ask him
His saying that I work
I told you to use it, not to throw it away.
My mother said he's still working.
Of course
She has to say this today.
What can we do now?
We can't let our daughter suffer with him.
Anything you see to the right
I'll give him two weeks.
But if he doesn't find a job, I'll take him to court to get my daughter divorced.
Drink your coffee.
You never come around unless you want something.
Frankly
My father went out.
You are forbidden to go out.
I know you're dying to
The soul of the coffee shop
To speak nonsense
Go to your room and sleep.
And tomorrow morning, look for a job.
If God wills, I will get up early.
Mom, I told her I broke this habit.
By God
Mom, to be honest, I'm a bit bored.
And don't talk nonsense.
Act your age.
Change
What's happening, guys? Where's your voice? Why don't you speak like before?
We want to hear some of your stories about stopping corruption.
Stop corruption.
Stop corruption.
Is Saleh there?
Surely sleeping
Is something wrong with my son?
We saw him at the coffee shop.
He worked.
He did the right thing.
Because there were a lot of people around us.
Call him.
Don't waste your time.
If I see you here, I'll cut off your leg.
If it was your mistake,
His mistake was not stopping you.
I know you well.
You're like someone who has just quit smoking.
Whether you speak or not, the corruption speaks volumes.
I warn you.
If I heard you speaking on a radio program
He is committed to stopping corruption.
Professor Saleh, you are a good citizen, you have strong patriotism.
We can't hire you.
What can I do?
Forgive us
Hello Saleh, how are you?
I wish I hadn't gone to the trouble of coming, and we know that this is our duty.
Not much.
Eager to hear every day, "They stopped the corruption."
You're really brave. You don't fear anything.
Please say it, just once.
God bless you, I am.
Is this a cigarette? Just say "stop corruption" please.
He's begging you, just get it for him, just once.
This is amazing.
Now, the precious one.
Regarding the job
You are a loyal citizen and dear to us.
We were going to call you to let you know.
Your exposure in front of people.
Oh my God!
Everyone said there were no vacancies.
They really wanted to hire me, but there were no vacancies.
And now, how are you going to get money for you and your mother?
And don't forget.
And she has four children.
God helps you.
Do not despair.
Don't lose hope.
Never stop.
You need to look for a job every day.
So my father won't get angry.
I'd do anything for you.
I will never say stop corruption again.
Stop corruption.
You have no idea what I've been up to lately.
I told you.
But you never listen to me.
May God guide you.
I can't go to the minister and tell him about this man's story.
The minister is thinking.
Surely he thinks about her like that.
You're right.
But it's a serious matter.
We need to do something.
They say it changes your position, you know? Rumors like these are effective.
I'm trying to find a way to stop him.
I don't want anyone to feel like I'm behind it.
I agree with you.
What are you thinking about?
The only way to divert him from affecting our interests.
Have you heard about Saleh and ending corruption?
He lives in my neighborhood.
He's meddling in the affair.
I'm obsessed with your voice.
No good
I'm really impressed with you.
A dollar is a lot of money.
And God willing, soon.
He'll come back and we'll be enjoying hearing his voice.
Bu Fahd himself asks about you.
Fried potatoes
Why did you leave?
I had some problems, some health and psychological issues.
Frankly,
You are a liar.
It's been a long time since I last heard from him.
How wonderful, please allow me, Saleh.
Just once, do it for me.
I want to hear you talk about him.
Salih says he agrees.
No, guys, it's really difficult.
Your turn?
Men are begging you.
Abdulrahman, I have finally resigned.
You didn't tell us you were looking for a job?
Okay, this is your chance.
Satisfy him, let him hear your voice, and go ask him for a job tomorrow.
Surely it's driving you crazy.
I want what's best for you.
Do you know what?
Leave, go home.
No, no, no, we don't want your help anymore.
Okay, bro, wait up, let's discuss the matter.
No, we don't want to.
Okay, okay
Okay, if I speak one last time now, I'll retire and make it my last time.
What is Father Fahd hearing?
What's the problem that concerns him the most? You know, there are many problems here, more than enough.
What does he prefer to listen to? Or does he prefer noise? I don't know, tell me.
According to the contract.
Use his authority.
Seven and eighty bears = centimeter
Ruined it for him.
Don't interrupt me.
Why did the employee do that?
Where is issue seven?
Don't interrupt me.
Issue Seven, His Excellency the Minister
Why the employee?
When the ministry moved to its new headquarters
His friends' cars.
People, stop corruption.
Now that you're back, we need you to engage with the program.
"I'm a stubborn person, so this is the last time."
Because, frankly, I had resigned.
Mom, you didn't say that he had already left and that you were the one who stopped him.
My daughter
My daughter
The men who called it stopping corruption talked about it on the radio.
What I heard was just what people told me.
I'm sure someone from the ministry leaked it.
Get rid of him.
He is free.
Okay, Your Excellency the Minister
Don't worry.
My whole day is dedicated to serving the ministry. May God bless you.
Heard?
I said it for you only.
Ignore me.
He didn't speak to me.
Abdul Rahman told me he puts me.
He didn't speak to me.
Oh, how weak you are, Saleh.
I pity you.
I am Bu Fahd's secretary.
And I know the problem.
They used you to achieve their goals.
Unfortunately, they connected them.
Do you know who planned all this?
Your neighbors are Abdurrahman.
He was behind all this.
Bu Fahd will never employ you.
I'll do the same to him.
As long as you're famous.
No one is going to hire you.
I want to take you to court tomorrow for the divorce.
I found a solution.
We are the best community in the world.
Trouble-free
No, we don't have it.
We never have problems.
We are pleased
What is the bribe?
Everyone stand in line.
Because this system is here.
He gets more rights than a foreigner.
We rely on foreigners.
We don't have this.
Your effort and work make you the best; we don't have any problems.
Or an important officer
They fire you.
We don't have this here.
With regards
Salih Rashid Saad Rashid Al-Bahri
Known for stopping corruption.
I didn't want to have dinner.
I was running and pulling on my shirt and tore it.
He's jealous because you're wearing a new shirt.
Waleed saw me wearing the shirt I had just bought from Villaggio.
He jealously pulled it, tearing it apart.
His heart is kind, he can't blame.
I think
You, Adoul, saw my son Wasim and envied him.
It's not up to him.
Why did you make Walid a shirt?
I saw him wearing a new shirt and feeling jealous, ask your father to buy you a new one too.
What's your opinion about your age?
Why did you cut Waleed's shirt?
I'm telling you.
Don't force him to win against you.
Sultan is my brother.
Why don't you hit him in the face and make him disabled?
This is a child, still young, not your age, be ashamed.
Is this a boy?
Oh, child.
He needs people to raise him and fix him.
Not just left
Pay attention to your words, you fool! Sultan
You think I'm a child because you correct me.
Do you see yourself?
Bring up your child well.
And if I could
I respect him.
I don't want to confront him in front of his wife.
"And the tables"
If Adel beats Waleed again,
Consequence.
I'm the one wasting my time arguing with you.
Mind your manners.
Let me go show her.
Your argument is for fools.
Where are the old days?
And the intentions were clear.
Forgive us
Do you have a larger one than this?
No, no, this is the biggest one.
Leave everything and come now.
Come and see the troubles we're in.
What's wrong, my love? Tell me what happened.
Brother Ahmed, please forgive me, I have to go home. There's something urgent and I must go.
Adel's pants are lost.
This is a hateful and mentally ill person who hates everything.
He... He is a sultan.
How can a child cut all these clothes?
"God is sufficient for me, there is no power except by God."
Borileh
Sit and listen to me.
If you go and talk to him, he won't confess. He'll tell you it was the child.
And the solution is...
Walid knows how to ride a bicycle.
Yes, I know.
Walid, my love
I'm telling the truth.
Just tell me.
Where did you put the scissors, dear?
Under his bed.
May God destroy them, may He destroy their lives.
Just a moment
I won't be silent.
Crazy, insane
Until now
And do not change it.
But the computer is something else, I'll buy it for him.
I won't be silent.
Do you think our son Adel is the one who broke their device?
Let's see what's behind this matter.
No
Go laugh at someone else, maybe your friends but not me.
I told you this is Advil.
And you laugh at someone else, oh it's not me.
Alive, come here please.
Their hearts were kind.
And the intentions were clear.
Is there a child?
I'm not going to look for a quarter.
"To make fun of me, oh Sultanah."
With the false accusation against me
Hold this pair of scissors.
Empower yourself.
Hello, Abdulrahman. Come quickly, boy.
Come see your brothers Fahd and Sultan.
They fight every day, my son.
I don't know.
At such a meeting,
We must be.
Think about our actions carefully.
And the works of the people who came before us.
WC
It serves as a lesson for us.
We need to learn from them.
Don't act like children like this.
It's as big as a camel.
Do you have kids?
With zero knowledge
You are his role model, not them.
His role model is his father.
You, Sultan
And you, Fahd
And I am your older brother.
I have
I'll make him pay for the computer.
I greeted him.
We haven't forgiven each other.
No, I only greeted him to get rid of him.
It's never-ending chatter from Abdurrahman.
Where are you going?
I swear I won't let him.
Did you make tea?
Come out, don't hide.
Open the door if you're a man.
I never said that Abdelrahman was reconciled with you.
Seriously, if he doesn't stop now, I'll mess up the whole yard.
Your brother
Crazy
Your brother is crazy.
Burry it at the moment of tea.
On his head
Be quiet, be quiet, enough! Oh, these kids have no shame, they're hitting each other.
You're acting like children, stop it, oh my goodness.
I'll show you.
Hit him, hit him, ouch, boy, such a big bomb.
Blood, mother
You scared me with your voice.
Oh God!
Leave us alone with your evil.
Shame on you
Even though I was the one who reconciled you both.
I won't let you.
He came at night to reconcile with them.
He didn't have time, my daughter.
Oh, my life
Inshallah
Speaks fluently
Oh, girls!
May God guide you.
You need to calm them down.
Don't incite them to fight each other, girls.
What happened? Is everything okay?
You've disappointed me, Abdurrahman.
I want to help, not do it myself.
You are wise, my brother, my son. May God guide you.
Two hits in a row.
Stick out your hand.
You've shamed us, may God guide you.
Our neighbor Saeed is laughing at you.
Oh officer, we've told him repeatedly.
Don't believe him, Officer.
They were stoning, the three of them.
No problem.
No
Believe me, Officer, I saw them **from the window**.
Did you hear him?
Means very far away.
My friend was honest when he said it's 100% true.
Excuse me, since you've signed that your children won't do it again,
Thank you, thank you.
Welcome, my brother, welcome.
Officer, how are you going to get them out? I'm sure, believe me.
Listen to me.
I didn't want to say that in front of them.
Abdulrahman, the elder brother
Is the assistant the ministry's agent?
The one in the text is the head of a government agency.
Take two Panadol tablets and go to sleep.
Benadol! Officer.
Do you have two Panadol tablets here?
God is the source of justice.
God is the source of justice.
"Sufficiency is from Allah, the Just, and He is sufficient for me."
What is this * and %pw?
The boy is kicking me so much!
This is an adult's hand, it seems to be his father's.
Can you believe this?
He seems to be from a respectable family, and he is kind and polite.
And this is because I come from a poor family.
And what does it mean?
Chasing you
He doesn't take his eyes off you.
Annoyed you
And you say you didn't have a chance.
The day she saw you, she gave you a look, what does that mean?
Coincidence, you think!
You turned your head and she turned her head at the same time.
No, but surely there's something.
I notice when you enter.
She seems genuinely happy.
Go ask her about the pen.
Give her your notebook.
I don't know her name, believe it or not.
Too romantic
Oh man, we're in the 21st century.
You're really desperate.
In all honesty
It's been a long time since we sat and chatted like this.
No, there's good news in it.
From now on, I'll have more time to spend with you.
But you just go rest now.
Especially after yesterday's outdoor shoot in the desert.
We were tired, it was 2 PM, I told the secretary I didn't want any press or TV interviews, nor contracts.
I want to spend time with my family.
God be with you.
Even if you're busy,
The first thing that came to my mind
I have the shepherd's number, I'll call him today.
Late for what?
The villa has been sold now and the buyers moved in a few days ago.
You were distracted by TV series and photography.
Umm Abdul Aziz says they are poor and...
This is what God has written for them; we don't interfere.
Good morning, Uncle.
What happened?
This car, my son, stops every now and then.
It seems like the battery.
Don't worry, I have a charger and I'll charge it for you.
May God reward you with good.
At any time, uncle.
Peace be upon you
Walid Sadiq
Okay, tomorrow I'll start looking for a villa nearby so I can visit you every day.
What do you want now?
Alright, man.
Take it.
What's your full name?
Rashed Abdullah
The same name?
I said that to your father.
Your mother is honest.
I was so happy when I found out that Rashid Abdullah, my favorite actor, is our neighbor.
Everyone loves him.
They say he is kind and humble.
Neighborhood before housing.
My father takes pictures with me.
So my friends will believe me.
I couldn't believe our house was next door to the actor Raed Abdullah's.
Talk to him to make him believe.
Oh life
What we used to see on TV.
And we hope to see him.
Our neighbor has become, thank God, O God.
If they want a ship, I have one to sail in.
I'm happy to help, but oh! People, go easy on me, I'm not very used to it yet.
Have you heard about him?
This is from his kindness, and God will reward him for it.
Peace be upon you
Does this mean that the transfer of some employees to the new branch of the ministry in Dukhan has been confirmed?
They asked you who was moving.
I didn't hear the names.
But what I heard and am sure of.
Is Bouali among them?
My name!
We just don't know exactly who we're passing it on to.
I can't go, may God bless you. The smoke is too far, I can't reach it.
Whether you can or you can't, it's still work, man.
The committee is still considering the matter.
But if they chose you.
Thank you for the visit, Abu Waleed Thayb.
Thank you, thank you, O father of Ali.
Forgive us, the furniture is old.
We are neighbors today.
We're like family.
"Masha'Allah upon you, O father of Waleed."
May God reward you with good, O father of the child.
I've heard a lot about your kindness.
God, don't change things upon us.
Oh, my dear daughter!
I'd love to search the whole market for you until you find the most beautiful and expensive furniture that suits you.
When? To be honest, our furniture is very old.
We need to change it.
Inshallah
I've told you before,
If you need anything
Consider me your sister.
May you never make me cry.
Where did you go, my love?
I forgot to scold her when she called me yesterday.
Not because it tires you.
No more.
I'll call you later, goodbye.
In fact, I was chatting with her.
But these people are different from us.
They are rich, we are nothing compared to them.
"There's nothing on you, Mother."
Just wait a moment.
Just wait a moment.
And I'll give you the green light to propose to her for me.
I told you.
No, it's okay, Mom.
And you come to me and ask me to propose to you.
I put the dinner in the living room.
If you'd like to have dinner.
The driver is taking her to university now, God willing.
We agreed that we are family, right?
Whose car is this, then?
And soon, God willing.
I called to thank her.
Good people, they love good.
Yes, of course! Oh, dad!
Even our relatives don't do that to us.
Sure! Is my name on the list?
Are you sure?
Alas, why do problems keep chasing us?
I don't know what happened to me now that I've heard this news. What should I do? I don't know.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, go now, okay, okay, thank you, may God reward you, may God reward you.
What happened, oh Abu Ali?
The committee met today.
And a list of the names of the people who will switch to smoking.
My name is inside.
Talk to the manager to get your name removed.
I don't think it will be useful. Oh! Umm Ali, I don't think it will be useful.
I talked to him, he said there's no use.
Famous actor
Consider that your name was not on the list.
Blessings upon you, thank you, and no need for more, O Bou Salem.
If it's not a bother.
I want to take a picture with you to show my children.
My children will be happy.
God bless them.
Can you take a picture with me, actor?
"Good news, may God bless you."
Come on, please. Come on.
Sure, I'm happy to help.
You and whom you love
Teach me two or three days before that.
Mom, get ready.
Ready? Ready for what?
Are you crazy? What's wrong with you?
She said, "I don't mind."
Leave your mother alone.
Go to them.
Oh, my poor son.
I don't want them to feel that we are poor people.
You have to be fashionable.
I don't have any fancy dresses.
You've put me in a bind.
Why are you wearing all these jewels? I've never seen you do that before.
I don't care about him.
Mother of Ali
Um Ali is looking for a bride for her son.
She wants chic clothes and jewelry.
She wants to show them that they are rich and have wealth.
(Surprise) God willing
How lucky she is!
God willing, this forest will be your first and hiyaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
Inshallah you will hear.
You are a queen, God willing, a queen.
You need to be ready too.
They tell you to come see her father.
I'm not going in these clothes.
The day I'll enter wearing the new clothes.
Mom, watch her stuff.
"Masha'Allah on your mother-in-law, it's kind of her to give you her things. Just use them carefully."
Ah, ah
We need to be like them.
Why didn't his mother go to his engagement?
This was for the women.
I have to go and meet the guys.
As you can see, God bless you.
All that's left is the bisht, may God bless you.
Kind people helped me.
They were helpful, only the pashtun coat remained.
Dad, can I borrow it from you to complete the look?
Everyone stops for you.
But my brother Rashid, am I supposed to just let it go like that or hold on to it?
No, look, first of all
You need to close this.
I imprisoned myself.
The dress is loose but
God bless you.
The left hand needs to be in.
Relax your right hand, like that.
You're holding the coat from the bottom.
Wow, wow
Oh, wow!
You need to slow down your steps a bit.
Oh! PW, yes.
Now you look like a millionaire.
What did they give you, okay, seconds
Put your left hand like this, your left hand, this way.
Do you know my friend Aisha?
What's wrong with her?
Do you know what she was telling me earlier today?
She told me, "Because you're my friend, and I don't want us to be far from each other."
I'm telling my brother to propose to one of you.
Tell your friend the truth, don't tell her brother and embarrass her and yourself.
I've been noticing a lot of suitors are interested in you these days. A few days ago, you told me that Saud wanted you for her uncle, and today, this one wants you for her brother.
They want to take my beloved.
And I'm just sitting here looking.
Do they know about our relationship?
They just know we're colleagues.
Zayn's family
They need to know tomorrow.
Why did Waleed refuse?
I'm screaming
You reject my son Walid.
The actors are more sincere than you, two-face.
But you
Working all your life.
This is what reflects you.
To serve people
You lie to people.
Wearing costumes in life in front of everyone.
I wore the bisht while acting on television.
It's me, not you!
Wearing accessories, gold and jewelry.
To play
You are getting married.
What scene?
A man walks ahead of his wife.
He put his keffiyeh on his cheeks.
Don't turn it more than 90 degrees to the left or right.
She reminds me of your friend you were talking about who works with you in the same office.
Is he with a girl and a boy?
Why is he walking like that?
As they said,
May God help him, O man.
Secret of a lady, don't stop.
He has no personality at all.
He laughs, happy!
Show us the city center.
No, no, no, no, it doesn't look good when you're sitting.
You look better when you're walking, when you stop, stop, stop.
I beg you, Thursday.
Hello, are you going downtown?
Come, father, I want to talk to you.
Where are you going? Stay with us for a while.
His wife is nagging him.
Are you happy with it?
Oh! Thursday
Play it, and if the introduction is there.
I'm changing the channel because I'm afraid it will get me into trouble.
Indeed, always.
Sitting with Salem, my colleague at work.
Talk to her.
I hung up the phone in my face. Take the phone. Take it.
The phone stopped ringing, and now it's bothering me.
Now you say I'll let you talk to her because we have a woman with us.
Now can you kick me out of the house?
Get out!
I'm not the first one to get divorced.
No, no, no, I can't, oh! My brother!
I don't want to torment my mother in her grave.
It was entrusted to me.
She said, "Don't shoot."
No, no, no, I can't, it's impossible.
Are you trying to find something?
No, no, no, stay, stay.
You are completely crazy.
Don't sell me your madness.
Tell me, I want to know what happened.
No, no, no, Mother, don't say that about him.
Salem is particularly one of the best men in our town.
I want you to get a divorce.
Even if he asks me for a divorce, I'm stupid to divorce. It's not reasonable.
Official Thursday went crazy.
Leave me alone, please.
I was talking to him alone.
May God guide you.
Poor thing, it breaks the heart.
My father gave him an important message from the minister's office.
"You want to give it to him? May God guide you."
No, nothing, nothing
Give it to me, I'll connect it for him.
It's about the meeting with the women's delegation tomorrow.
Women's delegation
What's wrong with you! Don't you want to sleep today?
Hello Salem
I am your brother, Khamis.
No, I'm speaking to you very consciously.
Oh! My brother.
Remove my name so I don't attend.
How do we delete your name?
The only person who can remove your name is His Excellency the Minister.
It's a meeting at the ministry.
Official meeting
Who spoke?
Healthy, healthy, healthy
Tell the truth.
Who is the woman you were talking to?
Safe and sound, I delivered, and indeed, he was safe.
If you were chatting with Salem
Will you speak louder?
That lie won't help.
Don't lie, Khamis.
You're not telling the truth!
Wearing casual clothes.
She thinks I'm chatting with a girl.
Oh, the life of misery.
God bless you, please say hello to Cole.
Please, just believe me.
He asked you to call.
This is none of your business.
Mind your own business, or something unpleasant will happen to you.
They complain about you.
Hello!? Hey, you!
How do you manage to live with a wife who has such a long tongue?
Let's start the meeting now.
Hasan is going to call Khamis.
Alright, let's discuss the real estate budget first.
Let's start.
Let's hope he finds it.
He was afraid when he saw the women.
I searched the whole ministry and you're just sitting here.
Come on, come on, people are waiting in the meeting room.
I can't sit with the women.
Oh! Thursday, how do you know your wife?
I'm afraid she'll call.
Oh no, you're going to suspect me, you don't understand.
If I don't answer her, how will I return home?
Your wife is calling at this hour!
Of course, because your company is large.
This project that your company will undertake for the ministry.
It is one of the largest projects in the history of our ministry.
Oh! People, why is the table shaking?
No, I'm not old, not the table, I am.
You can answer your call.
Who is this?
Sorry, who do you want to speak to?
My phone is %pw.
I understand, okay, wait a moment.
He fell because he was afraid to go home.
Oh, brothers!
His wife told him not to come home unless he changed his job and stopped working with women.
That's why he sent a book to the ministry to have us transferred away from here.
The very same minister told me he approved of it. What more does he want!
What's wrong with his wife?
This is madness.
I ask him who spoke.
I told you he's crazy.
What are you going to do! Your wife and kids are coming back tomorrow.
I don't know what to do.
Since you did what you wanted, why are you afraid to go home and see your children?
She wants official proof.
Okay, give her the papers.
Okay, this is what I did: I sent the paper with her brother.
To see the minister's signature and confirm it.
And if God wills, we will agree. If she agrees, God willing, I will return home tonight.
Brother, this is the minister's signature.
What else do you want?
He will start attending the new department from tomorrow.
Which is an office and a job different from the one he used to work in.
Where is the administration, may God reward you?
Oh, God bless you, that's the minister then.
"Nothing, nothing. That's what's on your right."
Yes, of course, God bless you.
Please come in, your office is ready.
Saad and Abdul Qadir, God willing, will have a big office. Yes.
safety first
How are you coming for the ride?
The whole department is women.
My wife
No one can execute another decision except the minister himself.
You have to work until the minister returns.
Oh! My brother, make a deal with your friends.
And you address them with masculine names so your wife won't know.
And I put in two extra for the new employee.
The new employee is a real employee.
A few days ago, the minister's office referred someone to work with us.
Shaking?
He looks funny, poor guy, a man working with five women, he looks funny.
They say his wife is very jealous of the women around him.
Blind jealousy
Poor them, they are in need.
He just asked us to be quiet when his wife called, and we complied and didn't speak.
"Which Abdelkader is with you in the office?"
**** See if it fits you.
My son called me and told me that his wife was coming to the office.
What are you doing?
The lady's spirit is in the first room on your left.
This is in the welfare office.
With him ***
These are six employees.
And this is what I'm sure he's coming to work on.
Liars don't walk on me.
My wife is jealous of the women around me.
Because Wesam is handsome.
May God guide you, Sultan.
We just want to know what stage we've reached.
Uncle, Sager and I were at the bank yesterday.
that the project
Peace be upon you
Brother, I have an important meeting at work today.
Go to the kitchen quickly.
Dressed, neat, my age, and ready.
On the contrary, your place is the kitchen.
Women must obey men.
And the scorpion's sting is painful.
This is indeed important, rain, see, see.
Look, uncle.
Aisha, please call the secretary and ask him to inform the employees.
If the meeting is postponed until tomorrow.
Insha'Allah there's nothing serious.
They continue to issue orders.
And we must apply
They should know you're an important observer.
I have a lot of responsibilities and commitments.
They consider women as servants.
I've never seen people despise women like they do.
At what age do they feel they are truly alive?
They told me not to go to work today, and to go to the kitchen to make tea instead.
Where are the restrooms?
And the second one escaped a week ago.
Even the servants can't bear their harm anymore.
I understand them.
God be with you.
There are few banknotes.
Tea
Oh uncle, they mean
In truth, the villa complex is worth nothing without a park.
Okay, now, the park...
Sister, before you go out, I want to speak to you privately about something.
My beloved Fatoum, I must go, I'm late.
Okay, tell me, what do you have?
Speak or I'll leave.
And he played at school.
A committee from the Jawa Women's Association today
And the school nominated me to be in the league.
Are you crazy?
And you want to go to the league?
You know if you tell your uncle and brother about this, you won't see any good.
You're the one to blame.
We warned you.
Why don't you come and see me? I haven't seen you in a long time.
It's been a year now, a year since I saw you.
Are you married yet?
Oh, God guide you.
Who would agree to marry a woman whose mother doesn't have a degree?
No, no, no, it doesn't matter if he's my mother, he's still a man.
And Thursday was born Escobinaría
The scorpion's sting hurts.
And then he has to marry someone from his own social class.
"Follow like its shadow"
God helps you.
"Oh my god! I'm living!"
Once the minister traveled, all the transactions were resolved for me.
Mustafa, the head of the HR department, was informed that I want to meet him tomorrow.
The ministry's guests arrived today.
You have the table.
And now I'm free to talk to you, oh! Aisha
What, Mary?
Okay, I'm coming, okay, I'm coming now.
What can I say, Aisha Oh!
My brothers are the root of all these problems.
I don't know what happened.
It's okay, my love. The snow is good for your face so it doesn't swell.
We've already warned her not to go and talk to them about this matter.
They went to her, she was beaten.
You know if I tell them it's football.
They used to whip you a long time ago.
Shame on you, play football!
Next time, we'll break your neck.
I know who's talking to you.
The Big Scorpion
This small
Come on, man, I only hit her once.
Heard?
I chose Economics and Political Science.
I chose graphics because it's in demand these days.
Architecture!
It's not your turn.
You've got your chance.
Don't be greedy.
Okay, Scorpion.
Hit her, break her teeth in her mouth.
Let me slap her.
She's with me here.
Go to the Scholarships Department.
And cross out architecture.
Take your time.
To make sure
I spoke to Sultan and Saqr.
They have no objection to Manira getting married.
What else do you want?
Our son Thursday deserves all good.
I'll arrange a meeting with them and let you know.
Your nomination will be with the delegation.
I understand your personal circumstances.
Just give yourself a chance to think about it until tomorrow.
To tell you the truth,
They care about you a lot.
And your nomination by the minister.
He is honest.
I know my brothers well.
They agree.
I'm surprised.
Their car loans are paid from my salary.
And I'm the one who provides for the house.
And I agreed to travel with her.
We're marrying her off this week.
What are you saying?
Stupid Thursday, he doesn't even have a school certificate.
Marry him and travel with him.
Let's go, come on.
Shame
They'll kill her if she refuses.
Oh! I've told you many times.
Why don't you go?
Tomorrow, I'm going tomorrow.
As long as he's a forgiving child.
Appearance is what matters.
I don't want to marry Thursday.
And go to the kitchen.
Put it in the living room.
Madrid vs Barcelona match tonight
I hope Valencia doesn't beat us.
Reliable sources
She is loyal and hardworking.
What's your opinion on this?
What do you want me to do?
We have to go.
Please go to your offices.
Thank you, and may God grant you a long life.
Longevity
They serve coffee there.
Happiness
May God grant her a long life.
Welcome, may Allah prolong your life.
Good morning, Sir.
May God grant you a long life.
Did you wash the coffee cups?
Go pour Captain Emad his coffee.
And also
We're going to play in China after tomorrow.
Captain, I forgot to introduce you to my sister, Mary.
Going to the official engagement party.
Are you stupid?
You don't know anything about life and you want to marry a minister's daughter.
Greet %pw for me.
Yes, Madam
Pour it and level it.
Behind the scenes of the actors
You know, Mishaal talked to me a few minutes ago.
What can I say?
It's a pity that Danov doesn't suit Mashael.
Nouf is a fifteen-year-old girl.
And torches shaped in the twenties
Okay, why don't you take Mary's role?
Suits her better.
Noof is thirty.
We need to get rid of the person who scrutinizes everything in the committee.
There's an issue, and I'm sure it won't let things go smoothly.
It's detailed.
He talks about art, family values, moral art, content, etc.
Who chose me for this committee?
The minister is the one who formed the committee.
You, me, and Hamad can influence him.
No, no, no, this is impossible.
Nothing proves it's ours.
Even if he went and asked at the Ministry of Economy,
He won't find our names.
The company is registered under the name of Mrs. Hamed. May God bless you.
Don't worry.
Don't worry, I mean, who's the head of the committee?
The last word is mine.
No, no, Real, everything is fine, please go ahead.
I thought I'd talked to them, spoke with them, and we agreed on everything.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, welcome Rashid, please come in.
As you know, this meeting is specifically to decide whether we approve the series "Blackmail of Conscience" or not.
And produced by the Modern Touch Arts Institute
A nice, strange, and bold action series.
I agree with Hamed.
The storyline of the series is really great.
I agree with you.
I liked the day I took the weapon and killed my neighbor.
And he wanted to hide the weapon, so he put it in the car.
And she did not know that he was her son, he was the one who caused it, and the police came one day.
And her sons are coming from school.
And kick the box.
He burst his bubble and flew through his mother's window.
This is the surprise.
This part of the box is inside the mother's room.
And it's great that a local company produces this advanced level of products.
We need to encourage and support them.
Mr. Rashid, you didn't tell us your opinion.
You've left me nothing to say.
With all due respect to your opinions and impressions of the series, this is "blackmail of the conscience."
Blackmailing human values
Disgusting surprises
Every episode, a person and a half.
We'll leave the second half for the next episode.
This series is written without social awareness.
It doesn't have a moral message to help society evolve.
Himalaya's tears are bound to make the audience cry.
"Excuse me, Rashid."
You gave us your opinion, Ali gave us his opinion, let Mr. Rashid give his opinion.
Clear from the meeting.
That there is an agreement between you.
You arranged it.
Some people understand, and this is their field, others have no business in the field.
What I like is this series.
I'm afraid he'll cause us problems.
Leave him.
He can't do anything.
I'll do what I want.
He gave me the bag and said, "This is from Madam Samira."
I don't know what to do.
I can't believe it, oh Nasser.
It's a new series we'll be producing soon.
The one where the driver rapes the girl.
Count the blessings we have because of him.
The first blessing is the sweet ring on your hand.
I'm telling you how.
So they present it in the name of Hamed's wife, who is the one who sent you the ring.
And your husband's role was to cover their backs.
He has a five percent share of the production.
Sweet dream
You played a similar role, didn't you see "Lost Dreams"?
By the way
It's called blackmail or something like that, I don't remember.
Ah, dream extraction.
Why are all the names similar?
All the series from last year were about girls.
You notice that every series has more than eight or even ten girls.
Your place is guaranteed.
You are very beloved.
How lucky you are!
What's your age?
Okay, okay
Sorry, honey, I have to go to work. I don't know what happened there.
Eat and trust.
He said he wanted to see me about a very important and urgent matter.
I have to go.
I heard that Rashid met the minister.
Sat with him for half an hour.
And I told him that you were involving him.
I told you he complained about us to the minister.
What happened was that the minister's office called and they want to meet me.
And I'm also afraid that the minister will believe him.
I see the minister.
The men are coming to explain their viewpoint about the series.
This is all.
This is true, Your Highness.
But first, Your Honor, I'd like to say that it's not acceptable to talk about your colleague behind his back.
We all know that Rashid...
He's jealous of everyone around him.
He only cares about financial interests.
That's just his specialty.
Only God blesses you; not every educated person can handle these artistic matters.
Especially television production
Extorting the serial conscience we're working on
Mass production
We will have a media initiative at the Gulf level.
Strong distribution
Of course, your expertise in this matter is more specialized than mine.
I promised a promise for a big series.
This is what makes us proud.
Look at what the journalist Abdulhamid is writing. Listen, listen.
And then one of the homosexuals said
The series promotes immoral ideas.
What is limited to the fall of modesty.
This is indeed bold and strong criticism.
They'll be in big trouble if journalist Abdel Hamid writes about them.
And if the people I'm shipping knew about the situation.
But they are also smart, they know how to deal with him.
These are garages.
We need to create our own website.
And list all the activities of our company.
What's the name of the company again?
From now on, you're the media advisor.
The conscience extortion series supervised by the Mercury Media Production Company is considered
A qualitative shift in Arab drama
Because it carries moral values and ideas.
This is a series aimed at developing society.
He's the same journalist who criticized them a few days ago.
Is it possible that he changes his opinion to its opposite?
How could he accept that?
The journalist Abdulhamid and those like him
What's wrong with Professor Hamed?
I told him, "It's going to be the best series in the Arab world."
I hope so.
I feel our series is going to be a hit.
I don't know where it is.
The second one is getting ready and is prepared to go.
A beginning is not necessarily an exciting beginning.
Your stories are always unrealistic, and the events never actually happened.
It's clear at first glance.
Your writers are stupid.
*Mumkin yusir* (Possible to happen)
Your series is very very boring.
What do you think?
Very tragic.
The flaws of other series are not an excuse.
This output is understood from the first time.
These are hidden lines and dimensions that require someone to focus in order to discover them.
By the way, it's a political drama.
It's a pity he saw it.
What happened?
I wasn't this nervous yesterday.
I was at Souq Waqif yesterday with Ali.
We were at a coffee shop.
You ignored me.
Nasser, what do you think about what happened? The minister is upset. This is a big problem.
In a week, we'll all be expelled.
The series failed; everyone who watched it said it was a failure.
I heard that Rashid is planning to visit him.
And his saying that the series is a failure and has no action.
This is a disaster.
Leave it to me.
Let's see what Nasser will do.
Hear oh! O Eli
From now on, I don't want any criticism of the series on your page.
Oh Eli, please.
A few days ago, I read an article that didn't just criticize the production, but also cursed it.
Don't irritate me.
I'm sorry.
That day I was free.
I wouldn't let them write this.
But honestly, I didn't receive any message with praise.
Once again, great success.
safety first
Brother Rashid,
Do I believe you or the newspapers?
Conscience unburdening is the best TV show.
I hope your life is long; they have an agreement.
Listen to what the other newspapers are writing.
They also have an agreement with the viewers' page.
My heart is killing me.
After a while, they told me.
Your luck is satisfied by the minister.
Frankly, Nasser
Be ready to watch the second part of the movie "Blackmail of Conscience".
No, no, no, no, oh! Oh, brother!
Cyril said he wouldn't write again.
He prefers to stay in his miserable job.
Part two after all this exhaustion.
And a third and a fourth after
And what's wrong with you? You don't want to help?
One of his friends told me.
Here I am
What is the magician doing?
I wish you more and more success.
I wish you would tell us your opinion about this success.
I thank God for this success.
They are jealous and envious of our success.
I feel it's strange.
This series wins awards and is a failure.
These are the experts.
They've awarded prizes for it, so they must see something we can't.
Prepare a second part of the series.
Alright, may your life be long.
A real wizard.
"Blackmail of the conscience" is gone.
I saw you chatting with the minister at the beginning of the event.
TV festivals are captivating!
I heard him say, "Be ready for part two."
It's the same thing.
The bank cleans it and it becomes clean.
All the weak, trivial, and degenerate series you watch
They nominate it in Arab and Gulf festivals.
So they clean it and give it awards because people consider it a high class.
Yes, truly.
As long as the rulers are the same producers.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you. Praise be to God for your safety.
It's true we signed a contract with them, but they want to lower the prices.
Come to my office.
We're not a small bakery or a bread shop.
We are one of the largest bakery companies in the world.
We won't let him down.
"Or we'll terminate the contract."
We signed the contract yesterday.
With the British company.
"He poured and his father drank."
I am at your service.
Do a job like no other.
He will be the first one in the world to produce this product.
He's not just the best baker in the world.
I'm telling you
How to bake bread with a twist
You can open it with your hand or go to the kitchen to look for a knife to cut it, and you might cut your hand.
So the bread contains clouds.
So we can put the cheese and close it again.
This is not bread, this is a pair of trousers.
What do you think, this is a bag of bread.
How can we remove this zipper?
If that's the case, one can tell their friend, "I've eaten two clouds."
Why didn't we receive the pastries from Jabal Al Noor Hospitals yesterday?
I know, but why didn't he arrive yesterday?
The bakers who make it.
Once again, use the bakers.
This is what happened, Professor.
Why are you shouting at him?
You wasted your time with soccer and delayed my work.
You know your son loves football.
And what's the problem if he takes a few employees from the company to hang out with him?
You have four thousand employees in the company.
11 starting players
Four substitutes, two administrative assistants, that's it, seventeen in total.
Team spokesperson
Why are you upset about him?
Just fine for now. Although the fans are the most important players on the field, they are the twelfth player.
I let you enjoy them.
And we actually signed a contract with the people.
It's the first time he told you he wanted to play football.
He heard your words.
Didn't do anything
No, you're only upset with him because he let some of the employees play football in front of him and have fun.
I said he couldn't take some of the employees.
Even if some of your friends need employees, you can lend him some.
Important bakers
Oh, my son, why are you taking the important bakers? This is not right.
Next time, inform me before you hire any staff.
No, no, let Hamdi do this paperwork.
He is in the hospital.
Why didn't they tell you?
I finished work and got into the car.
The principal spoke to me.
I went to him.
He said they didn't find a goalkeeper, and they have an important match today.
He said, "Let's find a goalkeeper," and then we arrived at the stadium.
Wear the goalkeeper's suit.
I've never played soccer nor touched a ball.
That story
Stupid
And we'll get you a job instead of wasting your time with football.
Let me explain.
"Do you really want to cancel and disband the team?"
Yeah, right.
Okay, please.
I can't let the team down, tomorrow's the final match.
No, no, no, he is truthful.
Do you agree?
Congratulations on your win.
Congratulations, Professor Nasser, on winning the cup.
We wanted to know how you planned to win.
See, I've prepared the team psychologically, physically, and mentally, and the coach did a good job.
At the hotel
Congratulations to you all, and there's a party tonight.
It seems happy.
I'm just afraid he might be nice and polite.
Oh Uncle Bu Nasser, firstly we'd like to congratulate you on the great victory of your team, the Global Bakers Team.
This great achievement
Blessings of Allah upon you, no, no, no.
No picture without a bisht. Wait, wait, be patient.
No, no
Wearing the bisht
Your attention, care, and creative insights played a significant role in this success, undoubtedly.
And the coach's plan
They also played 5-5-3-2 in the finals.
And as an athlete, you know that changing the game plan confuses the players, nevertheless, the bakers' team didn't get confused and did a tremendous job.
And the coach's plan
Bo Nasser, as the first athletes in the International Bakers Team, what do you suggest the players do?
Infinity
Welcome, welcome!
Longevity
Hello, is Hamud Sultan with them?
Welcome, but they must have dinner with us first.
Dinner, okay!
Thank you, Abu Abdulaziz.
And it is considered a contribution to the private sector.
The team is still young.
Don't envy me.
No, who?
Bu Abdulaziz
The motors we use in the factory.
"You se
I've wanted to meet him for a long time.
Football introduced us, I told him that.
I said to him, "Oh! Abu Abdulaziz!"
You've never been interested in football your whole life.
Mind your own business.
The ball was always close to me, there were only fifty centimeters between us.
Has Abu Nasser not arrived yet?
No, he hasn't arrived yet today.
At a seminar on sports injuries, the platinum sponsor must be present.
You get more.
Did you see the building behind the bakery that he wanted to convert into worker housing?
He is obsessed with football.
As usual, we tend to meet and interview a figure in the sports field.
This man inspires the bakery team with his great ideas.
And how is the Global Bakery Team doing? We heard you've made comprehensive improvements.
Compared to offices, all efforts.
This is a small amount, just a million dollars for all these efforts.
No, my friend, be honorable.
It's not my fault, brother Shahin.
My mistake.
What's my fault?
You told me you wanted players from the Gulf countries.
Gulf prices are considered the highest.
Which means if a player costs two thousand.
For the Gulf, it costs three or four million dollars.
I didn't understand it, explain it to me.
Receive a fax from here
And he read it in front of me when he was with you.
Dad bought four new players for the team, not a new batch of four players.
You know, he's amazing. He can easily beat Billy and Ronaldinho.
But eight hundred thousand is written on it.
Oh yes, God bless you, but it's a Turkish number.
In the UAE, they sell it for 1.2 million.
Don't look at me.
Okay, can we inspect the goods?
Here
Duck
Fine, okay.
No, no, no, I guarantee you.
He is strong, praise be to God, very strong.
This is elegant, perfect for the text.
The connecting muscle
It is the most important muscle; a player is useless without it.
Thank you.
Let the driver take them to the Automatic Club. Automatic, I said! Automatic.
How are you?
Hamdi, let's go.
Congratulations! Congratulations!
These are, God bless you, young players.
Yes, we get them from the forests of Africa.
We feed them, raise them, and then release them into the wild.
God bless you, you can take it. Do you have a place for it, or should I take it with me in the van?
When he saw them pressuring us
The forward was asked to play.
Kakana mokallali dindah, nu.
Let the defender play.
Kagumakakani Lololo was supposed to play.
Rookie coach
Even if it's on Mars.
Spain! Even if it's a coach on Mars.
I like his style of play.
This has to be on the north road.
There are rules to the game.
Even if it's just two days.
What's happening? Why are you shouting?
Your stupid son
He's not convinced that the coach is an expert in football.
Listen, she speaks like Mitsu.
He knows that the attacking player Selolo Tekawawa is a good midfielder, as Ahmed El-Tayeb said.
No one will give you a headache.
Just stay away.
I know how to deal with him.
Why did the team lose?
The team should think about changing the plan.
Because the players are not playing in their positions.
And player Takulamaka Kolalalalo is in the wrong position, he needs to be moved to his usual place.
The coach to change the ...
To refuse Hopway Malalo
Okay, okay, okay
No, no, no, no, what happened in the stadium?
This shouldn't happen.
The coach shouldn't do that.
Please postpone these topics until the game is finished.
People are watching this happen in front of the camera.
Fourth goal for the Success team, the ball entered the goal area.
The player who scored the fourth goal is the man of the match today.
The coach's brain is not in his head.
He says, "Uncle Bu Nasser no longer wants you as a coach for his team."
And you be quiet.
I'm watching the match on TV and you're sitting on the bench, do as I tell you.
Don't do that, it's not good.
Tomorrow we have a game. How are we going to play without a coach?
What's your father doing?
Alright! Rashid
What's happening with you? You scared me, tell me what's happening with you?
Divorce me, mother, divorce me.
I divorced her! How?
I don't know, Mother, I don't know.
Why did he divorce you? You were married for less than a month.
"I swear, mother, I don't know, I don't know %pw."
You divorced me without a reason!
Oh my god.
"By God, mother, I don't know. Suddenly, he came and told me to go to your family's house."
I asked him, "What happened?" He said, "You are divorced."
I swear, I don't know what's going on.
They were only married for a month. What will people say about us?
I agree with you.
I don't know what to say.
All I know is that he divorced you.
Sit down. I'll be back in a minute.
Because of her high morals.
I left Barcelona.
Oh light of my eye, Abdullah.
Yanni is crying.
He said she insulted Barcelona, a team he is very attached to and respects.
She insulted him and hurt his feelings.
He told me, "Mama, curse Barcelona," and I said to him, "Divorce her and I'll get you another one."
To tell him that your daughter got divorced because she insulted Barcelona FC.
Just for that reason, divorce her sincerely.
It doesn't matter to me.
Is it easy to hurt someone's feelings?
The wife questions her husband's loyalty.
I can't believe what I'm hearing!
We don't need a girl who doesn't respect international teams.
This time, she started making fun of Messi.
Disagreements between a couple are normal and inevitable.
Replace the unit with a thousand daughters.
There are many girls who want to marry him.
Listen to me.
I don't want to hear anything.
And please, don't interfere. This is my son, and I know him well.
I told you, it's none of your business.
I'm upset with you.
Don't worry, my son, and don't think about it.
Instead of one, there are a thousand girls.
Why are you upset?
But the day I remember her words
Real Madrid is better than Barcelona.
My dear Zain
What's wrong with her!
Her name is Mona.
She was married for one month?
If I tell you her story and why she got divorced, you won't stop laughing.
So that he can benefit you, he will take you in.
What's the point of a person like this divorcing his wife for a football team?
The hairdresser knows them and told me the whole story. Mom, don't involve me in this, I don't want to get mixed up with these people.
Okay, you're listening to the barbers' idle talk.
Tell them I didn't agree.
Let her say her nonsense and say what she wants to say.
Grace follows hardship.
I told her, "Girl, don't stop your blessings."
If it were just her money, I wouldn't care.
But she's taking her wealth and ours with her.
This building
He never refuses me a request.
God save us from this bad barber.
They hear a rumor and spread it.
Don't listen to her.
Tell her and make her understand not to close the door of opportunity that opens for us.
He knows how to convince her.
You must be kidding, you actually believe he divorced his wife because of Barcelona?
Ignore the nonsense and foolishness.
Don't miss the opportunity.
And maybe she is the reason or there is something wrong that made him divorce her.
Listen, girl, don't let Abu Burgin go, don't let him slip through your fingers.
What is this two-towered thing?
But when they get closer, they realize it's two towers.
That's why they called his father Shahin Abu Burujain.
God bless you.
Oh, no, no, no. Sweet. Thank you. Thank you.
Yes, thank you. Go ahead.
May God grant you a long life, they already took the money, you signed and they spent it.
Your happiness was absent-minded and you seemed very busy, that was a month ago.
The first wedding was a month ago, this is a new wedding, divorced.
He was married and divorced.
Yes, this is his third marriage.
And that's his story, my friend. He's going through a tough time.
Oh! Real, this is a difficult generation.
Opinion and Counter-Opinion
Congratulations, congratulations, O daughter.
My darling, don't forget the rug. I've placed it on top of the bag.
So you can take it with you when boarding the plane.
When you reach London
Oh dad, don't you want to go to London?
Hello, Mom.
Fine, normal.
Because she comes with us and then does shopping.
Malaysia, Malaysia.
Malaysia, take the fur with you.
Goodbye, Mother.
What's wrong with her?
I don't know.
I ask her, not knowing what's going on.
Tell me, my daughter, what happened?
The best thing you did was ignore her.
It's nothing.
On your honeymoon, she's supposed to pamper you and take care of you in every way.
Reasonable, it's a water dispenser!
The cup in your hand is what you hold and drink from.
I didn't receive a good education.
I should have told her to drink water from my mother's hands since my birth.
What's wrong with her?
She looks very upset.
And who is this lady with you?
Her name is Mishaal.
Oh my age, divorced on the honeymoon.
You won't believe me if I tell you her story.
Bless you, auntie. Thank you.
Your aunt is a student, and so are your uncles.
I don't know where Mom booked us.
Hello, Mom.
Where did you book us?
Because she wants to go there with us.
There is no power or might except with Allah.
Why did he do that at the airport and why did he take the children?
What happened between them?
You're asking me, I have no idea what happened between them!
Grandfather of madness
Where is Manar?
She's in her room talking to that idiot.
And now she says she's been calling him for two days but his phone is turned off.
She just found him.
We're waiting to see what he has.
How do you know he's upset? The boy is tired from outside and wants to rest.
Mom, I tell her every day to peel the apples, but she doesn't do it. She annoys me every day.
And you know I don't like apples with their skin.
She peels the apple.
Hello, let me tell you.
Divorced.
And one more time when necessary.
Go, my light.
Go, my light.
Manira, how's it going?
Why are you still upset!
Say it three times and tell him, "You are divorced."
Be quiet, may God give you health.
I don't know, mum, who saw me at the disco in Spain and told you.
He has nothing to say.
He really has nothing to say.
She dances twice or three times.
And whoever divorces my daughter will die.
How did he divorce you?
Where are you going?
Where are you going? I'm going to pour out my anger on this man who has no shame.
It has a tail like a peacock.
Embellished with gold, rubies, coral, and diamonds.
And the other girls are a game for you and your son.
They have no families or mothers to feel the bitter taste in their throats.
The people you gossip about.
And divorce them according to your own judgment.
She didn't make you water to drink, she cursed Barcelona, divorce her and forget her.
Those who went to a nightclub
Without shame or embarrassment
A ministry agent, Arab and Muslim.
He cares about his reputation and that of his children.
Stay still and don't move.
You have a bit of humanity.
It was my father's right.
Who sells land like this?
Take it from Dad by force, Abu Sakr.
Why is he selling it?
God guide you, if Abu Saqr wants something, can anyone say no to him?
Leave it to God, man.
Please, go ahead.
Come on, let's go.
What happened to your project, Abu Saad?
As you know.
Okay, last week you said you were going to the library?
I told you, if you want to get your project off the ground, you need to start paying for it.
Abu Sakr, the great millionaire
What does he eat? In this world, is there anyone who doesn't eat?
What my brother is doing is not a problem; we'll let him eat until he's full, we'll fill his stomach. The problem is how we'll reach him.
And you need to know Abu Sakr's key so that all the doors will open for you.
I saw him once and greeted him several times.
All you need to know is that you're paying him and managing your work; you just need to know the right time.
The secretary told me that Abu Sakr was waiting for you for dinner.
I came right away.
Abu Sakr, may God protect him, hosts a gathering every day.
Oh man, anyone.
He loves to congregate and hang out with his buddies.
It's really nice to live on this farm at night.
Yes, Your Highness, this is Abu Nasser, the owner of the car agency behind the mall.
He wants to get to know you, Your Highness.
I got the license.
As if my son got the driver's license.
Thank you, may God reward you with good.
Congratulations on your license, Falcon.
God bless you.
Abu Sakr
Please don't let me down. Say "okay."
Just say yes, Your Highness.
As a gift for him.
And after your permission, don't say no.
My job is going well.
In English, the sentence translates to: "So easily you saw each other and talked to each other."
Don't be stupid.
Yeah, it's okay, Abu Nasser.
Tell me what the technique is, what did you do?
Circumstances were in my favor.
The day we were sitting with him.
His son is almost done with his driver's license.
I have a gift, a falcon.
If the matter is about the car,
This is easy.
"Come on, take me to him."
Yes, it's done.
She has just been discharged from the hospital.
Tonsillectomy
And he will surely make a feast.
You deserve the health of your son, my pride.
We hope he gets better. We hope he gets better, God willing. May he not see harm, God willing.
And we met at a rosary shop.
I think so.
Oh, my God, we grew up and forgot.
They told me your son Shahin was in the room in front and left.
So I thought I should visit you.
And I congratulate you with good health, Shahin.
"Listen, oh! Your Highness, it's not right for you to leave without having dinner with us."
He has land in Mali.
Just say yes first.
Because our dear son Shahin has left the hospital,
My tower is on the corniche.
Just say yes.
Oh! My lad, don't be stubborn.
Mom, don't try. I don't like business and I have no interest in it.
Who can start a project without capital these days?
At the vehicle and crane agency, he said, "Just let him gesture."
Love is from God, and people love you because of their love for your father.
Until university,
All the doctors love and respect your father.
Most of them are in his office every night.
Whatever God wants, your father is loved by everyone but you.
Oh! And people are taking loans from banks to start a business or trade.
Am I at the supermarket?
Is there an open pickle shop?
This is still something new.
This is a falcon, the apple of my eye. He brought them to me yesterday and said, "These are samples. Try them."
He just took their agency yesterday.
"You se
And he told me that all businessmen are like me, God bless everyone who loves you.
Yes, Your Highness.
On my way to work
I saw a new supermarket.
They were preparing him.
I really liked it.
I don't know who its owner is.
Congratulations, congratulations, oh Uncle Sakr, congratulations.
God bless you.
In the name of God, In the name of God
Who is he to come as a partner and take it so easily?
You, you can say no now.
What happened?
What do you want me to say?
Be his partner.
Don't you know who his father is?
I know my father!
I told him I was a friend of Qasim Abbas. He asked me, "Do you have experience in the job?"
I said, "I have a bakery, thank God I can make a living from it."
No, no, I don't like the name.
I didn't notice it.
No, oh brother, the name is not nice.
So this is a suitable name for Iranian bread.
Present, my boss.
Qasim, we call it the big bread bakery.
Wait for me a bit.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God, O long-lived one.
Excellent, excellent. So, do you need anything or do you need any help?
No, thank God, everything is fine.
Yay, she's a new employee with us.
She's your highness, but she took her car to the garage and waited to take mine because she's an advertising representative in a marketing company and she can't do anything without a car.
You might still need your car later.
No, I don't want the car today.
Okay, no problem.
This is the age of science, knowledge, and study.
I agree with Dr. Rashid, everyone needs to have sufficient knowledge in their field, regardless of what that field is.
Excellent! Oh, Dr. Sami!
Yes, Your Highness.
Study and study.
You're just repeating what's in the books.
He didn't study business or economics.
He never read a book all his life, not even a newspaper. I never saw him holding a piece of paper in his hand all his life.
You all know who today's Falcon is.
I didn't want him to enter this field of business and %pw, but
Uncle Bu Nasser is still here in front of you, alive.
Whoever likes it.
But some people are born for trade and naturally love commerce.
You're right, Doctor!
May you be like your brother Shaheen.
God is generous, God willing.
It's still early.
This depends on education.
No one can be like you, Doctor.
Frankly.
How did Falcon, who hates trade, reach such a great economic sense?
If they count a hundred billionaires in the world today, they would feel them with them.
Oh! Abu Sakr?
Falcon's choice for equestrian market.
Peace be upon you.
How are you, Nasser?
Muhammad called me and told me that Abu Nasser is in the hospital.
Remember the day you told me you heard that Saqr bin Bu Saqr wants to take the car agency from my father.
You no longer have the agency.
People who never get satisfied.
His father helped him enter the market.
He has his eyes open to business.
Frankly, the doctor said his condition is critical.
This won't work.
Nothing works.
"It's not my problem. I told you to divorce her. Divorce her. You divorced her."
There are people like that in the 21st century.
We meet with you, dear viewers, with one of the men of this generous homeland.
Reel knows the path of the thirsty and the deprived.
So we have the founder and owner of Sager Charity.
Of course, if we're talking about this organization, oh! Sir,
We all know your noble goals that you are trying to convey to the world and, of course, to everyone.
Without hypocrisy or a desire for fame, God forbid.
Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds. Recently, we were able to deliver thirty sacrifices to our brothers in Africa.
And now, praise be to God, we are ready to go.
Seven boxes of sweets for our kids in Gaza.
Well done, our supervisor! May Allah increase people like you.
My wife and I just left the house.
But my wife will be spending half an hour opening her new project.
I'm waiting for her.
Okay.
To be honest, I love their company and enjoy spending time with them. I really have a great time.
And it's my family's livelihood as well.
He is my whole life.
I think you're trying to waste my time.
Stay away from trouble.
Good hot bread, hot bread.
Come on, guys! Oh, people!
There are people like that in the 21st century.
There are people like that in the 21st century.
If anyone wants to dive, keep in mind that diving requires effort.
Needs brave men.
Souq Waqif lives.
You deserve it. Congratulations.
God bless you all.
Praise be to God, everyone loves you, Shahin. Love is from God.
I want to say something, but please just say yes.
On the occasion of the license, my son Shahin will go to the exhibition and choose the best and most expensive car as a gift from me to him.
The wind blew upon us from the gap in the valley.
Oh, love, and my homeland's religion.
Hello Fadi.
How are you, Anaud?
No, no, no, no, no.
You told me the dress would be ready in a week, and yesterday you messaged me to say it would be ready in ten days. Oh! Ridiculous.
And you want your dress to have crystals, which takes more time.
If God wills, you'll start talking to Al-Anood and ignore me?
How many Norehs do we have?
No, no, no, no, no, no, let the whole world be angry, but not me.
What do you want more, Fadi? They stopped envying him.
Oh my God, I love the way they speak. I feel jealous of them, unlike our people.
Don't let me forget about it.
Is my dress ready?
Go ahead, Fadi.
Thank you, my brother Fadi.
My brother Fadi will visit you next week to pick up the dress, okay. Bye bye.
How can I help you?
Just send the dress to my house.
No, I didn't like it.
His name is Allah keeps you safe today I went to Fadi at the shop, praise be to God, his work is good and the girls are coming and going.
Alhamdulillah, we were very successful in this project.
What's happening?
Abu Nasser, my cousin.
What's wrong with him?
See the envy.
And we've never heard of him starting a business. Where is this bankrupt person getting the money from?
"They opened their mouths to plunder!"
And when he starts his project,
Sure?
I heard some talk.
And if God wills, you won't do anything?
It's seven in the morning.
Do you want them to bring you breakfast?
No, thank you, I've already had breakfast.
But I want to talk to you about something.
I heard that you
You want to start a business.
I don't know anything about these things, may God guide you, my cousin.
Design, women's fashion design and such?
Who lied to you?
I am a businessman!
No, no, no, no, no, no, just, I
You need consultation, you need %pw I'm present if you need any help.
Thank you, thank you oh! Cousin thank you.
Forgive me, I have to go.
Welcome, Director!
The first time you tell me if you want more.
Fadi cleaned the shop Oh! You look very busy.
The shop is no longer enough.
I said I'd rent the shop next to us, trust in God and take it.
I wish.
Did they open the shop next door?
Is there anyone named Khalaf Sultan Al-Sayfi other than your cousin Abu Nasser?
No, nothing?
Coming from the Ministry of Economy, saw his name on a transaction with my colleagues, his name is Essam and he is responsible for his transactions.
Women's fashion design
Are you sure?
I saw the contract, and his name was written on it.
What happened to him?
What's wrong with him? What's wrong with him? There's something wrong with him. There's something wrong with him.
Your ailing heart didn't stop you.
When you saw that my project was successful,
I said I had to destroy him.
This is an open market for everyone.
%pw Abu Nasser.
Is he a shepherd? What does he say?
And I wanted to test you, so I asked you, "Are you planning to start your own business?"
I didn't lie to you, Real.
A secret is better than a public statement.
I don't care about you or your requests.
But that's not what gets you there.
Oh my, this is destiny and everyone has their own destiny.
You beat me.
Come on, you're cousins.
No, no, no, Abu Saleh did not cross the border.
You shot me in my own house!
Open to everyone!
You are brothers.
My friend Ibrahim advised me.
He is a Lebanese designer.
I am a woman, ask me.
I know our women love Lebanese men.
Oh! Madam, this looks great on you. No, no, no, this one. There's nothing like it in all of Doha.
Yes, by God, this suits you, madam. They sell a piece that's worth a thousand for thirty or forty thousand.
Yes, just do the same.
As you know, the suppression I did last year when I brought the Lebanese carpenter.
Oh! Madam, I'll design for you a closet that has never been seen or equalled in all of Doha.
See, if you want to be successful
What's wrong with him exactly?
Why don't you know?
This means he was stealing from the customers.
What do you think about moving to another place, manager?
Don't mention it. Oh, it's empty.
And at this time, they are playing by themselves.
That doesn't mean we lost!
We have to confront them!
And we make our customers love us, whether they like it or not.
Do you have money to pay?
I'm paying.
I'm ready to do anything.
But the most important thing is that he won't defeat me.
This dress you chose costs sixty thousand riyals.
Of course, without the tie in the middle.
This is a gift from the designer, from me.
And I've put on it a crystal that there are only fifty pieces of in the whole world, and this piece is a very unique one.
Of course there's no discount, our prices are globally known.
Of course not, who would do that?
Madam, wait, wait, what's happening? What happened?
They have harmed us, O Sa'd, they have harmed us.
Is this something they do?
They've killed us; we don't have any customers left.
This is what war is, Abu Nasser.
We're not going to just stand and watch!
We need to fight them the way they fight us, and respond to them as well.
Tomorrow I'll take out a loan from the bank.
And I'll start a war against them and you'll see what I do.
Abu Nasser won't stop him.
Look at the ad!
Check the ad I posted.
Let's advertise two free evening dresses with every wedding dress.
She made four evening dresses with each wedding dress.
We'll place a quarter-page ad.
Saw, published a half-page ad.
I have no idea what he was planning to do!
Believe me, Umm Nasser.
For six days, not a single customer entered their store.
No, and they didn't open it this afternoon.
And you hear that he's putting the shop up for sale.
By killing him, I'll kill him.
Even they can't sit there, so he sat outside.
Alright, drink your tea and go to him.
What tea, may God guide you? I can't drink it, that's a problem.
Is anyone jealous of you?
"May God forgive him, he intentionally stinks up the place."
And all of these are chemicals.
Are you sure someone sprayed perfume in the store?
You're cousins and adults, not kids, so don't fight like children.
Eyy, he came at night and sprayed a scent that's driving everyone crazy in the place, is that okay?
I didn't recognize your scent.
Don't cross the line.
I made a pledge at the police station.
Don't worry.
This time,
I prepared a hell of a plane for him.
Without letting anyone catch me by mistake.
No, everything is fine.
This is what confuses me.
By God, I don't know what's going on. Today is the fourth day that no customers have come to our store, not even one.
Oh no, this isn't the right store. We have to go to the second store. I'll look for it, God willing.
And what did the doctor tell you?
The shop is empty and there are no customers entering the store.
I don't know if they've done black magic on him.
Women and girls are not allowed near the shop.
As if a spell had turned Saad into a beast.
Possible, anything is possible these days.
It has magic and it is evil.
Okay, is he asleep or awake?
Go see it, oh! Brother, go, I'm afraid the roof is going to collapse.
Lost, lost, my sultan, lost.
I don't know, but my heart turned into a dog.
Turn me into a monster!
Calm down, bro, don't get upset.
I don't know what I've done.
My love, tell me what you did. They say his friends started collecting money and paying off his debts.
I am determined.
I'm Lebanese.
I told him, didn't I?
Don't you know where he is?
The stars are there, and we're looking for these additions.
Call the guy again, he might have an emergency.
What's happening to you? What's happening to you? Oh, Uncle Ahmed.
What's wrong with you, Ahmed? You're just sitting here while the director is shouting at me. What am I supposed to do? Where are those bloody extras you said you'd bring today?
You'd better leave me alone. I called him and got a headache even asking Professor Abdullah.
First, don't shout. We're actors and we need to relax. We need to focus on our roles. Second, the guy called me several times. Just calm down.
What do you say, Professor Abdullah, what do you say?
Oh! Professor Abdullah, what should I do now? The director is finishing the scene and shouting at me.
Alright, oh! Guys, alright, oh! Guys.
Guys, we need to wrap up. These extras who are supposed to be in this scene haven't arrived yet.
You don't want anyone to shout at you, do you?
Do your work quietly and without shouting.
This is always our situation, screaming from morning. We need to focus.
I found a solution for you.
What do you think about casting yourself opposite Lynn? Hopefully, I'll bring you an actor who will do a great job in the role.
It's true that he's acting in one scene.
This is just the most important scene in the series.
Please, sir, just go now, please.
If you're not ready today, I'll just cancel.
Come on, guys, let's go upstairs.
I'm telling you something in Filipino, okay?
You don't know Abu Walid? He's always been like that, he's clearly from the elite, he has to be elite and Qatari.
Oh! Real, he wears a keffiyeh and an agal, no one will notice.
"Come on, Alaa? You just want the easy stuff, this is production that respects people's feelings and is intelligent."
Alaa gave you all the responsibilities. Distribute the tasks and you'll be comfortable.
Calm down so we can think. Rim, think with me, maybe you'll remember one of your friends.
Who is he?
Ahmedi, do you remember anyone in the power area named Saud Al-Nabk?
It's Saud Al-Nabk.
! Say Saudi cans
The manager said he wants a businessman with authority, and you're saying walls.
Oh my dear, by the end of the day, he's just a bit player. You're bringing in a rich and influential person as a bit player.
Just light makeup for Reem, and she'll wear an abaya and a clean thobe, and a luxurious car.
God willing, it will be suitable.
How do we reach it?
I know their house.
Peace be upon you.
Are you happy, Saul?
Who am I?
Ah, ah, ah, that's it, that's it.
That's it, thank you very much.
And now how are you going to work, Mother? There's nothing in the house except for this trifle that Uncle brought from abroad.
My son is with you, but it's your responsibility.
Oh my son, this is inside the cupboard under my clothes.
Mom, people are waiting for you outside. What's the delay?
Oh child, may God help you.
This means today I'll see you on TV.
My mom told me I'm going to be on TV as one of the elite.
Sit down, you jerk!
Come on, Real Madrid, what's this? Disgrace on you.
Spray, spray.
Come here, mother.
Quickly, Mom, is Hassan better?
Insha'Allah, my son.
God forbid, hopefully they just give him some money.
God help you.
Pray for me.
Yaylak kanz Saud, laptop Saud.
Peace be upon you.
"And peace be upon you and the mercy of God."
Is this Abboud, the son of Fatima Abboud?
Hello, hello
Hello, Saud?
Is he staging the scene?
Yes, God willing, he will do something good. Calm down, be quiet so he can give you complex roles.
How's your mother?
She's the same girl who used to gather berberis just like before.
Shame on you, shame on you, be quiet.
You're wearing glasses now.
You're really old now.
You don't change, I'll regret nominating you.
The men who brought him played the role of Abu Abdulaziz's father.
Hope is here, they brought her. You are welcome, you are welcome, you are welcome.
Do your best, this is our manager, Mr. Javad Fadil.
The important thing is that you don't fear the camera.
My brother, I only fear God.
Don't worry, relax and listen to his instructions. Say "yes" to anything the director asks you to do.
Oh! Brother, oh! Brother, please, you're going to play the role of one of the elite, one of the high-class people, right?
Come here, boy. Come here, boy.
I'm talking to you.
He's really stupid, the role needs someone awake.
Anything goes for some people.
Ask me why I speak like this.
"We bought this for the shoot. Listen, I'll take you to the makeup room now and coach you on the role."
God knows what I've been through. God knows what I've been through. God knows what I've been through.
Please, come in.
Introduce me to her.
Stop, stop, stop! Wait, wait!
Welcome back, please come in.
Boss, the car you need for the scene is ready.
Saoud, he's going to clean everything, he's going to fix it.
Let's do it again, and the director's help is available to watch you and to reassure the director.
Imagine yourself as a well-known merchant.
You're saying this?
I say to you, wait, wait, don't hurry. I didn't expect this from you. Oh (Abu Abdulaziz), say that you are Abu Abdulaziz.
For our rights.
Sweet and you need to know!
Let him clean my teeth, brother.
He will clean and complete the full name Abu Abdul Aziz Falah Marzouq, Lafi.
My love, go ahead, go ahead and take it into consideration.
Consider your daughter divorced.
I don't care why she divorced us.
Your daughter is divorced, is she beautiful? Is she beautiful?
She's beautiful, come forward and consider yourself, we won't get married.
Why don't you spit on him?
You are amazing, you are amazing, and he remembers everything, amazing.
Let %pw clean my teeth.
How? Why?
Oh! Real, the homeowners surprised us and they want the living room, and the director decided to finish the scenes in the living room before shooting the exterior scenes.
How are they? They don't want the %PW!
They want to, but it's been postponed. Later, they'll film another scene, and we'll be behind them, God willing.
Shall I get you some tea?
Peace be upon you.
And peace be upon you.
Good morning, Your Excellency.
Hello, which tribe are you from? Oh, boy!
My name, Your Honor, is Salem Abu Shawai Shawai.
Barbecue is popular.
You deserve it.
"It's lit, my anger is big and after the lips you can put them here."
Tell me, brother, what people have thin noses nowadays.
I'm holding my age.
If someone else were doing it, they wouldn't be able to stop laughing.
Hold on a second.
Hello, Mom.
My mother is very tired, I need to go quickly, oh brother!
You're going with those clothes.
I don't have time, I told you my mother is sick, very sick, he says!
Listen, you can go like this, but when I call you, you have to come quickly.
He and I can't leave the site.
Okay, okay, I'll try to get a taxi. Oh! Brother.
Where's a taxi? If you try to find a taxi, you won't find one for a year.
We rented the car for the scene.
While she's standing, take her.
Yes, oh brother, please give me the key. My mother is sick. Give me the key. Give it to me.
In the car.
My father has a wheelchair.
Hold on, hold on, I'll bring you the wheelchair right now. Oh, sir.
Can I tell you something? Can I tell you something?
My mother is very tired in the car and I need a wheelchair, please.
Where is the patient? In the car?
Oh! My lord, my lord, what happened?
Be quiet and don't speak, just look and remain silent.
Peace be upon you.
There's nothing, but my mother is a lady who has asthma.
I'm telling them to make the bed.
Fine, fine.
Don't worry.
Your Lord is sufficient for you regarding that which concerns you, and [for] that which you have done.
Cool! Rashood.
Take care of our son Rashid.
For your sake, come with me, Professor Rashid.
Come with me, Mr. Rashid.
And I'll take Professor Rashid and do what's necessary for him.
This is expected of you.
I'll tell the nurse to come and see what Your Highness wants to drink.
Come with me, Professor Rashid.
Excuse me.
"What am I going to do, get stuck in a crowd of people? I'll just wait!"
The problem is that no one cares about us.
Bro, order me what you want to drink? Tea, coffee, or cappuccino?
You're not the first security guard at the hospital to marry a Filipino woman.
Who told you I was rejected?
She never once gave me a chance.
They philosophize and are demanding.
He doesn't have a certificate. I don't want your mother. What's this, I don't want your mother! Go find your friends.
Oh! Bro, there's a girl in the hospital, I like her.
If you ignore me, I'll find someone else.
I can't, oh brother, my heart is attached.
Your brother loves you, believe it when you see it.
Take this to Dr. Mohammed.
What's wrong with you!
Go now.
You'll never win.
Your Honor, our aunt is now in perfect health.
You're a good actor, Saud, guys, the one after him.
Bravo to you, I saw how they agreed with you and how they praised you.
Now go change your clothes and remove your makeup.
Oh! Forget it, man. Come and take a breath for me here first.
Yes, from now on, my name is Falah Al-Marzook.
Ignore this and write Saud.
Saud died.
From now on, my name is Fahad Al-Marzouk, Abu Abdulaziz.
Bless you, dear.
Buffet one!
I made two.
Even I heard one of the bride's relatives say, "Masha'Allah, they are very stylish. I don't think anyone can do something similar to what they did at the wedding."
Okay, my love, goodbye.
Look, Mother.
I have to get them something for the occasion of signing my marriage contract.
What's happening, mom?
See your brother who belittles us.
Yeah, this is a failure, frankly, and by the way, it's cheap.
But that depends on our budget.
Leave this for the servants to eat.
He wants to make a mockery of us.
Glad I saw him.
This type is the free class, it's for the sophisticated community.
Almost above average.
No, we want something strange, something not everyone can do.
"Allowed, Sheikhah. No wonder those who don't know your worth."
Just shut up! You don't know anything.
I'm afraid the money I have isn't enough.
Don't embarrass us, pay with the card.
What luxury, so stylish.
Yesterday, Saleh's wedding contract was signed.
Salih Nasser!
I am at your disposal, I am at your service.
Coming!
They reserved the small ball room and the food was disgusting.
Very cheap.
What did she say about the Al Saeed wedding?
Sure, everyone says the same thing.
That's what's scaring me!
My dear sister
He's just worried about the money.
And he doesn't care about what people say.
He wants to make a mockery of us.
But we should bring something according to our budget and our circumstances.
Do you know there are people who borrow money and sell their homes and cars just to have an extravagant wedding and silence people from talking about them?
Leave it to us, and the cheap chocolate is enough to make you want to fail us.
You said the director's flaw was the dish and he took it home.
Okay, if the bride's family says they will choose the hall, choose the stage, and prepare everything themselves.
And you see us choosing anything!
No, nothing, just the shop we go to early has a very good price.
By the way, this place designed Abu Dhahab's wedding.
Has anyone used it before?
Frankly, just once.
In the marriage of the daughter of His Excellency, Mubarak.
No, no, no. Nothing used.
We need a theater to be the first people in the world to use it.
This means you want to stand out.
Show me what you've got.
This stage is used for the first time in Qatar.
Inspired by the information revolution, like Facebook and Twitter.
Once upon a time, there was a stylish and fashionable person.
How much for this stage along with the rest of the arrangements?
According to you now, but not less than one hundred and twenty-five thousand.
Mmm mmm, doing it like that isn't enough, everything is not cheap and nice and all that, all of that costs money.
Everyone does that.
"Excuse me, be quiet."
What's the decision?
So, is this your fault?
This is Noah's Ark.
Both are new, but Noah's Ark is twenty thousand more expensive.
No, why God bless your parents, I think the mouse stage is much better.
Shut up, I don't need Noah's Ark.
This is a marriage and it comes with costs. By the way, we are considered to be from the middle class.
You're paying the theater 150,000 and 150,000 for the hall that the Royal Hall, as you call it, reserved?
I didn't say box, but why this review and everyone wanting to see each other and everyone wanting to do better than what others have done.
It's all talk and no action, and no one benefits except wedding hall owners.
Who knows that everyone wants to be special, they exploit us and lie to us.
By God, I know one of my friends whose brother has a bridal shop.
He says that the theater costs no more than two thousand riyals.
I'm just waiting for the moment when his father says yes.
Okay then, do something.
Like young people who get married and get their lives together.
Hello, lady of honor.
How are you?
I know you love to stand out.
That's why I called you.
The first time in Qatar, design by the world artist Peter Salomon.
A collection inspired by the nine planets.
I am from the solar system.
By the time we reach Noah's Ark stage, it'll be something out of this world.
There's no such harmony. You'll be the first one in Qatar to use the nine planets.
Okay, then.
It was one hundred and fifty thousand, and now?
Okay, then.
God willing, your heart will be healed.
Give him what he wants.
Oh, the expenses, my brother!
Generally, I couldn't take all 80,000.
All I could gather was sixty thousand, and I took twenty thousand from my brother.
Thank you, thank you very much. Oh! Brother, oh! Fahd.
How do I solve this? Oh! Fahd, since we're dressed up for weddings, we're in danger.
Without any boasting.
Of course, you'll receive the invitations you want.
Yes, this week, God willing, we'll start with the invitations.
Our wedding will be better than theirs.
Mom, look at the cards my son chose for the wedding.
Where does your brother live?
People now travel to countries just to design their invitations.
On the contrary, the Amin family went to Italy to design their invitation. They will print it and return after the Munira family.
They went to France, even people who are not rich go to Lebanon to get their visas.
That's how the system works in our country. Do you want us to be different?
So, which country would you like to travel to?
We saw wonderful invitations.
Frankly, it's just too expensive.
It's just unique and no one has done it before.
Sparkle, that's what I like.
Gold is better and it sparkles.
Oh! Brother, if he can't afford the wedding expenses,
Why did he get himself into this mess?
And abandon all these appearances and waste in weddings and all these expenses that are of no use.
The only beneficiaries of our foolishness are hotels and wedding planners.
This is him, he's walking, poor thing.
Let me go get it. I'm afraid he won't find anyone to take him.
Come on, I'll give you a ride.
Good health to you, Abu Nasser.
Oh! My brother, the bride's family has to stand with you.
I only tried it once, just once.
I told them that there was no need for a dance hall in a very well-known hotel.
Why did you find our daughter on the street when there are others who are better than her?
This is the problem, everyone is looking at each other.
Who told you I got married?
At least they don't have this boastfulness.
The whole thing is about a simple party and some expenses.
Oh God, Real Madrid is now celebrating on Facebook.
Cheaper and less expensive.
That means you won't marry from your country.
Leave it, do you want me to go crazy?
See
If I don't get Abdullah Roaished or Nawal for my son's wedding.
May her good fortune be cursed, she won't be better than me.
Father, I have a question for you, dear.
If your son has a room number, give it to us so we can call him.
My love, thank you very much, goodbye.
Mom, we agreed on the DJ. Why did you change your mind?
Will Umm Nasser become better than me?
Did you forget who she is and who we are?
People who were below our level are now better than us.
It's not like that with us, but see, my brother Saleh breaks my heart, and we don't pressure him too much.
He really broke my heart.
Oh, right!
In the hospital! When and which hospital?
I don't know, but suddenly it fell.
I heard that and she just fell.
He doesn't make sense, and no one can blame her after she prepared everything and people simply found out that he didn't want a wedding.
He wants to embarrass us.
What did the doctor say?
He's embarrassing us, he wants to ruin the wedding.
God willing, everything will be fine.
Don't break her heart.
Oh! My son, you are a real man and you are the breadwinner.
Go and soothe her.
By God, if I tell him "No" Abu Yusuf's heart will stop.
Do you know why the minister is still keeping Abu Youssef?
In general, he should have retired three or four years ago.
Nothing is helping me.
By God, you're crazy.
Do you understand what I want from you now?
And you make him hide the papers and documents until the money is returned.
They call it amount cooling postponement.
I won't talk, and I don't know why. Why are you so jealous?
There's nothing to fear, and in the end, I will return the amount to you.
Do you know what they call me? Do you know what they call me?
Disciplined, disciplined.
Oh man, I tried, but there's no other way.
If I give you and the meticulous people a match,
And they are severe in scrutiny, taking me quickly, quickly.
Quickly, the tablet, the tablet, the tablet.
I ate, I ate the tablet.
No, no, God willing, by 7:30 we'll be in the hall receiving guests.
No, we'll definitely be there.
I'm going to throw a wedding for my son that will be the talk of Doha.
Surprise!
Okay, dear Fatima, I'll send you the news later.
I'm afraid they'll envy you, my son, if you enter their presence tomorrow wearing the bisht.
"Please make sure the dishdasha is long enough."
The police are here!
"Hopefully, it's nothing bad."
"Just stay here, I'll call the police and be right back."
May God protect you, Salouh.
Let your wedding be grand.
The marriage cage now enters the prison cage.
They discovered the document I was hiding for your loan, and now suddenly they've realized I exist.
Why are you upset?
You hear about a lot more disasters than this.
What do you say, mate!
A respectful and dedicated employee
Whoever loves their job, the ministry has contracted a company to do maintenance.
The employee, in his eagerness for his work, goes and asks about the materials.
He discovered that the cost was four hundred thousand.
It will provide the ministry with one million six hundred thousand.
And the minister punished him! No, no, no, I don't believe it.
Why don't you believe?
These are Saad.
Of course, he has all the news.
He fired him.
What's happening in the world? Where are the values?
They say he called his office manager.
And he said to him, "Let her work in place of Uthman."
And who is she?
She is the daughter of the director of the same company that presented the maintenance offer.
Uthman was discovered.
No, no, no, no, this doesn't make sense.
Always amazed, Oh! Saleh!
Who does this company belong to?
For whom?
This happened to us.
What are you saying!
The issue is not what I say, poor employee Osman, what is his fault!
His mistake is that he is honest and loyal!
Do you think the manager is in his office?
Yeah, he left a moment ago.
What's happening in the world!
We started seeing some strange people.
And I also agree with you, Osman doesn't deserve it, but what can we do?
Not at all, Your Honor, he has seven children and doesn't have a passport.
This is his job, how he earns a living! What is he going to do now and where will he go?
Do you know what happened?
The new employee whom the minister appointed,
She entered Uthman's office and started working. Poor Uthman came to collect his belongings, but she stopped him and said, "Go, and I will send your things with the tea boy."
Where is he now?
Things have turned Oh! Uthman?
This is the reward!
This is the will of God.
Praise be to God, the Almighty.
O Allah, the Generous, O Allah, the Clement, O Allah, the Preserver, may Allah keep you safe and sound.
What's happening? These aren't your clothes!
I know, I know you're very sensitive.
Get to work! I can't work, I'm leaving right now.
And it's an opportunity for me to visit my mother and bring you the news.
I don't want you to be this upset.
Why are you shouting at me? I'm your mother.
I'm not shouting at you, I'm asking you.
How is it normal? By what right do you go with him? Is he your husband? Your father? Your brother?
The world has changed, where have you been living?
I don't know, mother!
You're crazy.
People are liberated and the world has become a small village. Where do you live?
But what do you say!
Stay modern, live your time, don't be old-fashioned.
Get the stuff from the car quickly! Go, don't look at me, just do it.
"Hey, oh! Saleh, what's wrong with you?"
No, I'm not feeling well today.
You shouted at the poor maid, it wasn't her fault.
You know what I meant.
No, no, no, I have no desire.
To forget the misfortunes I've seen.
Dear, don't cry.
The official is a bit upset.
It is an honor, Your Highness.
Thank you, thank you very much.
Diligence and perseverance.
Correct, wow.
The most important thing is,
The most important thing for me in this ministry
Indeed, by God, O long-lived one.
Tell me what's the point of an employee who doesn't bribe.
He's of no use.
That's why I want all of you.
There's no room left for honest people and those with principles and values in tatters.
If discovered one day
He has no one to blame but himself.
Justice is a principle, no matter the reaction!
That's why I want you to cooperate with me.
If you have doubt
Just say it.
We are thieves and the children of thieves, and no one can compete with our sisters.
If Nour takes a bribe a day, she steals government tea before going home.
Excellent, excellent, bravo! This is what I expect from all of you. I don't want anything else, just for you to be like her. I want all of you to be just like her.
God bless you.
That's why I want you to leave the procurement department and become my office manager.
Frankly, you know how to choose. You picked the right thief for the right place.
Enough, oh Mother Saud, enough. Don't torment me more.
I don't want to live in a prison.
By Allah, the tyrants are enough, they exiled me and made truthfulness attractive to me.
And he told the truth.
You are a father.
Why bother with honesty and integrity?
You've always been a thief and you're comfortable with it.
Zayn, you've done well.
Let me talk to your father.
Don't do it again.
One has to be on the straight path, bribe, steal, and be hypocritical to live comfortably.
My father was imprisoned because all his money was illegally obtained.
Okay, okay.
Is this something you wear?
We are a respectable family.
Good health to you.
Where is your stomach?
Why aren't you wearing a mask?
You shameless girls.
I'm ashamed to wear my brother's clothes.
Are there still girls who blush?
Why are you shouting?
Look at what your daughter is wearing!
Would a respected woman wear such clothing?
And you'll walk in the street without exposing any part of your body?
I'm fed up with her; she doesn't listen to me.
I've never hesitated to support here.
I bought her see-through clothes, which are useless.
I warn you, if I see you one day in a place and something below the knee,
As long as you know about the situation, don't come and lecture me on the consequences.
We are here, God bless you.
I wish he were a playboy and a bit wicked.
He takes after his father.
You see before you.
This is really great. How can we get something like it?
Don't worry, Uncle, I'm ruined.
Oh, what a kind man. To tell the truth, I love my daughter Sarah very, very much and I care about her future.
But after we heard about it.
Praise be to God, I heard it once and it was bad.
I came home at 3:30 in the morning.
I got home at five in the morning.
Hello hello! Hello.
Come pick me up from the bar.
Start your car and come pick me up from the bar.
This is the first time I've seen a father not obey his son.
Your love has stopped, dad. Start your car, I'm waiting for you.
Mary, I love you.
I love you too, I melted, I melted, I melted.
Generally, generally, paternally, the father is present here.
Where is he?
He's bold, not the type to back down from a fight.
Let me introduce you to my friend Majid.
No, Abdulaziz was my ex-husband.
Welcome, come in, this is an opportunity not to be missed.
Arabic and Israeli satellites
I discovered that many Palestinians don't cut their nails.
According to what the State of Palestine commits to in the comprehensive peace agreement,
In general, the United Nations are gathered today to discuss Israel's request to send special inspection committees to inspect Palestinian fingers.
So they can see if their nails are long or not.
There was a condition, which was the absence of anything that cuts, hurts, or causes bleeding.
State of Palestine
I call on the entire international community to visit Palestine.
Comprehensive Peace Agreement
Made of cork.
And olives, oh king.
We press olives like this, we press olives like this.
We and our Arab brothers appeal to the international community.
To conduct inspections of Palestinian nails.
And now let's start the voting.
No, no, no, no, you don't get to that extent.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
How are you, Saleh?
What happened to your dream?
I dreamed of the upside-down world.
Oh! Rashid, you need to have a strong personality.
Now oh! Brother, this school that you are working on tomorrow is number how many?
I am a teacher like you.
Why didn't I change my school when I started teaching?
What's her problem, brother?
The problem is his weak personality.
By the way, the teachers who were with him were the ones who complained about him.
That's enough, buddy.
That's why you see him silent.
Then the teaching began.
What was ketchup, was mayonnaise by %Pw.
Oh! Brother, we don't mean to upset you with our words.
We're telling you this because it's your last chance.
And he told me that he accepted Rashid even though his personality was weak.
He is shy but very kind.
No matter what, he remains a citizen.
Why are you quiet, brother?
Because everything you say is right.
Everything you say is right.
I will tomorrow.
Mr. Rashid is new.
Mr. Rashid,
You're 100% right.
Okay, forget about it.
And tomorrow,
Yes, fine, and how later?
I'm telling you this.
I am a teacher. I don't like mistakes.
Let's say, for example, a boy jumped up and said, "This is like what the other boy said in your previous school when the inspector was present."
And take your bag!
Slowly, he broke the door.
Fine, one learns from one's mistakes.
From the first minute,
I'm telling you this.
I'm nervous.
It's up to me!
Just shut up!
It seems he said, "Okay, be quiet!"
Did you hear his words?
Mr. Rashid called me.
It's as if he said, "It's not my problem, but I'll see. I don't want to see your face here in class."
Professor, don't you know who he is?
Who is his son?
Here comes Mr. Rashid.
Saw it?
The problem, doctor, is that if he tells his father.
Okay, where do you usually see him sitting, during the break?
You may find him sitting in the chair area.
Above the chairs.
Chairs, chairs.
By the end of the day, you're human.
Just shout at me!
A quarter and they're arguing, you're arguing with me.
Dad is traveling, and he'll be back next week, and I'll tell him when he returns.
No, no, no, no, Abdelrahman, may God protect you.
We are friends. By the way, raspberry ice cream is really good, you should try it. It has a bit of tanginess, but it's amazing.
Okay, go get it quickly.
The only thing he's afraid of is telling his father the truth.
You said his father was excellent.
Yeah, he's out. His dad isn't coming back? They took his dad's stuff and kicked him out!
I hope there won't be dire consequences.
I picked up his bags and took them to him, gave him your phone number, and told him, "If you need anything, call me, I'm your friend."
Yeah, just.
Yes, but what?
You're the ones who told me.
Shout and make your voice strong.
Bathroom, bathroom, bathroom.
Oh! Rashid!
You can sleep, you can sleep, don't worry, sleep.
Mr. Abu Nasser, Mr. Rashid is in the bathroom.
One juice.
Come here, come here, come here, come here, give me.
Go, quickly.
Put them on the table.
That all people are equal.
This is what made me gather you to hear your visions for the party.
How can one ensure a child?
This complicates things for us. This is him calling.
It's three o'clock.
"Except, welcome. Sugar, he's just joking."
Faster, faster.
Peace be upon you.
Stand up for the inspector, and sit down.
Yes, I'm at your service.
Oh! Teacher, come, come here. Oh! Teacher.
Are you done screaming?
I'm losing my mind, oh! Come on, I'm just asking, are you done yet?
Have you finished or not? Where is the teacher's authority? With this act, you are insulting yourself and the teaching profession.
Fine, fine, okay, okay.
And you're still raising your voice.
Why should I raise my voice? First of all, you need to know who this boy is.
Faster, faster.
Just two cars.
Two cars? No, no, I want four or five cars. Hurry, hurry, we have a lot of space. Go, go, go!
He thinks he owns the neighborhood!
Abu Nasser used to do this and not do that.
God helps him.
I am the supervisor here.
It is known that Abu Nasser
I'm used to giving all the teachers extra lessons.
Except me.
Who's the principal of the school here?
You are the manager, God guide you, what's wrong with you?
Relax.
What you put on your head is on the chair, oh! My brother.
What do you mean?
"No, honestly, I want to help you."
What's its name?
So, what are we going to do with you now?
Do your best for your own sake, or you'll get extra lessons whether you like it or not.
Get lost! Come on, come on, come on, scram!
Okay, I'll download it.
"We told you, oh men!"
We must put him in his place.
Moment, oh guys, moment
Don't blame us, Abu Salmin.
Oh! Abu Naif, you're the elder of the neighborhood and you should put him in his place.
Mani is my father's son.
What do you see him doing?
Faster, faster.
Goodbye, Your Excellency.
Wow, when did he buy this new car?
I told you, but you didn't believe me.
He shaved his mustache and his face turned red.
I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes; I knew him the moment he spoke, from the sound of his voice.
Did you know he was promoted a week ago?
He is responsible for eight boys' and girls' schools.
What's this magic secret? Ask him, let him tell you what the secret is that got him out of the bottom!
Here I tell you from day one,
While I'm studying, I don't want to hear any noise.
Not even a breath.
Take care of yourself.
And you, too, respond to me. You, too, argue with me. Go away from my face. Go, go, go, go.
The day you're appointed minister, find yourself a nice job.
Alright, don't tell me to come and take this job.
Either the second job, no, brother, give me options, different jobs, and I'll choose the most suitable position.
My brother is a minister!
It's not good at all from the phone that called me.
Everyone is congratulating me.
"What will they say, mother? God guide you."
This is very common, every minister hires his friends and people automatically.
From this side, don't worry, I'm honored to know you.
They know I'm going to be a minister.
I mean, they're spraying me, it's appeasement.
"Our livelihood comes to us as a treasure, a treasure that is open to us."
The vast lands.
Come on, everyone go congratulate the new minister.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Congratulations, Your Excellency the Minister.
"Congratulations, Your Highness. May it be blessed."
Congratulations, you deserve it.
You deserve it, Your Excellency, Minister.
Oh! Brothers, the responsibility is great, God help us bear it.
As they say, you're cut out for the job.
You went back after Bu Saleh's phone rang.
It was far from him.
Keep it with you.
I'm surprised to see how he loves him now.
And Abu Sultan is not foolish.
Yes, I opened the car door for him.
Bravo to you, you did great!
We are waiting for our brother to become a minister.
I told you, Mother, but you don't believe me.
You were saying they're café stories, café stories.
After her husband died, she said she envied her friend her husband.
God forbid, God forbid.
Ah, you have nothing to say, you have nothing.
Oh my God, let's go, I'm bored and fed up.
What do you mean it's none of your business?
You just need to relax.
I interrupted her because she makes me nervous.
Yeah, they're right.
But I didn't want to say that in front of my mom, you know she tells everyone.
"They say that repeating everything you hear is called 'al-Gharabilah', we don't want any scandals."
Okay, what's the guarantee that if he steps down from power, they'll put you in his place?
Because I asked.
If he's leaving the office, you're the top candidate.
What guarantees that they will catch him?
No, I'm quite sure about that.
I've never seen you outside the office like I'm seeing you now in front of me.
I'm casting a spell on him.
But the plan in my head is guaranteed and effective.
This is a burn and kick plan.
I'll make him ban all activities that take place in the state.
At that time, he will be burned. When he is burned, he will be removed from office. When he is removed from office, he will be fired.
By God, brother, I don't know how and I don't know what to tell you!
Your visit is called a participation that reflects the extent of your love for your homeland.
You think?
You are a statesman today, you need to be present all the time.
You have to participate in everything. Sorry, Your Highness. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Before I forget, thank you for the lamb you sent me yesterday.
Come on, Your Highness, this is just a simple sheep, it's not worthy of your status. What do you think, Your Highness? Are you coming with me today?
The men are waiting for you outside!
For honesty's sake,
I don't want to go.
I'm sick, I'm tired of prestige, I'm tired of it.
You are the minister today. What he said is true. You are social. Build yourself some respect.
May God send you such a good man.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Don't take my picture.
Take, take.
Today was a night of poetry and a wedding, and they took at least a hundred pictures of him.
I'm telling you about something very nice that you should take to him.
Listen, I've also arranged a really nice educational activity for you.
Yes, like this. Let it shine, I want it to shine, shine, shine until it sparkles. I'm looking for that shine.
The seller is thanked. Congratulations, congratulations on the new bike. %PW Picture, picture, happiness. Picture, picture, don't take my picture, I'm far away. Picture.
This is the bicycle.
A blessed beginning and congratulations on his honor.
Picture, picture, and you're like that. You're all flesh, sir.
"Nothing, may God bless you."
Go to page two.
No, he doesn't know that.
This is a national contribution.
What Allah wills, happens.
This is the fourth friend of mine who has called me today.
Everyone praises your activities, O Mother of Khalid. They call you the active social activist.
Yesterday, I heard a word that bothered me.
The party that Bu Sultan took me to yesterday
Children's Swimming Victory Party.
One was telling his friend
They judge by what they hear.
This minister said
I want to buy a birthday present for my niece's son.
Hello, hello
I see you every day in the newspaper, Sheikh.
Correct, correct,
You lit up the store when you walked in, I'll give you a discount on everything you want.
If you want to pay or not, it's no problem.
This means you don't beat around the bush and sit with your minister.
I, I am Abu Saleh, the minister.
I'm not Sultan to take a place I'm waiting for.
And he put me in the front row, then went to the car to rest.
We don't need anything from him, may God guide you.
Oh, my god, please, parents asked me, I'll call you just to make sure.
And you are calling your soul.
People are giving us discounts.
I told you.
This job is awesome.
Just let him come and get me!
The minister's happiness oppresses me; may God oppress him.
Welcome, welcome, Your Excellency the Minister
No, I'm just a bit tired today.
Okay, if you're very enthusiastic, we're at your service.
We're ready for the good ones, but my brother Saad will take you around. God willing, you'll have a party or something.
A party?
No, no, today we don't have any activities.
No, we don't have it.
Okay, where can we find him?
A. Yes. Thank you, thank you.
Is there anyone we can ask?
May God help you.
Sleep and rest.
Moment of happiness
Anything, even a henna night?
This is good.
And there might be extra time.
Take him! Put him in the cabin and find a photographer to take pictures of his face.
Okay, okay, goodbye.
What did you find for him?
I don't know, a reserve league match. Let him sit alone in the stadium!
What is this! This minister is cursing us!
Zayn means he reached the summit.
His end is near when he becomes people's talk.
Your Honor, he has become much more famous than you.
Your presence is required if you go somewhere and take Abu Saleh with you.
Oh! Your Majesty,
His star is shining bright.
We'll turn it off and bring it back to its normal size.
The minister, yaa, yaa, yaa. The minister, yaa.
Don't take a picture! Don't take a picture! I swear, whoever takes my picture, I'll break his head. I'm not coming out.
They broke their cameras, I don't want pictures.
Peace be upon you.
As they say, I missed my flight.
This is my brother's halitosis.
There is no power or might except with Allah.
Why?
This is the first time I've seen him.
The first time you see it!
It's the first time I've seen him in years.
Oh my God.
Is this my eternity?
Oh, my dear, I haven't seen you in a long time. Come to me.
What's he doing, hanging on to her like that?
No power or strength except from Allah; review the same issue.
Get out, get out, you're giving me a headache. Give it to me, give it to me. I just came back from the wedding at 3 a.m.
Let me rest in peace and quiet.
Your sister is a boy.
By God, I'm telling my father to look at your face, you look like a girl.
He used to play, play.
Yeah, he was playing, I tell you he was playing with the makeup palette.
And this is Saud; I know what to do with him.
Oh, my darling Khalid, I wish all children were like him.
About these campaigns and the nonsense he's spreading about his brother.
Welcome, my dear brothers, please come in.
How are you, my dear?
No, dear, we're not going to Spain this summer.
Who spoke?
Cheetahs from Kuwait.
Oh, Hamada!
Listen to what I'm saying.
There is no power or might except with Allah.
I'll let her choose at her leisure.
But honestly, what do you think?
I say the one overlooking the sea is better.
So that in the near future, if we buy a yacht, we can sail straight from our home to the sea.
Us and our children.
Please, you must set a wedding date.
Fine, just a year and a few months.
What's wrong with your brother? He's dousing you with perfume.
Frankly, I noticed that your brother Khalid, I don't know.
He's just completely different from your brother Saad.
Different or not, my dear, everyone is free to act as they please.
And your fiancé is backward, he doesn't know there's a perfume for both genders.
Let your fiancé keep his opinion to himself!
It doesn't matter to me.
I can't believe it, Khalid!
Isn't that the perfume you use in a feminine way?
You're even using their colors.
Why are you doing this, Khalid?
You really don't have anything to say.
Mom, why don't you want to believe anything about him? Don't you see his actions and behavior?
Perfumes are now for both genders.
Here I warn you.
Did you see the Bluetooth?
I heard about it from my friends at the council; they say it's very popular in Doha.
I heard about him and showed you.
You have to see it and I'll tell you later.
Look how this girl dances!
Look at the moves!
Those are girls. See these ones you say dance very well and do moves, do you know who they are? They are Muhammad's cousin, Khulud.
My cousin Khulud has the right.
Zayn will see what I do to him.
His brother Saad is looking at him now.
Why? Just wait and you'll see. Let Saad send it via Bluetooth so his family can see it.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, hello, hello.
Sure, you lost.
Why is my cousin sitting so far away?
"Is your Bluetooth on?"
No, I just want to send you something.
No, thank you, Amira.
Escape from the family.
Are you crazy, Saad?
And I'm traveling tomorrow.
I won't see your face in this country.
Where are you going by yourself? (Colloquial expression)
What will people say?
They say our son left us and traveled, you don't want to cause us a scandal!
Oh, really?
And what your daughter, Khulud's son, did is a source of pride and honor.
The men who turned himself into a woman is not a scandal.
I can't face people when they say this is the brother of...
He travels for treatment, for study, for work, or even to commit suicide.
The most important thing is that I don't live in a place where scandal chases me every day.
Where are you going?
They don't care where I go.
Finish.
We don't know where the other one is, and this one here is carrying his suitcase to travel.
Even we don't know where it will take us.
What did you expect it to be?
What's wrong with you? I brought you here to comfort me, and you're just throwing harsh and heartbreaking words at me.
I told you to watch out for him.
Don't leave him with the servants.
You don't know anything about it and you were busy.
And your father is busy with his work and has left the responsibility to you.
Mom, you're right.
Is there any hope for your sister?
You're right about this.
What Kholoud did shamed us among the Arabs.
I don't see anyone.
Did you tell him anything?
This is the biggest mistake my father ever made.
We are discussing Kholoud's strange and bad problem.
I told him.
Burn it on a CD and give it to him.
Just one day I'll go to the airport.
I'm very afraid for him.
Our house must have reached that point, Amal!
Do not be surprised.
Khalood and her friends don't care about their parents' reputation.
And the reputation of their brothers and sisters
Whatever religious values called it
And they started dancing and cheering.
In the pit of evil.
Oh my! My dear son, I am perplexed.
Goodbye, Yuba.
Take care of yourself, my son.
Yes, Dad, I have a small gift for you.
Gift for me!
Now put the CD in the laptop, I'm afraid of what will happen, come with me!
It's all good.
I can't believe my dad is still watching the CD, it's only been three minutes.
It might work.
Where is he going? He doesn't have enough time to go anywhere for lunch.
Answer me, Abu Saad, what's wrong with you?
Hey!
Oh! Hope,
Even if I study, I might not pass the course.
So you can find someone with your morals.
But forgive me.
God helps you.
I see you're going up to the roof!
Oh, my dear.
We live in an age of freedom.
The age of human rights and its implications for us.
If anyone has a riyal, they can take a thousand, my dear.
Of course I can hold her. God bless America, my love.
Do you know that salaries are high now?
One thousand two hundred.
Your Lord has sufficed you every time you speak; He asks the driver how much is your salary.
My salary is very low.
The day he sees me, he starts complaining, "My salary is small, and it's not enough." We talked to him, explaining that his salary is seven hundred, and you increased it by a hundred when he got the license. What more does he want?
I told him that when you finish a year of work, we will increase your salary.
He seems greedy, and we're going to have dark days with him.
Enough, enough, just shut your mouth, just be quiet, just shut up and leave us alone.
This talk is easy for you, you're easy.
Does that mean he'll feel sorry for me? I hate riding with him in the car.
Alright, leave it to me.
You've just told me the story, I'm the man of the house. Go cut it out and get lost, you too, go away, I'll deal with him.
Get out of my sight!
Come and stand.
What did I tell you?
I said your friends don't come to your room, didn't I?
This one is not my friend, he's my uncle.
He will come in five minutes and leave, God willing.
Five minutes!
And keep it in mind!
Don't tell the madam that I want a raise in my salary, I want a raise in my salary!
Everything in the world has become expensive now.
And when did I give you eight hundred?
Boss, I have a lot of problems at home.
These drivers in Doha charge 1100, 1200 riyals.
And a thousand and one.
Moment, I'm thinking.
Listen, I'm up one percent and %pw silent, I'm not carrying you.
What do you say I raised you more than a hundred times, get to work!
What's up?
I'm telling you,
There's no use in being 100%.
There's no use in the dead.
I'm scared, little one.
Why are you afraid?
All the drivers fled.
Because she works outside for three or four thousand.
What's the problem? When you work at home, it's not beneficial, but when you work outside, you make more money.
I'm very scared.
See all these drivers.
How much?
Two thousand five hundred.
I'm just afraid of the police taking me and putting me in jail.
No, don't be afraid.
I guarantee you.
I was wearing my abaya and was about to leave.
I was calling, but now no one is answering me.
He opened his room and the safe was empty.
Maid Monira ran away for a year.
I write, but God is sufficient for him.
Okay, I'm coming to you.
I went to the police.
If you don't report it, you have no responsibility.
We'll do everything we can.
And you too, look around the neighborhood, you might see him and talk to us.
He who makes money and when he's satisfied, he surrenders himself.
We brought them, we spent on them, we brought them clothes, food, driving education.
It's not up to him.
The match is starting now, go inside, go inside better.
We were afraid.
These foxes and jackals aren't easily caught.
You know if she doesn't get more than three, we haven't won. We want ten or fifteen.
This is clear mockery, clear mockery. Let's be clear, this is clear mockery.
This is his level, if he doesn't score more than three, it's not the Foxes' team.
Take it from me.
In ourselves, in the players, and in the performance.
They don't have anything. They should be thankful if they have less than three.
What's the goal? These are just appetizers. Our team is still hungry; this is the Foxes' team. Come on, Real Madrid.
Now you've scored a goal, you're relieved and happy.
In your opinion, are there also goals, or does it stop at this point?
This fox is very clever, this fox is smart. It goes here, it goes there, and no one catches it, you will get dizzy. This fox eats the chicken.
No, I don't have a car.
You are my friend.
Did you hear what he said?
This fox is a troublemaker.
You can't hold it.
Yes, oh! Sir.
You don't know, do you?
He is a Foxes fan.
Sometimes he appears on the program "Relax Yourself."
They win today and you lose.
By God, I will defeat you. The Foxes team never loses, it's always the winner.
Foxes, what do you think of the result today?
Why are you asking me about the result?
Okay, the foxes are the winners.
The birds came to take their livelihood and fly away.
Let's be realistic, don't say the foxes won and flew away.
These are foxes, my friend.
This fox takes the hen and eats it.
Didn't you see what he was doing on the field?
The audience can't stop laughing at him.
Clear in the arena and thank you for listening.
The true fan with genuine loyalty to the club.
He hangs out with the elite of Qatar who go to malls and such places.
He treated me to a cappuccino.
Oh strange world, oh human.
The boy gave me five hundred riyals in front of me and paid the check.
Tell us the poem you wrote about our match against the frogs.
Thank you to all our listeners here.
You are a frog.
Don't be ashamed, my team beat yours four to zero.
Talk dirty, talk dirty about the club and the team and see what happens!
Don't say that!
The day one of the hens was expelled.
The reason behind this is a ruling.
A player was expelled from the Foxes team.
I changed his name from Hakim to Ghabi.
Thank you, thank you, thank you to all the listeners who are here.
Every month, we would meet to choose the best fan.
Great, who did you choose to honor this month?
The board members of the club are the ones who decide.
They are not children, and each of you is bigger than a camel.
I manage this big club. A cunning fox.
Come, come see the driver who lost to us appeared on TV. Come on.
Is this it?
This one speaks well, the other one doesn't speak.
What do you think, a pen or a watch?
Now, I know how to get there.
The audience is gone.
Catch him.
Wrap here.
He was driving fast.
We've put it now.
Seed!
Shut up, you don't decide. I'm the man of the house and I'm the one who decides.
We need to be sure.
Majid Abdurrahman Al-Subaihi
Ah, ah, ah, blessed be the Lord.
I am from the Suba tribe.
Buy it and register it in my name. No, no, no, no, I don't want to live in it, I have a house.
I just want to invest.
Since the investment price is rising, God bless you.
How can I help you? Oh! People, what do you want?
God bless you.
"Please! Guys, coffee?"
You don't have anything to say, may God reward you. You don't need anything, may God bless you.
You say I'm sure, is that right? Where do you want to embarrass us in front of distinguished people!
I'm very scared.
Mom, mom, I'm mom.
Now what's your father going to do to us? I don't know.
I didn't mean it, Mom!
Mom, please don't tell Dad.
Your father is turning the house upside down.
He's definitely going to kill you now.
Mom, I swear I didn't break it on purpose.
Mama, why don't we buy some glue and stick ourselves together?
Where should we stick it, my son?
How can we find another like it? I don't know where your uncle bought it, it was a gift.
I'm afraid of him for you.
Mom, I'm afraid he will hit me.
Close the door until I find a solution to this problem.
Go to your room quickly.
Blind, blind, blind! You're blind!
You've never seen a vase break, have you?
Mom, hasn't Waleed come to you?
No, oh! What's wrong with you?
He ran away from home, afraid of his father.
This isn't right. Have some sympathy for the boy!
This is not proper upbringing. May God guide you, my daughter.
Mom, what should we do now?
I don't know what to do!
I don't know, but I scared him with the cars on the street.
God protect him, I think he went to the assembly or went to the neighbors to play with the kids.
Yes, he is sweet, kind, and adorable, my daughter.
No, no, my daughter. Seek refuge from Satan and don't worry. God willing, everything will be fine.
Okay, goodbye my daughter.
Where are his children?
My father beats me.
O heedless one of his Lord's remembrance.
Don't worry, my dear!
Don't be afraid, my love!
I won't let him get to you.
I didn't mean to break it.
Come, my son, come and drink some water and rest in my room.
Your face turned yellow.
Guide us and guide him, God guides us and him. Come with me, my son, for a moment.
O Allah, the Generous.
I'm afraid my father will come here.
Welcome, my son. Don't worry.
No one interferes with raising my son.
This is my son, and I am raising him the way I want.
But the poor man buys a troubled one, trembling and afraid of something he never intended to do.
Why doesn't he have eyes?
Let him see!
The bag accidentally hit the vase. Believe me, he didn't mean to do that.
You! You have to support him!
Please don't tell him anything about me. Forgive him this time, his state of fear breaks my heart.
But where, where is he now? Why is he here at this time?
Present.
He's here! Where?
Go inside, go!
No, I'll take my brother's right today.
Why don't you bring something new instead of the old one!
Come on, Nasser! Oh, brother, let's play!
And your mother says you're studying.
Just play this game and then we'll study!
Don't you have an exam tomorrow?
Yeah, dad.
Come on, go ahead, don't ruin the match.
Come on, dad, don't take it seriously. Come on, go, go, dad, we have to study.
What? What are you saying! Listen to me,
If I go now, I'll call your uncle Abu Walid.
No, no, no, no. Don't tell my uncle, don't tell my uncle, no!
It's up to me.
I'm telling him that you don't obey me.
Come on. Everyone take their book and start studying.
Alright, put your phone in your pocket, we're going to study, but don't tell Uncle.
Mom, I'm so confused, I don't know what to do.
I'm afraid if he knows, he'll cause us trouble.
Surely he'll ask me why you're taking him to the hospital?
So what's the problem if I tell him?
If he had known that Waleed was wetting his bed, he would have killed him.
Oh! Mom, he's the one to blame. It's all his fault.
Oh! My daughter has a psychological impact.
The boy is not ignorant now, he is twelve years old.
It's okay, girl.
You're going to come have lunch with us, and I'll give him a few hints.
And I see his opinion.
Her mother went to Bahrain to buy abayas.
This is just an excuse, my daughter.
Fun and shopping.
It's a rule that he pees in his bed every night.
My son pees in his bed every night, and you just tell him a story.
He said it's necessary to take him to the hospital so they can treat him.
She's stupid.
And that's what he understands.
It's true.
He needs to go to the hospital, oh my son, so they can find out what's wrong with him.
He has a good dry-water hose.
He beat him until the last person in the neighborhood heard the screams.
Sit!
Call me, my daughter, call me.
No, I didn't say anything.
Go quickly and take a shower, and I'll bring you some clothes. Go!
I beg you, please.
I must punish them.
Don't interfere!
Do you call this a bus?
And Khalid scored forty-nine out of fifty.
Is this a statement?
Their grades are just fine.
He told them they would be punished if they didn't get a perfect score.
Please don't take them to your brother!
They need to be punished.
My children
Alright, uncle, this is the last time.
Why don't you get fifty out of fifty, fifty out of fifty?
Add one to it.
I'm telling him not to come with us to public places.
We went to the hospital yesterday and they told him not to enter. It's prohibited.
You're different, don't come with us.
Shut up! Let me deal with his brothers.
Auntie, I'm dying, I'm dying, I'm dying, I'm dying, Auntie.
Let me punish you.
Keep in mind that this is not a punishment, what you'll see at the end of the year if any of you don't get a fifty.
I'm draining the pool.
Filled with oil
Where is your certificate? Where is your certificate?
They said it will be ready tomorrow.
Khaled Abdulrahman.
Oh, well done! Khalid, you've excelled.
Faisal Abdullah Rashid.
Excellent! Oh! Faisal.
God bless you.
You are an outstanding student and you were second in your class.
Teacher, he's crying because he got forty-nine out of fifty in math.
The doctor is afraid of his father because his father wants him to get a perfect score.
Listen, boy, I'm talking to you!
Knock, knock on Spring's door.
He said he saw him at the school entrance.
Knock knock on your mom, she might be at grandpa's house.
No, he didn't go there.
Where is he? Where is he?
There is no power or might except with Allah.
What's up, bro?
Oh, he definitely failed and he's afraid of his parents.
No, he didn't fail. He was an excellent student and ranked second in his class.
But he was afraid to go back home.
Because he missed only two marks in math.
God have mercy on him.
Walid, Walid.
Walid, Walid.
Oh! Come here, Waleed.
Forty-eight, forty-nine, a float mark or two, no problem. I won't say anything, I won't scold or hit you. Waleed,
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful

Saudi Arabia leads the scene with twenty-four percent of the world's reserves.

This is one of the secrets and reasons behind major industrial nations hastening to occupy this region and its countries.

Prices of commodities and cost of living
In a direct conversation with the Deputy Prime Minister
Qatar's Minister of Energy and Industry
Abdullah bin Hamad Al Attiyah
And we say to the viewers who want to join us, call the numbers that appear on the screen.
Honorable Deputy, welcome.
I'd like to start with you about the unprecedented prices oil has reached.
Where could prices go?
Of course, where prices might reach, that's a puzzling question.
Or what we call market power.
Aren't you in OPEC?
But aren't these the production countries?
And not the producing countries, OPEC has nothing to do with oil pricing.
Is the relationship of price solely between supply and demand?
So far, supply and demand don't really have much to do with this.
So what are the factors?
There are other factors besides supply and demand.
What made investors
I feel a lot of pressure and have turned to oil and gold, or what is known as "commodities marketing."
Investors lost confidence in stock markets.
And he went away.
We saw gold rise from $350 in previous years to $970 now.
And today's price, as I mentioned before, is around one hundred and nine dollars.
But they're all going up, and if they go down, it'll be a gentle decline.
Let me remind you that in the first quarter of this year
Which is the second quarter that is supposed to see a drop in prices due to reduced demand for oil.
But we saw the market in an exciting and strangely changing state.
In the second quarter and at the beginning of spring, it rises above one hundred dollars.
But this means that the previous factors that determined the rise in prices for winter and consumption have now changed and there are other factors.
and economic growth
At the same time, we see oil prices rising to this level.
You mentioned political factors and said that political tensions play a role in this.
About Iran. Do you think Fallon's resignation in light of the political complexities
What was accompanied and today led most American newspapers and global media activities. It may affect oil prices.
Yes, 100% and today yes.
Today, we are in the era of globalization, and the impact comes quickly.
Unrealistic factors may influence
And it creates a kind of disturbance in the market.
Also created some types of political rumors.
He said there was no plan, but he didn't rule out the existence of other options that could be imposed on Iran.
And markets always react to uncertainty.
Of course, there's nothing certain now that America is at war with Iran.
And I'm one of the people who don't see this scenario.
And maybe there's something we haven't seen yet that will happen in the future.
But we work in the energy sector.
We see that these political tensions
In the world's oil supply
In return, there are very profitable supplies.
This indicates that there is oil going into storage.
There is never a shortage of oil supplies.
Prepared for the coming war
Under these circumstances, ensuring the image you're referring to regarding supply and that there are no obstacles in the supply chain.
In case President Bush and the United States decide to change their plan.
This is something else.
Prices are going to rise to reach record numbers.
Oil prices might rise.
Global oil reserves
You're here, today the Gulf represents importance.
In addition to Iraq, Iran, and other Gulf countries
Today they represent more than 60% of the oil reserves, that's for the confirmed ones.
You today
If a very minor accident happens.
Therefore, it indicates
Which means that in the event of any war with Iran, there will be no guarantee of the extent to which oil prices will rise.
God knows maybe he can make it today, we made it without him.
Wars of one hundred and seven and ten dollars, and it may jump to one hundred and ten, God knows.
Today, oil is living under political and psychological pressures, as I told you.
And the speculators rode these tensions.
We invested in oil.
Or what is not called a real investment, of course, neither buying the future nor marketing the future.
And its name is olive leaf.
And it's all speculation in oil stocks.
Its total production is around three hundred thousand barrels or less.
This could lead people to buy more and then develop more.
I wish April were April Fools' Month.
I hope there isn't any.
It is said that Shinny is coming to the area, and this is on his main agenda.
Cheney is the owner of this project, as many politicians and media figures have said.
I didn't know what was in the Chinese bag.
And I can't predict what it's going to be like.
Will he ignite the war?
America is in transition.
Why doesn't the boy do something else?
Let's see what happens if we talk about April. April is coming up soon, which means in a few weeks we'll be in April.
And the world can pay.
And America is a huge consumer.
In the Gulf countries
The Gulf will be the tough number.
You can't dial this number.
The cost of their production is very low.
Compared to West African countries, most of which rely on
No country in the world can match the Gulf.
We've been hearing this talk from the West and the United States for many years.
Use
Len akhrah wa tadhakaru qissat harb Bahr al-Qazwin. (Translation: Wait until the end and remember the story of the Caspian Sea War.)
Whatever these dreams may be
When you sit with Westerners in a small circle.
You hear them speak in a different way.
What are they saying?
On supplies, the importance of the region, and the value of reserves.
When I asked one of the European officials, I said: "It's strange that you speak among yourselves in closed rooms."
Not the same way you talk in front.
The media said: The reasons are political.
And of course, there's the double standards or the double language.
The dialect you know as "Gulf Arabic"
It has importance today, just like, for example, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
The largest producer and exporter of oil in the world
And her entry.
Despite all this
Commander of the Central Region
Declare war on Iran.
Even with an aerial war or airstrike, as they say.
In the supplies
You're not late, you're just very generous.
I disagree with you on the things you're saying.
We don't deal with the West at all.
We deal with America.
Where are the good prices?
Regardless of the nationality of this market
Put ,, for non-renewable energy.
For the sake of (in parentheses) generosity
Arab generosity
Go and give it to me.
Observers say the real price of oil
The reason behind the rise in oil prices
Oh people of the Gulf, OPEC, and the nations
You're being way too generous to the Americans; you're insisting on clinging to their currency.
I said the price of oil needs to be seventy dollars.
I said the actual price drop against the US dollar is sixty to seventy.
Okay, now the price is one hundred.
One hundred and nine because the dollar dropped thirty percent.
And now it's over a hundred dollars.
If we take the proportion.
No one denies
One of the main reasons
Compared to the decline of the US dollar
If we take
This comparison
Oil prices
Because the United States of America
Of course, it's in our favor for now that the dollar is falling.
Weakness or stagnation in the American economy. The United States can't do anything.
So what came was economic weakness and stagnation.
You will also become.
America is cutting interest rates on the dollar.
Why the insistence on linking oil to the dollar?
Let's talk about why the price of oil is tied to the dollar.
The first one who is over 100 years old.
The first one to start exporting the first barrel of oil exported from the United States of America.
And it is issued in dollars.
And it became from the twentieth century until today.
Pricing oil in dollars
Historically, it became
And for a hundred years, the world has been reacting and pricing.
And which today considers Norway to be the third-largest oil-producing country.
Oil export
Russia is the second-largest oil exporter.
North Sea field production in Europe
Prices are in dollars, not in...
Everything that changes in the world has sources and other information indicating something other than this.
You are the Gulf countries.
Do you have secret agreements between you and the Americans?
And oil became the real cover.
This is true and there's nothing in it.
These agreements
"The countries would stand to lose oil as a dollar hedge if the United States were to stop backing these regimes."
This is not true, and there are no secret agreements.
Today, let's stick to OPEC.
You have sixty-six percent attendance, Mr. Deputy.
Out of thirteen countries
Out of the eighty-five barrels, forty percent are OPEC's share.
In many large countries in oil production
Outside OPEC
What are the obstacles that prevent pricing in a second currency?
Convert the price to another currency.
Won't it be when the adults decide?
You, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf countries, oh clever one.
Today's OPEC class is like everyone else's.
Sixty percent
Even if we assume that OPEC wants this.
There is an agreement among all oil-producing countries.
There is a trend and an intention towards change.
What kind of attempt?
But now these countries cannot change the pricing currency.
Unless there is an agreement between
What effect?
Let me talk now about why the European...
They do not export their oil.
From the North Sea or Russia or Norway in euros or rubles
Because it's in their interest, their currency is strong and expensive.
No, on the contrary.
Here is the place of loss.
With one euro they export one and a half barrels.
No, you're the one who loses because your currency dropped since it's pegged to the dollar.
It's still a great loss.
The currency union here in the Gulf has a historical link.
Remember when the dollar was the strongest currency in the world?
And they are now connected when you talk about disengagement.
It's like a wedding day when we get married.
And you want a divorce, it's not easy.
There's nothing here.
Or married a Catholic for money.
And costs need to be studied in a way.
It was inspected professionally and examined thoroughly.
Similarly, Kuwait unwound twenty-five percent of its dollar currency position.
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE, and Qatar
You may adjust your currency's rate.
Today about the topic, but this doesn't mean you have no intention of studying or thinking about it.
The exam, of course, differs, as stated by His Excellency the Prime Minister.
It was mentioned that the Qatari currency is undervalued by thirty percent.
You are in this study.
You're the only ones going along with this idea.
Kuwait has moved forward on its own. Why don't you follow in its footsteps?
Economists say it is more profitable for countries and their peoples than losing.
But we
And nothing else.
that these four Gulf states declare
Everyone is a believer.
And I mean those who support it personally.
He will support it.
It needs to be put in the study.
In itself
What did he do as one nation or two?
Until the time for action came
So you don't fix the situation now.
Of course, there are experts who will conduct this study.
And they are the ones who will be
This requires a political decision.
Let's wait and not hurry now. See what's happening today.
People started... I mean
Of course, in collusion.
Honorable Deputy, the inflation rate in Qatar in 2007 reached 14% and will reach 15% next year.
Eats into people's salaries, swallows their wages. The wages of the workers here.
Salaries of residents in Qatar have eroded by thirty-five to forty percent.
We'll be back after the break to find out the size of the salary increases.
Many of the staff are in Qatar for at least the coming period, so stay with us.
Welcome back to "Without Borders" in this episode where we host the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of State for Energy of Qatar.
And industry, Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah, on the huge increase in prices.
In the oil that brought back tens of millions of dollars to the Gulf countries and producing nations.
My question was about the upcoming salary increase for employees, but before this increase, I would like to provide you with some important information about oil.
The UAE has 87 billion in reserves and produces 6.2 million barrels per day.
A ton just and the report on Kuwait Times is an economic report, Gulf revenues are one of the greatest.
The expected population in 2008 in Saudi Arabia is 91 billion.
And it was
170 last year in the UAE, 66 this year, and it was expected to be 75.
Kuwait in sixty-four was forty-five.
One quarter of oil plus fifty-five billion.
It's like she said in other reports, God willing, not out of envy, we don't envy the deputy's happiness.
Iraq forty-seven billion.
1.5 trillion
In terms of expenditure, it was one and a half trillion dollars.
Gulf countries exported one trillion dollars.
A dollar was a mix of imports.
American investment was three hundred billion.
Nine out of ten billion
In Bahrain, it was three percent.
In 2007, in Oman, it was 6.5 but will increase to 7. In Qatar, it was 13.75 but will increase to 15%.
Those living in Qatar can expect a high cost of living, from goods to prices.
The world is eating away at itself, prices are rising to high levels, and it's getting worse in Qatar.
We sympathize with everyone.
Then the solution must be
The solution means it aims to control inflation.
It means their salaries will increase by 50%.
They're not saying you're against raising salaries.
This is not true.
In the Cabinet, against raising salaries.
I am in a problem and the solution must be the ideal solution.
It's not a quick fix.
Okay, there's a balance between the two.
And it will be there, and that's it.
The important thing is to solve the inflation problem.
And here in Qatar, there's a committee.
The decree issued by His Highness the Amir to form
And he placed it.
And put on strong sunscreen.
To solve the problem and control inflation
What matters now is controlling inflation.
Inflation
If you control it.
But, Mr. Deputy, now
The one specialized in market research and who appeared last February, a few days before
Among them, because of the salaries.
Now you're solving inflation and letting inflation eat away at people's income.
I'll hurry them now.
Transfers to other countries
Increase our salaries, then solve the inflation problem and reduce it again.
I repeat their speech that balances the subject.
But now
And it's not a temporary solution.
Increase it further.
That's why it's here.
To stop inflation
Boredom forever
Because the increase was enormous over the past year, correct.
The second point is
And those working in the private sector are not the same as those working in the public sector.
The private sector is very neglected.
So now this matter of the raise needs to be seen fairly.
I don't know where he got these notes from.
We live in Qatar, Your Highness, not in Germany.
I'm telling you, on the contrary, today the private sector has started to pay.
Which is the most
Among the Qataris who worked in government offices, many have transitioned to the private sector.
Due to high salaries.
Do you have a problem?
To move to the private sector because it is more vibrant and dynamic.
And gives good salaries.
Attached to what is called market power.
Or market power.
They don't come with very high qualifications.
They don't come to Qatar because Qatar has low salaries or low expenses.
They come at their own expense.
Alright with our clear understanding
I don't expect any events and I'm not saying there will be a raise in salaries.
There's no hope left.
To control inflation
Let's give him some time.
On controlling inflation.
And, God willing, this is what he said about the report that Qatar was in 2008.
Insha'Allah, we say.
We'll see if these numbers change.
They sprayed it on the people.
It's a professional process.
Of course, professionally and all that.
From inflation
Because spending
Wide on various projects
Allow me to have some questions from the viewers, and I hope everyone will ask a direct question. Abdulaziz Mohammed from Morocco, what is your question, brother Abdulaziz?
Depends on the ruling families in the Gulf.
Therefore, I don't think justifying that is an OPEC dispute.
Secondly, the total oil revenue goes directly to the governor.
Then the right of the royal family and the rest will be for development.
In the absence of accountability, the situation will remain as is.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Welcome, my brother Ahmed.
I won't bore you with talk about the regimes, the issue of the Qatari riyal, and its peg to the dollar or other Gulf currencies to the dollar, but
America wants to globalize the world and make it swear allegiance to her.
The American deficit has become; trade between China and America reached eighty-two billion dollars.
The treaty with the European Union is worth $86 billion.
This means that all trends in global politics are against the dollar.
And we are paying the price of its consequences now as Arab countries and oil-rich Gulf states.
It's going to end in a confrontation between America.
And between the world's developed countries like China and Russia and others, the issue may become
Purely military
Because China's explosion, Russia's bombs, Japan's and America's bombs too.
Thank you very much for this clarification and information.
Your question is to Mohammed.
Hello, your question?
Can you turn down the TV and ask your question?
Your whole question is
But I saw him insist on not replying.
The topic is not related to the dollar because the dollar is declining.
With God's permission, you will reach the bottom.
He is a good man.
We need to follow the style of the Arab Idol program.
Thank you, my brother Mohammed. Thank you all, and now we have the final intervention from Ahmed Hassan from Qatar. Your question, Ahmed.
Good evening
Thank you, and thank you for the great interview.
What's required? A salary increase, God willing, things will get better.
It's true that we all face problems, not just in salaries.
Salaries, God willing, are fine.
Okay, tell me your question quickly.
Your line is going to be cut off. Do you have a question?
It's all due to the rise in prices. The increase affected all goods, they are all exported.
I am from European countries.
We have factories and laboratories in the Arab world.
Thank you, Ahmed, thank you. You took time for me.
And now the issue of rising prices is an important one.
The case of supporting poor men told you to stay with the poor, Your Highness.
Anyone who doesn't have a billion here is considered poor.
Here for some of the brothers, we are.
Who doesn't know Qatar?
That's not true for the State of Qatar.
The day Qatar comes to see the indicators.
What are the growth indicators in Qatar?
Highest growth indicators in the world
Where does this wealth go and what do you do with it?
What within the framework of a response
When the Moroccan spoke, he spoke in an unreal and unreality way.
The person who doesn't see with his eye.
If only he comes and sees Qatar and the huge developments taking place there.
As a great growth, you are right, you ask.
And everyone has the right.
And with your small population, where do you get people from?
So you mean you get the accessories from China, for example?
No, we don't export, with God's help we import.
The state is built on a plan and ...
The ideal independence of the amount of money coming from oil and gas, everyone knows that oil and gas will one day run out.
that Qatar will become
Considered one of the best achievements in the Arab world.
Today after
Focus on
And that has a great impact.
About the post-oil and gas era
So you're not copying us, Dubai?
Every country has its own peculiarities.
In the State of Qatar, we focused on education.
To those who are preparing
There will be a medical city where people come to get treated.
There will be a media city that will adapt.
Of course, the world today, today we need to build.
Building a vision
About the post-oil and gas era
There were fatal errors.
And unfortunately, we did not welcome these mutations because they took us by surprise.
And we were not prepared for it, neither humanly, nor technically, nor even educationally.
Now it has changed after thirty years.
And the best thing after that
Today there is a vision.
Vision
And the vision
Thank you, Mr. Deputy, and I also thank our audience.
To keep up with us, we hope we've provided you with
Qatar's foreign policy appears blurry to many observers.
Qatar enjoys distinct relations.
At the same time that Qatar had contacts with Israel, and still does.
From the Islamic Resistance Movement "Hamas"
And Qatar provided.
started
The largest Arab country
What upset the regime in Egypt.
To the extent of accusing Qatar of conspiring against Egypt.
Qatar was also not far from important files.
Like Darfur, the Houthis in Yemen, and even the Israeli prisoner.
Gilaad Shalit, Qatar's foreign policy reached out to him in a way that aroused the ire of the largest Arab states.
And what kind of power keeps him in this position?
These achievements
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani
Or contact us through our website www.Aljazeera.net
Welcome!
In September 22, 2007 to Saudi Arabia.
The visit marked a shift in the relationship between the two countries over the past two years.
Redrawing the borders
Wash what was stored.
This is what was mentioned.
In the newspaper or magazine of Hijaz.
What happened between Saudi Arabia and Qatar, where relations were restored and the Saudi ambassador returned.
To Doha
First of all, your introduction was very long and required many answers, without your last question.
What I believe you gave him
Especially regarding Saudi Arabia.
What is flour?
Saudi Arabia is very important to Qatar.
Between the two countries
You talked about the silence of the island.
I spoke about a revolutionary movement.
I think these matters were clear from both sides.
And we accepted the explanation.
In the State of Qatar
Disagreement with Saudi Arabia
It was always limited in scope.
From perspectives
Praise be to God, this is thanks to the wisdom of the two leaders.
King Abdullah and His Highness Prince
Large in the gulf
For over a hundred years
The relationships were bright, honorable, and built on trust.
My father focuses on the misunderstanding between two parties.
This issue is resolved and there were no conditions.
In solving any issue
But there was understanding and there was sincere intent between the parties.
To resolve this pending issue.
And it's not seasonal but a strategic relationship.
We wish for her to evolve, not merely continue.
Diplomatic sweet talk
Saudi Arabia withdraws its ambassador from Qatar.
I'm not used to speaking diplomatically, otherwise I would have prevented a lot of problems.
I always say what's on my mind.
Saudi Arabia is therefore not diplomatic but credulous.
The topic of the island falls under media.
Between the parties, many countries intervened as mediators.
They think it's possible to gain points at the expense of other countries.
Or at the expense of Qatar.
Or Saudi expenses
Healing within the Gulf house.
I mean the opposite of what was before.
It's part of a political agreement.
No, no, there was no agreement except for the agreement of love and mutual benefit.
But for anything else, you can ask the island management.
Have you built strategic relationships with Saudi Arabia to prevent what happened before?
It was originally based on a close strategy.
We can say it in one, two, three, and four.
And there must be unity.
And some disputes were settled on this basis.
Between some Arab countries and we try to resolve other disputes.
Because now, if we observe the differences in the Arab world, they are all differences based on different points of view.
When we have a viewpoint on a certain policy in a certain procedure in a certain issue, and another state has a differing opinion.
My destination is considered two points of view.
Some observers see that you enjoy criticizing Saudi Arabia.
To criticize him
Were you tired and decided to go in another direction, and from there you went to a bigger country, which is Egypt?
Okay, it's the same idea.
No, we're not enjoying either of these. We don't have anything.
To deal with any party in this manner
I mean, the reasons for the dispute with Saudi Arabia are over.
There is a great deal of understanding between them, and I know it.
And we know that we have founded
And there will be a type of form.
But Saudi Arabia
Let me put this under two lines.
You started to engage with Egypt, Al-Ahram newspaper, eighteenth edition, last April.
The Official Egyptian Newspaper
In a comprehensive investigation, he said that the expanded investigations
In Hezbollah's network, a sabotage plot was revealed.
Those targeting Egypt are three involved countries, namely Iran, Syria, and Qatar.
Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood
A well-known media outlet for its conspiratorial role
Qatar is the smallest Arab country.
Conspiring against Egypt
We respect.
And her struggle over the years.
I'm not saying this to manipulate anyone emotionally.
Let me finish what I haven't finished yet.
We appreciate
Egyptian President
And who is the eager one?
On Arab relations
The first point
The situation in Gaza.
As they say and as we acknowledge.
Qatar is
A smaller country.
What could be part of these plans
Because we have suffered from the interventions of other countries in the past, and I don't want to go back to that.
After the intervention of some countries in domestic affairs.
Thus, the policy of His Highness's government.
Now that they've discovered it, they call it a conspiracy.
What I'm trying to say is that regarding the house, God can protect it, Syria and Iran can defend themselves, I won't defend them.
Stability in Egypt
Why does Qatar want to change or interfere in such a matter?
And the pyramids don't bring things from the air.
He said that the miniature state of Qatar had sought to undermine Egypt's role and its relations with Turkey and the European Union.
And you sought to hold a conference parallel to the Arab summit to steal the spotlight.
And you are using a media outlet, which is Al Jazeera Channel.
Yes, go ahead.
With Hezbollah
We're comfortable with him.
But I can say we're certain.
That
The principle is non-interference in such circumstances.
We forced our brothers in Egypt, and that's why we blame the Egyptian officials.
The dispute with some members of the Egyptian government
But some officials have problems with
With what?
I'm coming.
O mother of the scent of good and peace and the cause of peace and that we are
And it has previously been held in Egypt.
And later with us
Because Israel
We have a disagreement with him.
You don't have a problem with Israel.
And now, because of the conference, from that day on
Any Islamic conference, any Arab conference, has sensitivity.
This allergy
Why don't you sit with them?
Let me finish.
We always wish for the best.
We discovered that this is an allergy.
Or three
Gaza Conference that took place
Egypt doesn't want to be in Qatar.
Not Arabic
In Qatar, and there is a summit in Kuwait, we told them.
The Palestinian people are under attack.
For over two weeks
But we assess it before any arranged conference, the Kuwait conference which we were the first to attend.
People are being killed and
And by procrastination
The dispute began.
No small country can
I know there are some brothers in the government, and this is also an insult to Egypt, not to anyone else.
The day they said "afterwards"
Okay, you're on the island.
And the Israelis were informed a day earlier that there would be a gathering to cease hostilities before any speech, any person, or any things.
What is it?
Brother, let the medicine and food enter during the beating that our brothers endured.
The day they say the gate was closed.
We can't get the trucks in.
They told us first that there was an agreement with the other party and they have to come.
Now is not the time to bring up Fatah or Hamas.
I don't care about either Fatah or Hamas. Our concern is the one and a half million people who are being attacked.
And those who don't have treatment.
The day we started talking about this topic and discussing the Gaza conference.
And Qatar's involvement in the matter affects the Egyptian regime.
This is not an intervention.
We said how Egypt will resolve the situation because it's within its purview.
One of the officials said, "We have uncovered a big plot from this."
He hasn't yet told us what the conspiracy was.
"We, meaning this is official."
He tells us that Egypt is something great.
Okay, we understand that Egypt is a large Arab country, and we always say that Egypt is a big country.
That's why we always ask a big country for many things.
Because Egypt is ours.
I attended a conference, and there was also provocation for them.
We were invited to a conference.
Reconstruction of Gaza
We coordinated and had a unified position.
People are suffering in Gaza.
It is forbidden to import Turkish goods through Israel.
I would be happy to see her enter through our brothers in Egypt.
These are part of us.
Even if Egypt wins or does a good political act.
We believe that this is in the interest of Qatar and the interest of the entire Arab world.
Egypt's stability is very important to us.
If they do a good job, it's important to us.
Let me finish your question, your introduction took a quarter of an hour.
The situation now has lost me.
No, I'm telling you now, anger.
Who is responsible for you in the Egyptian system?
We are the ones who caused the failure of the Qatar summit.
Secondly, they were the ones who failed the Qatar conference.
King Abdullah had a saying he wanted to implement.
And he wants to make reconciliations.
That's why some countries did not attend.
And I said this to our brothers in Saudi Arabia because we
He has no disagreements with Saudi Arabia, not even on this point.
Because, as explained, there are internal issues.
Or the officials
Among the high-ranking officials
A large country where the person in charge finds that a small country is doing such things.
It means there was something for you.
So they can take any role.
Darfur is part of Egypt's and Sudan's national security.
The five great powers decided.
Which country, just Qatar would be okay.
But these sensitivities will only make matters worse. Why do you have to stick your nose into everything near you?
We need to know what this allergy is so we can take the right allergy medication.
Why allergies?
Some brothers from the government
They have an internal failure.
They want to divert attention from the conspiracy in Gaza Revolution.
As if the English can blame the Italians.
All that happened
Not just instructions but also analyses.
We know what happened because
The issue needs to be resolved locally.
And it's not a solution.
My country, not my priority.
My priority is to first investigate the reasons that concern my country.
Then I'll see if I have enough time.
And we see the reasons that concern my Arab nation.
"Or Qatar tried to fix."
And thinking about any possible Arab issue, she contributes to it as much as possible.
Why are you being provocative? Why don't you take it in good faith?
I can't fix you.
I can explain my point of view.
Don't throw it at me.
From our perspective
What emanated from his heart.
Let me finish.
The day he announced the reconciliation initiative and all the leaders gathered in Kuwait, we hoped for something good, and I welcome this.
There is spelling.
Of course, the official Egyptian who clarified his achievements.
In a report, interview, or something similar, I won't respond to it.
Because I have a response to every point.
Just to maintain the minimum relations that bind us and bind Arab interests.
It also comes in response to the call referred to by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.
But what I can advise him or anyone else on is
And they try to correct their mistakes, internally or externally.
In politics or economics, or any other field, we all have our own mistakes, just like we have our own errors in politics and economics, therefore no one is infallible.
Because they accuse Qatar of all these charges.
He denied that there is a relationship between Qatar and Hezbollah.
This is a funny topic.
Distorting Egypt's relations, undermining its role, and disrupting its connections with Turkey and the European Union.
And we are few in number.
If we can pull this off
This is not true.
In some accusations against you personally
To pay money to Shalit's captives so that Qatar takes Shalit and outbids the Egyptian role in this matter.
They always accuse us of paying money, but we didn't pay any money, and we didn't tell anyone that we were giving money.
But this situation
We support Egypt to solve the same thing as we support Egypt and we are still working to resolve the issue between the Palestinians.
It was he who allowed the Palestinian president to stay until the issue is resolved.
We were there and the first to support the State of Qatar.
In power and for Palestinian institutions, they will remain until the dispute is resolved.
And we said that
"In the Arab League, but he said no, we let it happen because we believe there are people who don't want this."
But we did it cleverly.
He is addressing his boss.
His Prime Minister
By God, I don't know that there's a problem.
I don't know which one of them it is.
The decision was made in the twelfth of April last year exclusively with Al-Shuruq newspaper.
That the political leadership in Egypt has decided to launch a satellite news channel to counter the media outlet called Al Jazeera.
It's a matter of days and everything will be over.
You're afraid the island will become a thing of the past.
You mean we're currently living through a political adolescence.
You also wavered towards Saudi Arabia, and the Emir of Qatar sat with the Saudi king.
We didn't give in to them, nor did they afterward.
We dealt with them as brothers.
A small concession from the small state to Egypt, the large state.
"Neither Saudi Arabia, at a crucial point we need to clarify."
The relationship between Qatar and Saudi Arabia is not the same.
And then we'll talk.
So, what's your opinion on the relationship between Qatar and Egypt?
We rely on him a lot.
Let me be frank with you.
Or it's a dispute in core politics.
I hope it's not a personal dispute because we have no personal disputes. I told you, we respect the Egyptian people.
If I asked you to name two problems, Gaza and what else?
This situation affected all of us greatly.
"The psychological aspect of my problem means solving the dilemma."
Publish in some newspapers.
Minister of Foreign Affairs
In the presence of H.R.H. Prince Saud Al-Faisal
Let's talk about everything.
But it's clear that things have gotten worse and haven't been resolved.
No, no, I didn't hear it.
I can't tell you about our relationship in Egypt.
They scold us, and they're entitled to since they're our friends.
And we reproach them for our sake and for the sake of our younger brothers.
With the big countries, we don't want to compare ourselves to any big country.
Egypt is too big to please.
It's not a matter of life or death, but I hope the solution comes from heaven.
For us, if there is someone waiting for satisfaction.
"Or waiting for a way"
In Qatar
Dealing with non-relatives or non-siblings.
As a large country, yes, we are proud of Egypt as a large country.
But if there's someone cheating on someone
I know that Israel does this to us.
The previous American policy under the previous administration was also either with me or against me.
For I do not believe that they want to imitate either Israel or America on this issue.
Even if we take their policies, they are also pressured by third parties.
Let me finish often.
We understand and know that there are some dictates even for a large state.
What controls your policies?
We have no movement, only one thing moves us.
"Qatar's internal affairs are our internal affairs."
And we will help the Arab world whenever we can.
And what are the sources of power: Al Jazeera and Al Udeid Base
You could say it's not authoritative.
Our faith in God and confidence
Or seeing His Highness the Prince.
Let's keep our distance.
Let me finish. We don't want to cause any problems for anyone.
And we don't want to compete with anyone.
They can say whatever they want, Qatar the Great or otherwise.
But we have a point of view.
First, we closed the Israeli office. We closed it.
At first they said, "Close the office," so we heated it up. They got angry and went to complain to the Americans. Can you believe these people?
Join the team and name it the Devils' Team.
What are they saying?
Americans and Europeans, they are my people and I know how to deal with them.
Stratagems
What was created.
This is a flaw. We reached a certain stage and then what?
Fry it now.
Dot by dot, how do you solve the problem with Egypt?
And based on the fact that Egypt plays a significant role in the Arab world.
We think it's important to see him.
And I'm sure that President Hosni Mubarak warned about this.
But some of the crew
I need to get out.
Capturing the Egyptian public opinion, government, or else the leadership will follow.
And we focus on Arab and Egyptian interests.
Are there any steps?
We are behind them, not in front of them, because they are a great nation.
In the near future
Frankly, I can't imagine how it will be.
And I know there's time for regret.
And there will be time, O Mana.
If it were up to me.
Or them
Major Arab interests brought them together.
One day we'll get this topic.
You mean life still goes on.
That means we won't respond in the same Egyptian style you used.
If someone extends a hand to us, we'll help them with a full arm.
And now, Your Highness, Sheikh.
We've never been used to running.
Except on a sound basis and we are ready to serve Egypt.
With Egypt
There are many rumors about Egyptian labor in Qatar and how they are affected by this issue.
And there are contracts for Egyptians working in universities or in high-ranking positions.
You know about this matter, it's not our habit to cancel jobs and appointments.
Because these people have nothing to do with this.
This is a market with changing demands. They cancel one and bring in another.
This is supply and demand, with some nationalities increasing and others decreasing.
Okay, quick answer.
The office was there.
We messed up the office, so it's best to leave it now.
We could have patted him on the back in the days when they didn't have a campaign. All our losses in negotiations with Israel were because of this office.
So we told him to let them fix it with Netanyahu.
He was a guest.
And it is our custom to invite all the ambassadors accredited to any foreign country.
It was not an official invitation to honor Gabriela Shalev.
No, we didn't honor her before. As they say, the relations were good. We would honor her now, but it's a bit difficult.
There's no reason now that he should make you reopen the office during this period.
The office reopens when there are no reasons not to.
I left it big.
Who let it grow bigger than Egypt?
Egypt imposed this.
Let me be clear with you, our relations with America are strategic relations.
In some things, and this.
What's the most important thing?
There are issues in our region where we have had differences with the previous administration in resolving certain cases.
Now we have high hopes for the administration, especially with the steps President Obama has taken.
We think there is a good chance that this administration
Strive diligently to advance the path of peace and strive diligently to resolve the Palestinian issue.
They are our people, and we don't deny that.
What's the deal with Iran? And what might be its impact on the Gulf and on you?
It's up to the Iranians to decide how to solve their issues.
Among them
In their usual ways, and I'm sure they will overcome this crisis.
Iran's stability as mentioned by the Emir of Qatar.
Important for our region, the Gulf region, and we share the same borders with Iran.
Of course, we have special relations with all our neighbors, including Iran.
Because our country seeks peace and stability for this region.
And we intervene whenever a party wants to change the Doha Agreement.
And I believe that Saad Hariri said
Now it's over, and all that remains is the strategic conversation between the president.
Lebanese groups
About how to see.
As for Yemen, you have no role, neither you nor them, just take a stand.
I hear it's well-known that we supported unity when almost the entire Arab world was against the unity of Yemen.
We are the only Arab country and Gulf state that stood with the unity of Yemen.
And in the south, we spoke with Yemen, and His Highness the Amir sent me twice to meet the Yemeni president.
And I explained to them that our goal is the stability of Yemen because Yemen is an important country in the Arabian Peninsula.
They didn't respect the agreement, and I don't want to say what each one is doing.
But what affected me
This is Qatar, which has been accused of paying money to the Houthis and high-ranking Yemeni officials.
Because we don't interfere in these matters.
And whoever stands with unity, do not stand against it.
And another goal in the interest of Yemen, whether politically, economically, or otherwise.
We don't have an objection, but to be honest, I'm shocked.
Because I went more than ten times during the fighting, His Highness the Sheikh sent me between the Yemenis to Yemen.
Unfortunately, this is a strange accusation.
Time's up, but in short, tell me, will these problems you faced due to your efforts to solve problems change your policy of intervening in other Arab problems?
If only Sheikh would listen to my advice, I think it's unnecessary.
There was a big sale once.
Over five billion dollars at that time, if we had invested it, it would have become fifty billion dollars, better than the headache.
But I say it with conviction, because the time in the Arab world now...
Forbidden under these circumstances.
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
Can even exceptional with Sheikh Hamad's case
What happened to the agreement in Doha?
How did the Doha Miracle happen?
To empower the committee and provide it with all necessary support.
Discussion on Lebanon after the Israeli invasion
A day when there was Arab consensus.
When we went to New York, we were able to make a more balanced decision.
And we sought in this in Doha that both parties were eager.
We tried as much as we could not to hear it or not to be aware of it.
Because we knew the committee, we knew.
The reality on the ground and we know what the problem is after we sat with the Lebanese for long hours.
I believe it's a shared success.
But there was insistence.
I think Lebanon's problem is that the atmosphere of the region directly affects it.
Whether it is peaceful or non-peaceful
Lebanon was supposed to have this position.
Under these conditions
Unfortunately
External repercussions
I can say that the problem between Lebanese, even if there is an issue, won't be the number one problem.
Okay, Sheikh, I know that maybe it's not the right time yet, maybe it's too early to talk about the scenes.
What made you come here?
A kind of engagement talk stood on the ground now.
You weren't even a second late.
I know exactly what happened; even the Lebanese leaders were telling me what happened.
Not from the beginning
The day I spoke with His Highness.
I told him if we go to Lebanon.
His Highness the Ruler endorsed and supported the idea.
Where will all the Lebanese leaders be present?
Because here in Beirut, you have to go to each person's area.
They are in the same hotel and the same place.
They met on the same plane and chatted.
"So we did this thing, but from the start it was our idea."
And this was the most important decision that the two made.
Of course
And I felt this from the Arab League.
Then we need to be honest intermediaries.
Praise be to God, I believe this has proven to everyone that Qatar has strived.
On both sides
To reach a dignified solution for both parties.
And there will be a solution where no one loses.
Before you do anything
The consultation took place at the Arab League and we found support.
About what we did.
And I said to him, "And we were there."
If we succeed in Lebanon, we'll take them to Doha.
And he advised me.
They lock them up and take their phones away.
We were able to bring them there, and the brothers in Syria also supported the matter.
And I told you from the beginning, without Arab support, the committee can't do anything.
Why do they want a solution?
I believe the situation in Lebanon and the escalation that occurred.
And this is the time.
There is tension in Somalia. There is tension in Sudan.
There are many things happening in the world.
And every time we put out the fire
It is in the best interest of the Arab world to avoid foreign interventions.
And we try our best.
Sends forces
Even if he's a soldier.
For example, I believe this is a topic.
There's a point that needs to be discussed.
He always said that the solution to the Lebanese file was...
Saudi-Syrian Agreement
To stop the Arabs, meaning Qatar and the Arab League.
Could what happened in Lebanon lead to serious reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Syria?
We need self-review in the Arab world.
"Because of Arab differences"
Any agreement between two Arab states.
And we tried this.
In the war of seventy-three
Why can't Arabs agree on a solution to the issue?
I think it's interesting.
Saudi Arabia and Syria play a significant role in Lebanon.
Both parties are required.
Seize wisdom.
Arab relations are on the right track.
Because here in the Arab world, we are facing many big challenges.
Everyone is playing in our yard.
And we have no power or strength.
How can we stop the play from being performed in the Arab world?
As Arabs, at least the minimum agreement.
Unfortunately, we complain.
As we were going up
Our difference as Arabs and the lack of trust among us; trust is non-existent between Arab countries.
And the Arab states
It's not betrayal, it's more like a kind of...
What's the word for jealousy?
This is a case that requires support from everyone, I think.
Will Zain fulfill this wish or not? And will he, will he hold an Arab summit?
We suffer when he suffers and rejoice when he rejoices.
I came in the middle of the story.
Is it possible for him to play a role in patching up the rift between Damascus and Riyadh, even if?
Eager to find solutions, and I am certain of their wisdom.
They might reach an understanding.
Among them in many cases
There was harmony in politics, and I am sure that, God willing, this will continue.
Relations have improved.
Both parties need to take a step.
But I can't say for certain that this is what's happening now.
I'm sure if Arabs focused on resolving disputes between Arab countries and the problems of some Arab states that I mentioned earlier,
It is a source of optimism and pride for the citizen that there is a general Arab awakening.
But what I can say is what happened in Lebanon.
It could be interpreted on the ground that there is an Israeli-Palestinian escalation.
There could be an American-Iranian escalation, there could be other scenarios.
Will you still be afraid of him in the coming months?
We, as Arabs
We can only deliver food and medicine.
Electricity for the people.
We in Qatar are ready and His Highness the Amir is always there.
Over 1.5 million Palestinians are besieged.
And their prophets should not have weapons or support.
They're doing all this.
No electricity.
And we give him the right of the Red Cross organization so that he can deliver it to the Palestinians.
With the Palestinians, we provide food and medicine.
Our conflict with them could continue.
And I hope that the Palestinians on both sides will put the national interest first.
And leave illusions behind.
The Palestinian schism is now a deep wound.
To find a solution
But they didn't commit.
This is a serious matter, they must abide by the Mecca Agreement.
And they must do it again, go to Mecca and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
This resolves the dispute.
He won't benefit.
Why any promises from any side?
I hope there's a solution.
Our position is well-known and stated to all concerned parties that we
We won't be a party to it and we won't accept being a party to any military conflict with Iran.
We have good relations with him.
But we are a sovereign state and they are a sovereign state.
Everyone is pursuing their own interests, but these interests won't harm them or us.
We believe that the destiny of the Gulf should be in clear agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council.
Iran's cooperation and peaceful neighborhood
But when you say that Qatar is not a party.
Any details or clarifications
Just a sign.
Never
Okay, Dad, I'll go back to the Lebanese file if you don't mind.
Frankly, Your Excellency, we were facing a major deadlock, but we reached a solution in the last few hours.
Some linked what happened to what was announced.
It could be disparate pieces of information that aren't related to each other, but that's what happened.
What led you to this conclusion?
What happened in Istanbul, I know if it had been specified before.
That's how I knew there were negotiations.
Continuously finding a solution.
And without a doubt, the Kingdom's support is very important.
And change negotiation tactics.
These negotiations led to
Leading to a positive outcome, we gathered some parties from various sources.
And we started talking.
There is an Arab and Qatari approach in this paper.
Tell me what the problem is with this paper.
And we started talking about the subjects, one subject at a time.
At the last moment, you overcome an obstacle that persisted until the end.
But the prince met with the parties.
And I got rid of this consequence.
And there was a solution.
We heard a word from His Highness the Amir of Qatar at the opening session in Doha.
You don't consider your role now.
The most important thing is that we stay out of the spotlight.
We have no territorial ambitions.
Or even that it exerts control over another state or something because our state
Our size... We are proud of ourselves and believe that we can contribute to solving issues with our fellow peers.
But in the Arab world, it's very important.
To have countries.
Their actions matter, and this is important.
Some small countries delegate this role and support them.
In some matters, he is excellent, in some good, and in some less than good.
The last question, Your Excellency the Minister.
What is the central priority?
Is it a political priority?
"Security or peace fosters enmity."
Confronting Israel
We stop the play at the Arab court.
We fix what in Arab countries our problems
To choose an active member in Iraq.
To calm the situation down
At the national and regional levels
But if we become stubborn
Or he'll have any hope.
Thank you, His Excellency Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, for this meeting.
International efforts to stop the ongoing war on Gaza.
We start by requesting you to convene a meeting of the Council of the League of Arab States at the ministerial level.
You've changed your mind about
He called for an emergency Arab summit.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. First of all, I'm happy, Hassan, that you are in this program.
Despite the humanitarian circumstances
What we're seeing from our brothers in Gaza
Conditions require us to do a lot.
Qatar ignored the Arab summit.
In fact, when we came up with the idea of the Arab summit before
Not just the Security Council resolution but also through
Neither trampled nor humbled
Let me put it in another sentence.
While we were practicing
That the street can no longer bear it, if we, as those responsible for the Arab street, can bear it.
You won't bear it.
The day we were in Egypt.
"It was written 'agreed' from ten to eleven."
Some spoke at the meeting, and it was possible to hold a meeting.
What we hold on to is as much as there is an Arab consensus.
And I wouldn't blame them if, in a meeting, they had a point of view.
And how can the problem be solved?
Because it will be solved.
This is the important matter.
Because our goal isn't advertising. Our goal is to find...
That means you ignored the summit.
Even we ask ourselves.
We're going to put pressure on the weak side.
The previous and subsequent Security Council resolution, but let's just stay on the topic of the Arab summit, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Speak clearly that the situation may require an Arab summit with whoever is present.
We found that the majority of our brothers support holding the summit.
With those who are present.
And I don't know what they mean by moderation.
We are the only people
Only the Arab nation, if we go to any nation in Asia, in Latin America.
Unsolved
Those that were classified as moderate countries
And what is moderation in our eyes?
Will you abandon the Palestinian cause?
Just because we don't love them.
Are we interfering in the affairs of the Palestinians in some way?
No one should let either the good or the bad interfere.
Like Hezbollah, and who knows, maybe tomorrow another movement will emerge.
Is he asking?
And can we accept them as part of the Arab body?
It's as if it's written for us to engage in an internal Arab battle.
Okay, if we go to the Security Council.
There is no resolution in the Security Council.
I hope that after Israel finishes its mission,
Okay, the second Arab ministerial meeting that you are invited to attend.
Who was dominated by intense debates, disagreements, and altercations.
There's an important point.
This isn't important.
The day we call for a meeting
About booths
No peace after this day.
Are the ministers ready for this?
Because there's a party that tells you we have to wait.
But we are in an Arab initiative.
and freezing peace talks with Israel.
We say we're at a party, he says we're losing in this.
In a greater loss than what we've lost now, but we were always respectful, well-mannered, and committed to decisions since the days of the truce.
You say that arguments are not important.
There was someone who wished Hamas would be destroyed and things like that.
This reflects a political stance more than it does a dispute between two ministers.
Unfortunately, this has happened.
But not everyone
I don't want to talk about others.
It is important to be self-made men and men made by our state.
We are making policies for our countries.
Who does these things for him?
I think
I don't think they'll respect us in the end.
Who does things on behalf of the West?
No, and I hope I don't accuse anyone. I don't want to accuse anyone about this matter.
After the Security Council resolution
What will his agenda be?
The situation began with a decision to exert Arab efforts.
And the dispute here is whether Israel will implement the decision immediately.
We can say there's a decision.
But Israel did not implement the resolution.
Are we ready now to go and request Chapter 7? I know and am certain there are difficulties.
There are no questions from the international community, even if there were questions.
You are shy.
The situation
I saw that they were doing something for the Jews and Israel.
So they can get their rights.
This is the current Arab situation.
If the Arabs didn't go to the Security Council
They agreed to hold a summit and make tough decisions.
And the Western countries are trying to influence us.
Because we are in the Arab world, with a very large population, and you can see how the Arab street reacts to this.
But this decision is important.
Regarding contacting our supervisors one by one.
In the end, they said there was nothing and that it was a lie.
Okay, if we were like Germany or others, we would demand.
They don't have to pay any compensation because they were the ones who carried out the attack. Just say you have incorrect information.
And hundreds of thousands were killed.
This is because you are a weak Arab party.
We are Arab, some of us.
How did they work so much?
To show it.
As if it were fate from God.
If the Arab nation says, "If you send troops to Darfur, we will send troops to Darfur."
Arabs or some people considered Resolution 1860 a failure.
And our quarter worked properly to get the decision out.
What was issued by the Security Council
I don't want to say whether it was a win or not.
And what will reach us?
Let's assume that winning
What are we going to do?
We should not combine this with the other decisions.
But I assure you that we are committed to the decision.
Unfortunately, you will accept the decision even though you shouldn't.
Even after the Israeli rejection, Israel agreed.
It means "so we" or "that means we" in English.
Will you have a substitute, or is it better for you to call for a ministerial meeting?
I don't think the Arab nation
At the same time, ready for any alternatives.
And I don't believe that the Arab nation is ready.
In implementing the Gaza blockade
For various political reasons
So that a faction can defeat another faction in Palestine instead of reconciling with them.
We start trying to make plans.
One day they held a gathering, I don't know if it was Arab intelligence in Europe or something like that, without mentioning names.
And once they're done, that means we're sharing.
In implementation
What do the West want from us?
Let's just go.
I want there to be a distinction in this.
Of course, I'm not talking about the decision, I'm talking about...
The follow-ups because this Gaza issue started two years ago, not now.
I'm going to talk about the topic from two years ago, specifically regarding the decision.
Do you have reservations about his conditions?
Neither issued nor implemented.
We weren't invited.
They might think we have a different perspective.
Everyone was expected to have the same viewpoint.
Not everyone has to agree, but I think those who left tried their best.
And we thank them for this.
Regarding what happened in Gaza two years ago, and you mentioned the parties involved.
Prevailing over a category that participated in the siege of Gaza
Are you really convinced by the statements, insinuations, or accusations that have come from here and there?
About a real Arab conspiracy with everything that's happening now in Gaza.
We received a partial report.
"On the subject, let me tell you we are not fully informed."
But I know.
The Palestinian conflict
It ignited on the Arab and international level.
Even if there wasn't any increase, they wouldn't have differed much.
And after the elections...
With great enthusiasm, I took power.
By a majority
We had to give them a chance and see.
They either want reform or they are still revolutionaries who only know the gun and fighting.
But one day they came.
On the Arab level, some of our brothers used to believe that these radical movements should not have come to power.
Some of them are saying that there was an assault just now.
Those who broke the ceasefire are Hamas, or are these Palestinians from Gaza who broke the ceasefire?
Truce
Just as the Palestinian people in Gaza have been starving for two years.
Normal
For Israeli security reasons
It's clear that we don't want them in power, but that's not what concerns me in Qatar.
But what is the fault of the rest of the people?
And then who should decide?
These or those, not all of them have sovereignty in their choice.
Our government
It is the main problem.
But I'm sure it could have been solved.
If only we tried, we would try to ignite the dispute.
But it's clear that we were asked to make one group defeat the other because this group...
We consider them terrorists or we consider them.
All that happened led to
Even the promises they made to the party to provide them with a decent life.
They didn't do anything to them.
Let's go back to the international and Arab efforts being made to stop what is happening, as you mentioned you had said.
There is a Security Council resolution that Israel has not yet accepted.
And the Egyptian initiative, which is
And Egypt in Cairo
These are the efforts of the Egyptians.
On the contrary, not trickery.
Required for an important role
Egypt's borders are also next to Israel and Palestine.
We are
And we won't stop the chaos now.
In Gaza, we need to bring people together to stop the chaos in Gaza because
This is not the path to peace.
It has to be.
That's why we always ask them for a big role.
"And what was broadcast?"
Does that mean you can't assess the initiative now?
It gives the possibility of success or study.
I think his chances of success are slim.
If the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt can
Keep Palestinian views more similar.
And it is the party harmed in Gaza that should discuss the initiative.
Because he is the one who can say yes or no.
And this is an important point.
When Resolution 1860 was issued
This is a Palestinian Arab problem that we have.
We don't want to hear any sides.
But I really wanted to, when the Palestinian delegation left.
And when they went to the league, they requested to have someone from Gaza with them.
To show the Israelis that these are our people and we are with them.
This is an important point.
We don't give up power.
Our goal is not to build our policy.
To stay in power.
The sheikh now.
I don't know if we can discuss the Egyptian initiative because you haven't gone through its materials.
Do you think, in principle, that this could serve as a mechanism to implement UN Resolution 1860, as some people have stated?
Balanced role
Now, not tomorrow or the day after tomorrow because
Every day that passes
There will be blood shed for our brothers there.
That's why we don't want to postpone, and the Israelis won't postpone on this matter until they finish their mission. We will present this initiative.
And I'm sure the brothers in Egypt know this and reserve it.
I want to clarify everything I said.
Now we need to solve the issue.
And it's not what Israel wants it to be.
The Turkish role has been attractive since the beginning of the crisis.
Does it express?
Arab vacuum
Undoubtedly, a striking position.
It has an Arabic depth.
Entrance for Disabled People
We know there is an Arab disability.
Part of it was due to disagreements.
Partly because each person thinks their point of view is the complete one.
And a second person thinks that his point of view is the best.
And without a conscience, how do you expect people to respect and acknowledge the Arab decision?
Or they'll get us one by one.
One says, "No problem, we'll give them an extra two or three days so we can contact them and bring the guys to make it equal and solve the issue."
We must rise above this and not accept it.
Hamas may have mistakes, but we engage with them.
Arab level
But now
At least we say no to them.
Within the framework of the required stance for Qatar, stances such as, "We will return to this point later," but
Also in the field at the same time I heard.
Yesterday, Khaled Mashal, the head of the Political Bureau of the Hamas movement.
Firstly, everything Brother Khalid Mish'al said is unnecessary, with all due respect and appreciation for him.
Why don't you sit down with Khalid Mash'al and talk to him as Arabs?
Let's go to him at the Arab League and tell him.
This is an important story.
I am from Hamas.
Imposing Israel's conditions imposes conditions.
Let them impose conditions; they have no right to impose conditions, and Israel is fine with it.
First of all, what do you think of this Arabic gift?
They are cattle and we shouldn't listen to this people, once they told me De Gaulle didn't listen.
Completely different, first De Gaulle liberated his country.
With allies or without, he liberated his country from the fiery occupation.
What are we talking about now?
Is this the Arab gift we're supposed to give?
Leaders must represent the views of their people.
The Arab peoples in all these demonstrations we have witnessed
What can be supplied from these classes that are demanded.
Many of those who criticize Qatar in this situation also demand
About what's happening, the actor and the office are still open.
They speak the same language.
We sever relations, we go with all Arab states.
To cut all ties, even if someone claims to have a pact.
They want Qatar to sacrifice itself.
We are
And this is more important than the relationship.
Not just in this decision, in this one and in harder decisions.
I regret this decision.
We need a unified Arab stance.
For others
That no one sells one another for personal gain, moral or material, or otherwise.
Yes, before we close this file, on this subject, there are also countries that have taken individual steps.
Good, Chavez is another matter. He has disputes with the United States.
Our people don't need us to remind them.
Five permanent member ambassadors present these arguments in films.
What we've finished and the street now knows better.
With the high ceiling, your happiness, Sheikh.
Or demanding that Lebanese forces confront the Israeli aggression and so on.
Do you think it would work if it were framed within a single Arabic frame?
But we call for an Arab stance that will make people respect us.
I don't think the Arab countries are ready to fight.
"Nor do we encourage"
How do you bring together Syria, Lebanon, and other countries, when there are Arab countries that don't communicate with each other?
It has to be.
A shift in Arab relations.
This policy that currently exists among Arab states.
It's still there, but I think it's over.
In goals
Important subject
And they know the Lebanese composition.
There is no doubt that Lebanon
Set an example if you reclaim your lands.
The situation in Gaza is going to change.
Staring from all directions
This siege
Give her a natural disposition.
What does congratulating Israel's goals mean? Does it mean the goals of the operation for Israel?
One day you will hurt someone, one day you will punish someone, and one day you will please someone.
The example of what happened in Lebanon for them is not a good example.
A sample solution that happened in Lebanon.
They consider him handsome.
From Gaza
The problem in Gaza or Palestine is easier to solve than in Lebanon.
Those who disagree with each other, should we reclaim our land today or tomorrow?
Their differences over power
On the distribution of power
This differs because they are closer to each other intellectually.
More than a Lebanese intellectual.
Therefore, the solution is much easier.
And that's the problem.
Happiness Sheikh
We only have a few minutes left if we finish the matter as soon as possible.
And a diplomat.
How does this process end?
I am a Palestinian from Gaza.
Let me tell you.
Or reject
And he helped.
"He who is not with us"
It will be an Arab failure.
From a strategic standpoint
But from the Palestinian side
There were some efforts, but we didn't see a full initiative.
Not before now, why?
It's not a matter of initiative as much as we're feeling it.
Whoever solves the issue, we'll help without mentioning Qatar's name because some people have problems with mentioning Qatar.
Don't give up, because there's a summit in March that's going to happen.
If we take the initiative, we'll be better than our brothers. No, I don't think so.
We don't put pressure on them.
Because history won't spare us if we pressure them.
We were moving forward with this initiative and saw all parties involved; there was a meeting on the fourth day, but it was postponed due to the Security Council.
We hope, God willing, to make progress, and we hope that our Arab brothers will help us as much as possible in this matter.
And we hope to push him out of the competition.
Arab competition
In heating up due to their dispute with the Sudanese government at some point.
And these are our problems. Well, we argue with each other and disagree.
I don't want to go through that.
In Kuwait in the nineteenth century, next month, of course, the Arab situation.
As you know, as you mentioned and explained.
Does the entire Arab atmosphere support it? Is it the first economic summit?
His Highness
And of course, we attend any summit held in a sister country.
And we have no objection to attending any summit.
But we're not afraid to become a political summit.
Of course, taking into account that time imposes itself.
"The train has left the station, even if it means it will be back in ten days."
You're talking about the Palestinians after they've been silenced for twenty-five days.
Will be
What do Arabs say? They don't unite.
We said that
We said that
With all due respect, this summit was scheduled and we are committed to it.
I think we
The Arab street is against us.
In our current approach
Therefore
And mention your history.
And saying this is enough, it is guaranteed.
For this meeting
Thank you to the audience for watching.
Coverage of the ongoing war on Gaza continues. Goodbye.
A few days ago, there was a celebration for the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani
In Doha and contributed to the preparation of a draft law in particular
And a member of several local and Arab councils in the field of childhood.
Also provided more than seventy-five lectures and workshops, presentations, and articles published in Arab and international journals.
First, let's agree on the term currently in use.
To refer to people with disabilities, we say "people with special needs" rather than "people with disabilities" as I mentioned.
First of all, good evening.
Taken from a human rights perspective or culture of human rights because persons with disabilities
Because she dealt with people with disabilities, she considered them first-class people.
Human
And it resulted in his disability through his attempts to adapt to society.
The medical concept was the prevailing one at that time.
Move towards the idea.
Special education and training appeared.
This category has become.
That's why we started calling them "special needs individuals."
The normative rules from which it was derived.
The role of the Special Rapporteur in monitoring the implementation of this document.
And the pace increased until the international agreement appeared, which was legally binding and distinguished from the rules in this regard.
And set a basic condition or fundamental rule for this term.
Those who deal with these people as if they were humans, as if they were people.
With the change in terminology as you mentioned, is there a change in the perspective of this segment of society?
Yes, and it is measured in a certain way.
This varies from region to region.
But the special thing about this is...
That the Arab world was distinguished or differed.
But legal orientations include human rights and they exist, for example, in Africa.
In Latin America, but the reasons could be the lack of financial resources. Not like that.
Of course, that's what I wanted to say: culture exists, but sometimes there's a lack of resources and a lack of political will.
Sometimes regulations, but
But unfortunately, awareness is also a bit weak, and there is no culture of human rights.
Ten percent of the world's population are disabled.
Eighty to ninety percent of people with disabilities are from developed countries and are of working age.
And they suffer from unemployment.
I mean during my visit to Darfur.
He is aware of the presence of mines and weapons.
Males are one degree better.
Adding disabilities, they will be in remote areas and distant regions.
That's why there are many organizations working in this field and trying to raise awareness.
Awareness and obtaining the right to education
Instead of establishing many religious centers.
They went to set up rehabilitation centers, hospitals, and schools.
And this is one of the things, praise be to God, that we have achieved through our work in the office.
I tried with the current organization in Qatar.
To develop an agenda
Or incorporate the agendas of these humanitarian organizations to include those centers.
In light of the deteriorating conditions of persons with disabilities in the world
I can't name it, and I agree with you that there is a decline.
If there was a setback in the Arab region, it is because of the state of disability.
In a social context within a political and economic framework, we cannot expect the circumstances of people with disabilities to be
And they are among the marginalized groups.
In a country like I told you, for example, Gaza and Darfur.
On the contrary, I can't at all assert that there is no improvement in the situation.
And it was actually applied on the ground, and if I could give an example, I would say...
Qatar Red Crescent
We agreed that the projects include
People with special needs who have health issues are part of this strategy, and there are other programs as well.
What we tried after we included him.
As part of the work of organizations on the ground.
Kamal Kirro is with us now from Syria. Hello.
Good evening, I am Suleiman Kirro.
Solomon, I'm sorry, please go ahead.
My best regards to you and Mrs. Hafsa.
First of all, is there a mental disability in the laws of the United Nations?
Intellectual inertia means that a healthy person has become the result of what has become a pressure factor leading to intellectual inertia.
My son became disabled as a result of torture and imprisonment, which led to mental disability. He is still undergoing treatment, and it has been six years now.
I know that there are around four hundred people, including children and the disabled, present in the prison.
Is there a law in the United Nations?
In truth, I
Because they know, just as they know their own children.
And the whole meaning without them acting their age.
And there are values in the West.
Agreed upon by the people.
"Those who are apostates or do not follow the wisdom of Islam, their testimony is not taken from them."
"Many thanks, Naif Saeed from Kuwait."
We go back to our guest for comment.
In the calls, Suleiman wondered if there was any mental disability.
He is among the global rankings.
Regarding disabilities, of course, there is intellectual and developmental disability, which is also known as...
Are there sensory impairments among these disabilities, meaning visual or hearing impairments, as well as physical impairments?
Of course, as mentioned, disability is...
The action and reaction that occur in a social context.
In the Arab world or any other regions
Surely, dealing with the disability took a long time.
Even at the United Nations level
For example, during my experience and work as a special rapporteur, one of the things I tried to address and work on was...
In other words, it's everyone's right.
The linen they provide them with.
In various vocational aspects to ensure they enter schools also organized labor.
I work in vocational rehabilitation that includes people with disabilities.
There were some improvements.
Especially after the reform
Generally, they are found in this international committee.
I mean, as a special rapporteur
It's the nature of my job, and that has been positive for me, even if it's not directly related.
Who supported this position?
I've seen him in many meetings, for example, the international conference.
Disability rights
Disabled by these restrictions or these shortcomings
For example, with regard to legal capacity.
This is one of the key points in the world of disability.
The United Nations, unfortunately, was a bit delayed in preparation and formulation.
Regarding organizations and agencies
For example, and I conclude with this.
From the governments of the world and non-governmental organizations to the member states of the United States
We received another questionnaire and answered it.
In United Nations organizations and agencies in various regions
To find out how far programs for people with disabilities are on their agenda.
If you set budgets, then there is participation for people with disabilities.
Human rights
And not just development issues
We're taking more calls. With us now is Naji Machri from Algeria. Hello, Naji.
And you, after
I wanted to ask my sister who is exactly to blame.
I want to ask, I'm actually a person with special needs.
Okay, we'll forward this question to her. Naji Machri from Algeria. Thank you very much, Ahmed.
Hello, I'm Al-Halabi from Greece.
Good evening, madam. Good evening to your guest.
Healthcare Housing Seasonal clothing Even taking them on seasonal tourism And this is what happens in Europe
Is a mental patient considered a person with special needs?
Especially those who might harm themselves or harm others.
All we're talking about falls within the realm of unproductive discussion, thank you.
Sister Hessa mentioned the financial deficit.
In poor countries, especially in Africa and Latin America, I demand.
Establishing an international fund to support disability and allocating one percent of the net profits of every institution in the world.
This must be mandatory and without exception for any institution or company.
It will compensate for the inability of many people with special needs, war victims, and others.
Many thanks, Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
Naji Mashri was wondering and explained his problem that he is a person with special needs.
At the local or national level, meaning through Algeria.
The needs of the community must be met within the community itself.
Are these the same rights that should come to anyone else?
In English, it translates to: "The right to live is the first thing, then the right to housing, health, and education."
That's why I'm really calling from here, from this platform, governments, especially Arab governments.
In the interest of the citizen and the individual.
So that he ensures
These needs and rights are on the agendas.
No, there's no need to create any new devices.
To meet the needs of people with disabilities or not, this is a question for the state.
They are capable, and they should be committed to implementing it.
Advise him first to return and refer to the competent authorities at the government level, if possible.
Because it is on a national scale and it has to be within this scope.
You mentioned the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, but many countries have signed it without being committed to it.
And here we have a question from a caller: Why aren't there any laws?
It's a certainty that in our human society there are many mistakes and a lot of what's right.
Certainly, many agreements and treaties do not contain a literal commitment.
Or an ideal commitment from many countries that have joined many conventions such as CEDAW and others.
But there are violations and abuses, and we know it.
But the question of adopting an agreement and organizing it
First, I make sure there is at least consciousness.
This awareness starts at the top of this pyramid with the decision-makers.
Officials, and then gradually grow until they reach the entire society.
Also the issue of our commitment to prepare reports and deliver them to the United Nations.
The subject of knowledge, understanding, and a high degree of awareness.
According to reports, you worked as a rapporteur at the United Nations.
From what I've seen and observed, there is interest.
It means there is a preferential advantage to the agreement on the rights of persons with disabilities.
So I advise, encourage, and invite.
It's also important for people with disabilities to be...
And we will listen to what Ali Obeid Al-Sanari, President of the Qatari Society for the Rehabilitation of the Deaf and Mute, will tell us.
Mr. Naji, our hawk, is talking about him. Hello, Mr. Naji, and Mr. Ali as well.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
With me, Mr. Ali Obeid Al-Sanara, Chairman of the Board of Directors at the Qatari Cultural and Social Center for the Deaf
and chaired by H.E. Sheikhessa Hessa
The Special Rapporteur for Persons with Disabilities of the United Nations briefly
As a deaf person from Qatar
And as for the right of the President, in fact, Sheikhah Hessa has a long history.
And the international agreement you are talking about now is actually
Great benefit for all people with special needs everywhere in the world.
And especially the Arab world.
And I wish for deafness.
That these countries implement this international agreement.
This serves the needs of people with disabilities, it is essential.
It is indeed important to have someone who can activate this agreement in all countries.
Obaid Al-Senari is the president of the Qatar Association for the Deaf and Mute.
Let's stop.
Here we continue our talk after a short break. Stay with us.
Share your opinions on important issues in economics, politics, sports, and a variety of other topics.
Al Jazeera Mubasher Text Messaging Service
Welcome back, dear viewers, and a warm welcome to our guest today, Sheikhah Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani.
International Fund for Support of People with Disabilities
People with special needs, and it is mandatory for all countries to provide funding. What do you think of this proposal?
The United Nations has a fund called the Disability Fund.
Unfortunately, these contributions are very weak.
Regulatory Compliance Monitoring Mission
In the six years I worked there, there was no moral support.
Only from China and Austria
And that's always, I thank this country for its support.
The main supporter of the state is my country, Qatar.
The office that I established, through which we were able to implement many activities and projects, praise be to God.
Yes, this lack of support indicates what.
I mean, as we mentioned at the beginning, this point is always raised.
Circumstances of ordinary people
So, how is the care of people with disabilities or the care of the disabled called?
"That means if there was a real, genuine, and serious commitment."
In all circumstances, in all categories
Children with special needs, refugees, displaced children, and adolescents.
All of this is actually possible to some extent.
Equality of opportunity, participation, and equity
And there are these voices that are always demanding, and never get tired or complain.
In the Islamic and Arab region, why don't you allocate a part of Al-Samuha?
To benefit from these programs and projects.
As presented and repeated...
Qatar Islamic Bank
Within the budget that was allocated.
Failure to comply with the financial payment instructions I provided.
Funds to assist people with disabilities - do they only include developing countries and Arab states or what?
Even developed countries don't provide.
What does the person who was before me, the Swede, mean?
Also some EU countries
There are certainly many countries, especially in the Arab region, and perhaps they
So they know about the existence of this special course.
In my case, I mean what happened.
In Sweden and China
The Arab region, unfortunately, had many promises, but alas, only one country delivered.
But we're only talking about the Arab region.
We have more communications with Hamad Al-Marri from Qatar. Hamad, welcome.
Peace be upon you
And you, after
Welcome, Dr. Sheikhah Hessa
It's almost ten.
We noticed that this girl had a psychological disability.
What is your role for a girl who suffers like her?
With her colleagues
Sometimes, even if we preserve
What is your role in supporting Qatari women?
Many thanks to Hamad Al-Marri from Qatar and Kawan Behjat from Kuwait. Welcome!
As they say, Sheikhah Hessa.
Why don't we keep our oil in its crude form?
People with special needs, we can count them.
We can help them.
We have massive financial components.
We can break the psychological barrier between us and them.
Reviving individual morale.
And spend it on this noble cause.
This is if we truly believe.
Gratitude and appreciation to Sheikhah Hessa for all her efforts and everything she has done during her term as a Special Rapporteur.
With gratitude and appreciation to her and thanks to the State of Qatar for all it has done for people with special needs.
Many thanks, Aisha Mohammed from Qatar.
Peace be upon you, Professor Wasila.
Peace be upon you too.
And for your esteemed guest
H.H. Sheikh Hassa
My question is about prevention.
As they say, prevention is better than cure.
There's another level of disability, apart from wars and traffic accidents.
The genetic level can be a result of inbreeding within families.
I think it's a large percentage.
What leads to disability.
Thank you very much. Sharif from Tunisia has now taken over the flag. Let's go back to our guest.
The first caller was Hamad Al-Marri, and he was wondering.
Where does a girl with a mental disability go?
Where is he going?
In every country
Surely there are services that provide all types of disabilities in the State of Qatar.
For these disabilities, whether they are intellectual disabilities as we mentioned or any psychological disabilities
For schools
Before, there was
Or does special education in the Ministry of Education, which is now the Supreme Council, not mean anything?
The standard-bearer Sharif from Tunisia pointed to something of utmost importance.
and scientific papers, etc.
I work for organizations that focus solely on disability, but even within broader campaigns.
Programs for women
All this has attracted many campaigns and programs for reproductive health.
I talked about this aspect.
It is adopting healthy strategies.
Based on consciousness
To show the danger of marrying cousins.
and genetic factors
I think it was implemented in the State of Qatar.
Habits and traditions, but they need time for sure.
Especially in tribal societies
But over time, there will be a response to it, but it is essential to have a legal obligation, in other words,
A crow named Behjat asked and suggested allocating one percent of the budget of Arab countries.
To help those with disabilities, let me start by...
Yes, in an statistical estimate done by the World Health Organization for the world as a whole
In forty or nearly forty million disabled people.
Their group is made up of women.
But these numbers are multiplying.
Like a study in South Africa saw and proved.
Surely the statistics that emerged from the war in Iraq and the war in Gaza.
For every person killed, three disabled people come.
And because the Arab region has become an indisputable conflict zone.
Even the suggestion made by Kronan Behgat
One percent is not enough.
To help people with disabilities in the Arab region.
The issue of kinship regarding the rights of people with disabilities or any other marginalized groups.
Frankly and honestly, I don't think it suits.
Those who require their problems and needs to be addressed.
They emphasized that people with disabilities are the most forgotten.
What governments do does not account for the general needs of the disabled.
True, and this is linked to the culture of society and group constraints at times.
Why is the census being conducted by...
Stakeholders
There is a disabled person in the house.
There was only one question to be asked: Is there a disabled person or not?
A department dedicated to this subject and through the concerned individuals there.
We collaborated on creating a form.
Recommended to include more details.
First, specify the gender of the disabled person, whether male or female.
Did he get help or not?
Even if the numbers are correct, we haven't reached an accurate conclusion.
Care and attention should also be given to the progress of Fatima Al-Dosari, who is with us from Qatar. We welcome Fatima.
Peace be upon you too.
I am a Qatari citizen and I have a child with special needs.
And I thank His Highness the Amir of our country, Sheikh Hamad.
And his wife, Sheikh Moza, for adopting this category.
I am very proud to receive all this attention and care.
For her significant role
Hello minimalist minimalist minimalist
Because they represent major disturbances in society without education, without treatment.
"Thank you very much, Layth Al-Muzafari from Qatar, for joining us now."
Abdulkarim is from Jordan. Hello and welcome, Naseem.
Karim, we can hear you.
Peace be upon you too.
May God reward you. I actually have an intervention.
First of all, I am a sound specialist and I have experience working in the State of Qatar for almost four years.
We had a month of awareness for speaking and listening to the problem.
We held conferences, lectures, and awareness campaigns for hearing impairments.
Now I want to talk about Jordan. I lived there for almost three years.
Frankly, it provides new and good services.
Frankly, it offers new services, whether material, non-material, or moral.
Even the Jordanian Ministry of Education, resources
Ministry of Education in public schools
And our private institutions as well.
They receive good support.
Alright, you have a direct question, but due to time constraints, I apologize.
Do you have a direct question?
In Qatar, the UAE, and Jordan, their services are excellent and wonderful.
Can you comment on viewers' questions?
Anyone working in this field?
Regarding the subject
I'll come back later to the topic of the agreement.
What is required once they ratify and accede to it.
As a duty of the state or these organizations
Because they are based on the issue of the rights of these people regardless of
"And frankly, what?"
What do they do during the disabled period and why?
And you wish now that it would happen.
Of course, I wish so.
I hope that this is measured in this research or this survey and that higher-quality research is presented in this field.
It's clear to me from this experience.
Six years of experience
And coordination among Arab countries as well.
They also have a role; it's not just about rights, they receive rights as well.
Sheikhessa Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani, former UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, thank you.
We now have the introduction from Al Darwisch and Al Kass TV, we have on the line, good morning to us.
I, too, am delighted to welcome the brilliant captain in Umm Salal, Captain Ali Qasim.
Welcome, Ali!
Hello %pw
Good morning
I want to open the floor for congratulations. Everyone congratulate frankly, Lana please.
I had a five-hour studio session and a two-hour session the day before.
I congratulate Qatar - land, government, and citizens - they deserve this international achievement.
I might get the chance to congratulate Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.
His Highness the Amir of the Country, Sheikh Tamim
Yes, of course, Lana. You are from the mathematical field and are an expert in this area, very knowledgeable about these lines and this domain.
Because even our file
And competitors, that means we deserve the six-vote difference between us and the United States, 14 votes for Qatar and 8 votes for the United States.
This was because our file was rich, comprehensive, and supported by many ambassadors. It was very well-supported, for example, by the stadtholders.
Maybe some people were afraid, maybe there was a little %pw, like in America.
And some countries that are ready do not need to provide stadiums and prepare some projects, especially as this event
Because they're already ready.
They were also afraid of this point.
Captain Ali, as athletes, I think this is a very significant achievement for sports people.
It will impact the economic, political, and health sectors, I expect.
But you, as athletes
What does this achievement mean to you?
Of course, this is a great achievement, especially for us. Even you saw how the non-athletic people were so happy.
Inshallah, I'll let you know when the winner is announced.
I was leaving the training and we were listening to the radio.
I was waiting for the announcement with one of my friends.
As you drive the car and listen to the radio
The moment they announced that Qatar and...
We both screamed, and of course the roof window was open.
So his body flew off the roof of the car.
We were shouting, everyone was looking at us, we turned on the flashers, and we started our own celebration.
We started the celebration from the beginning.
Alhamdulillah, it was a very special day. I suppose all the channels focused on that event to a large extent.
Lana, of course, you participated in this event.
Especially the sports channels.
How did they celebrate this event and what was their reaction?
Many media outlets and channels from around the world were present.
He became a main teacher, very clear on the map, Qatar became famous.
Sure, Ali, the presence of the player in the team is very important.
And I suppose it's a responsibility that should be taken seriously.
What's your opinion on this particular point?
Do they also mention the required specifications to be in the league?
Now there are more sports events coming up.
We need to prepare a strong generation.
Those who have fundamental principles and well-studied plans for football strategies.
Okay, what are the laws and principles that a player should excel in?
I believe professionalism encompasses everything from
Rigorous and continuous training and discipline
All these are basic matters that help him focus all his efforts on playing or on training.
I think each stage has a unique advantage.
It has distinct feelings and taste.
Talk shows and sports programs, which do you prefer, where do you find yourself?
Great
Staying active helps you maintain your body and fitness, and teaches you how to keep healthy through exercise, which is the important part.
Also, everyone watches football matches, you will automatically love them when you enter the stadium.
Do you confine people working in the media to one side?
What confines you to one part?
It's an open field, not just football.
Everything is sport, but sport is great.
Ali, there are still some important topics we want to discuss.
I wish I could go back ten years to reach 2022.
Yes, didn't you wish for this?
Of course, anyone now dreams of this, especially as the World Cup is now any player's dream.
Just watching a World Cup match makes anyone happy, let alone playing in it.
I hope she meets expectations and that it's their chance.
"As a professional player, Captain Ali, what do you want to say to them from the bottom of your heart?"
We love having you with us.
As you said, I'm currently on vacation, though.
Her return to the rounds after twelve years of absence from the Gulf Cup championship.
You have a beautiful note from Qatar TV and beautiful memories.
Inshallah, Qatar TV will become like the university from which a large group of media professionals graduate.
Our Dorina is brave, and God willing, she will win many and varied cups.
Let's talk about an important point regarding Umm Salal Club.
How are you there? How are you? I hope you are well.
Sure, Alhamdulillah, frankly.
Of course, yesterday, in the studio, we talked about many players.
For I think that some of the young men who were watching us believe that you
Required
It's quite common in the Qatari league for players to move to other clubs.
I think I had a great opportunity in Umm Salal, *as an offer*.
I was able to take a place in the Asian Cup with the team, praise be to God.
I was in a good position with the team.
How can we make sports a social topic?
And beyond Qatar, how can we make women, children, and youth interested in sports?
He links everything. Everything is complementary to sports.
Women play a role in all sporting fields.
And expansion, every individual, whether young or adult in this society, is aware of the importance of sport.
"About eleven or twelve years, until we reach this event, that's enough."
We have newer generations.
The generation is growing up, but we need to raise a conscious, sporty generation from a young age.
We get Aspire, Aspire is an active building.
Essential for the new generation of sports.
We just need to be decisive and move forward.
And football in particular.
How can we engage the audience to interact in all the different club matches?
Frankly, the lack of attendance by the public is something we suffer from in the Qatari league.
But the problem is attendance; the Qatar Football Association hasn't yet found a way to attract the audience.
What's the best way to get them to attend those football matches?
It depends on the person themselves; some people don't like to attend the studio.
By the way, materialism plays a crucial role in the public's abstinence.
And now they use a ticket or loyalty points here.
No, the English Federation has a plan and many steps to attract the audience.
Some clubs have ways to attract the audience, like Al-Rayyan. Al-Rayyan is a famous club and doesn't need to attract the audience.
Some clubs %pw, some administrative clubs organize some activities and events.
For the public, to motivate them, I think these are the only ways.
I mean the new generation of players.
They love what they do and believe in their abilities. As I said, they don't just need financial support, they also need moral support, perhaps even more so.
Many thanks for this wonderful meeting. God bless us all.
Okay, we'd like to hear your final thoughts on Qatar's win to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Please.
I would like to reiterate that Qatar is always supportive, and
God willing, Captain Ali, your final words that you would like to say in this interview?
Congratulations and may God grant you success, from one success to an even greater one.
Thank you, Captain, and player Aliym. I wish you success in your sporting progress and life. God bless you.
I love sports even more.
The episode will be about young talents.
Some young people say that these songs are famous now, but they have a very old and great history.
Young people are singing Arabic or English words.
Today we're going to talk about this with a group of rap enthusiasts.
We'll get to know them better through the interview that will bring us together live.
Welcome, dear viewers, wherever you are, to our program.
For years, a new style of singing has dominated the Arab and Gulf scenes.
Yay, I'm from the West, especially America, which is rap.
Before we start talking about wealth and rap.
There's a boldness in using any word without any reservation.
Anyone can rap.
For writing words,
Most winners write their own lyrics.
Therefore, we will get all these many and important details from two people who are deeply involved in this field.
They make a cute couple.
Yousef Al-Naemi and Salman Abdullah, good morning, Yousef.
Welcome to join us, good morning Salman.
Good morning, hello.
I am very happy to have you with us through this program.
And of course, through the topic of rap singing.
Yusuf, how did you get into this?
We discovered that rap didn't exist in Qatar.
In a better way.
Speaking on behalf of the citizen.
Including joy, sadness, and political topics
I mean, I can say that rap,
And this talk, I think it's from the artist who paints a picture and the poet who writes a poem.
The singer can sing and the musician can play any instrument.
Do you think there is acceptance from Qatari society, from Gulf society, for this type of language?
Two thousand and ten.
Do people like buying rap music CDs?
Different ages
There are many families and people who listen more than before.
There was something like a site.
How many of you are still in this group?
So you can all say words, write poetry, perform rap.
You can say the one who sings, the rapper,
He who plays sometimes writes the words.
Ah, okay!
I ask him to listen and tell him I recorded this song.
Okay, all these songs that you produced, Salman, from Youssef, from, from anyone in the same band.
I didn't think it would be on CD and available in stores.
But you know, if someone is alone, it means I'll have to make the album and release it to the market, which is difficult with all the commercial registration and procedures.
Okay, why didn't you think about it? You're 25 years old, and you can't always clap with one hand.
Supposedly two, but if God wills, you have twenty-five. God protect you, all of you young men and brothers.
You can make a CD, and you can sell this CD through more than one website on the internet.
You have Facebook, YouTube, and local newspapers.
I think there are thirty-six songs.
Registration isn't like it is now.
A bit old, but it was clear.
It's low quality, not like now, but it's clear.
Burned almost fifty CDs.
In rap, I can't say it wasn't, because it's possible that there were young people who knew this art ten years ago.
It's not as strong as the registration and I think the distribution during this period, now it's different.
Especially since there's a variety of music, a wide range of techno music genres now.
These young people and these artists release a collection of wonderful songs.
And then we'd like to talk about the parties you attended.
See, the party we participated in Doha is one.
It was organized by Al Sadd Club, and they were very cooperative.
We'll see the audience later.
We were surprised by this large number, it was unexpected.
We were also surprised that more than a few families were attending.
More than the youth
The organization was strange.
We were a bit nervous because it was the first time in Doha.
We didn't expect this much attendance.
The audience interaction was amazing.
And since it was long, there were many songs.
Alright, let's hear something, or words you've composed, that the audience, especially the youth, love.
Let's hear a few words so we can introduce the audience.
Can we listen to it live?
Take your time.
Prefer Salem
The problem is that it's random.
Let's listen.
I don't know.
We are here in the Doha Morning Program
One enjoys coming to the morning program.
Salman is an artist. This is his fifth year doing rap.
Even if people didn't love him
They have no idea about it.
The words are random.
Okay, for the songs you performed, give me some of your previous lyrics.
See, not all songs are random, or what they call in English "freestyle".
They are in sync.
But when we sing, we choose some words carefully.
Good health to you, let's see.
We can say "Good morning, my country, good morning, Doha program."
We're live on television for the viewers.
So we can see what they will show, one by one, two, one.
Except for Doha's morning.
The sweet song you just heard
I insisted that the youth distribute it everywhere and online.
It's destined by God. When are you planning to release it?
Teamwork
Everyone composes for themselves.
He won't get it easily.
Everyone writes.
Sure, I suppose every artist, whether a musician or a poet, always...
He might also write it out of his love for sports.
Or love of the homeland
And I'm sure you participated in the National Day.
Through beautiful songs, you represent the youth of Qatar.
Doha is sparkling in anticipation of the Asian Cup, and there will be a celebration on the Corniche.
To celebrate that event
We're broadcasting these scenes live.
From the reception of the Asian Cup in Doha
From Doha Airport until now
Let's watch this live footage together.
Reception, audience, our children, our students
The Asian Cup arrived at Doha airport this morning to continue.
Preparations to host the massive continental event
Let's go back to our guests Youssef and Salman, whom we are happy to have with us.
They are an Arab Gulf rap group, right?
Can we say it this way?
Currently, to be honest, we...
We're preparing for a party, but it's not final.
But you're working on a party that Youssef will announce, God willing.
Insha'Allah, but it's not certain yet, we're still beginners.
You are still at the beginning of your career path, and I wish you all the best. Be assured that our program will support you with all our hearts.
And after Salman, where are all of you twenty-five people going to meet?
Where do you meet, and how do you gather all the ideas?
Surely there are shared songs.
It doesn't have to be someone like Salman or Youssef or any of you singing a whole song.
There must be cooperation among all of you.
Frankly, it's difficult for the twenty-five to gather in one place.
I started calling Youssef and the other guys and asked them to gather in one place.
So you can see the song and the lyrics.
And there's a second method.
I register my spot.
And continued
So register and send it to me again.
And see other experiences
Why are some CDs by famous artists?
You benefit from their experiences and techniques.
Sure, we always do.
Artists who have been doing this for years and have experience in the field.
We listen to them, learn techniques, and try to create a unique style.
Because if we did the same thing, with the same tone and the same words,
We're not producing anything new; we want to do something that is...
So we can benefit from them a little.
Is there any big Gulf youth group in the Gulf?
In a primitive way, let's watch the report together so we can benefit and enjoy it. Let's watch it together.
The talents some people have are mysterious.
Using very primitive tools.
Abu Ibrahim Abdullah al-Dail
This is one hundred and fifty kilometers.
I am from the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
He has experience and good skills.
Identifying shallow groundwater sites
Deeper than one hundred meters
You know that drilling wells is very expensive.
Determining the appropriate location to dig the well, but with the expert one can estimate.
Discover, from location.
Groundwater sites
Since ancient times
Our fathers and grandfathers
They consulted experts to locate the wells.
to drill:
Abu Ibrahim's methods for finding groundwater
What are modern techniques?
Or soil analysis in laboratories
He relies on God's grace in his work.
They are underground sewers.
Either pomegranate seeds.
Pomegranate branches or fig branches
And now the process of discovering water sources is being carried out scientifically.
To conclude, this is the end of the broadcast.
Come back again.
Go back
So, from here, we start putting a mark.
And that's the end of the broadcast.
Requires experience, patience, and effort.
To determine the sensitivity of the too's movement.
I've been to many places.
Ninety-five percent of success.
Of course, this method and the use of copper rods.
And there is no precise scientific explanation for
This method
What really surprises me is the success rate of those who practice this primitive profession.
Over ninety-five percent
In the search for shallow groundwater reservoirs
Praise be to Allah, the Generous, the Giver, for such happiness from Saudi Arabia.
Who has their own band and more than one CD?
Whether online or on the phone
Sometimes there are competitions between Gulf countries, such as Qatar vs. Bahrain and Qatar vs. Kuwait.
They produce a stronger song with a stronger theme.
In many issues, such as addressing a problem and others.
I see him as a role model.
"Masha'Allah" (Arabic:
And at the same time, we want
Played a wide range of songs
As much as possible
Let's keep in touch from time to time.
To keep up with the band's latest news
Just let's focus on the band's name.
They are robbers.
Let's go back to our guests at the corniche and the beautiful weather.
We are live with you through this direct link.
Wherever you are on the corniche, you receive the Asian Cup.
We are proud of them and their wonderful arts.
Deals with various social and psychological issues of youth.
He only has two with him in the studio.
I'm sure they represent the rest.
Yusuf and Salman, may God bless you again.
Sometimes the subscription runs out.
We tried to reach the company, but no one answered.
As a team, you need to develop yourself. People in it.
Facebook and YouTube
and other similar sites
Band name
"We get from the first search results."
Organize and work together on this big project.
Do you edit and combine photos with songs? Are these personal photos?
Just upload it to YouTube and video-sharing platforms where people can watch it.
A little, we've done it before.
There are a lot of songs.
The obstacles you face, for example, not having a company to adopt you, not having a website.
We really need a place where you can all gather as a team.
What are your wishes that you want to fulfill and achieve?
Who will vouch for him?
And arrange an album for us.
I wish it could be official.
Because we've been together for five years.
Just a coffee lover.
We participated in some things in some series.
We hope for development.
And we will have someone to support us and be with us.
So, Salman, we also want to know what your wishes are.
My only wish is to make a clip.
We wish you success.
We hope all your songs become famous in the Middle East.
This is a very beautiful and popular art.
And we'll send a message just like you said.
Good luck, I wish you all success.
Greetings to the group, and we wish you success.
And to conclude, we'll end with the song they produced especially for the show.
This is a KDE-DJGMR Doha program.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This lady Bobo with SKT is one hot body.
We can say "Good morning, my country, good morning, Doha program."
We're live on television for the viewers.
Don't forget the show starts at 9:30. Everyone must watch.
So we can see what they will show, one by one, two, one.
Except for Doha's morning.
Production: Hasan Naama, Presentation: Shaima Al-Hamadi
Director Nasser Al-Maliki, and guests Rappers Qatar, of course.
It can be done again and used at home.
Like a cart or a shopping basket
While shopping at the supermarket
When you put any item or anything you want to buy in
A large screen appears showing the components of this product.
This is also a great and feasible idea.
Just a barcode, a scanner in the cart that scans the item.
And make shopping easy for the buyer.
It can capture all the details on the screen.
I suppose it raises health awareness.
If the device is with you or in the trolley.
Ingredients
Any warnings, side effects
Full details
He is ambitious; he has several projects, around four or five.
Dealing with traffic issues
He deals with traffic congestion and other issues like parking problems. He is creative and very nice.
Insha'Allah, the Children's Cultural Center
Professor Abdullah, let's talk about the various activities that will take place in the coming days.
Yes, there are more surprises, but I'll discuss them briefly.
Ideas, I don't know if I should mention some of the projects that were proposed or
For example, regarding underground transportation, the brilliant idea is
One sees an elevator as soon as they leave their house.
And they gather at one point.
I assume that all the viewers are enjoying the images displayed now.
Children's Creations
Exactly, it's just like an ATM.
For women, for example, I have a card.
I put them on and say I want a T-shirt.
For example, some shops, or if you lose things at home, like a key.
Lost, for example, the office key.
We have a fundamental goal set by Her Highness Sheikh Moza.
His Highness' Consort
At an early age, this has great significance in project design.
Three hundred selected children
And then we invited speakers and orators.
Who hosted the closing ceremony?
To present their programs, we really need to open the doors to interested children.
And then they can start.
We need them to be there and support us, that's our top priority.
These programs and activities serve the main idea.
Diverse and varied skills for children
Self-development
Okay, do you have any collaborations with youth clubs in Qatar?
There are also science clubs in Qatar.
Of course, all our programs are based on the exchange of ideas.
Everything is a professional partnership.
With other community service institutions specialized in enhancing such talents
Involvement of all concerned institutions
Photography Society
The Boys' Innovation Center and the Secretariat of the Council of Ministers also played a very big role.
Yes, they played a crucial role in explaining Qatar's vision.
And training children on it.
Engaging and encouraging children, with each program based on institutional partnerships.
According to my role as a chief in projects and institutions.
What changes?
Being here in Katara gives us a strong boost and support.
And faster.
We are currently, in partnership with Katara, preparing some projects that will be ready for launch in the next two months.
Of course, there is cooperation in many programs.
Especially what relates to reading.
Chairman of the Supreme Council for Family Affairs
And we're working on it, especially since we're in the preparation stage.
To build a promising future for all children, the future generation and youth
What's the last word you'd like to say to the parents and children watching us now and wanting to join the center?
More than we're offering them now.
Sometimes our children come up with ideas that we shouldn't dismiss.
We need to consider their ideas, no matter what.
Because when we take it seriously, it will develop, at least we will encourage the child to think.
It's important that we provide care and attention to the child.
And spiritually, after our problem, most fathers
Support him.
He is motivated, so we, the parents, encourage him.
By paying more attention to a child's imagination today, our children are the roots of the future.
We took a tour of the exhibition and saw their projects.
We lived the dream.
Dreams and thoughts were the product of a vivid imagination.
And the dream becomes a reality. Many of them have come true and become a reality.
Praise be to God, we wish our children who were there all the best.
Our hearts are with you.
"Masha'Allah" (Arabic:
From various ages and nationalities
Up to seventy projects
He is very innovative and worthy of implementation.
Let's talk more about this national exhibition.
And the Children's Cultural Center as well.
Mr. Abdullah briefly told us about the exhibition.
A lot of events have happened, for sure. What could you say about them?
The kids introduced a new style in expressing their love for their homeland and loyalty to their country.
He was under the auspices of the Minister of Education.
On the tour of the exhibition
"Bakbar Lane 2030"
We started training children to see Qatar 2030 across all three axes.
Human development, economic development, sustainable development, environmental development
First, to know Qatar's position in 2030.
Then, so we can start thinking about
Creative ideas, and how to be innovative.
I assume they have a broad mind.
But why are we helping him?
I suppose their minds will grow more and more.
Oh, sir, you entered the exhibition under the slogan "Dreams of a Generation: Realities or the Nation of Tomorrow."
The slogan says "Dreams of a Generation"
It will be part of Qatar's future, Qatar's tomorrow.
We felt it when we were playing with the children when the child said to the minister.
I want you to open my project. I invite you to visit my project for twenty to thirty minutes.
He thinks twenty years ahead.
They express their love for their country in the field they are interested in.
There need to be events, activities, and competitions.
One of them won the Stars of Science award.
And there were also the winners of the first prize at the Arab League University.
Sure, all the kids.
On the sidelines, there were various performances on a specific schedule.
To showcase the projects they've done.
In a large presence, a very distinctive presence.
Stars of Science
Some of the winners from the projects that participated in the exhibition.
Who won one of the major prizes?
The innovative or creative forest or reserve.
We also want to talk about the colored ball.
The colorful ball is still a child's dream and Qatar's future vision.
This is an idea for twenty to thirty people.
How can a child contribute with a creative idea for twenty or thirty?
The main idea is that there is a slice in the ball.
The referee gives a colored warning.
For example, the referee can see the ball's movement.
The field changes via this electronic chip.
The one who rides the ball.
There are creative ideas, of course. The main idea is that some people might ask.
And projects
We always say we've reached this stage.
To develop their skills and broaden their horizons
It gives them an idea of how to express nationalism through these projects.
It gives them confidence in how to present the project, interact with the audience, and explain their idea.
In a field he loves, being engaged in something he enjoys, that's an achievement.
He showed his support, and we thank him for that.
Which is currently in the development stage
The audience, the committee, and some officials also supported the projects.
"The force was not second because this girl..." (Note: The sentence is incomplete in Arabic and thus the English translation is also incomplete. The meaning can vary depending on the context.)
Pipes, channels for the audience to attend underground, and the way viewers enter need arrangements.
Very large reserve forests
A place where visitors can wander and see animals and reptiles.
And there is also a sensor device attached to some animals to examine their condition.
And there is also the marine environment and the way of entering, which is also innovative.
One of the reasons it won was its vast and detailed imagination.
All this qualifies them for victory.
Someone also talked about an underwater tourism city.
Butterfly City
A forest on Earth.
And many ideas of tourism.
Very interesting
Perhaps this is what their minds need, at this time, perhaps in twenty or thirty years.
In the future, it will be achieved.
Three projects.
Adopted by the Scientific Club, they said these are the projects we need to work on.
In his project, the water from the air conditioners that we don't need is collected.
Let's see the Arab newspaper.
The news says, Qatar University celebrates graduation.
The presence of His Excellency Mr. Saad bin Ibrahim Al-Mahmoud.
Minister of Education and Higher Education, Secretary General of the Supreme Education Council
And Dr. Shaikha bint Abdullah Al-Missnad, President
A new record for the university indeed.
Qatar University and Calgary University
There's more good news about our students.
This is an educational achievement, and we wish them success in all fields, God willing.
He is considered one of the young actors who are rising in the Qatari dramatic scene.
How much longer after sorting and colored threads
Artist Abdelhamid Shawesh is considered one of the self-taught artists.
If it wasn't convincing,
They won't choose him to be involved in the projects happening within Qatar.
Currently, actor Abdulhamid Charshani is participating in the series "Killer Feeling" and "Classification Part 2".
We're pleased to have him as our guest this morning.
So we can talk to him about his involvement in these two things and about his experience in general.
Welcome and good morning.
We are delighted to have you with us on the Doha Morning program. This is the first time I'm meeting you, and this is your first time being on Doha Morning.
With the people who work a lot for the program
And you, Professor Lisa.
Welcome, everyone. Before we start chatting, let's
Come on, let's see.
I am a responsible and executive real.
And I enforce the laws.
The only thing I can tell you is,
Give me the bisht.
Listen, why are you asking me?
Go and ask them if anyone agrees that you don't have to return the bisht.
From me. I definitely have another question as an opener, but because we've seen this part of the first part of the series.
He pointed out that Khalid ibn al-Walid...
Some historians link the famous poet Imru' al-Qais with the city of Marar.
There's a lot of information and details related to that city in Saudi Arabia.
For more information, we'll follow up with you on this excellent report by our colleague Abdulrahman Al-Marshed.
Let's see it together.
So it's definitely a testimony from people who know, without any favoritism or bias.
As an affirmation of the history of this city or that.
As far as we see of her relics, and hear of her from her storytellers and poets
Classical and modern, thus this comes as an important record added to the city's record.
The city of Marrat is one of the cities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Historically, it is an ancient town founded in the pre-Islamic era.
There was a debate among historians about how it was named.
Some believed he was named after the famous poet Imru' al-Qais al-Kindi.
And the river that is named after her.
Its founding date is unknown.
In the time of ignorance.
The most famous thing in the city of Marar is Mount Kmit, which has been the subject of many proverbs.
Because it's in the city and close by.
Al Jeff. These are historical places.
This view is considered a tourist attraction in Saudi Arabia.
The staff members made a great effort in ...
A garden on this mountain
And councils for the citizens and all in the kingdom to sit and discuss.
It was named after the Prophet's companion Khalid ibn al-Walid, may God be pleased with him.
To fight the apostates and Musaylimah the liar.
One of its effects is Comet Brook.
It's a place where water from springs gathers and is stored for a long time.
It was one of the most important water sources in the past.
One of her works is also the Al-Dhawai House of Heritage.
The city dates back to pre-Islamic times.
It is renowned for its poets influenced by the Romantic movement.
With its beauty, its monuments, and its famous mountain, Mount Komit.
Abdulrahman Al-Marshed to Doha's Morning Program,
A mirror city north of Riyadh
And we return again to our dear guests.
I wish you could tell us and inform the viewers about these methods and ways.
Initially, I mentioned that our infrastructure is very distinctive.
We open a file for him and he registers with us, creating a personal file in our system.
Parent's email.
This report contains the extent of the increase in focus, typing speed, reading speed, and overall distraction.
The guardian receives a full report.
Okay, this report will be added to the student's file.
to register his son online.
And sees the progress of his son.
And he can see his grades and attention with the teachers.
So we can truly enjoy the intelligence of this beautiful girl.
So we can bring more children from the center and send them our greetings.
I registered at this center with a teacher there.
To assess her skills and the level she has reached since joining the center.
Of course, this year.
Focus on one task and after Ramadan.
But of course this is an effect that works at the expense of other works, always.
Some people only watch TV in Ramadan.
He stays up late watching TV, while people spend their worship months in front of the television.
Ease up, ease up, ease up on the TV series. Let them produce one work every two years. Is that better?
Of course.
I hope they love me in Ramadan.
I just wanted to send you all my best regards.
And God willing.
And after the plays.
From drama to fashion.
A fashion show was held at Katara Cultural Village.
Of course, we continue with you with great love and sincerity.
And develop the children's abilities and skills more.
In a manner different from the various schools in this generous country.
We have a model and our guest who was here a moment ago spoke to us.
And now with us is Mr. Ibrahim Hussein Abdulsalam. Welcome and good morning to you.
How are you, Amnia?
I'm fine.
Which grade are you in now?
Dr. Ibrahim, to start with, could you give us an idea about the course offered by the center?
"And security is an example of this."
And then we'll try the technique or method you mentioned, Miss Naseem.
Do you feel like there's a difference in his brain?
You feel these skills and methods.
The thing changes in terms of his mental skills or even his educational level changes.
Scientific methods
Including initially testing the child through an international test called the TONI test before starting anything in the program.
I'm starting part two after Tony's test.
We can measure the level or the change in the student's level through it.
Now there's going to be a test or something like that.
Wishful thinking and immediate response live.
Of course, Amnia doesn't know anything about the questions.
We surprised them with this thing.
Of course, I have another question to start with,
We'd like to ask about your participation in the second part this year.
What is your contribution that you can tell us about?
Of course, after we presented the classification series of the first part,
Alhamdulillah, I've been lucky with several roles.
Mr. Ghanem,
Distributing roles with the executive director Ashraf Shohata with Mr.
Tara's Opportunity for Artistic Production
For the youth.
Mr. Ghanem nominated me this year for
Of course, each episode is different.
I have acted in more than one episode where I will play different characters.
On the contrary, it's a wonderful experience. In this work, we have
The wind from the arms of the ocean brings rain.
We have actors from Bahrain, Abdullah Malik, Ali Al Ghareer.
Like Ali Mirza among us.
You also have a group of young actors like Abdullah Adham.
Yes, among our young actors, we have Abdullah Al-Osaim.
This happened a year ago, and last year we did two jobs a year.
This is probably why I asked you before we went on air. You've been acting strange since 1997.
But you couldn't do anything or achieve your ambition in acting.
Praise be to God in all circumstances.
Acting only, or what?
No, I consider it as a hobby.
I took acting as a talent. P.W. who supported me at the beginning was the actor Abdulaziz Jassim.
He is one of the actors who considers me his son.
If you need anything, I'll call him.
We were in all of his shows.
We tried our best, praise be to God.
Now without Tara, a very special thanks to Professor Andalrahman Al-Sulaiti, a very, very special thanks to Professor Abdulrahman.
If you compare us to Kuwait. In Kuwait, there are between twelve and sixteen new actors who come every year. Why?
They have it.
Of course, many thanks for this as it provides many opportunities.
But, let's say,
Let's talk about the second series, we had an idea about classification.
We need to know about the killer feeling.
And also the foot.
We have a sample with us, accompanied by the processor Mr. Abdulaziz Al-Maeeni Al-Tamimi.
For this procedure to be on air.
"We can see how we can deal with the person. Allow me first to greet Mr. Sobhi bin Hamza and say, 'Welcome!'"
May God bless you, and peace be upon you.
Alright, let's start with you, Your Highness. Please go ahead.
Inshallah.
In the name of God.
We hold hands.
We're watching the nerves.
It's like a drawing or a message from God Almighty, showing you all the organs in your body.
From the inside and its problems.
Sometimes you feel dizzy.
I have a headache and dizziness.
Unclench your hand, let it go. Let your nerves relax. Yes.
By doing this, Professor Abdulaziz, you will discover something specific from his hand that he suffers from a certain disease.
From the left side. His ears, he has a mild inflammation in his middle ear.
In pain! What does that mean, Professor Abdulaziz?
The ear, you have a problem in the ear.
Since the day I was born and since I was a baby.
Do you also have pain here?
These are the sinuses surrounding the nose!
Does it hurt in your nose and do you have a headache here?
I have a headache here.
He has a problem with his sinuses.
Gives him a headache between the eyes.
Weight is increasing without eating.
Your thyroid gland isn't working properly, you feel tired and lethargic all the time, and you feel like your body is heavy.
I sleep a lot.
Either you're oversleeping or you're always lazy, that's why you're so sluggish.
You always have inflammation in your tonsils.
In it, see the tremor, notice the tremor.
He's stressed, and you've probably never walked barefoot since the last time.
Are you from Tunisia?
Wow, you mentioned things about him.
Does massage still help babies?
The mother's thumb, glorified be God, is approximately the same size as the baby's palm.
Most babies don't sleep why?
When you pick him up, he doesn't like it, but people think he does. He has gas in his belly. God bless you.
And when the mother removes her thumb by extending her thumb.
In the palm of the baby's hand.
The hands are parallel and the child is parallel with them.
Let's see it so that every mother learns this move.
You start pressing like this. Right and left, and right and left.
This story is about children, about children, about children, about children, and it's sweet.
Okay, regarding discoveries, you have specific discoveries related to women.
As we said, in every house, there are ninety percent women, may God protect them.
First thing, first warning about ceramics and even floors.
It's fine to walk barefoot on ceramic, but walking barefoot on uneven ground is dangerous.
Walk barefoot! The proof is when ceramics are used in homes, health problems have increased.
Because it's cold and also.
When Sajad was young, there were problems, they suffered from asthma.
Increased.
The woman needs to focus on walking barefoot on the ankle bone.
This is the back of the foot and ankle area, the ankle.
From here, this heel and now under the wild heel.
This is the first discovery, the second discovery is a way to facilitate childbirth.
Just focus with me for a bit.
In the seventh or ninth month.
Generally, just being in the delivery month.
They don't come on the eighth, the eighth is dangerous, and the most dangerous thing is to walk barefoot.
Pregnant women need to be careful about walking barefoot.
If it is in plural,
"I seek refuge in Allah from Satan, the outcast: 'And shake towards you the trunk of the palm tree, it will drop on you fresh dates.'"
We know that Mary, peace be upon her, we know that her provision comes to her.
I even debated scholars and they told me, "Why are you changing the interpretation of Ibn Kathir?"
I told them, "I will give you the idea that God has placed in this knowledge and inspires me."
Shake the palm tree trunk towards you, when you shake the palm tree trunk, what does it look like?
Sharp like nails or thorns.
The day the palm tree bears fruit, it gives a command to the womb, which is the uterine region, here in the middle.
These are the organs that issue orders to facilitate childbirth and the re-seating of the fetus.
Elevating the fetus's head or changing the position so that it descends naturally.
Praise be to God, this is one of the benefits of this fruit.
He takes the hand and starts to loosen it.
Some take it as a practice, and some of them know it's a science.
That's why they're afraid to tell you, and you won't believe them.
Yes, Sheikh Abdulaziz, your discoveries are important.
I just want to ask you one last question because time has flown by.
If someone wants to get in touch with you, anyone who wants to get in touch with you, any specific email or you.
Okay, the mobile number is available in the control room. Anyone who wants to communicate with Mr. Abdulaziz can call us after the program.
Of course, from Qatar TV numbers so he can call us and take this number.
I was created only to serve people.
If we believe in this belief, God will bless your work and will lead people.
I have sins like anyone else and have done everything you can think of. I'm a normal human being.
But we aspire to more good.
We always think of beauty.
Dear viewers, we hope you enjoyed this segment on reflexology and hand massage.
And also by foot.
We saw a live model on air showing how to detect diseases in a person.
And what is he suffering from? I hope we can benefit from him, and if anyone wants to communicate with him, they can read about him online.
The way it is implemented, whether in the coming days or years, or if it includes more schools.
Good morning
How would you rate this experience?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
The truth is, obesity in Gulf countries has become a big problem.
So that's why we were afraid Qatar would be the fifth country with them.
This program, frankly, became the first lady of New York.
I visited Doha, and they have a program for this.
They offered it to us, we took it up and said okay.
Our students with students from New York, Spain, and England,
That's why we can observe the level of our students in Qatar compared to the world, and this is something we want in the future.
Because we encourage students to eat fruit.
And he quits sports.
Of course, the fifth week is family dinner with your parents.
We kill two birds with one stone (proverb).
In the sixth week, he tells us what he has gained from this experience. Thank God, we are at the conclusion today.
We are happy with the students.
You know they were three independent schools, for boys Abu Obeida,
Raquia Independent Girls' School
And with high spirits.
The family became more aware, and their brothers at home were enthusiastic and started eating this food like them.
A transitive culture has emerged among students, who then carry this culture back home to their families.
He goes and tells them, "They gave me this or taught me this."
The trainers or those who taught these sciences to the students,
How did you choose him and how did the communication with the student happen? Who communicated?
Yes, there were many parties that helped us, may God reward them well.
We have the brothers at the diet center who teach them about healthy eating, of course.
And learn with Lady Aisha Al-Tamimi the etiquette of eating.
How they arrange themselves, how they prioritize!
To learn about cooking, sports, or educating about the value of healthy eating.
It was in the form of separate lessons, a curriculum, or
How do these ideas reach the students?
In various ways, some within the school,
We organized a day at the beginning of the program in the Aspire zone, gathering all the male and female students.
These matters are not about a specific person, but we are all responsible, responsible because these are our children.
How should we deal with these students at first!
I initially said that the results were satisfactory.
Is three periods or a certain number of periods enough in those schools?
When you start an experiment in the world, you don't start on a large scale.
It starts within a reasonable range where all the specifications are; boys, girls, independent, private.
Since it's not suitable in our culture, environment, and family circumstances, as parents accept some things for their children and don't accept others.
They basically want to participate in it, and to be honest, it's very important.
A student who is twelve or thirteen years old, this is the right time for him to get to know his health.
This is a struggle for many people who want others to fail, but he imagines that this is impossible.
Some actors we see in movies have weak bodies; he says this is impossible, no.
We're very far apart, but there are many weeks we haven't caught up on.
And we can remind them of it through Doha's morning.
And the fruits that contain vitamin B that you can get from fruits and vegetables.
A person needs to know the benefits of fruits and understand that by eating them, their health improves, and they will be at the peak of their同時同
As for fruits, they went to the supermarket and chose the fruits they wanted.
So this is a point.
It is diverse and naturally competitive; each school excelled with its teachers' unique ideas.
Spirit of competition.
We give them broad guidelines, and each one has to be creative.
Did the teachers train the students, or do you have a special team?
I built them, I built them.
But some teachers, for example, in some schools like Abu Obeida, said they would dedicate Saturdays to student activities.
This is a day outside of school hours, they decide and approve it, Rania's school said they will hold a march.
They said it was a day for healthy cooking for girls, but they didn't make the boys cook healthy food on their own. The girls were一個一個一個一個一個一個一個一個一個一個一個一個一
I would also like to thank Rayan Water for providing all the water free of charge to schools. Rayan Water for this gesture.
Of course, water is very healthy because it helps cleanse the body of all the toxic substances that enter it daily through water.
We said the third week.
Which means that his body is moving.
He might be playing football or basketball and not even know that this is the game I love.
True, true, exactly, and some might want another game, perhaps they don't like team games.
Welcome to our live broadcast.
Mr. Abdul Aziz Al-Jaber, founder and director of the Qatar Multiple Sclerosis Association, is welcome with us.
Of course, we try as much as possible to focus on important topics.
We would like to know and inform our dear viewers about what multiple sclerosis is.
Because after this name, it might be strange to us,
The number of women who had this was greater than that of men.
All currently available treatments are preventive.
The white blood cells that are supposed to protect us start
He kills us by hitting the nerve cell.
Let me simplify it for the audience, it's like a wire.
Covered by a layer called myelin, we might say, for example, a nylon layer.
Of course, it generally leads to dizziness and double vision, double vision.
It also causes problems in the digestive and respiratory systems.
In the worst case, it leads to madness, quadriplegia, or paraplegia.
Of course, the treatments.
The most important functions in the body will be severely affected.
Or from this disease, which is multiple sclerosis.
Some theories say it is transmitted by a virus.
That the disease is a non-epidemic disease.
What is passed on to children?
Some people consider it a regional disease.
For example, the equator was exempt from this disease.
Currently, we have some cases of this disease on the equator.
This disease still has no cure because its cause is unknown.
So far, scientists have not been able to find the cause of the disease in order to find a treatment for it.
Currently, the process has become reversed.
They try to avoid the impact of the disease itself on the human body.
In other words, they start working behind the scenes.
We might be a little scared of this topic, which we can say is that this disease came suddenly.
Is there a specific group that feels this disease is prevalent in their community?
Globally, it was ranked between twenty and forty.
Currently, the international community has reduced the number of the same disease from twenty to fifteen.
Because it seems to take young people until the age of forty.
But humans don't recover from it.
Of course, as a society, we accept alternative medicine and prophetic medicine.
Yes, through the community, Multiple Sclerosis Society Qatar.
Why do we have this society?
There was a large group, so they thought about forming an association for this matter.
Sure, I'll give you a few random numbers.
In Kuwait, they say there are sixty thousand cases.
A thousand cases.
The rest of the Gulf countries range between one hundred to three hundred.
The day I was diagnosed five to six years ago,
My number was sixty-four and sixty.
Are there specific symptoms that indicate the patient has already contracted this illness?
We're not certain it's a virus, so we don't want to commit to a particular theory, that's the point. killing killing killing
The second point is how do I know if I have this or not.
This is very difficult.
I'm confused, oh! Professor Abdulaziz is trying to figure out a specific point.
