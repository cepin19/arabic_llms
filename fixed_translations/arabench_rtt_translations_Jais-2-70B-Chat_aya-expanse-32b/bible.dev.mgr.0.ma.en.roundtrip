Jacob was the father of Joseph. Joseph was the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Christ.
Yes, there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen generations from David until the exile of the Jewish people to Babylon, and fourteen generations from then until the Messiah, Jesus Christ.
This is the account of the birth of Jesus Christ. His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Joseph, her husband, was a good man. He didn't want to expose her to shame in front of people. Instead of divorcing her and leaving her on the streets.
But while Joseph was considering this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
"...she will give birth to a son...you are to name him Jesus...for he will save his people from their sins."
All this happened to fulfill what the Lord had spoken through the prophet.
"And We placed within the heaven signs of the zodiac and adorned it for the observers. And We have determined the matter of the heaven in [this] manner. And of everything We have recorded [its decree] in a clear register." (Quran 51:16-19) The name Iman means "believer" or "faith."
Joseph went to the house of David, as the angel of the Lord had instructed him, and took Mary as his wife.
But not even a single one of her children came close to him, and she gave birth to a son for him. She named him Youssef Issa.
Wise men visit Jesus.
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in the West Bank. This happened during the time when Herod was king of the West Bank. After Jesus was born, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem.
Solo, "Where is the child who was born to be the King of the Jews? When we were in the East, we saw his star. Now we have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was very disturbed, as was everyone in Jerusalem.
So Herod summoned the chief priests and the scribes of the people, and asked them where the Christ was to be born.
"...They answered him, 'In Bethlehem of Judea.' For so it is written by the prophet."
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times." (Micah 5:2)
Then Herod secretly called the wise men, and learned from them the exact time when the star had appeared.
"...Send them to Bethlehem... and tell them to go and search carefully for the child. As soon as they find him, bring me word, so that I too may go and pay him homage."
...After the wise man heard him...he continued on his way...the star he had seen when they were in the east...led him there...it stopped over the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, they were filled with joy.
...This is what happened...The wise men went to the house...There they saw the child with Mary...They bowed down to him and worshiped him...Then they opened their treasures...They gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to go back to Herod. So those men returned to their country by another route. The family of Jesus fled to Egypt.
...when the wise men had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. "Get up," the angel said, "take the child and his mother, and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."
Joseph traveled by night to Egypt with the child and Mary.
"...they remained there until the death of King Herod, in order that what the Lord had spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled, when he said, 'Out of Egypt I called my son'—Hosea 11:1."
...so Herod was furious and felt mocked...he became very angry...and issued his orders concerning Bethlehem and its surroundings...to kill all the boys under the age of two...and this coincided with the time the wise men had seen that star.
In this way, the word spoken by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled. He had said:
"A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning. Rachel weeps for her children; she refuses to be comforted, because they are no more." (Jeremiah 31:15) Jesus' family returned to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. An angel of the Lord appeared to him in the dream.
...the angel said to him, "Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel..." Those who wanted to kill the child have died.
So Joseph went up to meet his father, and presented himself to him. He fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good while. And Israel said to Joseph, "Now let me die, since I have seen your face, because you are still alive."
...but when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee.
"...he lived in a city called Nazareth...that's what the prophets had said before, it came true...they had said, 'He will be called a Nazarene'."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days, John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Turn away from your sins! The kingdom of heaven is near."
John was the one of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke. He said, "A voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.' " (Isaiah 40:3)
John's belongings were made of camel hair. He wore a leather belt around his waist. His food consisted of locusts and wild honey.
People came out to meet him from Jerusalem and all the region of Judea, and from the region beyond the Jordan.
When they had confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
...John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the place where he was baptizing, and he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
The level of maturity that shows you your mistakes.
"...Even if they don't believe in themselves, they say, 'We are the children of Abraham.' I tell you, God can raise up children of Abraham from these stones."
And if the sea were ink for the words of my Lord, the sea would surely be exhausted before the words of my Lord are exhausted, even if We brought the same amount of ink.
You amaze me with your words, asking for my forgiveness for your kindness, but my lady, I am rich beyond the strength of my lineage and rich beyond the terrors of fate and people.
...They gathered for the ceremony...and went to join the people there...and they are waiting for the bride to come out so they can do the bathing ritual and all that other nonsense...and at the same time, there are some women who came with the bride...and they are the ones responsible for leading her and dressing her...and at the same time...
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River, to be baptized by John.
But John tried to prevent him. He said to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you. Why have you come to me?"
...Jesus answered him, "Let it be so now, for thus it is fitting to fulfill all righteousness." And John consented.
When Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."
The experience of Prophet Jesus
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert. There, Satan tempted him.
After forty days and forty nights of fasting, our master Jesus felt hungry.
The experienced man came to him and said, "If you are indeed the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.' " (Deuteronomy 8:3)
After the devil, God sent Jesus to the holy city. They stopped at the high place of the temple.
"If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down. For it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you carefully. They will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'" (Psalm 91:11-12)
Jesus answered, "It is written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
He said to them, "If you prostrate before me and worship me, I will give you all this."
Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
"...the devil here will leave Jesus...the angels came to attend to him...Saint Luke the Evangelist"
John was in prison. When he heard about Jesus, he returned to Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and went to live in the town of Capernaum by the Sea of Galilee, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
In this way, what the prophet Isaiah said came true. He said:
Master of the waves! Master of fear! The mighty, the brave, not the weak! Master of the vast sea! The law, the law, the law!
"Those who live in darkness will see a great light. They live in the land of deep darkness, but light will shine on them." (Isaiah 9:1,2)
From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus chose the first disciples.
One day, Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. He saw two brothers, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
"Come. Follow me," said Jesus, "and I will make you a fisher of men."
They immediately abandoned their network and followed him.
"...then he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets. And he called them..."
Immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed Jesus. Jesus healed the sick.
...Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
"...And even though, Mr. Timur...he cut off the line...and he stood up from his chair...heading towards the door...until the secretary stopped him...to give him today's orders...until her request shocked him...the secretary, Mr. Timur...I want to take a leave today...is it possible? Timur, in surprise, asked why the secretary, um...In fact...I have an appointment with the doctor...I want to have a general check-up...and reassure myself about my health...because these days...I've been feeling very tired...and I need to sleep...and these symptoms...made me suspect that I..."
A large crowd followed him, including people from Galilee, the region known as the Ten Cities, and from Jerusalem and Judea. Others came from the region across the Jordan River.
Mr. Good
Jesus saw the crowds. So he went up a mountain and sat down. His disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them. He said,
Their blessings, which have lost respect, Paradise desires.
Blessed is he who sows sorrow and reaps ruin.
Blessed is He who created the heavens and the earth in six days and then established Himself on the Throne.
Their blessings that they have made and embraced for what is right, so they became signs in the heavens and the earth.
Barakallahu yerhamuna
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
They call them humans.
Blessed are those who are on His grace and the month is their kingdom of the term.
Blessings until people get tired of lying about you and exploiting you under the guise of blessings. They all tell lies about you, every single one of them is a lie.
Rejoice and be glad. Your reward is great in heaven. Likewise, people have persecuted the prophets who lived long ago. Salt and light.
We dig the earth, but when we open the salt mine, salt gives us a way to differentiate and I began to lag behind and my heart goes into it.
Neti Nour al-Alamiyya is a city on a hill that can be feared.
People don't put the lamp under a bowl. They put it in its proper place, and then it lights up everyone in the house.
In the same way, let your light shine before others. Then they will see your good works and will praise your Father who is in heaven. Jesus gives the full meaning to the law.
"You do not think that I have come to abolish what is written in the law or the prophets. I have not come to do this. Indeed, I have come to fulfill the full meaning of what is written."
What I'm telling you now is truly the sky and the earth will move before a single small letter of the law is changed, before a single small line in the law is changed, everything will be completed.
"...do not break even one of the least of these commandments. And do not teach others to break them. For then you will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. Instead, practice and teach these commandments. And you will be called great in the kingdom of heaven."
This is what I tell you: be more discreet than a Frenchman and a law professor, for if you are not, you'll be in hot water.
This is what I have heard from people who know whereof: "Do not fear, you have only killed her" (Sura 20:13). Whoever fears, envy will befall him.
But this is what I'm telling you. Don't be angry with your brother. Whoever is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment. Again, whoever says to his brother, 'Raka,' must face the Supreme Court. But whoever says, 'Fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell.
Suppose you were offering your gift at the altar and there you remembered that your brother had something against you.
Leave your gift before the altar. Go and be reconciled with your brother. Then come back and offer your gift.
Assume that someone has a claim against you and is taking you to court. Settle the account quickly. Do it while you're still on good terms with them. Otherwise, they might hand you over to the judge. The judge might hand you over to the officer. And you could end up in jail.
What I'm telling you is 100% true. You won't get out of here until you pay the last cent! Adultery.
You have heard that it was said, "Do not commit adultery." (Jesus, in the Sermon on the Mount)
But let me tell you this: Don't look at women in the wrong way. The one who does it has already committed adultery in his heart.
When your eye tells you the truth, and your heart whispers to you, remember that only a part of you is speaking, and not the whole of you.
She won't even bother to cut them off and push them onto your account, knowing that you'll lose them in the waste and the pursuit of your body.
"If a man divorces his wife, he must give her a written notice of divorce." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
But this is what I am saying to you: the man who divorces his wife makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. A man can divorce his wife only if she is unfaithful to him. I swear.
Again, you have heard what was said to your ancestors: "Do not break the promises you made to the Lord, and do not swear false oaths to him."
But this is what I am saying to you: Do not make any promise like this to them. Do not promise them even in the name of heaven. That is God's throne.
...Do not make it in the name of the earth...that is the footstool of my God...do not make it in the name of Jerusalem...that is the city of the great King.
And do not swear by your heads. You cannot change even a single hair, white or black.
Let your "yes" mean "yes." Let your "no" mean "no." Anything extra beyond this comes from the evil one. Be kind to people.
You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
But this is what I'm telling you. Don't resist evil. "If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek to him as well."
Assume someone sues you for your shirt. Let him take your jalabiya as well.
If someone forces you to go one mile with them, go two miles.
Give to those who ask you for something. Do not turn away from those who want to take something from you. Love your enemy.
You've heard that it's better to give than to receive.
But this is what I'm telling you. Love your enemy. Pray for those who harm you.
 Then you will be sons of your Father who is in heaven.  "He causes his sun to shine on evil people and good people. He sends rain on those who do right and those who don't.   
I love you for loving me, but don't you see that these lies are destroying us?
Say, "Peace be upon those who follow guidance from their Lord." And if they take from you, then take from others, but do not commit injustice against those who are righteous and fear Allah.
As different as your father and one in the sky.
Giving to people in need
Be careful not to do good deeds in front of people. Don't do them so that people can see you. If you do, your Father in heaven will not reward you.
"When you give to the needy, do not boast about it with loud proclamations. Do not be like those who pretend to be religious. They announce their deeds in the synagogues and on the streets, seeking the praise of people. What I am about to tell you from here on is true. They have already received their reward."
When you give charity to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
And the mountains, the mountains are like books of Allah, scattered throughout the earth.
"Wherever you pray, don't be like those who only pretend to be holy. They want to pray in churches and in the streets to be seen by people. That's what I'm telling you is true. They have already received their full reward."
"Whichever way you wish to pray, enter your house. Close the door and pray to your Father, whom you cannot see. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret."
When you pray, don't make meaningless long speeches like those who are not on the path of God. They think they will be heard because they speak a lot.
Don't be like your father, he knows your case better than you do.
"Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
Come down to earth and be realistic.
Give us today our daily bread.
Barak Allah bina swayy bhal ma samhna lli swayy 'lina.
We are innocent of the act in secret, and we are free from partnership.
Forgive people when they wrong you. If you do that, even your Father in heaven will forgive you too.
But there is no religious duty to advise the creation, the duty of wonder is not advisable.
"...When you walk without eating, don't act like those who just put on a holy face... They contort their faces a lot... Trying to show people they are fasting... What I'm going to tell you is true... They've already received their full reward."
But how can you do that without getting oil on your face?
A brother who doesn't know that you're right, your father who can't bear it, he's the one who'll reward you, your father who, when he sees the truth, will fear the light in the heavens.
Do not accumulate wealth for yourselves on this earth. Moths and rust may consume it, and thieves may break in and steal it.
Instead of keeping your treasures on earth, where moths and rust destroy and thieves break in and steal, store them in heaven.
Your heart is full of your love's sweetness.
The eye is like a lamp; when the eye is clear, the body is well lit.
But suppose your eyes are sick. Then your whole body will be full of darkness. If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one is laughing at us, one by one, they will lie, one by one, they will love, one by one, they will fail, one by one, they will regret. Don't worry.
"...I tell you, do not be afraid...do not be afraid for your life, what you will eat or drink...and do not be afraid for your body, what you will wear. Is there any life more than food? Is there anything more important for the body than clothing?"
Look at the birds in the sky. They don’t sow or reap. They don’t store grain in barns. Yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren’t you worth much more than they?
Can you add even an hour to your life by worrying?
And why worry about things? Look at how wild roses bloom. They don't work or make things.
But that's what I'm telling you. Even King Solomon, with all his wisdom, wasn't dressed like one of those roses.
What if God comes to the faithful with injustice? Is it not better than His absence? Even this day, tomorrow will be burned in hell. What are the beliefs? My faith is in beliefs.
And don't be afraid and don't say, "What will we eat? What will we drink? What will we wear? Where will we live?"
People who don't know God run after all those things. Your Father in heaven knows what you need.
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
So don't worry about tomorrow. Tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Be fair when you judge people.
What goes around comes around.
You reap what you sow. What goes around comes around.
You only see the splinter in your friend's eye, but you don't notice the log in your own eye.
How can you tell your friend: "Let me remove this little bit of dust from your eye," when you have a beam in your own eye?
O follower! The first step towards knowledge is to learn to see with your own
Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Ask, seek, knock.
Soul, and he gave you. Heart, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you.
Everyone who comes is welcomed, and whoever leaves passes on, and the door is opened to those who read.
Stand up, my son, and thank your aunt for her kindness.
"Nor did we ask for a fish. Who among you would give him a snake?"
Even though you are evil, you know how to give good things to your children. How much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him!
So, do to others as you would have them do to you. This is the law and the prophets. The great and the small.
Enter the kingdom of God through the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction and hell. Many are those who enter by it.
But the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life. Only a few find it. A tree and its fruit.
They counted the houses according to the news, and they didn't add anything to what you have, but in some neighborhoods, they exaggerated the number of houses.
...By their fruits you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?
In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.
Every date palm tree has a name, like a person.
Cooking uses up all the water in the trees.
"...But everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock. And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash."
Many will say to me on that day: "Lord! Lord! Did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many miracles in your name?"
"...I will tell them plainly... 'I never knew you! Depart from me, you evildoers!' The wise builder and the ignorant."
So, everyone who hears these words of mine and acts on them is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
...In winter, when the rain falls, the winds rise and beat against that villa...but it doesn't fall...it's built on rock.
But everyone heard my words and agreed with them except for one man who objected to Romeo.
"...and the snow was falling...and the water was rising...and the wind was howling and pounding that house...and he was lying there, gasping for breath with heavy gasps..."
Jesus said all these things, and the people were amazed at his teachings.
He spoke like someone in authority. He didn't speak like their law elders.
Sif tichbha rajel fih marad ssi.
Jesus came down from the mountain. Many people followed him.
...A man with a skin disease came to him...and knelt before our lord Jesus, peace be upon him...and said to him, "Lord, if you will, you can make me clean."
...Jesus stretched out His hand and touched him...He said, "I want to; be made clean." Immediately the leprosy left the man.
...Jesus said to him, "Do not tell anyone..."Go, show yourself to the priest..."and offer the sacrifice that Moses commanded..."This will be a testimony to them.
...When our lord Jesus, peace be upon him, entered the city of Capernaum...a Roman centurion came to him...asked him to help him.
...Oh my Lord, oh my Lord, Your servant is lying in his house, unable to move...He is suffering so much, oh my Lord, don't leave me alone, oh my Lord.
Jesus said, "I am going to heal him."
The leader answered and said, "Sir, I do not deserve you to come under my roof. But only speak the word, and my servant will be healed.
...I am a man in authority, with soldiers who obey my orders. I tell this one to go, and he goes. I tell another to come, and he comes. I tell my servant to do this, and he does it.
"...When Jesus heard this, he was amazed... and said to those who were following him, 'What I tell you is true: In Israel I have not found anyone with faith as strong as this.'"
We could tell you about a car that's more than just a means of transport. It's a masterpiece that stands out in the realm of luxury and comfort, a true gem in the kingdom of paradise. It purrs like a kitten, glides silently, and exudes elegance.
Speak to me about their relatives, they are going to pour their white wine in your cup and they are going to drink and wet their hands.
...Jesus said to the Roman centurion, "Go! Just as you believed, it will be done." And at that very moment his servant was healed. Jesus healed many people...
When Jesus came to Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law. She was in bed with a fever.
"...Jesus touched her hands, and warmth came out of them...She got up and started mocking him."
As soon as evening came, they brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed. The whole town gathered at the door, and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.
"He took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows. He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed." (Isaiah 53:4-5) Follow Jesus.
Seeing the crowd moving in on him, Jesus told his disciples to take him to the other side of Lake Galilee.
...Then a Sharia teacher came to him...The teacher said to him, "I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
One of his followers said to him, "Sir, let me go and bury my father first."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me. Let the dead bury their dead. Jesus calms the storm."
Jesus got into the boat. His disciples followed him.
...Suddenly, a strong storm arose over the lake...the waves tossed the boat...but our Lord Jesus was dozing.
The students woke up the teacher. They said, "Master! Save us! We're going to drown!"
...Jesus answered, "You of little faith, why are you so afraid?" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and it was completely calm.
The disciples were amazed. They said, "Who is this man? Even the winds and the waves obey him!" Jesus healed two men possessed by demons.
...Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake in the region of Gadarenes...He met two men possessed by demons...They came out of the tombs...These men were so violent that no one could pass that way.
"...and you want us to be silent? Did you come here to punish us before the time when each one will be tried?"
Not far away, a large herd of pigs was feeding.
The demons said to Jesus, "If you drive us out, we will go and inhabit the herd of pigs."
...Jesus said to them, "Go..." And the demons came out of the men and entered the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake and drowned in the water.
...those who were vaccinating the pigs fled and entered the city, spreading the word about what had happened to the men who were under the control of the demons.
After all the people of the city had gone out to meet Jesus, when they saw him, they asked him to leave them.
Isa is a cripple; he can't walk.
...Jesus got into one of the boats...he crossed to the other side of the lake and arrived at his town.
...Some men brought him a man who could not move...he was lying on a mat...Isa saw them and recognized them as sincere...that's why he told the man, "Do not despair, my son...your sins are forgiven."
...some Sharia teachers said among themselves, "Our brother is saying something very evil."
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to them, "Why do you have evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Is it easy to say, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Get up and walk"?
"...I want you to know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins..." And he spoke to the man who could not walk, saying, "Get up, take your mat, and go to your house."
...He went home.
When they saw this, they were amazed. They praised God, who had given men such authority. Jesus chose when.
...When Jesus had finished speaking, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. He said to him, "Follow me." And he got up and followed him.
Afterward Jesus went to the home of a man named Matthew and many tax collectors and "sinners" came and ate with Jesus and his disciples.
The Pharisees saw this and asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Isa heard that. He says those who are healthy don't need a doctor; those who are sick do.
"Go and learn what this means, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice' (Hosea 6:6). I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to follow me." Jesus questions fasting.
One day the disciples of John came and said to Jesus, "How is it that we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"
...Isa answered how the groom's guests would be sad and he would be with them... There will come a time when the groom will be taken from among them... Then they will fast.
People don't plan for the future without a new strategy, as the future will reach Mecca more quickly.
...People don't pour new wine into old wine skins... otherwise, the skins will burst... the wine will escape... and the skins will be ruined... No... each one pours the new wine into the new wine skins... and that's how salvation comes to both.
...while Jesus was saying this, a ruler came and knelt before him, saying, "My daughter has just died. But come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
And Jesus arose and went with him. Even his disciples went with him.
...Then, at that very moment, a woman came up behind Jesus...She had a condition that caused her to bleed...She had been suffering from this for twelve years...She touched the hem of his garment.
She said, "I just need to measure his clothes." "Okay, let's go."
...And he looked at her and said, "Dear woman, do not lose hope. Your faith has restored your health." And at that very moment, the woman was healed.
As soon as Jesus entered the ruler's house, he saw the flute players and the wailing crowd.
"...He told them to go, the girl wasn't dead, she was just sleeping, but they laughed at him."
After the crowd had been sent away, Jesus entered. He took the girl by the hand, and she arose.
...News of what Isa did spread throughout the entire region...Isa was like two blind men.
"...and they followed him...and they were shouting...Have mercy on us, son of David."
...When Jesus entered the house, the blind men came to him...He asked them, "Do you believe that I can do this?" They answered, "Yes, Sir."
Then he touched their eyes and said, "Your faith has healed you."
...Even so, they might be able to see again... Isa warned them well... Be sure that no one knows about this.
But they went out and spread the news. They were talking about it all over that area.
For whenever they brought out the demon-possessed man, he would go into convulsions, foam at the mouth, gnash his teeth, and become rigid.
When the devil came out of the man, he spoke. The people were amazed and said, "We have never seen anything like this in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons. There are only a few good works."
Jesus went through all the towns and villages. He taught in their synagogues, proclaimed the good news of the kingdom, and healed every disease and sickness.
When he saw the throngs, he felt deep anxiety for them. They were packed together and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
...And Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few."
Please, Mrs. Hassan, let me take care of Hassan's boundaries.
Sif tells them that she's bored.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
Here are the names of the twelve apostles. First, there was Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then there was James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
After Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the tax collectors. And there are two others: James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus.
The other two were Jesus' zealot disciple Simon and Judas Iscariot, who would later betray Jesus to his enemies.
...Jesus sent these twelve with these instructions: "Don't go among the Gentiles, and don't enter any Samaritan town.
But go to the house of Israel, for they are like sheep scattered abroad.
And as you go, preach, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.'
Blessed are the sick, who unite the words of life, who avoid the evil whispers of the devil. May Allah grant us His gifts.
Don't be silly or foolish or act like you don't care about your own feelings.
Don't bring any bags with you on the trip. Don't bring extra clothes, sandals, or canes. Only give the worker what he needs.
When you enter a city or a village, look for someone who seems willing to receive you. Stay in that person's house until you leave.
When I entered the house, I greeted the people who live there.
Go to that house and enter it.
"...those who don't want you, don't give them your attention... until you find the one who does, wipe the dust off your feet at the doorstep of that house or village..."
What I'm telling you is true. On the Day of Resurrection, it will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah than for this city.
"I am sending you like sheep among wolves. That's why be wary of the foxes and the doves."
Beware! The men will hand you over to the local courts. They will flog you in their temples.
You will bring emperors and kings because of me, and you will be witnesses against them and those who are not Jews.
But when they arrest you, don't be afraid of what you will say or how you will say it. At that time, they will give you the right words to say.
You're going to the party, even though your father objects to it.
...The brother is going to hand his brother over to be fought...The father is going to hand over his children...The son is going to stand up to his father and mother and bring them to fight and die.
Everyone is going to hate you because of who you are, but even the night will bear success.
"...when people attack you in one place, flee to another..." "...what I'm telling you is true...you will not finish your journey through the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes."
The student is not better than the teacher. The servant is not better than the master.
...It is enough for a disciple to be like his teacher, and enough for a slave to be like his master. If the master of the house is called Beelzebul, what will they say about the rest of those who live in his house?
Don't fear your enemies. Everything hidden will come to light. Everything concealed will be revealed.
What is told to you in the dark, say it in the light. What is whispered to you, shout it from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather, fear Him who can destroy both body and soul in hell.
What two storms are you afraid of, only one of them is not from here.
So every hair in your head counts!
Eva, don't be afraid. You're worth more than a hundred birds.
What does it matter to the man who says in front of people that he knows me? I too will say in front of my Father in heaven that I know him.
But what they say to me in private, I wouldn't say it to my Lord, who is in the heavens.
I thought it was the sky that was named after him, but it wasn't the sky, it was the sword.
I went to look for their father. The girls are just wasting their money. The young men are sleeping on their two ears.
A man's foes shall be they of his own household. (Micah 7:6)
Anyone who loves in Abu Dhabi or Amora more than me and doesn't deserve me.
And he doesn't listen to me, doesn't follow me, and he doesn't have any respect.
I found my life without her, the one who will make me regret my life, sir, I will hang myself on it.
Whoever follows you will follow me, whoever follows me will follow you, children of mine.
Assume that someone receives a prophet as a prophet. Then he will receive the reward of a prophet. And assume that someone receives a righteous person as a righteous person. Then he will receive the reward of a righteous person.
 Suppose someone gives even a cup of cold water to a little one who follows me. What I'm about to tell you is true. That one will certainly be rewarded." 
Lord and master of the night
Jesus continued to teach and preach to his twelve disciples. Then he went on to complete his education and preaching in the cities of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Jesus was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
Solo Jesus, "Are you the one who is supposed to come? Or should we look for another?"
Jesus answered, "Go and tell John what you hear and see.
The blind receive sight. The lame walk. Those who have leprosy are cleansed. The deaf hear. The dead are raised. And the good news is proclaimed to the poor.
Blessed are those who have believed in what has been revealed to us, in truth, following the truth.
"...When John's disciples came and told him about Jesus, he called them to him and said, 'What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed swaying in the wind?'"
"Or what, did you go out to see a man wearing beautiful clothes? People who wear beautiful clothes are not in the kings' palace."
Eva fash kharjto chofu nabi? Ah kano lika w akthar min nabi. Translation: So when you went out to see a prophet? Oh, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
That's what it says in the Holy Book. It says, "'I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way.' (Malachi 3:1)"
Truly I tell you, among those born of women, no one is greater than John the Baptist; yet the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.
"From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing rapidly. And those who are ready, take it by force."
Everyone is noble and virtuous until proven otherwise.
What I expect from him is to keep in touch with me, as he is the one who initiated our connection and led me to continuous success.
He who has two ears should give them to those who deserve them.
What can we compare the people of today to? They are like children sitting in the market and calling out to other people. They say...
There is poverty, but I am resilient and my promise to myself is my fortress.
When John McClane drinks, he doesn't do it like others. People say he's possessed.
But when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?" And they also went each to his own home. And the people said, "Behold, this man is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and 'sinners!'" "Those who know what is good have declared that what is good is worthy of honor." "The cities that do not repent, it will be worse for them than for Sodom."
...Jesus began to speak about the cities where he had done most of his miracles...the people there did not repent from their sins...so he said:
Oh, you coward! Oh, you miserable wretch! The substance that the common people consume in this world, one of them contains the happy life that suits the ages.
But I'm telling you this. On the Day of Reckoning, it will be easier for the images and the hunters than it will be for you.
And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to the realm of the dead. For if the miracles had been done in Sodom which were done in you, it would have remained until this day.
But I tell you, on the day of reckoning, it will be easier for Sodom than for you. Rest for all who are weary.
At that time Jesus said, "Father, glorify your name." Then a voice came from heaven, "I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again." The crowd that was there and heard it said it was thunder. Others said, "An angel has spoken to him." Jesus answered, "This voice has come for your sake, not mine. Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be driven out. And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself." He said this to show by what kind of death he was going to die.
Yes, father, this is what I want.
 "My Father has given all things to me. The Father is the only one who knows the Son. And the only ones who know the Father are the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to make him known.   
Come to me, all of you who are weary and carrying heavy burdens, and I will give you rest.
Be my servants and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
"My service is easy and my burden is light."
He advises to go on Saturday.
One Sabbath Jesus was going through grainfields, and his disciples began to pick some heads of grain as they went along.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to Jesus, "Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath."
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry?"
So he entered the house of God. Both he and his men ate the holy bread, which was only to be eaten by the priests.
"...Haven't you read the law? It says how every Sabbath the priests in the temple should perform their duties on that day...but they are not considered guilty."
You could say that this is more important to me than the temple itself.
The Bible says, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) You do not know what these words mean. If you knew, you would not condemn the innocent.
"The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
Going from that place, Jesus entered their synagogue.
...There was a man there with a withered and paralyzed hand...The Pharisees were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus...So they asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
"...I told them, what if a ewe falls into a well on Saturday...you're not going to catch her, you'll have to lift her out."
Man in a sheep's costume! Remember, the law allows us to do good on the day of the festival.
Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out, and it was restored, just like the other hand.
But the Pharisees went out and conspired against Jesus to kill him. Abdullah al-Mukhtar
Jesus knew all about the Pharisees' plans. That's why he left that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But warn them not to say who he is.
"This is how what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah will be fulfilled. He said,"
"He is my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved in whom I am well pleased, and I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations. They will praise him."
No one comes, no one goes, and no one hears a sound in the street.
What's broken will be mended, what's torn will be sewn, everything will be alright.
"The nations will put their hope in him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebul
They brought to Jesus a man possessed by a demon. He was blind and mute. Jesus healed him, and afterward the man could see and speak.
People were amazed. They said, "Could it be David's son?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man drives out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the prince of demons."
Jesus knew what they were thinking. That's why he told them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand."
And he will destroy me, he is fighting with his head. This is how a king lives his day.
They say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul, and by the power of the rulers of the demons. But if it is by the power of the rulers of the demons that your sons cast them out, then they will be your judges.
But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Don't even think about it. How can you just go into someone's house and take what they have? You need to tie them up first. Then you can rob the house.
He who walks with me is against me. He who does not gather the sheep with me scatters them.
So that's what I'm telling you. Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But speaking evil against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Whatever blasphemy is spoken against the Son of Man will be forgiven him. But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come."
 "If you make a tree good, its fruit will be good. If you make a tree bad, its fruit will be bad. You can tell a tree by its fruit.   
You poisonous vipers' nests! How can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
...A good man speaks good things. These things come from the good that is hidden within him. A bad man speaks bad things. These things come from the evil that is hidden within him.
But this is what I'm telling you. On the Day of Judgment, people will be held accountable for every trivial word they uttered.
How much does it cost, whether it's wholesale or not? "The olive oil for Mr. Nabout.
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus. They said, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from you."
He answered and said, "It is the evil and corrupt people who ask for a miraculous sign! But not a single one will be given without the sign of the prophet Jonah."
...Jonah was in the belly of a huge whale for three days and three nights...and the same thing will happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the tomb.
...The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here....
"...and the queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with the men who live now...and will condemn them...she came from a very distant place to hear the wisdom of Solomon...and now one who is greater than Solomon is here."
What happens when an evil spirit leaves a person? It starts to wander in dry areas, looking for a place to rest. But it can't find one.
Then he says he will return to the house he left. When he gets there, he finds the house empty. The house has been cleaned and restored.
"...after this evil spirit leaves, it takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. In the end, that person is worse off than before. That's how it will be with this evil generation." - Jesus and his brothers
While Jesus was still speaking to the people, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.
Someone told him that your mother and your siblings were outside and wanted to talk to you.
Jesus answered and said to him, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus pointed to his disciples. He said to them, "Behold my mother! Behold my brothers!"
Anyone who does what they want in this world is either a fool, a child, or a mother.
Sidi El Fadj
That day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
A large crowd gathered around him. So he got into the boat, sat in it, and all the people stood on the shore.
Then he said a lot of things to them by telling stories. He said: "A farmer went out to sow his seeds.
The seeds fell on the ground. Some fell on the path. The birds came and ate them.
A seed fell on rocky ground, where there wasn't much soil. It sprouted quickly, because the soil wasn't deep.
When the sun rose, it burned the plants. They dried out because they had no roots.
...Another one fell among the thorns...The thorns grew and covered the plant.
...Even so, one that should have been good fell, and that plant that gave water came up, sixty or thirty times more than what was sown.
He who has two ears, let him hear.
Jaw had the students come to him and asked him why he tells stories to people.
He answered and said, "It has been given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given."
...Anyone who has this type of knowledge will be given more. Originally, they will have a lot, lot...if someone doesn't have this type of knowledge, even the little they have will be taken away from them.
...That's why I use stories when I talk to people...I say...They see...But they don't really see...They hear...But they don't pay attention...Or they don't understand.
In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: "You will indeed hear, but never understand; you will indeed see, but never perceive."
"...The hearts of men are hardened...they can barely hear with their ears...they close their eyes...or they see with their eyes...they can hear with their ears...they can understand with their hearts...they can return to the Lord...and then He will heal them." (Isaiah 6:9,10)
But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and blessed are your ears, for they hear.
What I am about to tell you now is true. Many prophets and righteous people wished to see what you see. But they didn't see it. They wished to hear what you hear. But they didn't hear it.
Listen! This is the meaning of the farmer's story.
...People hear the message of the Kingdom, but they don't understand it...then comes the evil one...he steals what you've planted in their hearts...those people are like that seed that's sown on the path.
Others gathered the seed that fell on the rocky ground. They are the ones who hear the message and receive it in the place with joy.
But they don't have the roots. That's why they don't last long. They quickly lose faith when problems or suffering arise because of the message.
... and others gather the remaining dates that fell among the thorns... They are the ones who listen to the talk... But afterwards, they fill it with the worries of this world and the false promises of wealth... They gather them... They prevent them from bearing fruit.
"...but there are still others who take that seed that fell on the good ground...they are the ones who hear the message and understand it...and they bear fruit 100 or 60 or 30 times more than what the farmer planted." The Parable of the Weeds
...Jesus told the crowds another parable...What is the kingdom of heaven?...A man sowed good seed in his field.
But when everyone was asleep, his enemy came. The enemy sowed weeds among the wheat and then left.
...It began to sprout and give ears...and at the same time...some weeds sprouted with it.
"...we are working for the owner of the farm...they came to him and said: 'Sir, you planted beautiful crops in your fields.'...So where did these weeds come from?"
"...He told me it's an enemy who did this." The servants asked him if we want to go and uproot that spring.
"No," answered the landowner. "When you're weeding, you might pull up the wheat along with the weeds."
Let them grow together until the harvest. Then I will tell the workers what to do. This is what I will say to them: First, gather the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned. Then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn." - Parables of the Mustard Seed and Yeast
...Jesus told the crowd another parable, saying, "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed. A man took that seed and planted it in his field."
She is the smallest unit of the full moon. But when she becomes a tree, she is the largest among all the trees in the garden. She becomes a tree. Birds come and rest on her branches.
...Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a woman who took yeast and mixed it into a large amount of flour until all of it was leavened."
Jesus spoke all these things to the people in parables; he said nothing to them without using a parable.
So the word that the prophet spoke was fulfilled. He had said, "I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter hidden things from the time of creation." (Psalm 78:2) Jesus explains the parable of the weeds.
...and people will follow him...he'll go into a house...the students will come to him...they'll say to him...sell us the story of that wretched herb that's in the vegetable garden.
Answer them: It is the Son of Man who sows the good seed.
The field is the world. Good crops represent people who belong to the kingdom. Weeds are people who belong to the evil one.
The people who are evil are the devil's angels on the day of reckoning and suffering.
Weeds are pulled up by the roots and burned in the fire. That is how it will be on Judgment Day.
But the Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers.
He will throw them into the blazing fire. There, the people will weep and gnash their teeth.
...and the people of God will shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom. Let those with ears listen. Stories of the hidden treasure and the pearl.
King Salman was very angry when he saw the rose that had been turned into a snake, and he was even angrier when the snake bit him and he found the rose inside it.
Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.
...He met something...very valuable...He sold everything he had...and bought that pearl...The net's story.
Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that is thrown into the sea, gathering all kinds of fish.
As soon as they were full, the sailors pulled them up and placed them on the shore. Then, they sat down and gathered the good fish in the baskets. But they threw away the bad fish.
That's how it will be on the Day of Resurrection. The angels will come. They will separate the people who did bad things from those who did good things.
They're going to throw those losers into a terrible furnace. There, those losers will bake and gnash their teeth.
"Did you understand all this?" asked Jesus. "Yes," they answered.
"...He told them, 'Every teacher of the law who has become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old.' A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home."
...Jesus finished these stories...and went from there.
...and returned to his hometown, Nazareth...where he began to teach in their synagogues...and they were amazed and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works?"
What is this girl Mary Mary doing? She's a real troublemaker, always causing problems and stirring up trouble.
Are you all with us? Does this sky not bring these things to you?
"...They were not at all pleased with him... but Jesus said to them, 'A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home.'"
They moved some of the things there because they didn't trust anyone.
John the Baptist's head flew off.
At that time Herod the tetrarch heard about the fame of Jesus.
"...He told those who were with him, 'That is John the Baptist...he has risen from the dead!...That's why he has the power to perform miracles."
Herod had John arrested, bound, and put in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.
...John was telling Herod that it was against the law to be with her.
Herod wanted to kill John, but he was afraid of the people, because they considered John a prophet.
On Herod's birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced for Herod and his guests. Herod was very pleased with her.
And he promised by Allah that he would give her whatever she asked for.
"...She said to her, 'What do you want to say?' The girl said, 'I will say to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."'"
...but remember his promise and his dinner...and he told one of his men to give her what she wanted.
Herod cut off John's head in prison.
They brought her his head in a large platter and gave it to the girl, who took it.
John's disciples came, took his body, and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed the five thousand.
...Jesus heard what had happened to John...He wanted to be alone...He went by boat to a solitary place...The crowds heard about it...They followed Jesus on foot from the towns.
When our Lord Jesus went up to the mountain, he found a large crowd of people. He felt great compassion for them and healed their sick.
...Evening approached, and the students came to him...They told him there was nothing there...It was getting dark...He sent the people to go...They started to go and buy what they would eat in the villages.
Jesus answered and said, "It is not necessary for them to go away. You give them something to eat."
"We have only five loaves of bread and two fish."
"Bring them to me here," he said.
...And after Jesus said to the people, "Sit down on the grass..." He took the five loaves and the two fish...He looked up to heaven and gave thanks...He broke the loaves into pieces...Then He gave them to the disciples...and the disciples gave them to the people.
...They all ate and were full... The students took 12 baskets of the remaining bread...
...The number of men who ate was almost five thousand... even the women and children ate... Isa walks on the water.
...At that very moment...Jesus made the disciples get into the boat...He sent them ahead to the other side of the Sea of Galilee...Then...He dismissed the crowd.
After sending them away, he went alone to a side of the mountain to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.
...The steamer had plowed far out to sea...and the waves were tossing it to and fro...because the winds were blowing from the opposite direction.
So early in the morning, Jesus came to his disciples. He was walking on the lake.
"...They saw it walking on the lake...and they were terrified... 'A ghost!'...and they screamed in fear..."
...Then Jesus called out to them, "Take heart, it is I; do not be afraid."
"Oh Lord, who are You? asked Peter. If it is You, command me to come to You on the water."
Jesus said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat, walked on the water, and went toward Jesus.
But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me!
"...for nothing is impossible for him...so advance...and do not be afraid."
When they got in the boat, the wind stopped.
...and those who were in the boat worshiped Jesus, saying, "You are the Son of God."
He sailed across the lake and landed at Gennesaret.
The men who were living there were the ones who knew Jesus. They sent a message to every place in the surrounding region, and people brought all their sick to Jesus.
...and they asked him to let only those who were sick touch the hem of his garment...and everyone who touched it was healed.
What makes people "dirty"?
...the Pharisees and some of the scribes came from Jerusalem to see our Lord Jesus, and they asked him...
Why don't your students practice what the elders teach? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!
Jesus answered, "Why do you not keep the commandments of God? But you prefer to follow your own teachings!"
God said: "Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) He also said: "He who curses his father or his mother shall be put to death." (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9)
But you allow people to tell their parents that any help they receive from us is a gift from God.
"Those don't need your words, you make God's word vain without following it as you claim."
O you who believe, stand firm for justice when you bear witness.
"These people praise me with their words. But their hearts are very far from me."
"Their worship means nothing to me. They teach nothing but human rules." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus called to the people who were there. He said to them, "Listen and understand."
"What goes into your mouth doesn't make you dirty. It's what comes out of your mouth that makes you dirty."
Then his disciples came to him. They said to him, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus answered, "There are plants that my Father in heaven did not plant. These plants will be uprooted."
Leave them. The Pharisees are blind guides. If a blind man leads another blind man, both will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Don't you understand yet?" asked Jesus.
What if everything that enters the eye goes into the heart?
Words that come out of your mouth reflect what's in your heart. These are the things that make you 'dirty'.
The wicked sins that come from the heart. That's how murder, adultery, and other sexual sins are committed. That's how theft, false witness, and lying to others are done.
These are the two cases that are bothering you; you are bothering about "a woman's defect from among those we know."
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Sidon and Tyre.
...A unit of Canaanites lived near Tyre and Sidon...they came to him and cried out to the Lord who created them...Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on me! A demon is living in my daughter...she suffers greatly.
...Jesus didn't say a word...His disciples came to him and pleaded with him...Send her away...She is crying after us.
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
"...Then the woman fell to her knees in front of him... she was sobbing and gasping... and saying hysterically... 'The woman, oh God...'"
They answered and said, "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
"Yes, Sir, but the chance of eating it is surprising, even the dog eats like a wolf that hasn't eaten in seven days."
...Then Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed at that hour. ...Jesus fed four thousand people.
Jesus went from there. He walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then He went up the mountain and sat down.
Jesus had a large crowd of people following him. They brought with them the blind who could not see and the lame who could not walk. They also brought the mute who could not speak and many other people. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them.
...People were amazed at those who could not speak, those who were lame, those who did not walk in a straight line, those who were blind or could not see...and the people began to worship the Lord of the Children of Israel.
...Then our Lord Jesus called his disciples to come to him... and he said to them... "I am deeply concerned for these people. They have been with me for three days now, and they have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them home hungry, or they will faint on their way."
His disciples answered him and said, "We have nothing here but five loaves and two fish. What are they among so many people?"
"How many loaves do you have?" asked Jesus. "Seven," they answered, "and a few small fish."
Jesus said to the people who had come to watch, "Sit on the ground."
God blessed the seven loaves and the fish, and gave thanks. Then He broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples distributed them to the people.
"They gathered all the fragments, and the disciples took them up, seven baskets full."
The number of men and women in the crowd was 4 million.
After Jesus had sent the multitude away, he went up into a ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.
Jesus is asked for a sign of a miracle.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
He answered and said, "At night, you look at the sky. You say, 'The weather will be nice. The sky is red.'"
And the morning says, Today there will be a storm. The sky is red and overcast. You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you can't understand the signs of what's happening now.
"The foolish and unbelieving people were looking for a sign. But no sign will be given to them except the sign of Jonah." Then Jesus left them and went away. The yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
The pupils went to the other side of the lake. They forgot to bring bread.
"Beware," Jesus told them, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The pupils talked among themselves, saying that what they were saying was because they hadn't brought bread.
Jesus knew what they were saying. He answered them, "Your faith is very small! Why do you discuss among yourselves that there is no bread?"
Don't you understand yet? Haven't you thought about the five loaves for 5000 people? Haven't you thought about how many baskets of fragments you gathered?
Didn't you remember the seven loaves for the four thousand? How many baskets of fragments did you gather?
How is it that you don't understand? I was not talking about bread, but be careful of the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
...After the disciples understood that Jesus was not telling them to avoid the leaven used in bread, they realized He was warning them about the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter declared that Jesus is the Messiah.
...Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi...He asked his disciples, "Who do people say I am?"
"Some say it is John the Baptist. Others say it is Elijah. Still others say it is Jeremiah, or some other prophet."
"But you?" they asked. "Who do you say I am?"
Peter answered and said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
"If we told you that you're the one who's going to win this race, wouldn't you be thrilled?"
"I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you have bound on earth will be bound in heaven. Whatever you have loosed on earth will be loosed in heaven."
...After Jesus, he warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah... Jesus was speaking about his impending death.
From that time Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem. There he will suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes. He will be killed and on the third day be raised again.
"...Peter turned to the side and started sobbing... Never, Lord! ...This will never be yours!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but rather the concerns of men."
Jesus spoke to his disciples and said to them, "If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me."
If he wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for me, he will find it.
What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?
Man will be brought before God in all his glory, and his angels with him. He will reward each one according to his deeds.
I'm telling you now, it's true. Some of the people standing here will not die until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
Jesus' appearance was transformed.
Six days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and John the brother of James up a high mountain, by themselves.
Before them, his form changed. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light.
...Then, at noon, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Jesus.
"...Peter said to Jesus, 'Lord, it is good for us to be here; if you wish, I will make three booths here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
...When Peter was still talking...they were surrounded by a bright cloud...and a voice from within the cloud said, "This is my son...my beloved son...I am so proud of him...I am happy with him...Listen!"
When the students heard it, they were terrified and fell face down to the ground.
But when Jesus came, he said to them, "Get up. Don't be afraid."
When they arrived, they saw no one but Jesus.
...they came down from the mountain...and on the way, Jesus told them what to do...he said to them, "Do not tell anyone about what you have seen..."Wait until the Son of Man rises from the dead."
His pupils asked: "Why do the Sharia scholars say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus answered, "This is true. Elijah must come and restore all things."
But I tell you, Elijah has come, and they did not recognize him. They did to him whatever they pleased, as it is also written of the Son of Man.
...When the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist, Jesus healed a boy who had a demon.
As Jesus approached the crowd, a man ran up to him, knelt before him, and pleaded with him.
"...Oh my Lord...have mercy on my son...he trembles so much...and suffers so much...sometimes he falls into a coma...sometimes into water."
"You brought him to your students. But they couldn't cure him."
Jesus replied, "How long must I bear with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy here to me."
Jesus commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it did, and he was healed instantly.
...Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked him, "Why couldn't we cast out the demon?"
"...Answer, because your faith is very little...What I am about to tell you now is the truth...If you have even a tiny bit of faith, as small as a mustard seed...it is enough...You can tell this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move...You will never face anything impossible."

Then Jesus went with them to the region of Galilee. And he said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men."
"...They will kill him...and on the third day he will rise from the dead...then the disciples will be filled with deep sorrow...Jesus pays the temple tax."
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. When the tax collectors came to Peter, they asked, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
...Ah...what's he doing...answer him...even like that...it's not easy...he sighed...as he looked at Peter...who entered the house...he sighed again...and looked at Peter...who was coming in...and he saw Jesus...and he stood up...and looked at him...and he felt his heart...beating hard...and he felt his head...going numb...and he started seeing...only fog...and he felt his legs...failing him...and he fell to his knees...and looked at Jesus...who was looking at him...with blurred features...and they kept staring at each other...and the whole world stopped...and only their eyes remained...speaking to each other...expressing what was within them...and at the same time...they were trying to read...the features and expressions on each other's faces...and at the same time...they were trying to read...the features and expressions on each other's faces...and at the same time...they were trying to read...the features and expressions on each other's faces...
Peter answered: "I have nothing." Jesus replied: "Yes, your children do not need to pay anything."
But we don't want to anger them. So go to the lake and wave your fishing rod. Catch the first fish you hook. Open its mouth. Inside you'll find the very coin you need. Take it and give it to them to pay my taxes and theirs.
