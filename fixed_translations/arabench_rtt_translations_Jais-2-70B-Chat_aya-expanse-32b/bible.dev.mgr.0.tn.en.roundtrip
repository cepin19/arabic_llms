� khoa Jesus
� khoa is the tree of the lineage of our Lord Jesus Christ. He was the son of David. He was also the son of Abraham.
Abraham is the father of Isaac. Isaac is the father of Jacob. Jacob is the father of Judah and his brothers.
Judah is the father of Perez and Zerah. Tamar is their mother. Perez is the father of Hezron. Hezron is the father of Ram.
khoa is the father of Amnon. Amnon is the father of Nahshon. Nahshon is the father of Salmon.
Salmon was the father of Boaz. Rahab was the mother of Boaz. Boaz was the father of Obed. Ruth was the mother of Obed. Obed was the father of Jesse.
And Jesse was the father of David the king. David was the father of Solomon. Solomon's mother was the wife of Uriah.
khoa is the son of Rehoboam. Rehoboam is the son of Solomon. Abijah is the son of khoa.
Perhaps he is the father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat is the father of Joram. Joram is the father of Uzziah.
Uzziah was the father of Jotham. Jotham was the father of Ahaz. Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
Hezekiah is the father of Manasseh. Manasseh is the father of Amon. Amon is the father of Josiah.
And Josiah took care of Judah and his sisters. Then the Jewish people were forced to go to Babylon.
And after him, the family line continued. Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zechariah was the father of Jeconiah. Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
I visit Boaz. Boaz is the father of Zadok. Zadok is the father of Akim. Akim is the father of Eliud.
Jews are the children of Eliezer, Eliezer is the son of Machath, Machath is the son of Jacob.
Jacob is the father of Joseph. Joseph is the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to our Lord Jesus, who is the Messiah.
So fourteen generations from Abraham to David, and fourteen generations from David to the deportation to Babylon, and fourteen generations from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ. And fourteen generations from the Christ to Jesus who is called the Christ.
This is the account of the birth of Christ. Mary, his mother, was pledged to be married to Joseph. But before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband, Youssef, was a pious man. He didn't want to humiliate her in front of people. So, he decided to divorce her quietly.
But Joseph, while he was thinking about this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
You will give birth to a son. You must name him Isa. This is so that he may save his people from their sins.
Everyone was waiting for what the Lord had promised. He spoke through the prophet,
"The virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and his name shall be called Emmanuel," which means "God with us." (Isaiah 7:14)
Joseph got up, took Mary to his home, and made her his wife.
But we didn't touch each other until I gave birth to a son and named him Youssef Issa.
The kings visited Christ.
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This was during the reign of Herod the Great, King of Judea. After Jesus' birth, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
They said, "Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard about it, he was very troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
So Herod called together all the chief priests and the teachers of the law in the land and asked them where the Messiah was to be born.
"In Bethlehem in the region of Judah," "that is what the prophet wrote," he said.
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, yet out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times." (Micah 5:2)
Then Herod secretly summoned the wise men and learned from them the exact time the star had appeared.
I sent them to Bethlehem. He said, "Go. Do a thorough investigation on the young one. If you find him, bring me a report. Then we will go worship him too."
After the wise men heard the king's words, they continued on their way. The star they had seen in the east went ahead of them. It stopped over the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, joy overwhelmed them.
The wise men went to the house. They saw the child with his mother Mary. They brought him gifts and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But my father warned them in a dream not to go back to Herod. So they returned to their country by another road. The family of Jesus fled to Egypt.
When the wise men had gone, Joseph had a dream. In the dream an angel from the Lord appeared to him. "Get up!" the angel said. "Take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you to return, because Herod is going to search for the child with the intention of killing him."
Joseph arose and took the child and his mother Mary, and went to Egypt.
And they remained there until the death of King Herod. Thus, the word that the Lord spoke by the prophet was fulfilled. He said, "I called My son out of Egypt." (Hosea 11:1)
Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him. So he became very angry. He gave orders concerning Bethlehem and the surrounding areas. All the boys two years old and under were to be killed. This was in accordance with the time that the wise men had seen the star.
So, the words that the prophet Jeremiah spoke came true. He said,
"A voice is heard in Ramah, a voice of deep lamentation; it is Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be consoled, because they are no more." (Jeremiah 31:15) Jesus' family returns to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise! Take the child and his mother. Go to the land of Israel. Those who were trying to kill the child are dead."
And she gave birth to her firstborn son; and she wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.
But when they heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, they were afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, Joseph went to the land of Galilee instead.
And so he lived in a city called Nazareth. And so the words of the prophets about Jesus are not true. They told us, "His name will be Nazarene."
John the Baptist is coming in the way.
In those days, John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Turn away from your sins! The King of the heavens is near."
John is the one of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke, saying, "A voice cries out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes were made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
People came out from Jerusalem and from all over Judah. They also came from all around the Jordan River.
When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the place where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Give the fruit to Yuri to you after your sins.
"Do not deceive yourselves into saying, 'Abraham is our father.' I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham."
The axe is lying by the roots of the tree. And the tree that doesn't bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
My advice to you is to stay away from all your sins. But after my death, someone stronger than me will come. I am not worthy even to untie his sandals. He will counsel you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
His fork is in his hand to remove the straw from his threshing floor. To gather his wheat and put it in the barn. But to burn the chaff with the unquenchable fire. Jesus is baptized.
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan. He loves to be baptized by John.
But John tried to prevent him. He said to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you. Why have you come to me?"
Jesus replied, "Let's do it this way now. This is the right thing for us to do. It fulfills the Lord's holy plan." And then John agreed.
When our Lord Jesus was baptized, the heavens opened. At that moment, he saw the Spirit of God descending on him like a dove.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Jesus is tempted.
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness. There, he was tempted by the devil.
After forty days and forty nights of fasting, Jesus was hungry.
They brought the deceived one. He said, "If you were the son of God, say to this stone, 'Become bread.'"
Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'" (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Behold, the devil took Jesus to the holy city and set Him on the highest point of the temple.
"He said: 'You are my son; today I have begotten you. Ask of me, and I will make the nations your inheritance, the ends of the earth your possession. You shall break them with a rod of iron; you shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.' " (Psalm 91:11-12)
Jesus said, "It is also written, 'You shall not judge your God.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
And in the end, the devil took a very high mountain and behind him all the emperors of the world and their majesties.
He said, "You would fall at my knees and worship me," so I would give you all this.
Jesus said, "Get away from me, Satan! It is written, 'Worship the Lord your God and serve him alone.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
Afterward, the devil left Jesus. Angels came and attended to him. Jesus began to preach.
John was sent to prison. When Jesus heard about it, he returned to Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and made his home in Capernaum by the lake, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
So, the words that the prophet Isaiah spoke were proven true, and he said,
O land of Zebulun! O land of Naphtali! Galilee, where those who are not Jews live! Land on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea! Land to the east of the Jordan River!
"The people walking in darkness have seen a great light. On those living in the land of deep darkness a light has dawned." (Isaiah 9:1,2)
From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus chooses his first disciples.
One day, our Lord Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There, he saw two brothers. They were Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the sea. They were fishermen.
"Come, follow me," said Jesus, "and I will make you fishers of men."
In a jar, they shook their nets and followed him.
And going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. And he called them.
In their place, they left the boat, left their nets, and followed Jesus. Jesus healed the sick.
Jesus walked in every place in Galilee. There, He taught in the synagogues. He preached the gospel of the Kingdom of God. He healed every disease and infirmity among the people.
And his news spread throughout all Syria, and people brought to him all kinds of sick people, including those with various diseases, some with severe fevers, some with madness, some who were paralyzed, and some who could not move. Jesus healed them all.
Large crowds followed him. Some people came from Galilee, from the region known as the Ten Towns, and from Jerusalem and Judea. Others came from the region across the Jordan River.
Jesus is giving a blessing.
Jesus saw the crowds. So he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him.
And then, my brother, he asked them to learn. And he said,
Blessed are those who need spiritually. The kingdom of heaven is theirs.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Congratulations to Abdellah for his humility. May they be given the world.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
"May Allah have mercy on them."
Blessed are those with pure hearts, for they will see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
"Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. The kingdom of heaven belongs to them."
Congratulations when people wish you and hurt you on my behalf. Even you, congratulations when they love to say about you all kinds of evil and lies on my behalf.
Be happy and joyful. Your reward in Paradise is great. In the same way, people harmed the old prophets. Salt and light.
"You are the salt of the earth. But if salt has lost its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot."
You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden.
Moreover, people don't light a lantern and place it under the bowl. They put it on their table. Then it gives light to everyone in the house.
In this way, let your light shine before others. So that they may see the good things you do. And give glory to your Father in heaven. Jesus gave the full meaning to the law.
I didn't come here to upset what is written in the Sharia or about the prophets. I didn't come to do this. I came to fulfill all that is written.
What I am about to tell you is true. Heaven and earth will pass away before the smallest letter or stroke of the law passes away. Not the smallest letter of the law will pass away until all is accomplished.
Do not break even the least of these commandments, and do not teach others to break them. If you do, you will be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven. But if you keep and teach these commandments, you will be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven.
This is what I tell you. You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you are not, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.
"What happened to the old commandments? They were told, 'Do not kill. (Exodus 20:13) Whoever kills will be tried for murder.'"
As for me, this is what I say: Do not deceive your brother. Anyone who deceives his brother must be brought to trial. Again, anyone who says to his brother, 'Raka,' must stand trial before the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of hellfire.
Imagine you're bringing your gift to the mass, and you remember your brother owes you something.
Just place yourself before the altar, first make peace with your brother, and then come back and present your offering.
Imagine someone owes you money and they are accusing you and taking you to court. Resolve the issue quickly. Do it while you are still on good terms with them. If not, they might hand you over to the judge. The judge might hand you over to the executioner. And you might end up in jail.
What I'm telling you is true. Don't leave until you finish your studies! Adultery
I have heard what was said, "You shall not commit adultery." (Exodus 20:14)
But this is what we advise you against. Even just looking at a woman in an inappropriate way. Anyone who does that has committed adultery in their heart.
Your right eye makes you do bad things, pluck your eye out and throw it away. Your eye is just one part of your body. It's better to lose it than to have your whole body be called to Hell.
"Your right hand makes you commit sins, cut it off and throw it away. Your hand is just one part of your body. It's better to lose your hand than for your whole body to go to hell."
They said, "If a man divorces his wife, he must give her a certificate of divorce." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
But here's what I'll tell you: Everyone who sends her a letter, sends her a letter, a divorce letter, a divorce letter, makes her commit adultery, makes her commit adultery, whoever takes her, takes her, of divorce, of divorce, adulterer, adulterer. A man can only send her a letter if she hasn't betrayed him. Monthly.
Once again, I heard what was said to your people of old. They were told, "You cannot break the promises you have made to God. Keep the oaths you have sworn."
But this is what I say to you. Don't make any promises like this. Don't make promises even for the sake of God. This is God's throne.
Do not name them after the things of this world, for that is the Lord's footstool. Do not name them after Jerusalem, for that is the city of the great King.
And don't speak ill of your mother. You can't do a single gray or black hair.
Let your "yes" mean "yes." Let your "no" mean "no." Anything more comes from the evil one. Be kind to others.
I heard it said, "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
Well, this is what I tell you. Don't resist an evil person. If someone slaps you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek to him as well.
Imagine someone taking you to court to take your Syrian belongings. Let him take even your robe.
Imagine someone scares you and tells you to walk a mile with him, walk two miles with him.
Give to him who asks of you. Do not refuse him who would borrow from you. Love your enemies.
I heard what they said, 'Love your neighbor.' (Leviticus 19:18) 'Hate your enemy.'
As for this, what shall I say to you? Love your enemies. Pray for those who persecute you.
"So you shall be sons of your Father in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust."
You reap what you sow. That's how my parents are.
If you had submitted, it would have been better for your companions. What have you done that is not done by people? Even the disbelievers do the same.
Be perfect, as your Father in heaven is perfect.
Charity for the family
Be careful not to do 'good deeds' in front of others. Don't do them just to be seen by others. If you do, your reward will be in heaven, and your father will not give you a penny.
When you give to those who have not, don't make a big show of it and blow your own trumpet. Don't be like those who cause disturbances. They announce everything they do in churches, mosques, and on the streets. They want people to respect them. To tell the truth, they have fully received their due.
When you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
It is good that you are discreet. And be careful, He sees everything you do in secret. Prayer.
When you pray, don't be like the hypocrites who pretend to be religious but are not. They love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners to be seen by people. What I'm telling you now is true. They will receive their reward in full.
When you pray, come to your house. Close the door and pray to your unseen Father. And He will reward you. Your Father sees what you do in secret.
When you pray, don't babble like the hypocrites, for they only aim to be heard by others because they talk a lot.
Don't be like them. Your dad knows what you need even before you ask him.
This is how prayer should be: "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
Your kingdom will come to you, and what you love will happen on earth as it does in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, just as we forgive those who have sinned against us.
Resist sin when it tempts you. Flee from evil.
Forgive people who trespass against you. And your Father in heaven will forgive you as well.
But if people forgive others their sins, Allah will not forgive the sins of those who do not forgive others. Fasting
When you walk around without eating, you're not really fasting like those who pretend to be religious, depriving themselves and wanting to show off their fasting to others. I'm telling you, this is true, and they'll get their reward and more.
But when you walk and don't eat, put olive oil in your hair. Wash your face.
Others don't know what you're fasting for. Only you and your Lord, who is unseen, know. He will reward you. Your Lord sees what you do in secret. Place your wealth in Paradise.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
"Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal."
Your heart is where your money is.
The eye is like a lamp for the body. So, if your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light.
Imagine your eyes seeing nothing but darkness, that's what makes your whole body faint. If the light within you is darkness, then it's a terrible darkness!
To a certain extent, one can serve two masters at the same time. One will hate one of them and love the other. Or be loyal to one and hate the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Don't be afraid.
We tell you, do not be afraid. Do not be afraid for your life, and what you will eat or drink. And do not be afraid for your body, and what you will wear. Is there not food in the world? Are there not more important things for the body than clothing?
They walk on their two feet, they do not sow or reap, or store up in barns, yet your Lord provides for them. Are you not less worthy than they?
Can worry add even an hour to your life?
And why do you worry about clothes? Look how the wildflowers grow. They don't work or spin.
"And this is what I'm telling you. Even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these."
My Lord covers the grass in the salt marsh, so how could He cover you better than that? You think this grass will remain there that day and the next day it will be thrown into the fire? Yet your faith is equal.
No, don't worry. Don't say, "What are we going to eat now?" or "What are we going to drink now?" or "What are we going to wear now?"
People who have no faith run after all these things. Your Father in heaven knows that you need them.
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
No, don't worry about tomorrow. Tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Be fair when you judge others.
Don't judge people, and no one will judge you anymore.
You are judged by the same standards by which you judge others. You are measured by the same measures by which you measure others.
"Look at the speck of dust in your friend's eye, while you ignore the log in your own."
How can you tell your friend: "Let me remove the speck of dust from your eye," when there's a log in your own eye?
"Hey, get ready! Remove the crust from your first eye. Then, you'll clearly see how to remove the crust from your friend's eye."
Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Ask, seek, knock.
Ask, and it will be given to you. Search, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you.
Everyone who asks receives. Everyone who seeks finds. The door opens for those who knock.
Imagine your child asking for bread, who among you would give him a stone?
And do not ask for a whale. Who among you would give him a snake?
Even if you are evil, you know how to give good things to your children. How much more will the one in heaven give good things to those who ask him!
In all things, work with people who you want to do for you. This is written in the scriptures and in the prophets. The great and small gates.
Enter into the kingdom of my Lord through the narrow gate. The gate is wide and the road is broad that leads to death and hell. Many people are walking on this road.
But the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life. Few people find it. A tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets. They come to you wearing sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves.
"You can really know them by their fruits. Do people gather grapes from thorns? Do they pick figs from thistles?"
In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good palm tree can only bear good dates. A bad palm tree can only bear bad dates.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
Every tree is known by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father who is in heaven.
Many will say to me on that day: 'Lord! Lord! Did we not prophesy in your name? Did we not cast out demons in your name? Did we not do many miracles in your name?'
And then I'll tell them plainly, "I've never known you. Stay away from me, you people who do evil!" The wise building and the foolish one.
Mala, whoever hears my words and applies them is like a wise man. He builds his house on rock.
The rain is pouring. Water is rising. The wind is blowing and banging against that house. But it won't fall. It's built on a rock.
But whoever hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
It's raining. Water is coming out. The wind is blowing and banging against that house. And it fell with a loud noise.
Jesus spoke his word to all. The people were amazed at his teaching.
He taught and spoke with authority, not like their Sharia scholars.
Jesus heals a servant with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain, and a large crowd followed him.
One leper came and knelt before Jesus, saying, "Lord, if you choose, you can make me clean."
Jesus reached out and touched the man. He said, "I am willing to do this. Be clean!" Immediately, the man was cured of his leprosy.
And after our Lord Jesus said: "Do not tell anyone, not even a servant. Go and show yourself to the ruler. Present the gift that Moses enjoined. So that you may be a witness against them. A Roman commander with faith.
When Jesus came down to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached Him. The centurion pleaded with Jesus to help him.
My Lord, he said, my servant is lying prostrate at home, unable to move. My family is suffering greatly.
Jesus said, "Let us go and heal him."
The leader replied and said: "Lord, I do not deserve for You to come under my roof. But speak a word, and my servant will be healed."
I am a man of authority. I have gendarmes who obey my orders. I tell one, "Go," and he goes. I tell another, "Come," and he comes. I say to my servant, "Do this," and they do it.
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, no one in Israel has such faith."
We tell you that many people will come from the east and the west and will take their places in the wedding feast of the kingdom of heaven, together with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
But those who are from the kingdom will be thrown out into the darkness. They will cry and gnash their teeth.
Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go! Let it be done just as you believed it would." And his servant was healed at that very hour. Jesus healed many people.
When Jesus came to Peter's house, he found Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Isa took her hand and the warmth went through her. She got up and started taking care of him.
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
They did that to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah had said: "He took our sufferings and carried our diseases." (Isaiah 53:4) To follow Jesus, you must be delivered.
The crowd saw Jesus being followed. He gave instructions to his disciples to go to the other side of Lake Galilee.
And a professor of Islamic law came and I asked him, Professor, we follow you wherever you go.
Jesus said, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
One of those who followed him said, "Lord, let me go and bury my father first."
But Jesus said, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus got into a boat and his disciples followed him.
Suddenly, a strong storm came upon the lake. The waves were crashing against the boat. But our Lord Jesus was asleep.
The students went to get it. They said, "Oh my God! We passed! Let's celebrate!"
Answer, your faith is very small! Why are you so afraid? Then the wind and the waves calmed down, and everything was still.
The disciples were amazed. They asked, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!" Jesus healed two men possessed by demons.
Jesus came to the other side of the lake, to the region of the Gerasenes. There they met two men possessed by demons, coming from the tombs. The men were so violent that no one could pass by.
"Oh son of God, what do you want to do to us?" they shouted. "Have you come here to punish us before the time of reckoning?"
Not far away, two herds of pigs were foraging for food.
The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" And the demons came out of the men and entered the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake and drowned.
The people who had been tending the swine fled and went into the town, and told everything, and what had happened to the demoniacs.
And all the people of the country went out to meet our Lord Jesus. When they saw him, they begged him to leave their land.
Jesus heals a servant who cannot walk.
And Jesus crossed over to the other side on a boat and came to the other side of the lake to the town where he lived.
Jabulon, who couldn't walk, was lying on a mat, and Jesus saw their faith. He said to the man, "Do not be afraid, my child; your sins are forgiven."
Some Islamic scholars said to themselves, "This man is saying something very foolish!"
Jesus knows what you are thinking. So he said, "Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say "Your sins are forgiven" or to say "Get up and walk"?
"We want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he said to the paralyzed man, "Get up, take your mat, and go home."
The man stood up and walked home.
When the people saw this, they were amazed. They praised God for giving such authority to human beings. Jesus chose the moment.
And Jesus walked on from there, and saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. He said to him, "Follow me." And Matthew got up and followed him.
After some time, Jesus was dining at Matthew's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" came and ate with Jesus and his disciples.
The Pharisees saw this. So they asked the disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard what was said and replied, "Those who are well don't need a doctor, but only those who are sick."
Walk and learn what it means to say, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice" (Hosea 6:6). I did not come to gather those who think they are righteous before God to follow me. I came to gather sinners to follow me." Jesus is asked about fasting.
One day the disciples of John came to Jesus and said, "We and the Pharisees fast often. Why don't you teach your disciples to fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridefast mourn while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them and then they will fast."
People don't sew a new patch on old clothes. The new patch will hold the old patch together, making the tear bigger.
People don't pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the wineskins will burst. The wine will spill, and the wineskins will be destroyed. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins. That way, both are preserved." A girl's body and a woman suffering.
While Jesus was speaking, a ruler came up and knelt before him, saying, "My daughter has just died. But come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
Jesus rose and went with him. His disciples also went with him.
At that very moment, a woman came up behind Jesus. She had been bleeding for twelve years. She touched the edge of his cloak.
Inside, she said, "I needed a cat to cuddle. I feel better now."
Jesus turned and saw her. "Daughter," he said, "your faith has healed you." And at that very moment, the woman was healed.
When Jesus entered the ruler's house, he saw the flute players there. And he saw the mourners.
He said, "Go. The child didn't die. She's sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After everyone had gone out, Jesus entered and took the girl by the hand, and she got up.
The news of Prophet Jesus' deeds spread in the region. Prophet Jesus healed two lepers.
And Jesus went on from there, and two blind men followed him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus entered the house, the blind men approached him. They asked, "Do you believe that we can do this?" He answered, "Yes, my lords."
After he had plucked out their eyes, he said, "This is what will happen to you because you did not believe."
They did not see until Jesus warned them, "Be like a tree that no one notices until it bears fruit."
But they went out and spread the news, talking about it throughout the entire region.
As they were going along, they brought to Jesus a man who was demon-possessed and could not speak.
When the devil flew away, the servant spoke. The people were amazed. They said, "We have never seen a servant like him in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons, Beelzebul."
Jesus went through all the cities and villages. He taught in their synagogues, preached the good news of the kingdom, and healed every disease and infirmity.
When he saw the crowds, he had great compassion on them, for they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
"I ask our Lord of the Harvest to send workers for His harvest."
Jesus sent out twelve of his disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
These are the names of the twelve apostles: The first is Simon Peter, and his brother Andrew; James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
After that, Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew, who collected taxes. And two others, James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddeus.
And there were also Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent these twelve disciples with instructions: "Do not go to the Gentiles, and do not enter any town of the Samaritans."
Go to the people of Israel, for they are like lost sheep.
As you go, proclaim this message: 'The kingdom of God is near.'
Heal the sick. Raise the dead. Cleanse those who have leprosy. Drive out demons. Freely you received, freely give.
Do not carry gold, silver, or copper in the pockets of your trousers.
Don't bring a bag on the trip. Don't bring extra stuff, an umbrella, or a cane. Someone might take advantage of it.
When you enter a city or a village, look for someone who wants to welcome you. Stay in this person's house until you leave.
How do you enter a house without disturbing the people living there?
If this house accepts you, greet it and bless it. If it doesn't accept you, don't ask about it and don't bless it.
Some people might not accept you or listen to your words. If they don't accept you, dust off your feet and leave that house or town.
What we're saying is true, and what will happen on the Day of Judgment will be much harder on that village than on Sodom and Gomorrah.
Be wise as serpents and harmless as doves.
Be careful, they will hand you over to the local courts, and they will flog you in their churches.
You shall answer to the judges and kings for my sake, you shall testify against them and the others who are not Jews.
See, when they grab you, don't worry about what you're going to say or how you're going to say it. At that moment, they'll give you the right words to say.
It's not you who will speak. It is your father's spirit that will speak through you.
A brother to betray a brother, to have him killed. A father to betray his son. A son to rise up against his father and let them kill him.
Everyone will hate you because of me. But everyone will eventually turn on each other.
When people attack you in one place, flee to another. What I am telling you now is true. You will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
A student is not better than his teacher, and a servant is not better than his master.
It's enough for the student to be his teacher's friend. And it's enough for the servant to be his master's friend. If the head of the house is called a tyrant, what can others who live with him expect?
Don't be afraid of your enemies. Everything secret will be revealed. Everything hidden will be discovered.
What we say in the dark, say in the light. What is whispered in your ear, shout from the rooftops.
Don't fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear those who can destroy both body and soul in hell.
Two birds aren't sold for a penny? Not even one of them falls except by your knowledge.
Not even your hair is exempt!
So don't be afraid. You're much better than a flock of birds.
And one said in front of people to all who know me, I also say in front of my father in heaven whom I know.
As for those who say in front of others that they don't know me, I say in front of my Father in heaven that I don't know them.
"You think I came to bring peace to the earth? No, I tell you, but to bring a sword."
I came to prevent the children from fighting with their father. Girls should refuse to obey their mothers. Dressed girls should be against dressed mothers.
"A man's foes shall be they of his own household." (Micah 7:6)
No one loves their father or mother more than me, that's not worth anything to me. And no one loves their son or daughter more than me, that's not worth anything to me.
"Anyone who does not carry their cross and follow me cannot be my disciple."
He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for my sake will find it.
Everyone who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. And everyone who welcomes the one who sent me welcomes me as well.
Imagine someone welcoming a prophet as a prophet, that person will receive the reward of a prophet. And imagine someone welcoming a righteous person as a righteous person, that person will receive the reward of a righteous person.
Imagine someone coming to give even a glass of cold water to the children following me. That's what I'm going to tell you is true. That's what will surely earn them a reward.
Jesus and the prophet John
Jesus continued teaching his twelve disciples. Then he went to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Jesus was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
"They came to Jesus and asked him, 'Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?'"
Jesus said, "Go and tell John everything you hear and see.
The blind received their sight. The lame walked. Those with skin diseases were cleansed. The deaf heard. The dead were raised. And the good news of the kingdom was preached to the poor.
"Blessed is he who does not lose his faith because of me."
When the crowds had gone away, Jesus began to speak to the people about John. He said, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
So what did you go to see? Someone dressed in fine clothes? No. Those who wear fine clothes are in the palaces of kings.
"Didn't you see a prophet when you went? I'll tell you, and more than a prophet."
"Behold, I send My messenger before You, who will prepare Your way before You." (Malachi 3:1)
What I am about to tell you is true. No one is more important than John the Baptist, yet even the least important person in the kingdom of heaven is more important than him.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and forceful men lay hold of it.
We all know that the prophets and the scriptures prophesied until John came.
If you're okay with it, John is the Elijah who was supposed to come.
Ear that hears.
What kind of stars can we compare today's people to? They are like small children who stay in the markets and call out to others. They say,
We played the flute for you, but you didn't dance. We sang a funeral song, but you didn't mourn.
When John came, he neither ate nor drank as you do. And the people said, "He has a demon."
But when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?" They also said, "This fellow welcomes sinners and eats with them." The Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to Jesus about his disciples, "Why do you eat and drink wit
Jesus began to denounce the cities where he had done most of his miracles. The people there had not repented of their sins. So he said,
"How severe will the punishment be for you, Korazin! How severe will the punishment be for you, Bethsaida! If the miracles that were performed in your midst had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, wearing sackcloth and sitting in ashes."
As for me, I'll tell you something. On the Day of Judgment, it will be easier for Sur and Sidon than it will be for you.
"And you, Capernaum, what will become of you? You will be brought down to Hades. The works that were done in you, if they had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until today."
"But I'll tell you something. Nader, it's easier to understand you more than you understand yourself." Rest for the weary.
At that moment, Jesus said, "We praise you, Lord. You are the Lord of heaven and earth. You have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children."
Yes, Dad. That's what you like.
Papa gave me everything. Papa is the only one who knows his son. And those who know Papa are his son and the people who love his son, he will inherit them.
"Ajaw lia, ya kullu alladhi mitin wa hamilin athqal kibara, tawa nariyakum." Translation: "Come to me, all you who are weary and carrying heavy burdens, and I will give you rest."
Be my servants and learn from me, for I am humble and free from arrogance. Your souls will find rest.
My work is easy and my burden is light.
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and as his disciples walked along, they began to pick some heads of grain.
The Pharisees saw this and said to Jesus, "Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath."
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him?"
Mala went to the House of God. He and his men finished the sacred bread. It was meant to be eaten by the priests.
Haven't you seen the law? It states that every Saturday, the priests in the temple must perform their service on that day. But they are not considered guilty.
We tell you that what is present here is more important than the structure.
The book says, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) You don't know what this means. If you did, you wouldn't bring charges against innocent people.
The son of man is lord of the Sabbath.
And he remained in their place, Jesus went to their synagogue.
A man with a disabled and crooked hand was there. The Pharisees loved to catch Jesus in a mistake. So they asked him, "Does the law allow us to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
The man is worth more than a sheep! So the law makes us do good on the Sabbath.
And then our master Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand," and he did, and it was restored whole, and it became better than it was before.
But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus, the Lord's chosen servant.
My Father knew all about the Pharisees' plan. So he went elsewhere. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But he warned them not to say who he was.
This is how the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah came to be fulfilled:
He is my servant. I have chosen him. He is the one we love. I am very happy with him. I will put my spirit upon him. He will proclaim to the nations that everything will be made new.
The mouse neither argues nor cries. No one hears his voice in the streets.
He doesn't break a crooked stick. He doesn't blow out a candle that's barely lit. To make everything right again.
"All people will see their hope in him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebul
They brought to Jesus a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute. Jesus healed him, and the man was able to speak and see.
All the people were amazed and said, "Is this the son of David?"
The Pharisees heard this and said, "This man casts out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the prince of demons."
Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. And every city or house divided against itself will not stand."
The devil was casting out the devil, which means he was fighting against himself. So how can his kingdom stand?
You say we chase demons by the power of Beelzebul, but by whose power do your people drive them out? Therefore, it is by the power of Satan that they drive them out.
But if we drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you.
Don't think about it. How can you enter a strong man's house and simply take what he owns? You need to incapacitate him first. Only then can you steal his stuff.
Everyone who is not with me is against me. Everyone who does not gather with me scatters.
This is what I told you. Every sin, and every evil word spoken against God, will be forgiven. But blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
Every sin against the Son of Man can be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either here or in the age to come.
You reap what you sow. A good tree bears good fruit, a bad tree bears bad fruit. You can tell a tree by its fruit.
You snakes! How come you're so good at saying nice things? Your mouths say everything that's in your hearts.
A good man speaks good words. This comes from the goodness within him. A bad man speaks bad words. This comes from the evil within him.
Well, this is what I'm telling you. On the Day of Judgment, people will be held accountable for every reckless word they uttered.
"According to your words, you will be justified or condemned." - The sign of Jonah.
Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem. "Teacher," they said, "we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
The evil and faithless people asked for a sign, but no one will receive a sign except for the sign of the prophet Jonah.
Greece was in the belly of a great whale for three days and three nights. So will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
The queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with the people who are now living. And she will prove them guilty, for she came from a long way off to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And behold, one greater than Solomon is here.
I wonder what happens when an evil spirit leaves a person? It wanders through desolate places, looking for a place to rest. But it doesn't find one.
And then he said, "Let's go back to the house I left." When he got there, he found the house empty. It had been demolished and put in a dump.
"And after that, the discouraged spirit goes and takes with it seven other spirits more discouraged than it. They go and take over their houses. That man becomes worse than before. This is what will happen to the discouraged people of today." - Mary, mother of Jesus, and her sisters.
While Jesus was speaking to the people, his mother and brothers were standing nearby, wanting to speak to him.
So someone told him, "Your mother and sisters are outside. They want to talk to you."
Jesus said, "Who is my mother? Who are my sisters?"
Jesus pointed to his disciples and said, "These are my mother! These are my sisters!
"Everyone does what they love, Papa in heaven, that's my brother or sister or mother."
The Farmer's Tale
That day, Jesus left the house and sat by the side of the Sea of Galilee.
And they enjoyed it, all the people. Then he got into the boat and sat in it. And all the people stood on the shore.
Then he started telling them about many things he uses in his stories. He said, "Once there was a farmer who went out to sow his seeds."
Scattering the "seeds" on the "ground". Some fell on the "path". The birds came and ate the "food".
So love falls in places where there are stones, and where there is a little dirt. Plants grow quickly, because the soil is not deep.
When the sun rose, it burned the plants. They withered because they had no roots.
"What has roots as nobody sees, Is stronger than all the trees, Its strength is the strength of the mountain, The longer it lives, the more sturdy it grows."
And the other grains fell on good soil. And they bore fruit, one hundred, sixty, or thirty times what they sowed.
"He who has ears, let him hear."
Jesus' disciples came to him and said, "Why do you speak to the people in parables?"
Answer, "You have been given an opportunity to understand the secrets of the kingdom of heaven. This is not given to those outside."
Everyone has a certain amount of knowledge, so that more can be given to them. In fact, so that they may have abundance. If anyone does not have a certain knowledge, even the little they have will be taken from them.
This is why I use parables when I speak to the people. I say, "They look, but they do not truly see. They listen, but they do not truly hear or understand."
"You will indeed hear, but not understand, and you will indeed see, but not perceive." - Isaiah 6:9
"The hearts of the people have become callous; they do not listen with their ears, they do not look with their eyes, they do not understand with their hearts. They have become like wood, so that they cannot hear or understand or repent." (Isaiah 6:9-10)
But your eyes, praise be to God, because you saw them, and praise be to God for your ears, because you heard.
What I am about to tell you is true. Many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see, but they did not see it. They longed to hear what you hear, but they did not hear it.
Listen to me! This is the meaning of the farmer's tale.
People hear the message of the kingdom but do not understand it. Then come the children of the devil. They steal what is sown in their hearts. These people are like the seeds that are sown on the path.
Others scoffed when they found a stone, but those who heard the word quickly picked it up with joy.
They are without roots. So, they didn't last long. They quickly fell away from faith when problems and tribulations came because of the message.
Other people have taken the seed that fell among the thorns. These are the ones who hear the word, but the worries of life and the deceit of wealth choke the word, and it does not bear fruit.
But others took the seed and planted it in good soil. These people hear the word and understand it, and they produce a crop 100, 60, or 30 times more than what they planted.
Jesus told another parable to the people, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
But when everyone was asleep, the enemy came. The enemy sowed weeds among the wheat and then left.
The wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
"My master's servants gathered them. They said to him, 'Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? Where did this weed come from?'"
Reply to them, "The enemy did this." The slaves asked him, "Do you want us to go and pull the weeds?"
Answer the man in the house: 'No. As long as you're pulling up the weeds, you might as well pull up the wheat with them.'
Let the two of them grow together until the time of harvest. Then I will tell the reapers what to do. This is what I will tell them: First, gather the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned. Then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn." - Parables of the Mustard Seed and Yeast
Jesus told another parable to the crowds. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. A man took the seed and sowed it in his field."
It is the smallest of all your seeds, but when it grows, it becomes the largest garden plant of all. It becomes a tree. Birds come and nest in its branches.
Jesus told another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount of flour until it worked all through the dough."
Jesus spoke to the people in parables. He did not say anything to them without a parable.
"I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter hidden things, things from of old." (Psalm 78:2) Jesus interprets the parable of the wheat and the tares.
After Jesus had walked through the crowd and gone into the house, his disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
Answer, "It is the Son of Man who sows the good seed.
The world is the field. The seed for good represents those who belong to the kingdom. The thorns represent those who belong to the evil one.
The enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the day of reckoning. And the servants are the angels.
"I trimmed the herbs and burned them in the fire. That's how I make my daily living."
The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers.
They'll throw them into the blazing fire. People will struggle and grind their teeth.
"The people of God shall shine like the sun in the kingdom of Bohemia. And those who have ears to hear, let them hear. Tales of hidden treasure and jewels."
The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and for joy went and sold all that he had and bought that field.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.
He found a very precious pearl. So he went and sold everything he owned. And he bought that pearl. The parable of the pearl.
And again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea, and gathered together of every kind.
When they were fishing, the fishermen pulled it up and brought it to shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in bags, but they threw away the bad fish.
This is how it will be on the Day of Judgment. The angels will come. They will separate the people who did bad things from those who did good things.
They'll throw the evil-eye people into the big cauldron. The evil-eye people will scream and bang their teeth.
Jesus said, "Do you understand all these things?" "Yes," they answered.
He said to them, "Every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure both new and old." A prophet without honor.
Jesus finished telling these stories. Then he left.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth. Jesus began to teach in their synagogue, and the people were amazed. "Where did this man get this wisdom? Where did he get this power to do miracles?" they asked.
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary? Aren't his brothers Alexander, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
What are his sisters up to? Where did this man get such a thing?
They were not pleased at all. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home."
And then a few miracles here because you don't believe.
John the Baptist's head after they chopped it off.
At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard about Jesus.
He said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles."
Herod laid hold of John, bound him, and put him in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother.
John is telling Herod, "It's against the law for you to take her."
Herod wanted to kill John, but he feared the people, for they regarded John as a prophet.
At Herod's birthday banquet, Herodias' daughter danced before Herod and his guests. Herod was greatly pleased with her.
So he gave her a word and promised to give her anything she asked for.
Her mother told her what to say. So the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king is close to losing. But he has thought about his promise to his friends who urged him. So he decided to give them everything they asked for.
Herod had John's head cut off in prison.
They brought a rooster in a large plate and gave it to the girl after she took it to her mother.
John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed five thousand.
Jesus heard what had happened to John. He wanted to be alone. So he got into a boat and went to a quiet place. The people heard about this. They followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus came to the shore, he saw a large crowd. He had compassion on them and healed their sick.
Around dusk, the pupils came to him. They said, "There's nothing here anymore. It's time for them to go. Let them go buy food from the village."
Jesus said, "You do not need them to go. You give them something to eat."
They answered and said, "We have five loaves of bread and two fish."
He said, "Bring them to me."
After Jesus commanded the people to sit down on the grass, he took the five loaves and two fish. He looked up to heaven and gave thanks. He broke the loaves into pieces and gave them to the disciples. The disciples then gave them to the people.
Everyone eats and is full. Students carry 12 bags of waste.
And so about five thousand men were fed. The women and children also ate. Jesus walked on the water.
In a moment, Jesus had the disciples get into the boat. He sent them ahead to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, while he dismissed the crowd.
After sending them away, he went up on a mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.
The beach was very far from Labato. The waves were crashing against it because the wind was blowing in.
Early in the morning, Jesus came to the disciples. He walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and got terrified. "It's a ghost!" they said. And they screamed in fear.
"In the boat, Jesus went to them and said, 'Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.'"
"Lord, is that you?" Peter asked. "It is I," he replied. "Come to me, walking on the water.
Jesus said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat. He walked on the water, going to Jesus.
But when he saw the wind, he was afraid. He began to sink. And he cried out, "Lord, save me!"
Then Jesus reached out his hand and touched him. "Your faith is great," he said, "and your doubts are gone."
How they got to the boat, the wind stopped.
Then those in the boat worshiped Jesus, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God!"
They made the lake and came to Kinsart.
The people who lived there got to know Jesus. So they sent a message in all directions around them. The crowds brought all the sick to Jesus.
They begged him to let the sick just touch the fringe of his garment, and everyone who did was healed.
What makes people "not clean"?
They came to Jerusalem to see Jesus. And they asked,
Why don't your students listen to you when the elders teach them? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!
Jesus answered, "Why do you not do what my Father commands? Your faith is too small!"
The Lord said: "Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) He added: "Whoever curses his father or mother shall be put to death." (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20: Life Life Life Life Life
As for you, let the people say to their parents, "Any help you can get from us is a separate gift to God."
So they don't need to honor their parents with a gift. You make the word of God valueless so that they can follow your teachings.
"You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you. He said,
These people praise me with their words, but their hearts are far from me.
"Your worship means nothing to me if you only follow human laws" (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus called to his disciples and said, "Listen and understand."
What goes into your mouth does not make you unclean. Rather, it is what comes out of your mouth that makes you unclean.
After the disciples came to Jesus and said to him, "Teacher, do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus answered, "It is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth; this defiles a person."
"Leave them alone. The Pharisees are blind guides. If a blind man leads another blind man, both will fall into a pit."
Peter said, "We understand this."
Jesus said to them, "Do you still not understand?"
What's wrong with you? Anything that goes into the mouth goes to the stomach. Then it comes out of the body.
But the words that come out of this mouth come from the heart. These are the things that defile you.
Bad thoughts come from the heart. So does murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. And so does theft, bearing false witness, and lying about others.
"These are the things that make you unclean. Eating without washing your hands does not make you unclean." - Iman, a woman from Canaan.
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
So there was a Canaanite woman who lived near Tyre and Sidon. She came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is severely oppressed by a demon."
Not even a word did Jesus say. This made his disciples come to him. They pleaded, "Send her away. Her constant presence and voice are tormenting us."
Jesus said, "They sent me to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
And after that, she knelt before him and said, "Oh Lord! Help me!"
He replied, "We shouldn't buy their children's bread and throw it to their dogs."
"Yes, my Lord," she said. "Even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
Then Jesus answered, "Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted." And her daughter was healed instantly. Jesus feeds four thousand people.
And Jesus departed from there. He walked by the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up the mountain and sat down.
A large crowd came to him. They brought the blind and those who could not walk. They even brought a mute, who could not speak, and many others. They placed them before him, and he healed them.
People were amazed. The one who did not speak spoke. The broken was repaired. The one who could not walk walked. The blind saw. Therefore, the people praised the Lord of Israel.
After this, Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have great compassion on this crowd. They have been with me for three days now and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."
The pupils answered him, "Not even a thing is available," "Where are we going to find enough bread to feed all these people?"
"How many loaves do you have?" asked Jesus. They answered, "Seven, and a few small fish."
Jesus told the audience to sit on the ground.
"He took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples distributed them to the people."
Everyone ate and was satisfied. Afterwards, the students gathered seven baskets full of leftover pieces.
The number of men who were killed was 4000. Women and children increased the number of casualties.
After Jesus had dismissed the crowds, he went up on the boat. He went to the place near Magdala.
Jesus is asked for a sign from heaven.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
Answer: "On a night, you look at the sky. Then you say, 'It will be good weather. Red sky.'"
In the morning, she says, "Today, there will be a storm. The sky is red and cloudy." She knows the interpretation of what she sees in the sky. But she can't understand the signs of what's happening now.
"For there are evil and treacherous people seeking a sign. But no one will give them any sign except the sign of Jonah." After he said this, he left them and went away. The scent of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
The pupils went to the other side of the lake. They forgot to bring the bread.
Jesus said to them, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
Some of the pupils said to each other, "That's what he means when he says it's not because we brought even a piece of bread with us."
Jesus knew what they were discussing. He said, "Your faith is small. When did you discuss among yourselves about the loaves of bread?"
Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves that fed the five thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets they gathered?
Don't you remember the seven loaves of the four thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets of leftovers were collected?
How could you not understand? I'm not talking about bread. But be careful of the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
No, the disciples understood that Jesus was not rebuking them for the yeast they mixed into the bread. He was warning them about the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter said that Jesus was the Messiah.
Jesus went to a place called Caesarea Philippi. There, he asked his disciples, "What do people say about the Son of Man?"
They answered, "Some say it is John the Baptist. Others say it is Elijah. Still others say it is Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
"What about you?" he asked. "Who do you think I am?"
Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered and said, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in heaven."
This is what I told you. You are Peter. On this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
"I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven. Whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."
After cautioning His disciples not to tell anyone that He was the Christ, Jesus spoke of His coming death.
From that time, Jesus began to explain to his disciples what was going to happen to him. He told them that he had to go to Jerusalem, where he would suffer greatly at the hands of the elders, chief priests, and scribes. He would be killed, and on Sand Sand Sand Sand Sand Sand Sand
Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him, saying, "Lord, this must never happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
After Jesus spoke to his disciples, he said, "If anyone loves me, he must follow me. He must take up his cross and follow me."
He was about to save his soul, but he was about to lose it. But he was losing his life for my sake, to find it.
What's the point of gaining the whole world and losing one's soul? Or what can one exchange for their soul?
The Son of Man is coming in his Father's glory, accompanied by his angels. Then he will reward each person according to their deeds.
What I am telling you now is true. There were some standing here and dying who would not have believed it if they had seen the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
The appearance of Jesus Christ was transformed.
After six days, Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John the son of James. He led them up a high mountain, by themselves.
And there before them his face changed. His face shone like the sun. His clothes became as white as light.
At that moment, Moses and Elijah appeared before them. Moses and Elijah were speaking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, let us make three booths: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
As Peter continued speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them. A voice from the cloud said, "This is my son, and I love him. I am very proud of him. Listen to him!"
The pupils, upon hearing these words, were very frightened. They bowed their heads to the ground.
But Jesus came and rebuked them, saying, "Get up, do not be afraid."
When they lifted up their heads, they saw no one but Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. As they were coming down, Jesus told them what to do. "Don't tell anyone anything you have seen," he said. "Wait until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
The disciples asked him, "Why do the elders of the law say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus answered, "Yes, it is true. Elijah must come and restore all things.
But they cried out, "Crucify him! Crucify him!" And they did not recognize him. They kept on accusing him and shouting, "Crucify him!" And so it was that they crucified the Son of Man.
Truly, the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus heals a boy who had a demon.
As Jesus approached, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him.
He said, "Oh my Lord, have mercy on my son. He is always trembling and shaking, and he suffers a great deal. He always falls into the fire or into the water.
I brought it to your students, but they couldn't see it.
"You hypocrites and evil doers!" Jesus answered. "How long must I bear with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring me the child here."
Jesus commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it did, instantly leaving him.
After the disciples had been sent out, they came to Jesus in private and said, "Why couldn't we cast it out?"
"Because you have so little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
(No
They came together in Galilee. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men.
"They will kill him. And on the third day he will rise again." The disciples were deeply distressed. Jesus pays the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples came to Capernaum. When they entered the house, the collectors of the temple tax came to Peter and said, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
"Yes, it does," he replied. When Peter entered the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "Who do the kings of the earth collect taxes and duties from? From their sons or from others?"
Peter answered, "I have no money." Then Jesus said, "The sons are exempt."
