environmental khoa-tree of Jesus
khoa is a record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
Abraham was the father of Isaac. Isaac was the father of Jacob. Jacob was the father of Judah and his brothers.
Jacob inherited from his uncle the Ammonite. His wife's name was Adrah, and she did not bear him children. He had an Egyptian servant named Potnach. He called on the God of Israel and said, "Show me Your glory." Moses said, "The goods we took are gold, silver, agate, jasper, carnelian, lapis lazuli, and all precious stones. The wood is sandalwood, and the iron is like stone. All the iron goods are iron."
khoa was the father of my mother's uncle. My mother's uncle was the father of Nahshon. And Nahshon was the father of Salmon.
Salmon is the father of Boaz. Rahab is the mother of Boaz. Boaz is the father of Obed. Ruth is the mother of Obed. Obed is the father of Jesse.
And Jesus was the father of David the king. And David was the father of Solomon, whose mother was the wife of Uriah.
khoan was the father of Rehoboam, and Rehoboam was the father of Abijah, and Abijah was the father of Asa.
Jehoshaphat begat Jehoram. Jehoram begat Uzziah.
Uzziah was the father of Jotham. Jotham was the father of Ahaz. Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh, and Manasseh was the father of Amon, and Amon was the father of Josiah.
Jeconiah was born to Jehoiachin and his brothers in the days of the Babylonian captivity.
And the genealogy continued. Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zechariah was the father of Abijah, and Abijah was the father of Azariah.
Azariah the father of Zadok, and Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud.
Let him be the father of Eleazar. Eleazar is the father of Matthan. Matthan is the father of Jacob.
Jacob was the father of Joseph. Joseph was the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Messiah.
So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David. There were fourteen generations from David until the exile to Babylon. And there were fourteen generations from the exile to Babylon until the Messiah, whose name is Jesus Christ.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband, Yusuf, was a pious man. He did not want to put her in an embarrassing position before people. So, he planned to divorce her quietly.
But Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.”
"She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins."
And all this happened to fulfill what the Lord had said would happen. For he had spoken through the prophet,
Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. (Isaiah 7:14) The name "Immanuel" means "God with us."
Joseph woke up. He did as the angel of the Lord commanded him. He took Mary into his home as his wife.
But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son, and he gave him the name Jesus.
The Visit of the Wise Men to Jesus
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in the region of Judea. This happened during the reign of Herod, king of Judea. After the birth of Jesus, wise men from the east arrived in Jerusalem.
They asked, "Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
When Herod heard this, he called together all the chief priests and the scribes of the people, and asked them where the Christ was to be born.
"In Bethlehem in Judea," they answered. "That is what the prophet wrote. He said,
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times."
Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them the exact time the star had appeared.
Send them to Bethlehem. He said, "Go! Search carefully for the child. And when you find him, bring me a report. Then I too can go and worship him."
And when they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.
And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
The Magi went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They knelt and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and offered him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
And God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their country by another way. The flight of Jesus' family into Egypt.
And when the Magi had departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and remain there until I tell you. For Herod is about to seek the child to destroy him."
Joseph arose and, during the night, departed for Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.
They remained there until the death of King Herod. Thus was fulfilled what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, "Out of Egypt I called my son" (Hosea 11:1).
Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him. He was furious and issued orders for Bethlehem and the surrounding area: All boys under the age of two were to be killed. This corresponded to the time when the wise men had seen the star.
In this way, the words spoken by the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled. He said:
"A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning. Rachel weeps for her children, refusing to be comforted because they are no more." (Jeremiah 31:15) The return of Jesus' family to Nazareth.
And after Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
The angel said, "Arise! Take the child and his mother. Go to the land of Israel. Those who were seeking to kill the child are dead."
So Joseph got up, took the child and his mother Mary, and went to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee.
There he lived in a city called Nazareth. So what the prophets said about Jesus came true. They said, "He will be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Repent of your sins! For the kingdom of heaven is near."
John is the person of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke. He said, "A voice cries out in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes were made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
And people came to him from Jerusalem, and from all Judea, and from all the region around the Jordan.
And when they had confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing, and he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Bear fruit in keeping with repentance.
Do not think in your hearts, 'Abraham is our father.' I tell you, God can raise up children for Abraham from these stones.
The axe is already at the roots of the trees. All trees that do not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water, calling you to repent of your sins. But after me will come one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
And his winnowing fork is in his hand to clean the wheat from his threshing floor. He will gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire." The intent of Jesus
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. He wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to prevent him, saying to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you. Why do you come to me?"
Jesus said, "Let it be so now. It is right for us to do this. It fulfills God's holy plan." And John agreed.
And when Jesus was baptized, he went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Jesus' trial
The Spirit led Jesus into the desert, where he was tempted by the devil.
After forty days and forty nights of fasting and not eating, Jesus felt hungry.
The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become loaves of bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'" (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city and set him on the highest point of the temple.
"If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down. For it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you in all your ways. They will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot
Jesus answered him, "It is also written, 'You shall not test the Lord your God.' " (Deuteronomy 6:16)
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
He said, "If you prostrate yourself before me and worship me, I will give you all this."
Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
Then the devil left Jesus. Angels came and attended to him. Jesus began to preach.
John was imprisoned. And when Jesus heard of it, he withdrew into Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth. He went to live in the town of Capernaum, which was on the lake in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
And so was fulfilled what the prophet Isaiah had said:
O land of Zebulun! O land of Naphtali! Galilee, where the Gentiles dwell! Land by the sea! Region beyond the Jordan!
"The people walking in darkness have seen a great light. Those living in a land of deep darkness—on them a light has dawned." (Isaiah 9:1, 2)
From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." And saying, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men." Then Jesus chose the first disciples.
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said, "Come, follow me." "I will make you fishers of men."
Immediately they left their nets and followed him.
And going on from thence, he saw two other brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.
So when they had come out of the boat, the people immediately recognized him and ran about the whole region and carried to him only those who were sick. Wherever he came, into villages or cities or countryside, they laid the sick in the marketplaces and begged him that they might touch even the fringe of his garment. And as many as touched it were made well.
Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom of God, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
And His fame spread throughout all Syria. And they brought to Him all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases and torments, possessed with demons, epileptics, and paralytics; and He healed them.
A large crowd followed him, and people came to him from Galilee, the Ten Towns, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan.
Isa grants blessings.
Jesus saw the crowds. He went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them. He said:
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
"Blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account."
Rejoice and be glad. Your reward is great in heaven. So it was with the prophets who lived long ago. Salt and light.
You are the salt of the earth. But if salt has lost its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
And they do not place a lamp under a vessel, but in its proper place, so that it may give light to all who are in the house.
In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven. Jesus gives the Law its full meaning.
"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished."
What I am about to tell you is true. Heaven and earth will pass away before even the smallest letter of the law passes away. Not even the smallest stroke of a pen will pass from the law until all things are accomplished.
Do not break even one of the least important commandments. And do not teach others to break them. If you do, you will be called the least important in the kingdom of heaven. Rather, practice and teach these commandments. Then, you will be called important in the kingdom of heaven.
To you I say this: You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you are not, you will surely not enter the kingdom of heaven. Murder.
You have heard what was said to the people long ago: 'Do not murder' (Exodus 20:13) - whoever murders will be subject to judgment.'
Here is what I say to you. Do not be angry with your brother. Whoever is angry with his brother is liable to judgment. Again, whoever says to his brother, 'You fool!' is liable to the court. But whoever says, 'You idiot!' is in danger of hellfire.
Suppose you were offering your gift at the altar and there you remembered that your brother had something against you.
Leave your gift there before the altar. First go and be reconciled with your brother, and then come and present your gift.
Suppose someone has a claim against you and takes you to court. Settle the matter quickly. Do it while you are still with him on your way. If you don't, he may hand you over to the judge. The judge may hand you over to the officer. And you may be thrown into prison.
The thing I'm about to tell you is true. You're not leaving until you pay the last penny! Adultery
You have heard that it was said to those of old, "You shall not commit adultery."
But I tell you, anyone who looks at a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
"If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell."
If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you that you should lose one of your members than that your whole body should be thrown into hell.
It is written: "When a man divorces his wife, he must give her a written notice of divorce." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
Again, you have heard what was said to your ancestors long ago: "Do not break the covenant that you made with the Lord. Keep the oaths you swore to him."
But this I say to you: Never make such promises at all. Do not make them in the name of heaven. That is God's throne.
Do not make it in the name of the Earth. That is the footstool of my God. Do not make it in the name of Jerusalem. That is the city of the great King.
Do not swear by your master's name. You cannot make even one hair white or black.
Let "yes" mean "yes." Let "no" mean "no." Anything more comes from the evil one. Be kind to others.
I heard it said, "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
But here is what I say to you: Do not resist evil. "If anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also.
If someone takes you to court for your shirt, let him have your coat as well.
Suppose someone forces you to go one mile with him. Go two miles with him.
Give what is asked of you. Do not turn away from one who wants to borrow from you. Love your enemies.
I heard it said, "Love your neighbor and hate your enemy."
But I say to you, Love your enemies. Pray for those who persecute you.
"Then you will be sons of your Father in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust."
If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Even tax collectors do the same.
When you greet each other, what do you do that is more than others do? Even sinners greet each other.
Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Giving to the needy
Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them; otherwise, you will have no reward with your Father who is in heaven.
When you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets. Do not be like those who pretend to be holy. They proclaim their deeds in the synagogues and on the streets. They want to be honored by others. What I am about to tell you is true. They have received their reward in full.
When you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
Then your good deeds will be in secret, and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. Prayer
When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, who love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by people. Truly I tell you, they have already received their reward.
When you arrive, go to your room, close the door, and pray to your unseen Father. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret.
And when you pray, do not babble as the Gentiles do, for they think that by their many words they will be heard.
Do not be like them. Your Father knows what you need, even before you ask Him.
This is how you should pray: "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth.
Our Lord, give us our daily bread every day.
Forgive us our sins, as we also forgive those who sin against us.
'Deliver us from falling into sin when we are tempted. Save us from the devil.'
Forgive people when they wrong you. If you do, your Father in heaven will forgive you as well.
"If you do not forgive people their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins either." - Fasting
When you go without eating, do not make your faces gloomy like those who pretend to be holy. They make their faces very sad. They want people to think they are fasting. What I am about to tell you is true. They have received their full reward.
But when you fast, do not be gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
So when you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
Instead, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
Your heart will be where your treasure is.
The eye is the lamp of the body. So, if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light.
But suppose your eyes are bad. Then your whole body will be full of darkness. If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money. Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you shall eat or what you shall drink, nor about your body, what you shall put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?
I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you shall eat or what you shall drink; nor about your body, what you shall put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
Can you add even an hour to your life by worrying?
And why do you worry about clothing? Look at the lilies of the field, how they grow. They neither toil nor spin.
But here is what I say to you. Not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of these.
If God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
So do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?'
Those who do not fear God pursue all these things. Your Father in heaven knows that you need them.
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Be fair when you judge others.
Do not judge, so that you may not be judged.
You will be judged by the same standard by which you judge others. You will be measured by the same measure by which you measure others.
You look at the speck in your friend's eye, but you don't notice the log in your own eye.
How do you tell your friend: "Let me get the splinter out of your eye"? How can you say this when you've got a splinter in your own eye?
You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye. Then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your friend's eye.
Do not give what is holy to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Ask, seek, knock.
Ask and you shall receive. Seek and you shall find. Knock and the door will be opened to you.
Let everyone who asks receive. Let everyone who seeks find. Let the door be opened to everyone who knocks.
Let's assume your son asked for bread. Which one of you would give him a stone?
Or what if he asks for a fish? Which one of you would give him a snake?
"Although you are evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!"
In all things, treat others as you would like to be treated. This is what is written in the law and the prophets. The great and small gates.
Enter the Kingdom of God through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, to hell. Many are those who enter through it.
But the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life, and only a few find it. A tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
"You can tell what they really are by what they do. Do people pick grapes from thorns? Do they pluck figs from thistles?"
In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You can distinguish every tree by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?' Then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'
Then I will say to them plainly, 'I never knew you. Depart from me, you evildoers!' The wise and foolish builders.
Therefore, everyone who hears my words and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
It rains. Water rises. The wind blows and strikes that house. But it doesn't fall. It's built on the rock.
But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
It rained. The water rose. The wind blew and struck that house. And a deafening crash ensued.
Jesus ended his discourse with these words. The crowds were amazed by his teaching.
He taught as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain. A large crowd found him.
A man afflicted with leprosy came to Jesus, knelt down before him, and said, "Lord, if you choose to, you can make me clean."
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!" Immediately the man was cleansed of his leprosy.
Then Jesus said to him, "Tell no one. But go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." A Roman centurion believed.
When Jesus entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, pleading with him and saying, "Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, in terrible distress."
"O Lord," he said, "my servant lies at home, paralyzed and in great pain."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
The centurion replied, "Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof; but only say the word, and my servant will be healed.
I myself am a man in authority. I have soldiers who obey my commands. I say to this one, "Go," and he goes. I say to another, "Come," and he comes. I say to my servant, "Do this," and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, "Truly, I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith."
I tell you, many will come from east and west and sit at table with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
But those who think they belong to the kingdom will be thrown outside into the darkness. There, they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go! Let it be done just as you believed it would." And his servant was healed at that very moment. Jesus healed many people.
When Jesus came to Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to wait on him.
In the evening, those possessed by unclean spirits were brought to Jesus, and with a word He drove out the spirits and healed all the sick.
He did it to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah had spoken: "He took our weaknesses and carried our diseases." (Isaiah 53:4) Following Jesus has a cost.
Seeing the crowd around him, Jesus gave them a commandment and instructed his disciples to cross to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
Then a Pharisee came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus said, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me. Let the dead bury their dead." Then Jesus calmed the storm.
Jesus got into the boat. His disciples followed him.
Suddenly, a terrible storm swept across the lake. The waves crashed over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
The pupils went and woke him up. They said, "Our Lord! Save us! We are drowning!"
He answered, "You of little faith, why are you so afraid?" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm.
The disciples were amazed and asked, "Who is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!" Jesus heals two men possessed by demons.
Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake in the region of the Gadarenes. Two men who came out of the tombs met him, possessed by demons. They were so violent that no one could pass that way.
"Son of God, what do you want with us?" they cried. "Have you come to punish us before our time?"
Not far away, a large herd of pigs was feeding.
The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" So the demons came out of the people and went into the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.
Those who were feeding the pigs fled and went into the town, telling everything and what had happened to the possessed man. Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.
Then all the people of the city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk.
Jesus got into a boat, crossed to the other side of the lake, and arrived at his hometown.
Some men brought to him a paralytic, lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
Then some of the scribes in their hearts said, "This man speaks blasphemy!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said, "Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Which is easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven," or "Get up, take your bed and walk"?
"I want you to know," he said to the man, "that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he said to the paralyzed man, "Get up, take your mat and go home."
The man stood up and went home.
When the crowd saw this, they were amazed and praised God, who had given such authority to human beings. Jesus chose that moment.
So Jesus went forth, and saw a man named Matthew sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.
Later, Jesus was dining at Matthew's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" came and ate with Jesus and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick."
"Go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' (Hosea 6:6) I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance." Jesus, when asked about fasting.
One day, the disciples of John came and said to Jesus, "We and the Pharisees fast often. Why do your disciples not fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast."
You don't mend a new garment with old cloth, for the new patch will pull away from the old, making the tear worse.
"People, do not pour new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wineskins will burst, the wine will spill, and the wineskins will be lost. No, each one pours new wine into new wineskins. In this way, both are preserved." A dead girl and a suffering woman.
As Jesus was saying this, a synagogue leader came and knelt before him, saying, "My daughter has just died. But come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
Jesus got up and went with him. So did his disciples.
And when Jesus had passed by, half the multitude followed him, and there was a certain woman which had an issue of blood twelve years, which had
I thought, "I just need to touch his clothes. Then I will be healed.
Jesus turned and saw her. He said, "Woman, your faith is great. Do not weep, for you have been forgiven." At that very moment, the woman was cured of her disease.
When Jesus entered the ruler's house, he saw the flute players there, and the crowd wailing.
He said, "Back away, the girl is not dead, she's sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After the crowd had been led outside, Jesus entered. He took the girl by the hand, and she arose.
News about what Jesus had done spread throughout that whole region. Jesus heals two blind men.
As Jesus passed by, two blind men followed him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus entered the house, the two blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They said to him, "Yes, Lord."
Then he touched their eyes and said, "Your faith has healed you."
They could see again. Jesus warned them sternly: "Make sure that no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news, talking about it throughout the whole region.
As they were leaving, another man who was demon-possessed was brought to Jesus. He was blind and mute.
When the unclean spirit has gone out of a man, he speaks. The multitude is amazed, and says, "Never has anything like this been seen in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons." There were only a few workers.
Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease.
When Jesus saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to His disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few."
"Therefore ask the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his vineyard."
Jesus sends the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
Here are the names of the twelve apostles. The first is Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then James the son of Zebedee and his brother John.
Then come Phillips and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the tax collector. Then James the son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus.
And the others were Simon the Zealot and Judas the Alexandrian. Judas was the one who later betrayed Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent out the twelve and gave them these instructions: "Do not go to Gentile territories," he said. "Do not enter any Samaritan town."
But go to the people of Israel and say to them, You are like sheep that have strayed from the fold.
As you go, make this your motto: "The kingdom of heaven is near."
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. Freely you received, freely give.
Do not carry gold, silver, or copper in your belts.
Don't take a bag for the trip. Don't take extra clothes or sandals or walking sticks. The worker should be given what he needs.
When you enter a city or village, look for someone willing to receive you. Stay in that person's house until you leave.
When you enter a house, greet its people.
If that house welcomes you, bless it with your peace. If not, do not bless it.
"Some people may not welcome you or listen to your words. If they don't, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that house or town."
What I am about to tell you is true. It will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that city.
"Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents, and harmless as doves."
Beware! People will hand you over to the local courts. They will whip you in their temples.
You will be brought before governors and kings because of me, to bear witness to them and to the Gentiles.
But when they arrest you, don't worry about what you'll say or how you'll say it. At that time, you'll be given the right words to say.
It is not you who will be speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.
Brothers will deliver up their brothers to death, and fathers their children, and children will rise against parents and cause them to be put to death.
Everyone will hate you because of me. But whoever endures to the end will be saved.
"When people attack you in one place, flee to another. What I am about to tell you is true. You will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes."
A student is not better than his teacher. A servant is not better than his master.
It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and enough for the servant to be like his master. If the master of the house is called Beelzebul, what will they say about the household?
So do not be afraid of your enemies. Everything that is hidden will be made known. Everything that is secret will be revealed.
What I tell you in the dark, shout from the housetops. What is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father.
He even counts every hair on your head!
So do not fear; you are worth more than many sparrows.
What about someone who says in front of others that he knows me? I too will say in front of my Father in heaven that I know him.
But what about someone who says in front of others that he doesn't know me? I will say in front of my Father in heaven that I don't know him.
Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
I have come to cast the son upon his father, the daughter upon her mother, and the daughter-in-law upon her mother-in-law.
"A man's enemies are the members of his own household." (Micah 7:6)
Whoever loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
"And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me."
Whoever loses his life will find it. Whoever finds his life will lose it.
Whoever receives you receives me. And whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.
Let's assume that someone receives a prophet as a prophet. That person will receive the reward of a prophet. And let's assume that someone receives a righteous person as a righteous person. That person will receive the reward of a righteous person.
"If anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little children who follows me, truly I tell you, that person will certainly not lose their reward."
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus finished teaching his twelve disciples. Then he set out to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard about the deeds of Christ, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked Jesus, "Are you the one who was supposed to come? Or should we look for someone else?"
Jesus said, "Go to John, and tell him what you hear and see.
The blind receive sight. The lame walk. Those with leprosy are cleansed. The deaf hear. The dead are raised to life. And the poor have the good news preached to them.
Blessed are those who do not insist on their faith because of me.
As the disciples of John the Baptist were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John. He said, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A prophet?
If not, what did you go out to see? A man clothed in fine garments? No. Those who wear fine garments are in the palaces of kings.
So, what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
He who was written about in the Holy Book says: "'Behold, I send My messenger, and he will clear the way before Me. And suddenly the Lord whom you seek will come to His temple; and the messenger of the covenant in whom you delight, behold, He is coming,' says the LORD of hosts." (Malachi 3:1)
What I am about to tell you is true. No one is greater than John the Baptist, but the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with power. And the violent take it by force.
Every prophet and every home prophesied until John came.
If you are ready to receive it, John is Elijah who was to come.
Let him who has ears to hear, hear.
What are people today most like? They are like children sitting in the markets, calling out to each other. They say,
We played the flute for you, but you did not dance. And we sang you a sad song, but you did not grieve.
When John came, he neither ate nor drank as you do, and they say, "He has a demon."
But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank, and they say, 'Look at this man! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and "sinners"! ' Those who are wise prove that wisdom is right. The cities that do not repent will perish.
Jesus began to denounce the cities where most of his miracles had been done, because they did not repent of their sins. Therefore he said,
Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
"And what about you, Capernaum? Will you be exalted to heaven? No! You will be brought down to Hades. For if the miracles had been performed in Sodom which were performed in you, it would have remained to this day."
"But I tell you this: It will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you." Comfort for all the weary.
At that time Jesus said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants."
Yes, Father. That's what I wanted.
My Father has handed over everything to me. Only the Father knows the Son, and only the Son knows the Father, and whoever the Son chooses to reveal him to.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Be my servants, and learn from me. For I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
"My service is easy and my burden is light."
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On one of the Sabbath days, Jesus was walking through fields of grain. His disciples were hungry, so they began to pluck some heads of grain and eat them.
The Pharisees saw this and said to Jesus, "Look! It is against the law to do this on the Sabbath. But your disciples are doing it anyway!"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him?
So he entered the house of God, and he and his men ate the sacred bread, which was restricted to the priests only.
Haven't you read the Law? It describes how every Sabbath day the priests in the temple are to do their work on that day, yet they are blameless.
I tell you, there is someone here more important than the temple.
The Bible says, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) You do not understand the meaning of these words. If you did, you would not bring charges against the innocent.
"The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
And leaving that place, Jesus entered their synagogue.
And there was a man there whose hand was withered, and the Pharisees sought occasion against Jesus to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day. So they asked him, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day?"
He said to them, "If one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
"The value of a human being is greater than that of sheep! Therefore, the law allows us to do good on the Sabbath."
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out, and it was restored, just like the other one.
But the Pharisees went out and conspired against Jesus, the chosen servant of God, to kill him.
Jesus knew all the plans of the Pharisees. So he left that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But he warned them not to reveal his identity.
And this was done to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah, who said,
"Here is my servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved in whom my soul delights. I will put my Spirit on him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations."
He will not argue or shout. No one will hear his voice in the streets.
He won't break a bent branch. He won't extinguish a flickering flame. He'll make everything alright.
"The nations shall entreat his name." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebul
A man possessed by demons, who was blind and could not speak, was brought to Jesus. Jesus healed him, and the man was able to speak and see.
And all the people were amazed at the wonderful things he did. They asked, "Is this the Son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man casts out demons only by the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
Jesus knew their thoughts. He said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. And every city or house divided against itself will not stand."
If the devil casts out devils, he is warring against himself. How then shall his kingdom stand?
You say that I cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. But by what power do your people cast them out? Therefore, they will be your judges.
But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you.
Or consider this. How can you enter the house of a strong man and simply take what the man has? You must first bind him. Then you can rob his house.
He who is not with me is against me. He who does not gather with me scatters.
This is what I tell you: Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come."
When the tree is sound, its fruit is sound. When the tree is corrupt, its fruit is corrupt. The shape of the tree is known from its fruit.
O brood of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak any good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
The good man speaks good. This springs from the good that is stored within him. The evil man speaks evil. This springs from the evil that is stored within him.
But I tell you that on the day of judgment people will have to give account for every careless word they speak.
"By your words you will be justified, or condemned." The miraculous mark of Leona.
And some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus. They said, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
He answered and said unto them, "An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas."
And Jonah was in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights. So will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, there is one here greater than Solomon.
What happens when an evil spirit leaves a person? It travels through dry lands searching for a place to rest. But it finds none.
Then you say, "I will return to the house I left behind." And when you arrive, you find the house empty. It has been swept, cleaned, and tidied.
Then the evil spirit goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and dwell there. And the man's final state becomes worse than the first. So will it be also with this evil generation." - Jesus and his brothers
While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.
Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside. They want to talk to you."
Jesus said to him, "Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?"
Jesus pointed to his disciples and said, "Here is my mother! Here are my brothers!"
"Whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother."
The Farmer's Tale
On that very day, Jesus went out from the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
And a great multitude followed him. So he got into a boat and sat in it, and the whole crowd stood on the shore.
Then he told them many things by means of stories. He said: "A farmer went out to sow his seed.
He sowed the seed on the ground. Some of it fell on the path. Birds came and ate it.
Some seeds fell on rocky places, where there was not much soil. The plants grew quickly, because the soil was not deep.
When the sun rose, it scorched the plants. They withered because they had no roots.
Some seeds fell among the thorns. The thorns grew up and choked the plants.
And some seeds fell on fertile ground, and produced a crop a hundred, or sixty, or thirty times as much as was sown.
"Let him who has ears to hear, hear."
And the disciples came and asked him, "Why do you speak to them in parables?"
He answered, "To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given.
And whoever has that knowledge will be given more. In fact, they will have an abundance. If anyone does not have that knowledge, even what little they have will be taken from them.
Here's why I use stories when I talk to people. I say, "They look, but they don't really see. They listen, but they don't really hear or understand."
In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: "You will indeed hear, but never understand; you will indeed see, but never perceive."
"Their hearts are callous. They barely hear with their ears. They close their eyes. Otherwise, they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn to the Lord, who would then heal them." (Isaiah 6:9,10)
But blessed are your eyes, for they see. And blessed are your ears, for they hear.
What I am about to tell you is true. Many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you see. But they didn't see it. They wanted to hear what you hear. But they didn't hear it.
Listen! Here is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message about the kingdom but do not understand it. Then the evil one comes. He steals what was sown in their hearts. Those people are like seed sown on the path.
Others received the seed that fell on rocky ground. These are the ones who hear the word and accept it with joy at once.
But they have no roots, so they do not last long. They fall away quickly when persecution or affliction comes because of the word.
Others received the seed that fell on the path, where those who hear the word, but the worries of this life and the deceit of wealth choke it, preventing it from bearing fruit.
"But some fell on good soil. These are those who, when they hear the word, accept it and produce a crop, one hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was sown." - The Parable of the Sower
Jesus told another parable to the crowds, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field."
But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. The enemy planted weeds among the wheat and then went away.
The wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
The landowner's servants came to him and said, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where did the weeds come from?'
He replied, 'An enemy has done this.' The servants asked, 'Do you want us to go and weed them out?'
The owner replied, 'No, while you are weeding, you may uproot the wheat along with the weeds.'
Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the workers what to do. This is what I will say to them: "First, gather the weeds. Bind them in bundles to be burned. Then gather the wheat. Bring it to my barn." - The Parables of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast
Jesus told the crowd another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. A man took the seed and planted it in his field.
It's the smallest seed of all the seeds you have. But when it grows, it becomes the tallest plant in the garden. It turns into a tree. Birds come and rest on its branches.
"The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a bushel of flour until all the dough had risen."
Jesus spoke these things to the crowd in parables. He did not say anything to them without using a parable.
So, the words spoken by the prophet were fulfilled. He said, "I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter hidden things from the foundation of the world." (Psalm 78:2) Jesus explains the story of the weeds.
Then Jesus left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
He answered, "The one who planted the good seed is the Son of Man.
The field is the world. The good seeds represent the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the evil one.
The enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the day of judgment. The workers are the angels.
Weeds are uprooted and burned in the fire. So it will be at the end of the age.
"And the Son of Man will send His angels, and they will remove from His kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil."
They will be thrown into Hell, where they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then the people of God will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Let anyone with ears listen. Parables of the hidden treasure and the pearl.
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.
He found one of great value. So he went and sold all he had and bought that pearl. The parable of the net.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the lake and caught all kinds of fish.
When they were full, the fishermen pulled them to the shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish in baskets. As for the bad fish, they threw them away.
This is how it will be on the Day of Judgment. The angels will come and separate those who did wrong from those who did right.
The wicked will be thrown into the blazing furnace. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
"Do you understand all these things?" asked Jesus. "Yes," they answered.
He said to them, "Every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure both new and old." A prophet without honor.
Then he left from there.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth. There he began to teach the people in their synagogue. They were amazed. "Where does this man get this wisdom? And where does he get this authority to perform miracles?" they wondered.
Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? And his brothers, James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
Aren't all his sisters with us? So where did this man get all these things?
They were not at all pleased with him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, and among his relatives and in his own home."
Few miracles were wrought there because of their unbelief.
John the Baptist's head was cut off.
At that time Herod the ruler of Galilee and Perea heard reports about Jesus.
He said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles."
King Herod arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison because of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother.
John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have her."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he feared the people, for they believed John to be a prophet.
On Herod's birthday, Herodias' daughter danced for Herod and his guests. He was greatly pleased.
He promised under oath to give her everything she asked for.
Her mother told her what to say. So the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very displeased. However, he thought of his promise and his dinner guests. So, he ordered one of his men to give her what she asked for.
Herod cut off John's head in prison.
His head was brought on a large platter and given to the girl. She then carried it to her mother.
So John's disciples came and took away his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed the five thousand.
Jesus heard what had happened to John. He wanted to be alone. So he went in a boat to a quiet place. The crowds heard about this. They followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus landed on the shore, he saw a large crowd. He felt deep compassion for them. He healed their sick.
And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food.
Jesus said, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat."
They answered, "We have only five loaves and two fish."
He said, "Bring them here to me."
Then Jesus directed the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, and gave thanks. He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, who distributed them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. Then the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of the broken pieces that were left over.
The number of men who ate was about 5000. The women and children ate also. Jesus walked on water.
And immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat, and to go before him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.
And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain alone to pray. When evening had come, he was there alone.
The boat had drifted far from the shore. The waves were tossing it because the wind was blowing against it.
Early in the morning, Jesus came to the disciples. He walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake, and they trembled in fear. "It's a ghost!" they cried. And their screams of terror rose.
So Jesus immediately called out to them: "Take heart, it is I; do not be afraid."
Peter asked, "Lord, are you?" "If you are, command me to come to you on the water."
Jesus said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid and began to sink. He cried out, "Lord, save me!"
And immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and caught him, saying, "O you of little faith!" Then He asked him, "Why did you doubt?"
When they boarded the boat, the wind died down.
Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God!"
They crossed the lake and landed at Gennesaret.
The men who lived there knew Jesus. So they sent a message throughout the nearby countryside. People brought all their sick to Jesus.
They knelt before him, begging him to allow the sick to touch even the edge of his clothes. And everyone who touched him was healed.
What makes people "unclean"?
And there came to him from Jerusalem Pharisees and Sadducees, and began to question him.
Why don't your students obey what the elders teach? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!
Jesus answered, "Why do you not obey the command of God? You prefer to follow your own teachings!"
God said, "Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) He also said, "He who curses his father or his mother shall be put to death." (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9)
But you allow people to say to their parents: "Any help you may have received from us is a gift dedicated to God."
Therefore, they do not need to honor their parents with a gift. You make the word of God of no effect in order to keep your own tradition.
O ye hypocrites! Isaiah was true when he prophesied about you, saying:
"They honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me."
"Their worship means nothing to me. They know nothing but human laws." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand.
What goes into your mouth does not defile you; what comes out of your mouth, that is what defiles you.
Then the disciples came to him. They asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus answered, "There are plants that my Father in heaven did not plant. They will be uprooted."
"Leave them alone. They are blind guides. If a blind person leads another blind person, both will fall into a pit."
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Do you not yet understand?" Jesus asked them.
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes to the stomach. Then it comes out of the body.
But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles a person.
Evil thoughts come from the heart. So do murder, adultery, and all other sexual immoralities. So do theft, bearing false witness, and slandering others.
"These are the things that make you 'unclean'. But eating without washing your hands does not make you 'unclean'." "The faith of a Canaanite woman"
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
And when she passed by Tirza and Sidon, and when she was near Tirza and Sidon, she came to him and cried out, saying, "O my Lord, O son of David, have mercy on me! For my daughter is severely tormented by a demon."
Jesus said not a word. So his disciples came to him. They pleaded, "Send her away. She keeps shouting after us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. They are like lost sheep."
Then the woman knelt before him. "Oh God! Help me!" she said.
He replied, "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to their dogs."
"Yes, Lord," she said, "but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
Then Jesus answered and said, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour. Jesus Feeds the Four Thousand
Jesus left that place. He walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down.
And a great multitude followed him, and he healed there many sick people, and blind, and lame, and withered, and dumb, and many others, and he laid them at his feet, and he healed them.
The people were amazed. Those who could not speak were speaking. The crippled were made well. Those who could not walk were walking. Those who were blind could see. So the people praised the God of Israel.
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have compassion on these people, because they have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."
His disciples answered him, "There is nothing here." And they said, "Where shall we find enough bread to feed so great a multitude?"
Jesus asked, "How many loaves do you have?" They answered, "Seven, and a few small fish."
Jesus told the crowd to sit down on the ground.
He took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and they distributed them to the people.
So they all ate and were satisfied. And the disciples picked up seven baskets of the fragments that were left over.
The number of men who ate was 4000. The women and children also ate.
After Jesus had dismissed the crowds, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
Jesus was asked for a sign or miracle.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a miraculous sign from heaven.
He replied, "In the evening you look at the sky. You say, 'The weather will be good. The sky is red.'
In the morning you say, "Today the weather will be stormy. The sky is red and cloudy." You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you cannot understand the signs of what is happening now.
"Verily, a wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign! But no sign will be given to them except the sign of Jonah." Then Jesus left them and went away. The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
The pupils crossed over to the other side of the lake. They forgot to bring bread with them.
Jesus said to them, "Beware." "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The pupils talked about this among themselves. They said, "He must be saying this because we didn't bring any bread."
Jesus knew what they were saying. He said to them, "Your faith is very small! Why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread?"
Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets of pieces you picked up?
Do you not remember the seven loaves of the 4000? Do you not remember how many baskets of fragments you gathered?
How can you not understand? I was not talking to you about bread. But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not warning them about the leaven used for bread, but was cautioning them about the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter says that Jesus is the Christ.
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "What do people say about the Son of Man?"
They answered, "Some say it is John the Baptist. Others say it is Elijah. Still others say it is Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
"But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say that I am?"
So Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus said, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
I say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
"Behold, I give unto you the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever ye bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."
Then Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. Jesus foretells his imminent death.
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes. He must be killed, and on the third day, be raised from the dead.
Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him. "Never, Lord!" he said. "This shall never happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me."
"For whoever wishes to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it."
What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?
Truly, the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory, with his angels, and will reward each person according to what they have done.
"What I'm about to tell you is true. Some of you standing here will not taste death until you see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."
The appearance of Jesus changed.
And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, and led them up to a high mountain by themselves.
And there before them his form was changed. For his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as light.
And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
As Peter was speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them. A voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!"
When the disciples heard this, they were terrified and fell on their faces to the ground.
But Jesus came and touched them. "Get up," he said. "Don't be afraid."
And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. And as they were going down, Jesus commanded them that they should tell no man what they had seen, till the Son of man was risen from the dead.
His disciples asked him, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus answered, "That is true. Elijah is supposed to come and make everything new again.
But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also will the Son of Man suffer at their hands.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus heals a boy possessed by a demon.
And when they came near to the multitude, a man ran up to Jesus, knelt before him,
"Oh Lord," he said, "have mercy on me for the sake of my son. He trembles violently and suffers greatly. He often falls into the fire or into the water.
"I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him."
"You faithless and evil people!" Jesus answered. "How long must I stay with you? How long must I bear with you? Bring the boy to me here."
Jesus commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it did. He was healed instantly.
Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why couldn't we cast it out?"
He replied, "Because your faith is so small. What I'm about to tell you is true. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, it is enough. You can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."

So they gathered together to Galilee, and Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men."
"They will kill him, and on the third day he will rise from the dead." The disciples were deeply distressed when they heard this. Jesus pays the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. And there the tax collectors came to Peter and asked him, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
"Yes, he does," he replied. When Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "From whom do the kings of the earth collect duties and taxes? From their own children or from others?"
"From others," Peter answered. "Then the children should not pay," Jesus said to him.
But we don't want to anger them. So go to the lake and cast your fishing line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. There you will find the coin you need exactly. Take it and give it to them for our tax and yours.
