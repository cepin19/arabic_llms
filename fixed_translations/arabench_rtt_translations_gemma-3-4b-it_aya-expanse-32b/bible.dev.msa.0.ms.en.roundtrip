There were fourteen generations from Abraham to David. There were fourteen generations from David until the deportation to Babylon. And there were fourteen generations from the deportation to Babylon until the Messiah, whose name is Jesus Christ.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband, Youssef, was a good man. He didn't want to embarrass her in front of people. So, he planned to separate from her quietly.
And when Joseph had thought about this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
You will give birth to a son. You shall name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.
All this happened to fulfill what the Lord had spoken through the prophet,
The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel, which means "God with us."
Joseph awoke. He did as the Lord had commanded him. He took Mary to be his wife.
And he knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name Jesus.
Wise Men visitors of Jesus
John was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the reign of King Herod. After John's birth, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
They asked, "Where is the child who has been born to be king of the Israelites? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard the news, he was greatly troubled. Everyone in Jerusalem was also disturbed.
So Herod summoned the chief priests and the scribes of the people, and asked them where the Christ was to be born.
In Bethlehem in Judah, they answered. "This is what the prophet wrote. He said,"
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times."
Then Herod called the wise men secretly, and learned from them exactly when the star had appeared.
Send them to Bethlehem. He said, "Go! Search carefully for the child. And when you find him, bring me a report. Then I too can go and worship him."
After the wise men had listened to the king, they set out on their way. The star they had seen in the east went ahead of them. Finally, it stopped over the place where the child was born.
When they saw the star, they were filled with joy.
The wise men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They bowed down to him and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and offered him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their country by another road. The family of Jesus flees to Egypt.
When the wise men had departed, Joseph had a dream. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him. The angel said, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you to return, for Herod will seek the child to kill him."
Joseph awoke. During the night, he departed for Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.
They remained there until King Herod died. Thus was fulfilled what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, "Out of Egypt I called my son" (Hosea 11:1).
Hercules realized that the wise men had tricked him. He became very angry and issued orders regarding Bethlehem and its surroundings. All children under the age of two were to be killed. This corresponded to the time when the wise men had seen the star.
In this way, the words spoken by the prophet Yeremiah were fulfilled. He said:
A voice is heard in Ramah, wailing and great mourning. Rachel weeps for her children; she refuses to be comforted, because they are no more. The family of Jesus returns to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise! Take the child and his mother. Go to the land of Israel. Mother, those who were trying to kill the child are dead."
So Joseph got up, took the child and his mother Mary, and went to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was king of Judea in the place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And having been warned in a dream, he went to the lands of Galilee instead.
He lived there in a city called Nazareth. So what the prophets said about him was true. They said, "And his name will be called Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
At that time, John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Repent from your evil deeds! The kingdom of heaven is near."
John is the one of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke. He said, "A voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes were made of sheep's wool. He wore a leather belt around his waist. His food was summer worms and wild honey.
People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea, and from the region along the Jordan.
When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River with water from the Sea of Galilee.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the place where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.
Do not think that you can say to yourselves, "We have Abraham as our father." I tell you that God can raise up children for Abraham from these stones.
The shovel is already thrown at the roots of the trees. Any tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down. And it will be thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water, calling you to repent of your sins. But after me will come one more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
He carries his stick to clean the chaff from his ground at harvest. He will gather the wheat into the place appointed for its storage. But he will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire. Jesus is being purified.
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. He wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to prevent him. Jesus said, "I must be baptized by you. Why do you come to me?"
Jesus answered, "So it must be. It is our right to do this. It fulfills God's holy plan." And John agreed.
As soon as Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment, the sky opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Jesus is tested.
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert, and there he was tempted by the devil.
After forty days and forty nights without food, Jesus was hungry.
The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, turn these stones into bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city and set him on the highest point of the temple.
He said, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you,' and 'On their hands they will bear you up, so that you do not strike your foot against a stone.'" (Psalm 91:11, 12)
Jesus answered, "It is also written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain. He showed him the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
He said, "If you worship and serve me, I will grant you all this."
Jesus said, "Get away from me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Matthew 4:10)
Then the devil left Jesus. Angels came and attended to him. Jesus began to preach.
John was put in prison. When Jesus heard of it, he withdrew to Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and went to live in the town of Capernaum, which was on the lake in the region of Zebulun and Naphali.
In this way, the words spoken by Isaiah were fulfilled. He said:
Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where the Gentiles dwell! Land by the Mediterranean Sea! Region beyond the Jordan River!
The people who now live in darkness will see a great light. They live now in a very dark land. But a light will shine upon them.
From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, "Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." He chose the first apostles.
One day, Jesus was walking along the shore of Lake Galilee. There he saw two men, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
Come, follow me, said Jesus. "I will make you fishers of men."
So they rowed all night, and at daybreak they saw the land; but they were unable to make the shore, and so they dropped anchor and waited for the wind.
Then he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. Jesus called them,
Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed Jesus. Jesus healed the sick.
Jesus went everywhere in Galilee. He taught in the synagogues and preached the good news about the Kingdom of God. And he healed every disease and sickness among the people.
The news about him spread throughout Syria. People brought to him all who were sick, those suffering from various diseases. Some were in great pain, others were possessed by demons. Some were violently shaking, others could not move at all. Jesus healed them all.
Large crowds followed him. Some people came from Galilee, and from the region known as the Ten Cities, and from Jerusalem and Judea, and others from the region across the Jordan.
Jesus grants blessings.
Jesus saw the crowds, went up the mountain, and sat down. His disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them. He said,
"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
The most honorable people are those who feel sorrow. They will be rewarded.
Honor the people of humility. He will grant them the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
God blesses their pure hearts, for they see God.
"They will be called children of God."
Blessed are those who suffer for doing right. The kingdom of heaven is theirs.
"Blessed are you when people mock you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account."
Be happy and joyful. Your reward in Heaven is great. Likewise, people harm the prophets who lived long ago. Salt and light.
You are the owner of this land. But if salt has lost its saltiness, how can it become salty again? It is no longer good for anything. It will be thrown out. People will walk on it.
You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
Likewise, people do not light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead, they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.
Likewise, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven. Jesus gives the complete story of the law.
Do not think that I have come to abolish what is written in the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish these things but to fulfill them.
What I am about to say is the truth. The heavens and the earth will vanish before the smallest letter of the law vanishes. Not even the slightest stroke of a pen from the law will disappear until everything is fulfilled.
Do not break or disregard even the smallest command. Do not teach others to break them either. If you do, you will be called the least important person in the kingdom of heaven. But if you keep these commands and teach them, you will be called important in the kingdom of heaven.
This is what I tell you. You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and teachers. If you are not, you will surely not enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Murder.
You have heard what was said to those of ancient times, "You shall not murder." (Exodus 20:13) For everyone who murders will be accountable.
But I say to you, do not be angry with your brother. Whoever is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment. And whoever says to his brother, 'Raka,' will be answerable to the Sanhedrin. But whoever says, 'You fool!' will be liable to the fire of Gehenna.
If you are presenting your offerings on the altar of the church, and remember that your brother has something against you.
Leave your gift there before the altar. First, go and be reconciled with your brother; then come and offer your gift.
If someone is demanding and suing you, settle the matter quickly. Do it while you are still on your way with him. Otherwise, it may get into the hands of the judge. The judge may get it into the hands of the officer. And you may be thrown into prison.
What I'm about to tell you is the truth. You're not leaving until you pay the last cent! Adultery.
You have heard that it was said, "Do not commit adultery." (Matthew 20:14)
But I tell you, anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. Your eye is just one part of your body. It is better to lose it than to have your whole body thrown into hell.
If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. Your hand is one part of your body. It is better for you to lose one part than for your whole body to go into hell. Divorce.
It was said: "If a man sleeps with a woman and then sends her back to her husband, he shall not be judged for having lain with her. And if you desire her for yourself, he shall not be judged for having lain with her, and if you write her a bill of divorce, he shall hand it to her." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
But that's not what I'm telling you. Everyone who divorces his wife causes her to commit adultery, and everyone who marries a divorced woman causes her to commit adultery. It is permissible for a man to divorce his wife if she is not faithful to him. I swear.
Again, you have heard what was said to your forefathers: "Do not break the covenant that you made with God. Keep the oath that you swore to Him."
But this I say to you: Make no such promises at all. Make them not in the name of heaven. That is God's throne.
Do not create them in the name of the earth. That is the platform for God's foot. Do not create them in the name of Jerusalem. It is the city of the greatest King.
And do not make your oaths by your heads, for you cannot make a white hair or a black hair.
Let your 'yes' mean 'yes', and your 'no' mean 'no'. Anything more than that is from the devil. Be kind to others.
You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
But this is what I tell you: Do not resist an evil person. "If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek to them as well."
If someone takes you to court to take your shirt, let them also take your coat.
If they force you to walk one mile, walk two miles with them.
Give to those who ask of you. Do not turn your back on those who want to borrow from you. Love your enemies.
You have heard that it was said, "Love your neighbor" (Deuteronomy 19:18) "and hate your enemy."
But here is what I tell you: Love your enemy. Pray for those who harm you.
So you will be sons of your Father in heaven. "He makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous."
If they love those who love you, what portion will you get? Even zakat they take this way.
If you only take leave of your people, you do no more than others, even those who do not fear Allah.
Be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.
Assisting the needy
Beware of doing good deeds in front of people. Don't do them to be seen. Otherwise, your Father in heaven will not reward you.
When you give to the poor and needy, do not boast about it by sounding trumpets. Do not be like those who pretend to be pious, for they boast of their deeds in churches and on the streets, seeking to be honored by people. What I say to you is true. They have received their reward in full.
When you give to the poor, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
Then your donation will be secretly honored. Your father will reward you. He sees what you do in secret. And prayer.
When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, who love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
When you pray, go to your room. Close the door and pray to your Father who is unseen. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret.
When you pray, do not babble as the Gentiles do, for they think that by their many words they will be heard.
Don't be like them. Your father knows what you need even before you ask him.
"This is the way you should pray: 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name."
"O Lord, destroy Your kingdom. O Lord, grant what is desired on earth as it is in heaven."
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we have forgiven those who wronged us.
Save us from falling into sin when desire is kindled within us. And help us against the temptations of the devil.
Forgive people if they wrong you. And if you forgive, your Lord in the heavens will also forgive you.
But if you do not forgive others their offenses, neither will your Father forgive you your offenses. Fasting.
When you give up eating, do not make your face gloomy like those who pretend to be pious. They make their faces very sad, wanting to show people that they are fasting. What I am about to tell you is true. They have received their full reward.
But when you stop eating, put olive oil on your head. Wash your face.
Then do not let others know that you are fasting. It is only your Lord, who is unseen, that knows it. He will reward you. Your Lord sees what is done in secret. Place your treasures in heaven.
Do not let your wealth become stagnant on the earth. Vermin and rust destroy it, and thieves may break in and steal it.
Instead, store up your treasures in heaven. There, no moth or rust destroys, and no thieves break in and steal.
Your heart will be where your treasures are.
The eye is like a lamp for the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light.
But if your eye is unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness. And if the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. Either he will hate one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not worry.
I tell you, do not worry. Do not worry about your life, what you will eat and drink; nor about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
Look at the birds of the sky. They do not sow or reap, nor do they store the harvest in barns, but your Lord in heaven provides for them. Are you not better off than they are?
Can you add an hour to your life by worrying?
"And do not underestimate the cold, look at how the velvet pillows are planted, they neither work nor is the covering maintained."
But here's what I say to you: Not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of these.
If God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
Don't worry. Don't say, "What will we eat?" or "What will we drink?" or "What will we wear?"
People who have no fear aspire to all those things. Your Lord in heaven knows that you need them.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
Do not worry about tomorrow. Tomorrow will take care of itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Be fair when judging others.
Do not judge people. Unless you judge yourselves.
You will be judged as you judge others. You will be measured as you measure others.
You notice the small piece of wood in your friend's eye. But you pay no attention to the piece of wood in your own eye.
How do you tell your friend: "Let me get the splinter out of your eye," while you've got a log in your own eye?
You're delusional! First, remove the beam from your own eye. Then you'll be able to see clearly to remove the speck of dust from your friend's eye.
Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.
Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you.
He who asks gets. He who seeks finds. The door opens for him who knocks.
If your son asks you about bread, between the two of you, who will give him a stone?
Or if he asked for a fish, would any of you give him a snake?
Despite your evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will the gifts of your Father who is in heaven be to those who ask Him!
In all things, treat people as you would like to be treated. This is what is written in the law and the prophets. The great and small gates.
Enter the kingdom of God through the narrow gate. The gate is wide and the broad way that leads to death and hell is a path many walk on.
But the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and only a few find it. A tree and its fruit.
Beware of false Nazarenes. They come to you pretending to be sheep. But inside they are ravenous wolves.
You can tell what they really are by what they do. "Do people pick grapes from thorns? Do they gather figs from thistles?"
Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree does not bear bad fruit, and a bad tree does not bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You can distinguish every tree by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father who is in heaven.
A stern group will say to me on that day, "Our Lord, our Lord, we were not created except for You, and we did not submit except to You. So what kept us from recognizing You except for misguidance and a life spent in vain pursuits?"
Then I will say to them plainly, "I never knew you. Depart from me, you evildoers!" The wise builder and the simple.
Well, everyone who hears my words and puts them into practice is like a wise man. He builds his house on the rock.
The rains pour down. The waters rise. The winds howl and beat against that house. But it does not fall. It is built on the rock.
But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
Here is the rain pouring down. The water is rising. The wind is blowing and striking that house. And it lets out a loud crash.
Jesus finished saying all these things, and the crowds were amazed at his teaching.
He taught as one having authority, and not as their scribes.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mount of transfiguration. A large crowd followed him.
A man with a skin disease came to him and knelt down before Jesus. He said, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."
Jesus touched the man's hand and said, "I am willing; be cleansed!" And immediately the man was cleansed of his disease.
Then Jesus said to him, "Tell no one. Go, show yourself to the priests, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." A Roman officer believes.
When Jesus entered Capernaum, a Roman official came to him and pleaded with him to help his servant.
"O Lord," he said, "my servant is lying at home, paralyzed and in great distress."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
The centurion answered, "Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof, but only say the word, and my servant will be healed."
I myself am a man of command. I have soldiers who obey my orders. I say to this one, "Go," and he goes. I say to that one, "Come," and he comes. I say to my servants, "Do this," and they do it.
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed. He said to those who were following him, "What I'm about to tell you is the truth. I have not found anyone in Israel with faith as strong as this."
I tell you, many will come from east and west and take their seats at the feast in the kingdom of heaven. They will drive out the enemies and occupy their places. Then the last will be first, and the first will be last.
But those who believe they are of the kingdom will be cast out into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Then Jesus said to the Roman, "Go! It will be done as you believed." And in that very hour, Jesus healed many people.
When Jesus entered Simon's house, he saw Sonia's mother. She was lying in bed, suffering from a fever.
When Jesus touched her hand, her fever left her. And she got up and began to serve him.
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
He did this to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: "He took up our infirmities and carried our diseases." (Isaiah 53:4) The cost of following Jesus.
Jesus saw the crowds surrounding him. He ordered his disciples to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
Then a teacher of the law came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
The other said, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."
And Jesus went up to him and said, "Follow me." "Let the multitudes take up their dead bodies." Then Jesus came to the sea of Galilee, and a great wind stirred up the sea, so that the sea was rough.
Jesus entered a boat. His followers followed him.
Suddenly, a severe storm arose on the lake. The waves overwhelmed the boats. But Jesus was sleeping.
The pupils sat up and rose. They said, "Lord! We believe! We are on the point of drowning!"
He answered, "You of little faith! Why are you so afraid?" Then Jesus got up and commanded the winds and the waves, and they ceased. The sea became calm.
The disciples were amazed. They asked, "Who is this man? Even the winds and waves obey him!" Jesus healed two demon-possessed men.
Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake in the region of the Gadarenes. Two men possessed by demons met him. They had come out of the tombs. These men were so violent that no one could pass that way.
"Son of God, what do you want with us?" they cried. "Have you come to bring us punishment before our time of reckoning?"
Not far away, a large group of pigs were eating.
The demons begged Jesus, saying, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" And the demons came out of the men and entered the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.
Those who were tending the pigs fled. They went into the town and reported everything, including what had happened to the men who had been possessed by the demons.
So the people of the town came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they begged him to leave their village.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk.
Jesus got into a boat, crossed to the other side of the lake, and arrived at his hometown.
Some men came to him, carrying a paralyzed man on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
Then some of the teachers of the law said to themselves, "This man is blaspheming!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said, "Why do you have evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Rise and walk"?
I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. Then he said to the man who could not walk, "Get up, take your mat and go to your house."
The man stood up and entered his house.
When the horse saw this, they were filled with wonder. They praised God for a blessing that is among the greatest He has given to humanity. Jesus chooses Matthew.
As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he told him. And Matthew got up and followed him.
Later, Jesus was dining at the home of Matthew. Many tax collectors and "sinners" came to him and ate with him and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
Jesus heard this and said, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick."
Go and learn what this means: "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance. Jesus is asked about fasting.
One day, the disciples of Jesus came to him and said, "The Pharisees and we fast, why do your disciples not fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
People do not stick a new piece of cloth on old clothes. This new piece will tear off from the old clothes, making the tear worse.
New wine is not poured into old wineskins. If it is, the wineskins will burst, the wine will spill, and the wineskins will be ruined. No, new wine is poured into new wineskins, and both are preserved. A dead woman and a tormented woman.
As Jesus was saying this, a man came up, knelt down before him, and said, "My daughter has just died. But come and lay your hand on her, and she will live again."
Jesus rose and followed them, and so did his disciples.
Suddenly, a woman came up behind Jesus. She had been suffering from a discharge of blood for twelve years. She touched the edge of his garment.
I thought: "All I have to do is touch his clothes. Then I will be healed."
Jesus turned and saw her. He said, "Woman, do not weep." "Your faith has healed you." The woman was healed at that moment.
When Jesus entered the ruler's house, he saw the flute players there. And he saw the mourning crowd.
He said, "Go away. The girl is not dead. She is sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After the crowd had been sent away, Jesus entered. He took the girl by the hand, and she arose.
News about what Jesus had done spread all over that region. Jesus heals two blind men.
As Jesus was going on from there, two blind men followed him, shouting, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus went indoors, the mute came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I can do this?" They said, "Yes, Lord."
Then he touched their eyes. He said, "May your belief bring you healing."
Now they could see again. Jesus sternly warned them, "Make sure that no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They talked about it everywhere in that region.
As they were leaving, another man who was demon-possessed was brought to Jesus. He was blind and mute.
When the demon was cast out, the man spoke. The people were amazed. They said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons." There are few workers.
Jesus went through all the cities and villages. He taught in their synagogues, and preached the gospel of the kingdom of God. And he healed every disease and every affliction.
When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, for they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
So ask the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.
Jesus sending out the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
These are the names of the twelve apostles. The first is Simon, son of John, and his brother Andrew. Then comes John, son of Zechariah, and his brother John.
Then come Philip and Peter, and Thomas and Matthew the publican. There is also James, the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus.
The last one is Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas Iscariot is the one who will later hand Jesus over to his enemies.
Jesus sent out the twelve with these instructions: "Do not go among the Gentiles," he said. "Do not enter any town of the Samaritans."
Instead, turn to the people of Israel. They are like lost flocks.
As you walk, proclaim this message: "The kingdom of heaven is near."
Heal the sick. Raise the dead. Cleanse those who have leprosy. Drive out demons. You received without paying; give without being paid.
Do not take with you gold or silver or copper in your belts.
Don't pack a bag for the trip. Don't take extra clothes, shoes, or a walking stick. The worker should be provided with what he needs.
When you enter a city or village, look for someone willing to host you. Stay in that person's home until you leave.
When you enter the house, welcome to its inhabitants.
If that house welcomes you, bless it with peace. If it does not welcome you, do not bless it.
Some people may not welcome you or listen to your words. If they don't, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that house or town.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. It will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that city.
I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.
Beware! They will hand you over to the local courts. They will flog you in their homes.
You will be gathered before the wise and the princes because of a slanderer. And you will testify against them and those who are not Jews.
But when they arrest you, don't worry about what you'll say or how you'll say it. At that time, you'll be given the right words to say.
You will not speak. Your father's spirit will speak through him.
Brothers will hand over brothers to be killed. Fathers will hand over their sons. Sons will rise up against their fathers and be killed.
Everyone will love you out of hatred for me. But whoever endures to the end will be saved.
When people attack you in one place, flee to another. What I am about to tell you is the truth. You will not finish your journey through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
A student is not preferred over his teacher, and a servant is not preferred over his master.
It is enough for the student to be like his teacher. And it is enough for slaves to be like their masters. If the head of the house is called Beelzebub, what can the others who live in it expect?
Do not fear your enemies. For everything that is secret will be revealed, and everything that is hidden will be exposed.
What you say in the dark, speak in the light. What is whispered in your ear, shout from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Doesn't Sherut tell you that eight birds are sold for one drachma, but not one of them falls to the ground without your father's knowledge?
And he even counts every hair on your head!
Do not be afraid. You are worth more than many birds.
What about those who claim to know me before people? I will also say before my Father in heaven that I know him.
But what about those who claim in front of people that they don't know me? I will say before my Father in heaven that he does not know him.
Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
I have come to set a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law, and your enemies will be those of your own household.
The man's enemies will be from his own family.
He who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. And he who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for my sake will find it.
Whoever has mercy on you, has mercy on me. And whoever has mercy on me, has mercy on the One who sent me.
If one welcomes a prophet like a prophet, they will receive the reward of a prophet. And if one welcomes a righteous person like a righteous person, they will receive the reward of a righteous person.
If anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones who follows me, truly I tell you, that person will certainly be rewarded.
Jesus and John the Prophet
Jesus completed his training of his twelve disciples. Then he began teaching and preaching in the cities of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked Jesus, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?"
Jesus answered, "Go back and tell John what you have heard and seen."
Sight is given to the blind, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor.
Honor those of faith who neither waver nor abandon their belief because of me.
As John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John. He said, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
If not, what did he go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No. Those who wear fine clothes stand in the palaces of kings.
Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
He who was spoken of in the holy books. It is said, "I will send my messenger before you, to prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
What I am about to tell you is the truth. No one greater than John the Baptist has ever been born, but the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
Since the days of John the Baptist, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and forceful people have been seizing it.
The prophets and the law spoke by inspiration until John came.
If you are ready to receive it, John is the Elijah who was to come.
Whoever listens, let him listen.
What can I compare people to today? They are like children sitting in the markets, shouting at others, saying,
We played a tune for you on the flute, but you did not dance. We sang a dirge, but you did not mourn.
When John came, he neither ate nor drank as you do. And people say, "He is bewitched."
When the Son of Man came, he ate and drank, and they said, "Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!" But wisdom is justified by her deeds. Cities that do not reject sin
Jesus began to denounce the cities where most of his miracles had been performed, because they did not repent of their sins. He said:
How severe will be your punishment, Korazin! How severe will be your punishment, Bethsaida! For if the miracles had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
But I tell you this: It will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
And what about you, Capernaum? Will you be lifted up to heaven? No! You will be brought down to the realm of the dead. If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre, it would have remained until this day.
But I say to you this. On the day of reckoning, it will be easier for Tyre and Sidon than for you. Repent, all of you, for the kingdom of heaven has drawn near.
At that time Jesus said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants."
Yes, Father. This is what you wanted.
My father gave me everything. A father is the only teacher of a son. The only ones who teach the father are the son and those the son has chosen to introduce to him.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Be my servants and learn from me. I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
My service is easy, and my downloads are light.
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On one of the Sabbath days, Jesus was walking through wheat fields. His disciples were hungry, so they began to break off some heads of wheat and eat them.
The Pharisees saw this and said to the Lord Jesus, "Look! This is against the law on the Sabbath. Yet your disciples do it anyway!"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry?"
So he entered the house of God, and he and his companion ate the sacred bread, which was only allowed to be eaten by the priests.
Haven't you read the law? It explains how the priests in the temple are obligated to perform their duties on that day every Sabbath. But they are not considered guilty.
I tell you, someone greater than the temple is here.
The Bible says: "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) You do not know the meaning of these words. If you did, you would not sue the innocent.
The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.
Then Jesus went to their synagogue.
There was a man with a weak and withered hand. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take it and lift it out?"
Man is more valuable than sheep! Therefore, the law allows us to do good on the Sabbath.
Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out, and it was restored, just like the other hand.
But the Pharisees were compelled to go out, and planned to kill Jesus. Abdullah Al-Mukhtar
Jesus knew what the Pharisees were planning. He left that place, and a crowd followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But he warned them not to reveal his identity.
This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah:
This is my servant. I have chosen him. He is the one I love. I am very pleased with him. I will stake my life on him. And he will perish for the homeland that everything will be alright.
He will not argue or shout. No one will hear him in the streets.
He will not break a bruised reed. He will not quench a faintly burning wick. He will faithfully bring justice.
Nations will put their hope in him. Jesus and Beelzebub.
A man possessed by demons was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Then the man was able to speak and see again.
Everyone was amazed. They said, "Is this the Son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man casts out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the prince of demons."
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand."
If a demon casts out a demon, it is fighting itself. How then can its kingdom stand?
You say that I cast out devils by Beelzebub's power. But by what power does your people cast them out? Therefore, they will be your judges.
But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God has come to you.
Or think about it. How can you enter a strong man's house and take what he owns? You must first tie him up. Then you can plunder his house.
He who is not with me is against me. And he who does not gather the sheep with me scatters them.
This is what I tell you: Every sin and every evil spoken against God will be forgiven. But speaking against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Whoever blasphemes against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. Indeed, such a person will not be forgiven in this age or in the age to come."
If you do good to a tree, its fruit will be good. If you do evil to a tree, its fruit will be evil. You can tell a tree by its fruit.
O brood of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
A good companion says what is pleasant. Indeed, that is from the good that has been gathered in his very being. A bad companion says what is harmful. Indeed, that is from the evil that has been gathered in his very being.
But this is what I say to you. On the Day of Judgment, people will have to account for every idle word they have whispered.
By your words you will be condemned or acquitted. The wonderful sign of Jonah.
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus and said, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
He replied, "The corrupt and disobedient nation asks for a wondrous sign! But they will only be given the sign of Jonah, peace be upon him."
John was in the belly of a huge whale for three days and three nights. Something like this will happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the grave.
The men of Nineveh will stand in the day of judgment with the people who live today. And the men of Nineveh will refute that these people are guilty. The men of Nineveh repented of their sins when Jonah preached to them. And now, one greater than Jonah has come.
The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with the men of the earth, and will condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
What happens when a demon comes out of a man? It wanders through barren places seeking a resting place, but it finds none.
He then says, "I will return to the house I left." When he arrives there, he finds the house empty. The house has been completely cleaned and tidied.
Then the evil spirit goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself. They enter and make their home there, and the man's final state is worse than the first. So it will be with this evil generation.
While Jesus was still speaking to the multitudes, his mother and brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to him.
Someone told him, "Your mother and brother are outside. They want to talk to you."
In answer, Jesus said, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus saw his disciples. He said, "Behold, my mother and my brothers!"
Whoever does what my Father wants in heaven, they are my brothers and sisters and mother.
The Farmer's Tale
On the same day, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea of Galilee.
A large crowd gathered around him, so he dove into a boat. He lay inside while everyone stood on the shore.
Then he told them many things based on stories. He said, "A farmer went out to sow his seeds."
He threw the seeds on the ground. Some fell on the path. Birds came and ate them.
Some seeds fell on rocky places, where there was not much soil. The plants grew quickly, because the soil was not deep.
When the sun rose, it scorched the plants. They withered because they had no roots.
Some seeds fell among the weeds. The weeds grew up and choked the plants.
And some seeds fell on good soil, and grew up, and produced a crop a hundredfold, or sixtyfold, or thirtyfold.
Whoever listens, let him listen.
The pupils came to him. They asked him, "Why do you use parables when you speak to people?"
He answered and said, "It has been given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given."
He who has this kind of knowledge will be given more. Indeed, he will be given abundant. But he who does not have this kind of knowledge will even lose what little he has.
This is why I use stories when I talk to people. I say, "They look, but they don't really see. And they listen, but they don't really understand or hear."
These words are embodied in the prophecy of Isaiah. He said, "You will hear, but not understand. You will see, but not know what you see."
These people have closed their hearts. They can barely hear with their ears. They have shut their eyes. Otherwise, they would see with their eyes, hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts. And they would call upon their Lord, who would then heal them.
But blessed are your eyes, for they see. And cursed are your ears, for they hear.
What I am about to mention is a fact. Many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you see, but they didn't see. They wanted to hear what you hear, but they didn't hear.
Listen! This is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message about the kingdom, but they do not understand it. Then comes the devil. He steals what was sown in their hearts. These people are like the seed that was sown on the path.
Some received the seed that fell on rocky places. These are the ones who hear the message and immediately receive it with joy.
But they have no roots. Therefore, they do not last long. For as soon as they encounter tribulation or persecution because of the message, they quickly fall away from the faith.
While others receive the seed that fell on the rocks. They are the ones who hear the message. But then, the worries of the world and the deceitful gains intervene to obscure it. They prevent it from bearing fruit.
But others received the seed that fell on good soil. They are the ones who hear the message and understand it. They produce a crop a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was planted. The story about the weeds.
Jesus said to the crowd, "This is what the kingdom of heaven is like." He told them another parable: "A man went out to sow good seed in his field."
While everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. The enemy planted weeds among the wheat and then left.
The wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
The owner's servants came to them. They said, "Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? Then where did the weeds come from?"
He said, "An enemy did that," and then asked the servants, "Do you want us to go and pull the weeds?"
"No," the owner replied. "While you're pulling the weeds, you might pull up the wheat with them."
Let both grow together until the harvest. Then I will tell the workers what to do. This is what I will say to them: First, gather the weeds. Bind them in bundles to be burned. Then gather the wheat. Bring it to my barn. "The Parable of the Weeds"
Jesus told the crowd another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field."
It is the smallest of all your seeds. Yet when it grows, it is the largest of all the plants in the garden. It becomes a tree. And the birds come to rest in its branches.
Jesus told them another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast." He said, "A woman took some and mixed it into a large amount of flour. The yeast spread throughout the dough."
Jesus spoke these things to the people in parables. He did not say anything to them without using a parable.
When the words of the prophet came, the truth was revealed. He said, "I will open my mouth and tell stories. I will speak about things that have been hidden since creation." (Genesis 78:2) Jesus explains the story of the grasses.
Then Jesus left the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
He replied, "Whoever sows the good, it is from him that it springs.
The field is the world. The good oil represents people who belong to the kingdom. The tares are people who belong to the devil.
The devil is the one who sows them. The harvest is on the Day of Judgment. And the workers are the angels.
The graves are exposed and belittled in the fire. Thus it will be on the Day of Resurrection.
The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will remove from his kingdom everything that causes sin and all evildoers.
They will be driven around in columns of fire. There, the losers will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then the people of God will shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom. Let those who have ears listen. Parables of the hidden treasure and the pearl.
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.
He found one of great value. So he went and sold all he had and bought that pearl. The parable of the net.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the lake and caught all kinds of fish.
When it was full, the fishermen pulled it to shore. Then they sat down and sorted the good fish into baskets. But they threw the bad fish into the trash.
Thus it will be on the Day of Reckoning. The angels will come. They will separate those who did evil from those who did good.
The devils will be driven into the Fire of Hell, where they will be huddled together and weeping.
"Do you understand all these things?" asked Jesus. "Yes," they answered.
He said to them, "Every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like a homeowner who brings out of his treasure both new and old." An undeniable prophet.
Jesus finished telling these stories. Then he left.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth. And there he began to teach the people in their synagogue. They were amazed at his teaching. "Where did this man get this wisdom? And where did he get this power to do miracles?" they asked.
Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? And his brothers, James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
Isn't all his sister with us? Then what has this man gained with all these things?
They were not at all pleased with him. Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, and among his own people and in his own house."
He only showed a few signs there because they did not believe.
John the Baptist's head was cut off.
At that time, Herod, the tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, heard reports about Jesus.
He said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles."
Herod seized John, bound him, and put him in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother.
John was telling Howard, "It's wrong for you to have it."
Romeo wanted to kill John. But he was afraid of the people, because they believed John was a prophet.
On Herod's birthday, Herodias' daughter danced before Herod and his lords. And Herod was exceedingly pleased with her.
He promised her by his days to give her all she asked for.
Her mother told her what to say. So the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very angry. But he remembered his promise and the dinner guests. So he asked one of his men to give her what she had asked for.
Herod cut off John's head in prison.
They lifted his head on a large platter and gave it to the girl. She then carried it to her mother.
The disciples came, sat on his body, and buried him. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus feeds the five thousand.
Jesus heard what had happened to Ahmad. He wanted to be alone. So he went in a boat to a quiet place. The executioners heard about this, so they followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus came down to the shore, he saw large crowds. He felt deep compassion for them, and healed the sick among them.
When it was almost evening, the disciples came to him and said, "This is a remote place, and it's already getting late. Send the crowds away so they can go to the villages and buy food."
Jesus answered, "They need not go away; you give them something to eat."
"We have only five pounds of bread and two small fish," they answered.
Bring them to me, he said.
Then Jesus directed the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, and gave thanks. He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, who distributed them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples gathered twelve baskets of the remaining fragments.
The number of men who ate was about 5000. The women and children also ate. Jesus walks on water.
Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead to the other side to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd.
After sending them, he went up to a mountain by himself to pray to God. When evening came, he was there alone.
The boat had drifted far from the shore. The waves were beating heavily against it due to the winds blowing upon it.
Early in the morning, Jesus came to the disciples. He walked on the water.
They saw him walking on the lake, and they trembled. They said, "It's a ghost!" Then they cried out in fear.
Then Jesus said, "Have faith in yourselves! I am he. Do not be afraid."
"Lord, are you?" Peter asked. "If it is you, command me to come to you on the water."
Jesus said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat, walked on the water, and went toward Jesus.
When Peter saw the wind, he was afraid and began to sink. He cried out, "Lord, save me!"
Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?"
When they boarded the boat, the wind died down.
So they honored Jesus and the disciples. They said, "You are indeed the Son of God!"
They crossed over the lake and plunged into the Genzourite.
The men who lived there recognized Jesus. So they sent a message throughout the whole region. And people brought all their sick to Jesus.
So he allowed the sick to touch the hem of his garment, and all who touched it were healed.
What makes people "dirtier"?
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came from Jerusalem to see Jesus. They said,
Why don't your students obey what the elders teach them? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!
And on what basis do you not obey the command of God? Do you prefer to follow your own instructions instead?
God said, "Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12; Leviticus 5:16) He also said, "Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death." (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9)
But you allow people to say to their parents: 'Any help you have received from us is a separate gift to God.'
They do not need to honor their parents with their gifts. And you make the word of God of no effect by your tradition.
Rebels! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you. He said:
"They greet me with words, but their hearts are far from me."
Their worship means nothing to me. They only teach human rules.
Jesus' call to the crowds. He said, "Listen and understand."
What goes into your mouth does not make you "unclean"; it is what comes out of your mouth that makes you "unclean."
So the disciples came to him. They asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus answered, "There are plants that my Father has not planted in heaven, and they will be uprooted."
Leave them. The Pharisees are blind leaders. And if a blind man leads another blind man, they will both fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Did you not understand this?" Jesus asked them.
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes to the stomach. Then it comes out of the body.
But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart. These are the things that defile a person.
Evil thoughts come from the heart. So do murder and adultery, and other sexual sins. So do theft, bearing false witness, and lying to people.
These are the things that make you "unclean." But eating without washing your hands does not make you "unclean." "The faith of a Canaanite woman"
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A Canaanite woman lived near Tyre and Sidon. She came to him, crying, and begged him, saying, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is severely oppressed by a demon."
Jesus did not answer a word. His disciples came to him and pleaded, "Send her away, for she keeps crying after us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
Then the woman fell on her knees before him. She said, "Oh Lord! Have mercy on me!"
He said, "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to their dogs."
Yes, Lord, she said. "Even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' tables."
Then Jesus answered and said, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour. Jesus feeds the four thousand.
Jesus left there. Then he walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up a mountain and came down.
A large crowd came to him, bringing with them the blind, the lame, the paralyzed, the epileptics, and many others. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them.
The people were amazed. Those who did not speak began to speak. The dwarves corrected. The weak walked. The blind saw. So the people shouted to the gods of Israel.
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have great compassion on this crowd. They have been with me for three days now and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."
His disciples answered him, "There is nothing here but five loaves and two fish." They said, "What good is that for such a large crowd?"
How many loaves do you have? asked Jesus. "Seven," they answered, "and a few small fish."
Jesus told the crowd to sit down on the ground.
He took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples for distribution to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples then gathered seven baskets of the remaining fragments.
The number of men who ate was 4,000. Women and children also ate.
After Jesus had sent the crowds away, he got into the boat and came to the region of Magadan.
Jesus asks for a sign.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus, and asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
He replied, "In the evening, you look at the sky. You say, 'The weather will be good. The sky is red.'"
In the morning you say, "Today will be stormy. The sky is red and cloudy." You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you do not understand the signs of what is happening now.
People are evil and adulterous, seeking for a sign from heaven. But none will be given to them except the sign of Jonah. Then Jesus left them and went away. A wicked and adulterous generation seeks a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.
The disciples came to the other side of the lake. They forgot to bring bread.
"Beware," Jesus said to them, "of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The pupils spoke among themselves about this. They said, "He must say this because we brought no bread."
Jesus knew what they were saying. He said to them, "Your faith is so small! Why do you talk among yourselves about having no bread?"
Haven't you understood yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets were collected with the pieces?
Do you not remember the feeding of the four thousand? How many baskets full of fragments did you take up?
How do you not understand this in the first place? I wasn't talking to you about bread. But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not forbidding them to observe the yeast used in bread, but was warning them about the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Simon said, "Jesus is the Messiah."
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They answered, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others say Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
But what about you? he asked. "Who do you say that I am?"
Jesus answered, "You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God."
Jesus said, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father in heaven."
This is what I tell you. You are Peter. I will build my church on this rock, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Then Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Jesus speaks about his upcoming death.
From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised the third day.
Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him. He said, "Never, Lord! This shall not happen to you!"
Then Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Whoever wants to follow me must deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow me."
If he wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for my sake, he will find it.
What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?
The Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father. His angels will come with Him, and then He will render to each according to his works.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. Of those who are standing here, not one of them will die before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
The appearance of Jesus changed.
After six days, Jesus took with him Simon and Peter and James, and James's brother John. He led them up a high mountain, where they were alone.
Before him, his appearance changed. His face shone like the sun. His clothes became white as light.
Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared before them. Moses and Elijah were talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here; if you wish, I will make three dwellings here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
While Peter was still speaking, a white cloud enveloped them. Then they heard a voice from the cloud saying, "This is my Son, whom I love. I am very pleased with him. Listen to him!"
When the disciples heard this, they were afraid. They bowed down with their faces to the ground.
But Jesus came and touched them. He said, "Arise, do not be afraid."
When they looked up, they saw only Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. And as they were going down, Jesus commanded them that they should tell no man what they had seen, till the Son of man was risen from the dead.
The disciples asked him, "Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus said, "True. Elijah must come to make all things new."
But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also will they do to the Son of Man.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus heals a boy who was suffering from a demon.
As they approached the mount, a man came up to Jesus, fell on his knees before him, and pleaded with him.
Oh Lord, have mercy on my son. He is trembling violently and enduring great suffering. He often falls into fire or into water.
I brought him to your pupils. But they couldn't cure him.
"You brood of vipers! How long shall I bear with you? How long shall I endure you? Show me the fruit." said Jesus.
Jesus commanded the demon to depart from the body, and it left him. The child was instantly healed.
Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why couldn't we drive out the demons?"
He replied, "Because your faith is so small. What I'm telling you is the truth. If your faith is as small as a mustard seed, it is enough. You can tell this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
"Please"
They came together to Golgotha. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man will be handed over to the people."
They will kill him. On the third day he will rise from the dead. Then the disciples were filled with deep sorrow. Jesus pays the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples came to Capernaum. When they entered the temple, the tax collectors came to Peter and asked, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
Yes, he did, he replied. When Simon entered the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "Who pays taxes and fees to the kings? Do they pay from their sons or from others?"
Peter said, "Not even the others." Then Jesus said to him, "So the children are exempt."
But we don't want to upset them. So go to the lake and cast your fishing line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. There you will find the small coin you need. Take it and give it to them for the tax you and I owe.
