🌑The family lineage of Isaac
ensing the following text into English: "This is the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham."
Abraham was the father of Isaac. Isaac was the father of Moses. Moses was the father of Judah and his brothers.
Joshua was the father of Bezalel and Zerach. Their mother was Tamar. Bezalel was the father of Hazzelon, and Hazzelon was the father of Ram.
Ram was the father of Amminadab. Amminadab was the father of Nahshon. Nahshon was the father of Salmon.
Boaz was the father of Obed, and Rahab was the mother of Boaz. Obed was the father of Jesse, and Ruth was the mother of Jesse. Jesse was the father of David.
And Jesus was the father of David the king. David was the father of Solomon. Solomon's mother was the wife of Uriah.
Solomon was the father of Rehoboam. Rehoboam was the father of Abijah. Abijah was the father of Asa.
Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat was the father of Joram. Joram was the father of Uzziah.
Uzziah was the father of Jotham. Jotham was the father of Ahaz. Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
Ezekiel was the father of Manasseh. Manasseh was the father of Amon. Amon was the father of Josiah.
Josiah was the father of Jacob and his brothers. At that time, the people of Judah were forced to migrate to Babylon.
Then the family line continued. Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud. Abiud was the father of Eliakim. Eliakim was the father of Azor.
Azor was the father of Zadok. Zadok was the father of Akiv. Akiv was the father of Eliud.
Eliezer was the father of Machir. Machir was the father of Gilead.
Jacob was the father of Joseph. Joseph was the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Messiah.
So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David. And there were fourteen generations from David until the carrying away into Babylon. And there were fourteen generations from the carrying away into Babylon until Christ. And so all the generations from Abraham to Christ were fourteen generations. Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband, Youssef, is a good man. He didn't want to embarrass her in front of people. So he planned to separate from her quietly.
But while he was pondering these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.”
This is like a child to her. Oh, one must feed him the name of Jesus. This is a lot because she saved her people from his sins.
All this happened to fulfill what the Lord had spoken through the prophet,
Mary began to swell. She will give birth to a son, and his name will be called Immanuel. Immanuel means "God with us."
Joseph woke up. He did as the angel of the Lord commanded him. He took Mary as his wife into his house.
But he had no relations with her until she had borne a son, and he called his name Jesus.
Visitors of the wise men to visit Jesus
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This happened while Herod was king over Judea. After the birth of Jesus, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
They asked, "Where is the child who has been born to be the king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard the news, he was greatly enraged. Everyone in Jerusalem was also disturbed.
This is Hodrina, who gathered all the chief priests of the people. He also gathered the teachers of the law. He asked them where the Christ would be born.
In Bethlehem in Judea, they answered. "This is what the prophet wrote. He said:"
"Woe to you, Bethelem Ephrathah, who are too little to be among the clans of Judah. From you will come forth for me one who is to be ruler over Israel, whose origin is from of old, from ancient times."
Then Hud secretly summoned the wise men. He learned from them exactly when the star appeared.
Send them to Bethlehem. He said, "Go! Search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, send me a report. Then I too can go and worship him."
After listening to the Arab, they continued on their way. The star they had seen in the east went before them, and finally stood over the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, they were very happy.
The wise men followed the star to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They knelt down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and offered him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their country by another road. The family of Jesus flees to Egypt.
When the wise men had departed, Joseph had a dream. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him. The angel said, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you to return, for Herod will seek the child to kill him."
Joseph awakes. During the night, he fled to Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.
They remained there until the death of King Herod, so that what the Lord had spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled: "Out of Egypt I called my son." (Hosea 11:1)
Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him. Therefore, he became very angry. He gave orders concerning Bethlehem and the surrounding area. All the male children two years old and under were to be killed. This corresponded to the time when the wise men had seen the star.
In this way, the words spoken by the prophet Yeremiah were fulfilled. He said:
A voice is heard in Ramah, wailing and great mourning. Rachel weeps for her children; she refuses to be comforted, because they are no more. The family of Jesus returns to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, John was still in Egypt, dreaming. In the dream, the angel of the Lord appeared to him.
Gabriel, peace be upon him, said: "Take hold! Take the child and his mother. Ride towards the land of Israel. Whoever grieves for the killing of the child has already died."
And Joseph awoke and arose. And he took the child and his mother Mary to the land of Israel.
But then he heard that Archelaus was king of Judea. Archelaus reigned in place of his father Herod. This made Joseph afraid to go there. Warned in a dream, Joseph returned instead to the land of Galilee.
There he lived in a city called Nazareth. What the prophets had said about Jesus came true. They had said, "He will be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Repent of your sins! The kingdom of heaven is near."
John is the person about whom the prophet Elijah spoke. He said, "A voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes were made of sheep's wool. He had a leather belt around his waist. His food was cockroaches and wild bees.
People came to him from Jerusalem and all Judea, and from the whole region around the Jordan River.
When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to him. He said to them, "You are a brood of vipers! How can you escape the wrath of God?
Bear fruit that shows you have abandoned your sins.
Do not think that you can say to yourselves, "We have Abraham as our father." I tell you, God can raise up children to Abraham from these stones.
The scavengers are piling up wood at the roots of the trees. Every tree that doesn't bear good fruit, they cut it down. They put it in the fire.
I am pouring water on you, and cleansing you from your sins. But after that, one who is stronger than I will come, and I am not fit to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
He carries his stick to clean the chaff from his ground at harvest. He will gather the wheat into the granary. But he will burn the chaff with the fire that cannot be quenched. Jesus repents.
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. John wanted to baptize him.
But John tried to prevent him. Jesus said, "I must be baptized by you. Why do you come to me?"
"The answer of John said, 'Let this judgment be blackened at this hour. May it be a curse to us to strike this. It fulfills the plan of the Holy Lord.' Then John sang."
As soon as Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Jesus is multiracial
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert. There, the devil tempted him.
After 40 days and 40 nights of not eating, Jesus was hungry.
The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, turn these stones into bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'" (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city. He made him stand on the highest point of the temple.
"You are the Son of God," he said, "stand still and see. For the scripture says: 'He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you carefully. They will lift you up in their hands, so that you do not strike your foot against a stone.'" (Psalm 91:11, 12)
Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water."
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain. He showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
If you bow down and serve me, he said, "I will give you all this."
Jesus said, "Get away from me, Satan! For it is written, 'Worship the Lord your God and serve him alone.'"
Then the devil left Jesus. Angels came and attended to him. Jesus began to preach.
John had been put in prison. When Jesus heard about it, he returned to Galilee.
The impurity left Nazareth and went to dwell in the city of Capernaum, which was on the seashore in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
In this way, what the prophet Isaiah said came true. He said,
Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where the Gentiles dwell! The region along the Mediterranean Sea! The area east of the Jordan River!
People who are now living in darkness will see a great light. They are now living in a very dark land. But a light will shine upon them.
From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, "Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." He chose the first apostles.
One day Jesus was walking along the shore of Lake Galilee. There he saw two men, Simon, son of John, and his brother Andrew. They were casting their net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
"Come, follow me," said Jesus. "Over there, over there, your ears, your ears, your ears."
At that very moment, they left their nets and followed him.
From that moment, he saw two other brothers. They were James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, when Jesus called them.
They immediately left the boat and their father and followed Jesus. Jesus healed the sick.
Jesus walked everywhere in Galilee. There he taught in the synagogues, proclaimed the good news of the kingdom of God, and healed every disease and sickness among the people.
News about him spread all over Syria. People brought to him all who were sick with various diseases. Some were suffering from severe pain. Others were possessed by demons. Some were violently shaking. Others could not move at all. And Jesus healed them all.
A large crowd of people gathered behind him. Some came from Galilee, and from the region known as the "Ten Cities," and from Jerusalem and Palestine. Others came from the region east of the Jordan River.
Jesus grants blessings.
Jesus saw the crowd, so he moved to a mountain and sat down. His disciples came to him and sat around him.
Then he began to teach them. He said,
God blesses the righteous who seek spirituality. The kingdom of heaven is theirs.
God bless the sorrows. They will be happy.
Blessed are those who have no arrogance. They will be granted the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
God bless the poor. They will be shown mercy.
God bless the hearts of the righteous people. They see God.
God blesses those who seek peace. They will be called children of God.
Blessed are those who suffer for doing right. The kingdom of heaven is theirs.
May God bless you when they mock you and harm you because of me. And you are also blessed when they say all kinds of evil lies about you because of me.
Be happy and joyful. Your reward in Paradise is great. Likewise, people harm the prophets who lived long ago. Salt and light.
You are the salt of the earth. But if salt has lost its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
Furthermore, people do not light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead, they put it on a stand. Then it shines for everyone in the house.
Likewise, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven. Jesus gives full meaning to the law.
Do not think that I have come to abolish what is written in the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish these things but to fulfill them.
"Heaven and earth will pass away before one smallest letter of the Law perishes. All will be fulfilled."
Do not break even the smallest commandment. Do not teach others to break them. If you do, you will be called the least important in the kingdom of heaven. Instead, fulfill these commandments and teach them. Then you will be called important in the kingdom of heaven.
This is what I tell you. You must be holier than the Pharisees and the teachers. And if you are not, you will surely not enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Kill.
You have heard what was said to those who lived long ago. It was said to them, "You shall not murder." (Exodus 20:13) For everyone who murders will be accountable.
But this is what I tell you: Do not be angry with your brother. Anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, 'Raka,' must go to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You fool!' is in danger of the fire of hell.
If you are presenting your gift on the pulpit, remember that your brother has something against you.
Leave your gift before the altar. First, go and be reconciled with your brother. Then come back and give your gift.
If someone has a claim against you and sues you, settle the matter quickly. Do so while you are still on good terms with him. Otherwise, he may take it to court. The judge may then involve the police. And you may end up in jail.
What you lack is the truth. You won't get out until you pay the last cent! Adultery
I have heard it said, 'Do not deprive each other.' (1 Corinthians 7:5)
But this is what I told you. Don't look at your daughter in a wrong way. Whoever does that, has already committed adultery in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. Your eye is just one part of your body. It is better to lose it than to have your whole body thrown into hell.
If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. Your hand is one part of your body. It is better for you to lose one part than for your whole body to go into hell. Divorce.
It was said, "When a man divorces his wife, he must give her a divorce certificate." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
But this is what I'm telling you. Any man who divorces his wife causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries the divorced woman commits adultery. A man may divorce his wife only if she has been unfaithful to him. I swear.
Once again, you have heard what has been said to your people for a long time. They were told, "Do not break the promises you make to God. Keep the vows you have made to Him."
But this is what I told you. Never make such promises again. Don't promise them in the name of Paradise. This is God's throne.
Do not create them in the name of the earth. This is the throne that bears the feet of God. Do not create them in the name of Jerusalem. This is the city of the greatest King.
Do not swear by your heads, for you cannot make even one hair white or black.
Just let "yes" mean "yes," and "no" mean "no." Anything more comes from the devil. Be kind to others.
I have heard it said, "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth." (Exodus 21:24; Deuteronomy 24:20; 2 Samuel 19:21)
But this is what I told you. Don't fight a wicked man. "If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek to him as well."
If anyone sues you for your shirt, let him have your cloak as well.
If someone forces you to walk one mile, walk two miles with them.
Give to those who ask of you. Do not turn your back on those who want to borrow from you. Love your enemies.
You have heard that it was said, "Love your neighbor (Deuteronomy 19:18) and hate your enemy."
But this is what I tell you: Love your enemies. Pray for those who harm you.
"Then you will be sons of your Father in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust."
If you only love those who love you, what reward can you expect? Even tax collectors do that.
If you are merely saying goodbye to your relatives, what more are you doing than others? Even those who are not righteous do that.
Be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.
Assisting the needy
Beware of doing good deeds in front of people. Do not do them to be seen by them. Otherwise, your Father in heaven will not reward you.
When you give to the poor and needy, do not blow a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, so that they may be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
When you give to the poor and needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
Then your donation will be secretly rewarded. My father will compensate you. He sees what you do secretly. Duaa.
When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites. They love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the streets of the city. They want people to see them. What I am about to tell you is the truth. They have received their reward in full.
When you pray, go to your room. Close the door and pray to your Father who is unseen. He will reward you. Your Father sees what you do in secret.
When you pray, do not babble as the disbelievers do. They think that they will be heard because of their much speaking.
You don't have to ask him; your father knows what he doesn't have from you.
"This is the way you should pray: 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name."
May your kingdom come. And may your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who have wronged us.
Keep us from falling into sin when we are tempted. Deliver us from the devil.
Forgive people when they wrong you. And when you forgive them, your Father in heaven will also forgive you.
But if you do not forgive your parents their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive you your trespasses. Fasting.
When you stop eating, don't look as sad as those who only pretend to be pious. Their faces are so sad. They want people to think they are fasting. What I'm about to tell you is the truth. They've already been paid in full.
But when you go without eating, put olive oil on your head. Wash your face.
Then others do not know that you are fasting. It is only the Lord, who is unseen, who knows it. He will reward you. The Lord sees what is done in secret. Store up your treasures in heaven.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
Instead, store up your treasures in heaven, where moths and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
Your heart is where your treasure is.
The eye is like a lamp for the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light.
But imagine if your eyes were weak. Then your whole body would be dark. And if the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. One will be hated and the other loved. Or one will be held in esteem and the other despised. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not be anxious.
Who understands me, don't be afraid. Don't be afraid for your life and don't eat and drink. And don't be afraid for your body and don't wear clothes. Is there still a lot in life besides eating? Are there still a lot of important things for your body besides clothing?
Look at the birds of the sky. They do not sow or gather harvests into barns. Yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth more than they?
Can you add an hour to your life by worrying?
And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider how the wild flowers grow; they neither toil nor spin.
But this is what I told you. Even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
If God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
Do not be anxious or say, "What shall we eat?" or "What shall we drink?" or "What shall we wear?"
People who do not fear God aspire to all these things. Your Father in heaven knows that you need them.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
Don't worry about the future. The future will worry about itself. Every day has its own troubles.
Be fair when you judge people.
Do not judge people, as if you are not being judged yourself.
You will be spoken to in the same way you speak to others. You will be judged by the same standards by which you judge others.
You only criticize the splinters in your friend's eyes, but you don't criticize the log in your own eye.
How would you tell your friend: "Let me remove the splinter from your eye," while you have a splinter in your own eye?
You hypocrite! First, remove the plank from your own eye. Then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your friend's eye.
Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.
Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you.
He who asks will receive. He who seeks will find. The door opens for him who knocks.
If your son asks for bread, which one of you will give him a stone?
Or imagine that he asks for a fish. Who among you would give him a snake?
Although you are evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask Him!
In all things, treat people as you would like to be treated. This is what is written in the law and the prophets. The great and small gates.
Enter the Kingdom of God through the narrow gate. The gate is wide and the road is long that leads to death and hell. Many walk this path.
But the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life. Only a few find it. A tree and its fruit.
Beware of enemies. They come to you pretending to be sheep, but inside they are hungry wolves.
You can tell what they are by what they do. "Do people gather grapes from thorns? Do they pluck figs from thistles?"
Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree does not bear bad fruit, and a bad tree does not bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You can know a tree by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father who is in heaven.
A group of people will say to me on that day: "Our Lord, our Lord, we were not evildoers, nor were we eating from the luxuries. And we were not criminals on the day when spirits are separated from kings, scholars, and monks."
Then I will say to them plainly, "I never knew you. Depart from me, you who do lawlessness!" The wise and foolish builder
Therefore, everyone who hears my words and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
It has no foundation. The wind blows and hits this house. But it doesn't collapse. It's built on rock.
But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
They wanted to come. The water is rising. The wind is blowing and hitting this villa. And it's blowing hard.
Jesus finished speaking, and the people were amazed at his teaching.
He knew it as one who has authority. He did not speak as their religious teachers do.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain, and a large crowd followed him.
And a man with a skin disease came to him and knelt down before Jesus, saying, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. He said, "I am willing to do this. Be made clean!" Immediately the man was healed of his disease.
Then Jesus said to him, "Tell no one. Go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." A Roman officer believed.
When Jesus came to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached him and asked for help.
My Lord, He said, "My servant is sitting at home and cannot move. He is suffering greatly."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
The president said, "Lord, I do not ignore that I have no right for you to come to my house. But speak a word, and my servants will be healed."
I myself am a man under authority, and I have soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servants, Do this, and they do it.
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed. He said to those who were following him, "What I'm about to tell you is the truth. I have not found anyone in Israel with faith as strong as this."
I tell you, many will come from east and west and sit at table with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
But those who believe they are of the kingdom will be cast out into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Then Jesus said to the Roman officer, "Go! Let it be done as you have believed." And at that very moment his servant was healed. Jesus healed many people.
When Jesus arrived at Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law. She was lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to help him.
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to Jesus, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
He did it to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah had spoken: "He bore our sufferings and carried our diseases." (Isaiah 53:4) The cost of following Jesus.
Jesus saw the crowds around him, so he sent his disciples to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
Then a teacher from among the scholars of the Sharia came to him and said, "My teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
The other said, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."
And Jesus said to him, "Follow me. Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus sat in a boat. His disciples followed him.
Suddenly, a terrible storm swept across the lake. The waves surged over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
The disciples went and woke him up, saying, "Lord! Save us! We are perishing!"
He answered, "You of little faith! Why are you so afraid?" Then Jesus got up and commanded the winds and the waves, and it became completely calm.
The disciples were amazed. They asked, "Who is this man? Even the winds and waves obey him!" Jesus heals two men possessed by demons.
Jesus knew that they had come from the other side of the sea, in the land of the Gadarenes. A herd of about two thousand pigs was feeding there on the hillside. They rushed down the steep place into the sea and were drowned.
"Son of God, what do you want with us?" they cried. "Have you come here to scourge us before our time of judgment?"
After what was not long ago, there was a large gathering of pigs eating.
The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" And the demons came out of the men and entered the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.
Those who cared about the chickens fled. They entered the city and all that. They told the people what brought the Muslims who were under the control of the demons.
Then all the people of the town came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk.
Jesus got into a boat, crossed to the other side of the lake, and arrived at his city.
Some men brought to him a man who could not walk. He was lying on a mat. Seeing their faith, Jesus said to them, "Do not lose heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
Then some of the religious scholars said to themselves, "This man is saying something very ominous!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he said to them, "Why do you question in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Get up and walk"?
I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. Then he said to the man who could not walk, "Get up, take your mat, and go to your house."
He put his head down and went to his medicine.
When the crowd saw this, they were amazed. They praised God for granting such authority to men. Jesus chooses when.
As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax collector’s booth. “Follow me,” he told him. And Matthew got up and followed him.
After that, Jesus was eating dinner at Matthew's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" came. They ate with Jesus and his disciples.
The Pharisees saw this and said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard it. He said, "The healthy do not need a doctor, but the sick do."
Go and learn what this means: "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to follow me. Jesus is asked about fasting.
One day, Jesus brought his disciples to him. They said to him, "We and the Pharisees have been fasting, but your disciples do not fast."
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast."
People don't sew a new piece of cloth onto old clothes. The new cloth will stand out. It will ruin the outfit.
 "People don't pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst. The wine will run out, and the wineskins will be destroyed. No, everyone pours new wine into new wineskins. Then both are saved." A Dead Girl and a Suffering Woman   
As Jesus was saying this, a synagogue leader came and bowed down before him, saying, "My daughter has just died. Come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
Yasu stood up and went with him. His disciples also went with him.
At that moment, a woman came up to Jesus from behind. She was suffering from a disease that caused constant bleeding for twelve years. She touched the edge of his clothes.
She was thinking: "I only need to touch his clothes. Then I will be healed."
When Jesus saw her, he called out to her, "Woman, you are set free from your infirmity." And at that very hour the woman was made well.
When Jesus entered the judge's house, he saw the musicians there. He also saw the crowd that was filming.
He said, "Go ahead, my daughter is not dead. She's just sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After the crowd had gone out, Jesus entered. He took her by the hand, and she arose.
News about what Jesus had done spread all over that region. Jesus heals two blind men.
As Jesus was going on from there, two blind men followed him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus had come down from the mountain, great crowds followed him; and there was a leper who came to him and knelt before him, saying, "Lord, if you choose, you can make me clean." He stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, "I do choose. Be made clean." Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
Then he touched their eyes. He said, "Your belief will be granted."
They could see again. Jesus strictly warned them, saying: "Make sure no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They talked about it everywhere in that region.
As they were leaving, another man who was demon-possessed was brought to Jesus. He was blind and mute.
When they drove out the demons, the man spoke. The crowd was amazed. They said, "Never before has anything like this been seen in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "They cast out demons by the power of the prince of demons." There are few workers.
Jesus comforted all the mourners and the bereaved. He taught in their synagogues. He proclaimed the good news of the kingdom. And he healed every disease and every affliction.
When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, for they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
Ask the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.
Jesus sought to send the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
These are the names of the twelve apostles. The first is Simon, son of John, and his brother Andrew. Then comes John, son of Zechariah, and his brother John.
Then come Philip and Bartholomew, also Thomas and Matthew the tax collector. There are also James, the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddeus.
The last are Simon the Zealot and Judas the Iscariot. Judas is the one who was going to betray Jesus to his enemy.
Jesus sent out the twelve with these instructions: "Do not go among the Gentiles, and do not enter any town of the Samaritans.
Instead, go to the people of Israel. They are like a lost sheep.
On your way, teach this content: "The queen of heaven is near."
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, and cast out demons. You have given us authority over all demons, so give us blessings.
Do not carry any gold, silver, or copper in your belts.
Don't take a bag with him on the trip. Don't take extra clothes, sandals, or a walking stick. He needs to be given the job he needs.
When you enter a city or village, look for someone willing to host you. Stay in that person's home until you leave.
When you enter the house, feed those who live in it.
If this house welcomes you, bless it. If it does not welcome you, do not bless it.
They should not welcome you or listen to your speech. And if they don't, wipe the dust off your feet when you leave that house or country.
Let his saying be, "It is true." On the day of judgment, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah than for that city.
I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and harmless as doves.
Beware! They will drag you to the local courts. They will flog you in their homes.
You will be gathered before judges and rulers because of Me. You will be witnesses against them and against the Gentiles.
But when they arrest you, don't worry about what you will say or how you will say it. At that time, you will be given the right words to speak.
You will not be the speaker. The spirit of your father will speak through you.
Brothers will deliver up brothers to death, fathers children, and children will rise up against parents and cause them to die.
Everyone will fill your head with my wife, but only those who do the right thing until the end will remember it.
When people attack you in one place, flee to another. What I mean to tell you is true. You will not finish your journey through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
The student is not better than his teacher. The servant is not better than his master.
It is enough for the student to be like his teacher. And it is enough for the slave to be like his master. If the head of the house is called Belial, what can the others who live in it expect?
What does not scare you from enemies. Everything secret will be revealed. Everything hidden will be shown.
What you tell me in the dark, speak in the daylight. What is whispered in your ear, shout from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Instead, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Are two small birds sold for just one cent? But neither of them falls to the ground without your father's knowledge.
He even counts every hair on your head!
Don't be afraid. You deserve more than many small birds.
Is there anyone who claims to know me? I will also claim before my father in heaven that I know him.
But what about someone who says in front of people that he doesn't know me? I will say in front of my father who is in heaven that he doesn't know him.
Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
I will stir up children against their fathers, and daughters against their mothers, and daughters-in-law against their mothers-in-law.
"The man's enemies will be from his own family."
He who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. And he who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
"And whoever of you does not take up his cross and follow Me is not worthy of Me."
"Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it."
Whoever welcomes you welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.
If someone receives a prophet like a prophet, they will get the reward of a prophet. And if someone receives a righteous person like a righteous person, they will get the reward of a righteous person.
If anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones who follows me, I tell you the truth, they will surely be rewarded.
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus finished preaching to his twelve disciples. Then he went to teach and preach in the cities of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked Jesus, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?"
"May Allah reward him well. Go to Yahya and inform him of what you heard and saw."
The blind shall see, the weak shall walk, the sick shall be healed, the deaf shall hear, and the dead shall be raised. And good tidings shall be spread to the poor.
May God bless those who do not stop believing because of me.
As Jesus' disciples were leaving, he began to speak to the crowd about John. He said, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
If not, what did you go out to see? A man in fine clothes? No. People in fine clothes are in the palaces of kings.
Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
He is the one spoken of in the Bible. It says: "I will send my messenger before you, to prepare your way before you." (Malachi 3:1)
What he says to you is trustworthy. Not even a child is more important than a sparrow. But even the least important person in the kingdom of heaven is more important than them.
Since the days of John the Baptist, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with power. And the violent take it by force.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you are ready to receive him, John is the Elijah who was to come.
Those who heard tell it.
Who do I compare people today to? They are like children sitting in the markets, calling out to others, saying,
"We played the piano for Lalla on the coffee machine. But you didn't turn around. We sang a funeral song. But you didn't increase your grief."
When John fasted, he neither ate nor drank as you say. And people would tell him, 'He must have some demons.'
When the Son of Man came, he ate and drank in the same way as you do. And the people said, "This man always eats and drinks too much. He is a friend of tax collectors and 'sinners'." But whoever proves wisdom right, proves that wisdom is right. Cities that do not reject sin.
Yahya learned, and from the marks he had made, he realized that the palaces were more numerous than the fortresses of those who had mocked him. So he was terrified and said:
Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
But I tell you this: It will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
And what about you, Capernaum? Will you be exalted to heaven? No! You will be brought down to the realm of the dead. If the miracles I performed had been done in Sodom, it would still be standing today.
But I say to you, it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you. Rest for all the weary.
At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children."
Yes, Father. That's what you wanted.
My Father has given me everything. Only the Father knows the Son. And the only ones who know the Father are the Son and those the Son has chosen to make him known.
Hey everyone, come to me who are tired and carrying heavy weights, we will give you rest.
Be my servants and learn from me. I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
The service with me is easy, and my burden is light.
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On the Sabbath, Jesus was walking through wheat fields. His disciples were hungry, so they began to pluck and eat some of the heads of wheat.
The Pharisees saw this. They said to the Lord Jesus, "Look! It is against the law to do this on the Sabbath. But your disciples are doing it anyway!"
The response of John said, "Have you not heard what David did when he and his people were hungry?
He suddenly entered the House of God. He and his men ate the sacred bread. Only priests were allowed to eat it.
You haven't read the law? It explains how every Sabbath the priests in the temple had to do their work on that day. But they are not considered guilty.
I told you that what's important here is not the sect.
The Bible says: "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) You do not know the meaning of these words. If you knew, you would not judge the innocent.
The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.
From there, Jesus went to the Jewish temple.
There was a man with a withered and crooked hand. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "What if one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath? Won't you take hold of it and lift it out?"
The man is richer than the sheep! Therefore, the Sharia allows us to do good deeds on Friday.
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out. It was completely restored, just like the other hand.
But the Pharisees were compelled to go out and plot to kill Jesus. The servant of the chosen God.
Jesus knew what the Pharisees were planning. So he left that place. Many followed him, and he healed all the sick among them.
But he warned them not to tell who he was.
This would make what was said in the letter from Esai come true. He says,
This is my servant. I have chosen him. He is whom I love. I am very happy with him. I will put my spirit upon him. He will tell the nations that everything will be alright.
Don't argue or shout. No one can hear him in the market.
What will break a broken branch. What will extinguish a flickering flame. It will restore everything to its place.
Nations will set their hope on him. Jesus and Beelzebub.
A man possessed by demons was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Then the man was able to speak and see.
All the people were amazed and asked, "Is this the Son of David?"
This is the speech of the Pharisees. They said, "This man casts out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the prince of demons."
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand."
If a devil defeats a devil, he fights himself. How can his kingdom stand?
You say that I cast out demons by the power of Beelzebub. But by what power do you cast them out? Therefore, you will be the judges.
But imagine that I drive out demons by the Spirit of God. Then the kingdom of God has come to you.
Or think about this. How do you enter the house of a strong man and steal what he owns? First, you must tie him up. Then you can steal from his house.
He who is not with me is against me. And he who does not gather the sheep with me scatters them.
Here is what I tell you: Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But speaking evil against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. Such a person will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come."
A good tree bears good fruit, and a bad tree bears bad fruit. You can tell a tree by its fruit.
You are a den of venomous snakes! How can you, Kaid, say anything good? Your mouths speak what is in your hearts.
A good man speaks good words. This comes from the good that he chooses in his heart. An evil man speaks evil words. This comes from the evil that he chooses in his heart.
But I tell you that on the Day of Judgment, people will have to give account for every careless word they speak.
By your words you will be condemned or acquitted. The sign of Jonah.
Some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus. They said, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
He replied, "The devilish and disbelieving people ask for a wondrous sign! But they will only be given the sign of Prophet Jonah."
Jonah was in the belly of a giant fish for three days and three nights. Something like this will happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the grave.
The men of Nineveh will stand in the day of judgment with the people who are now living. And the men of Nineveh will testify that these people are guilty. The men of Nineveh turned from their sins when Jonah spoke among them. And now, one greater than Jonah is here.
The queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with the men of this generation, and will condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
Who started this? Why didn't anyone think of anything? She's running in circles, trying to calm down. But she can't calm down.
He then says, "I will return to the house I left." When he arrives there, he finds the house empty. The house has been completely cleaned and tidied.
Then the evil spirits go out and bring with them seven other spirits more evil than themselves. They enter and live there. That man is worse off than before. So it will be with this evil generation. They come behind me and follow Christ.
While Jesus was still speaking to the people, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.
Tell him: "Your parents and sisters are outside. They want to talk to you."
My Lord said to him, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus pointed to his disciples. He said, "Behold, my mother and my brothers!"
Whoever does what my Father wants in heaven, they are my brothers and sisters and mother.
The Farmer's Tale
On the same day, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea of Galilee.
The people gathered around him. So he got into a boat. He sat in it. All the people stood on the shore.
Then he said many things to them in parables, saying, "A farmer went out to sow his seed."
He scattered the seeds on the ground. Some fell on the path. Birds came and ate them.
Some seeds fell on rocky places, where there was little soil. The plants grew quickly, because the soil was not deep.
When the sun rose, it scorched the plants. They withered because they had no roots.
Other seeds fell among the thorns. The thorns grew up and choked the seeds.
And some seeds fell on good soil, and grew up, and produced a hundredfold, or sixtyfold, or thirtyfold.
They don't have eyes to see.
The disciples came to him. They asked, saying, "Why do you use parables when you speak to the people?"
He answered, "You have been given the chance to understand the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven. This has not been given to outsiders."
"Those who have this kind of knowledge will gain much more. Even a lot more. And those who don't have this kind of knowledge, even the little they have, will be taken away from them."
This is why I use stories when I talk to people. I tell them, "They look, but they don't really see. And they listen, but they don't understand or really hear."
In it the words of the prophet Elijah are fulfilled, who said, "You will hear, but will not understand; you will see, but will not comprehend what you see."
The hearts of these people have become stubborn. They can barely hear with their ears. They have closed their eyes, otherwise they might see with their own eyes, and perhaps hear with their ears, and perhaps understand with their hearts, and perhaps seek refuge in Allah, for He heals between them.
But blessed are your eyes, for they see. Woe to your ears, for they hear.
Let his words be true. Many prophets and righteous people wished to see what you see, but they did not see. Many prophets and righteous people wished to hear what you hear, but they did not hear.
Listen! This is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message about the kingdom, but they do not understand it. Then the devil comes. He steals what was sown in their hearts. These people are like the seed that was sown on the path.
Others received the seed that fell on rocky places. They are the ones who hear the message and immediately receive it with joy.
But they have no roots. Therefore, they remain for only a short time. They quickly withdraw from faith when problems or suffering come because of the message.
Others received the seed that fell among the thorns. These are the ones who hear the message, but then the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the message, making it unfruitful.
But others received the seed that fell on good soil. These are the ones who hear the message and understand it. They produce a crop of a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was planted. The parable of the weeds.
Jesus told the people another parable. "This is how the kingdom of heaven is," he said. "A man sowed good seed in his field."
But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. The enemy planted weeds among the wheat and then left.
Wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
The owner's servants came to them. They said, "Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? Then where did the weeds come from?"
"The enemy did this," he replied. They asked the servants, "Do you want us to go and pull the weeds?"
'She, my trained one,' answered the owner, 'if she gets the grass, she might get the worm with it too.'
Let them grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the workers what to do. This is what I will say to them: First, gather the weeds. Bind them in bundles to be burned. Then gather the wheat. Thresh it into my barn. "Parables of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast"
Jesus told the people another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field."
This is the smallest of all your seeds. But when it grows, it is the largest of all the plants in the garden. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest in its branches.
Jesus said to them another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast." He said, "A woman took some yeast and mixed it into a large amount of flour. The yeast worked its way through all the dough."
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up.
So, what the prophet said has come to pass. He said, "I will open my mouth and utter parables. I will declare things that have been hidden since the creation of the universe." (Revelation 78:2) Jesus explains the story of the grasses.
Then Jesus left the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
He replied, "Whoever sows the good, it is from him that it grows.
The field is the world. The good seed represents the people who belong to the kingdom. Weeds are people who belong to the devil.
The devil is the one who sows them. The harvest is on the Day of Judgment. And the workers are the angels.
The pasture is gathered and burned in the fire. So shall it be in the day of judgment.
The Son of Man will send His messengers. They will remove from His kingdom all that causes sin. They will also remove all who do evil.
They will throw them into the burning oven. There they will groan and scream.
Then the people of God will shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom. Let those who have ears listen. Stories of the hidden treasure and the pearl.
The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again. He was overjoyed. So he went and sold everything he had and bought that field.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.
He found one of great value. He went away and sold all he had and bought that pearl. Internet story.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the lake. It caught all kinds of fish.
Since it was full, they called it to the shore. Then they cast their nets and gathered the good fish in baskets. But they threw back the fish they didn't like.
Thus will be the Day of Reckoning. The angels will come. They will separate those who did wrong from those who did right.
They will throw the devils into the hot oven. There, the devils will groan and gnash their teeth.
"Are you in charge of all this?" asked Jesus. "Yes," they replied.
He said to them, "Every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure both new and old." An undeniable prophet.
Jesus finished telling these stories. Then he left.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth. There he began to teach the people in their synagogue. They were amazed at his teaching. "Where did this man get this wisdom? And where did he get the power to do miracles?" they asked.
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary? Aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
Aren't all his sisters with us? Where did this man get all these things?
They did not receive him well at all. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home."
He performed only a few miracles there because they did not comply with faith.
John the Baptist's head is cut off.
At that time, Herod the king of Galilee and Perea heard reports about Jesus.
His servants said to him, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do these miracles."
Herod imprisoned John. He bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias. She was the wife of Herod's brother Philip.
John was saying to Herod: "It is against the law for you to have this."
Herod allowed him to behead John. But he feared the people, for they regarded John as a prophet.
At Herod's feast, the daughter of Herodias danced before Herod and his lords. Herod was exceedingly pleased.
So he swore an oath that he would give her all she asked.
Her mother told her what to say. So the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very annoyed. However, he thought about his promise and the dinner guests. So he told one of his men to give her what she asked for.
Herod ordered John's head to be cut off in prison.
They brought him his head on a large platter and presented it to her. She then served it to me with her mother's help.
The disciples came to them and took away his body and laid it in a tomb. Then they sent to Jesus. Jesus feeds the five thousand.
When Jesus heard what had happened to John, he withdrew in private to a place near the sea. But when the crowds heard this, they followed him on foot from many towns.
When Jesus came down to the shore, he saw large crowds. He felt deep compassion for them. He healed the sick among the people.
As evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, "The day is over, and it is already late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves."
Jesus answered, "They do not need to die. You give them something to eat."
"The machine uses a different kind of yeast and a different kind of dough," they answered.
"Bring them here to me," he said.
Then Jesus directed the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, and gave thanks. He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
Everyone ate and was satisfied. The disciples gathered twelve baskets of the fragments that were left over.
The number of men who ate was about 5000. Women and children also ate. Jesus walks on water.
Soon Jesus made the disciples get into the boat. He told them to go ahead of him to the other side of Lake Galilee. Then he sent the crowds away.
After he contacted them, he will return to the mountain he wants. When night came, they were all alone.
The boat was too far from the shore. It was being violently struck by the waves because the wind was blowing against it.
In the early morning, Jesus went out to the disciples. He walked on the water.
He saw his son walking on the lake and was very afraid. "It's a ghost!" he said. And they screamed in fear.
Soon Jesus called out to them, saying, "Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid."
"Lord, if it is you," Peter asked, "command me to come to you on the water."
"Come," said Jesus. So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid and began to sink. He cried out, "Lord, save me!"
Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?"
As they got into the boat, the wind died down.
Those in the boat worshiped Jesus, and said, "Truly you are the Son of God!"
They have prolonged their stay beyond the sea and gathered in Constantinople.
The men who lived there recognized Jesus. So they sent messengers throughout the surrounding region, and people brought all their sick to him.
They pleaded with him to let the sick just touch the edge of his cloak, and everyone who touched it was healed.
What do people have to do with "polluters"?
And some of the Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked him.
Why don't your students obey what the elders teach them? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!
And why do you not expect Allah's command? You contain within your sects statements that necessitate you to hold fast to your statements!
God Almighty said: "Honor your father and your mother." (Quran 20:12; Leviticus 5:16) He also said: "He who curses his father or mother, let him die the death of the accursed." (Quran 21 Bus Bus
But you allow people to say to their relatives, 'Any help you have received from us is a separate gift to God.'
They do not need to honor their parents with their gifts. You make the word of God of no effect in order to uphold your own tradition.
You are hypocrites! Isaiah was right about you when he prophesied about you. He said:
These people admire me for what I say, but their hearts are far from me.
Their worship means nothing to me. They only teach human rules.
Jesus called the crowds to Him. He said, "Listen and understand."
What goes into your mouth does not make you "unclean." Rather, it is what comes out of you that makes you "unclean."
Then the disciples came to him. They asked, saying, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
My Lord has not planted a tree in it, and its trunk will be uprooted.
Leave them. The Pharisees are blind leaders. And if one blind person leads another blind person, they will both fall into hell.
Peter said: "Be quiet."
"Don't you even understand this?" Jesus asked them.
"Are you serious? You're saying what goes into the mouth reaches the stomach, and then exits the body?"
But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart. These are the things that make you "unclean."
Evil thoughts come from the heart. So do murder and adultery, and other sexual sins. So do theft, bearing false witness, and lying to people.
These are the things that make you "unclean." But eating without washing your hands does not make you "unclean." "The faith of a Canaanite woman"
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A Canaanite woman who lived near Tyre and Sidon came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is tormented by a demon. She suffers greatly."
Jesus said not a word. His disciples came to him. They pleaded, "Send her away. She keeps shouting at us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. They are like fluttering doves."
Then the woman fell on her knees before him. "Oh God! Save me!" she said.
He replied, "It's not right for you to take your children's bread and leave it for their dogs."
"Yes, Lord," she said. "Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
Then Jesus answered and said, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour. Jesus feeds the four thousand.
The Lord left him there. He walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up a mountain and came down.
Large crowds came to him, bringing with them the blind and those who could not walk. They also brought the crippled, the mute, and many others. They placed them at his feet, and he healed them.
The people were amazed. Those who could not speak were speaking. The sick were healthy. Those who could not walk were walking. The blind were seeing. Therefore, the people praised the God of Israel.
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have great compassion on this crowd. They have been with me for three days now and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."
His disciples answered him, "There is nothing here," they said, "but five loaves and two fish." "Where shall we get enough bread to feed so large a crowd?"
"How many loaves do you have?" asked Jesus. "Seven," they answered, "and a few small fish."
Jesus said to the crowd, "Sit down on the ground."
He took the seven and the fourth parts of the spoils and distributed them as rewards. Then he divided them and gave them to the brotherhood. The brotherhood then gave from the obligatory share to the community.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples then gathered seven baskets of the remaining fragments.
The number of men who ate was 4000. The women and children ate as well.
After the crowds had gone away, Jesus got into the boat and came to the region of Magadan.
Jesus asks for a sign.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
He replied, "At night, you look at the sky. You say, 'The weather will be good. The sky is red.'"
I wanted to tell you, right now, "The day is going to be cloudy. The sky is red and overcast." You know what I mean right now. But you don't understand much about the signs that these want to guide you to.
People are unfaithful devils seeking a sign from heaven. But they will be given no sign except the sign of Jonah. Then Jesus left them and went away. The dough of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
The disciples were crossing to the other side of the lake. They had forgotten to bring bread.
"Be on your guard," Jesus told them. "Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
They blamed it on them, saying, "He's saying this because we didn't bring anything."
Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, said to them, "Why do you discuss among yourselves about having no bread? Do you still not perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened? Do you have eyes and not see, and ears and not hear?"
Don't you understand? Don't you remember the five numbers for the lottery? Don't you remember how many cups of coffee it cost you?
Do you not remember the seven loaves for the thousands? How many baskets full you gathered?
How can you understand what you don't know? I wasn't speaking to you about bread. Just be wary of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not referring to the leaven used in bread, but to the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Simon Peter said, "Jesus is the Messiah."
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples: "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They answered: "Some say it is John the Baptist. Others say it is Elijah. Still others say it is Jeremiah, or one of the prophets."
"Are you with me?" he asked. "Did I say how old I am?"
Simon Peter answered: "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
This is what I tell you. You are Peter. On this rock I will build my church. The gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Then Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Jesus speaks about his upcoming death.
From that time Jesus began to explain to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem, and there suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised again.
Peter's behavior towards us began to annoy him. He said, "Goodness, no! That's not what we wanted for you!"
Jesus spoke and said to Sadqa, "Leave me behind, Satan! You are hindering me on my path. Your fantasies do not please God, but you pursue worldly thoughts."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Whoever wants to follow me must say no to themselves. They must take up their cross and follow me."
If he wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for my sake, he will find it.
What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?
The Son of Man will come in his Father's glory, and his angels with him. And then he will give to each one according to his works.
"I tell you the truth. Among those standing here, not one of them will see the Son of Man come in his kingdom."
The new appearance of Christ.
After six days, Jesus took Peter, James, and John, the brother of James, with him. He led them up a high mountain, where they could be alone.
Before him, his appearance changed. His face shone like the sun. His clothes became white as light.
Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared before them. Moses and Elijah were talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three booths: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
While Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them. A voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love. I am very pleased with him. Listen to him!"
When the disciples heard this, they were afraid. They fell on their faces to the ground.
And Jesus reached out and touched them. "Do not be afraid," he said. "Get up!"
When they looked up, they saw only Jesus.
They were descending from the mountain. All the way, they were told what to do. "Don't tell anyone what you saw," he said. "Don't eat until the son of man rises from the dead."
The students ask: "Why do the external teachers say that Elijah must appear first?"
Jesus replied, "So it is written: Elijah will come and will restore all things."
But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also will they do to the Son of Man.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus heals a boy who was suffering from a demon.
As they approached the crowd, a man came up to Jesus, knelt down before him, and presented his request.
My Lord, have mercy on my son. He is trembling violently and enduring great suffering. He often falls into the fire or into the water.
You brought it for your students, but they couldn't see it.
"You brood of vipers, you evil lot!" Jesus said. "How long shall I remain with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring me that boy."
Jesus commanded the demons to come out of the boy, and they did. He was healed instantly.
Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why couldn't we drive out the demons?"
He replied, "Because your faith is so small. What I'm about to tell you is true. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, it is enough. You can tell this mountain, 'Move from here to there,'यरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरयरय
"Please"
They stood together at Gethsemane. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men."
They always wanted to kill him. On the third day he rises from the dead. Afterwards, deep grief overwhelmed them. Jesus pays the dog tax.
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. When they entered the house, the collectors of the temple tax came to Peter and asked, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
He answered and said, "Yes, he did." When Peter had come into the house, Jesus spoke first to him. "What do you think, Simon?" He asked. "Whose image and inscription are on the denarii? Doαντίαντίαντίαντίαντίαντίαντίαντίαντίαντίαν
"From the people," Peter replied. "Then their children don't have to pay," Jesus said to him.
But what we'll do is we won't ruin their feelings. You'll go to the lake and cast your fishing line. You'll take the first fish that bites. You'll open its mouth. That's where you'll find the coin youיויויויויויויויויויויויויויויויו
