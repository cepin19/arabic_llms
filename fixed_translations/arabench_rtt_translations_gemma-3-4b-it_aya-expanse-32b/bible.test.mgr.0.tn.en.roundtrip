Jesus called a little child to him and had the child stand among them.
Jesus said, "What I am about to tell you is the truth. You must change and become like little children. And if you do not, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."

"Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me."
But what if one of these little ones who believe in me is led into sin? And if they do, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and be drowned at the bottom of the sea.

If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one hand or foot missing than to be thrown into the eternal fire of hell with both hands and feet intact.
If your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye rather than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. The Parable of the Lost Sheep
You don't allow yourself to look down on any of these little ones. Here's what I've saved up for you. Their angels in heaven can come at any time to see my father in heaven.
"Please"
What are you doing? I imagine someone has 100 sheep and one of them gets lost. It's impossible to leave the 99 sheep on the mountains? It's impossible to go look for the one that got lost?
What is about to be said to you is the truth. If he finds this sheep, he will be happier about it than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off.
This is also the case with your Father in heaven. He doesn't want any of these little ones to get lost. When someone does you wrong
If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over.
But if he will not listen to them, take one or two others along with you. The Quran says: "Every charge must be supported by two or three witnesses." (Quran 4:15)
But what if he refuses to listen to the witnesses? Tell this to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church? Treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
What you are about to explain to us is correct. What you close on the ground, they close in heaven. And what you open on the ground, they open in heaven.
Again, here's what I was telling you. Imagine if two of you on earth agree on anything you ask for, my heavenly Father will do it for you.
Where two or three are gathered in my name, I am there with them. The servant who does not know mercy.
Peter said to him, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seventy times, but seventy-seven times."
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
At the king's procession, a man who owed him two million dollars came to his line.
The man was unable to pay. His master had already given an order. The man, his wife, his children, and all that he owned had to be sold to repay his debt.
"Be my servant, kneel before me." "But I have my time," he asked. "We'll compensate you for everything."
His creditors used to mock him. He forgave him the debt he owed and let him go.
The pimp then lit up and found one of the other servants who owed him a few dollars. He grabbed him and started choking him, saying, "Pay me back what you owe!"
The second servant fell to his knees. "Give me a moment," he begged. "I implore you."
But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay back all he owed.
The other servants saw what happened. It made them very upset. They went and told their master everything that had happened.
The first servant was occupied, for the Lord said, "You wicked servant," he said, "I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me."
It's not fair that you didn't show mercy to the other servant as you did to me.
In his master's anger, he was turned into a prisoner. He will be punished until he pays off all he owes.
This is how my Father in heaven will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.
Jesus teaches about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
The large crowd followed him. He healed among them there.
Some Pharisees came to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason at all?"
My Lord replied, "Did they not read that Allah created them male and female?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh."
What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
They asked, "Then why did Moses command that a man could write his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?"
Jesus replied, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of heart, but it was not this way from the beginning."
This is what I'm telling you. Any man who divorces his wife and marries another is committing adultery. Men can divorce their wives only if their wives have been unfaithful.
The students told him, "If that's how it is between a couple, it's better not to get married."
Jesus answered and said, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining single. Only those who are given the grace to live without marriage can accept it."
Some men are unable to have children because they were born that way. Others have been made that way by other people. Still others have made themselves that way to serve the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever can accept living that way should do so. Children, come to Jesus.
People brought little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and bless them. But the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me. Do not hinder them. For the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he went from there. Jesus and the rich young man.
A traveler came to Jesus and asked, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to have eternal life?"
Why do you ask me about what is good? Jesus replied. "There is only one who is good. If you want to enter the kingdom, obey God's commands."
"What do you seek?" asked the man. Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not be angry. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness."
"Be to the monastery and the monastery's people like a shepherd." "Honor your neighbor as if you brought him into being."
I, the young man, said: 'I have obeyed all those commands.' What more should I do?
Jesus answered, "If you wish to be perfect, go, sell your possessions, and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
Walaa, upon hearing this, left sadly. He was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
I tell you again, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
He turned away from them, and they were left in perplexity. They said, "Who then will be protected?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter replied: "We've found everything to follow you! Is this the fortune they're giving us?"
"Whatever you are going to tell them, say it," Jesus told them. "For when everything is renewed, the Son of Man will come on his glorious throne. Then those who follow me will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
Those who have left homes, families, or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times more, and will have eternal life.
But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.
The Story of Workers in the Vineyards
The kingdom of heaven is like a man who was the owner of a field. He went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
He agreed to pay them the usual daily wage. Then he sent them to his gardener's garden.
At nine o'clock, he went out again. He saw others sitting in the market doing nothing.
He said to them, "You also go and work in my vineyard. I will pay you what is right."
"They left. He went out again around noon and the next two days he did the same thing."
I left around five o'clock and found some people still there. He asked them, "What have you been doing here all day and haven't finished it?"
"No one invited us," they replied. "He's eating, mother, let them go and work in my vineyard."
The day was over, and the owner of the building spoke to the person in charge of the workers. He said, "Signal to the workers and give them their wages. Start with the last ones you hired, then move on to the first ones."
And the staff who came on duty around five o'clock arrived. Each one received their daily income as usual.
Loyalty to what came first, those who worked earliest, expected to get more. But each of them also received their regular daily wage.
When they arrived, they started complaining about the landlord.
"Those who served us last only worked for one hour," they said. "You lied to them about the same amount you lied to us. We did most of the work and finished under the hot sun all day."
The owner replied to one of them, saying: "My friend, I am dealing with you fairly. Didn't you agree to work for the usual daily wage?"
Take your money and leave. I want to give those who worked the same wage I gave you.
I told you I had the right to do that at my desk, didn't I? Don't feel lost just because I've shared with others a lot.
"This is for him who will be last, and this is for him who will be first. Jesus reiterates his upcoming death."
Jesus was going to Palestine. On the way, he took the twelve disciples aside to speak with them.
"We are going to Jerusalem," he said. "The builder is leaving for the Sadducees and the teachers of the law. Death will overtake him."
So they will hand him over to people who are not Jewish. People will mock him and spit on him, and they will nail him to a cross. On the third day, he will rise from the dead! Are you asking a favor of Jesus?
The mother of Zebedee's children came to Jesus with her sons. She bowed down and asked him for a favor.
"What do you want?" asked Jesus. She said, "Grant that one of my two sons may sit at your right hand and the other at your left in your kingdom. Grant that they may eat at your table."
"You don't know what you are asking," Jesus said to them. "Can you drink the cup I am about to drink?" They answered, "We can."
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to give; but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The remaining ten scientists heard about this. They were angry with the brothers.
Jesus gathered them and said, "You know about the rulers of the nations. They have authority over their people. Their high officials give them orders."
That's how it goes. Instead of "man," anyone who wants to be important among you has to be your slave.
And anyone who wants to be the first must be your servant.
Be like the Son of Man. He did not come to be served, but to serve others. He came to give his life as a ransom for many. Two blind men receive their sight.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho. Large crowds followed him.
Two blind men sitting by the roadside heard that Jesus was passing by. They shouted, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The crowd asked them to stop. They told them to be quiet. But the two men shouted even louder, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Esau stopped and called to them, "What can we do for you?" he asked.
"Lord," they answered, "we want to see."
Jesus felt deep concern for them. He touched their eyes. Suddenly, they could see. And they followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem
So they all went together to Jerusalem, and when they reached the Mount of Olives, they found a donkey and a colt tied there, just as Jesus had told them. So they untied them and brought them to Jesus.
He told them, "Go to the village ahead of you. When you reach it, you will find a chained man. Untie him and bring him to me."
If you need anything, say that our Lord needs them. The owner will send them right away.
This happened so that the words spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled, he says.
Say to the city of Zion, "See, your king comes to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey."
The disciples went and did as Jesus had told them.
They brought the colt and the horse. They placed their yoke upon them. Then Jesus sat on the yoke.
A very large crowd spread their coats on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
Some people preceded him, and some followed him. They all shouted: "Hosanna, Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest heavens!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred. The people asked, "Who is this?"
The crowd answered, "This is Jesus. He is the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus drove the beggars out of the temple.
Jesus entered the temple area. He began to drive out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers. He also overturned the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "Why has the Lord stood up to judge, saying, 'My house shall be a place of holiness for the nation' (Isaiah 56:7), while you are making it a 'place of the appetite of the wicked' (Lamentations 7:11)?"
The frightened and those afflicted by impotence came to him at his mansion. And there he healed them.
The priests and the teachers, when they saw the wonderful things that he did, saw also the children in the temple area shouting: "Hosanna, Son of David!" But when they saw all this, they were indignant.
"Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked Jesus. "Yes," he replied. "Haven't you read," they retorted, "'From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise'?" (Matthew 21:16)
Then Jesus left the people and went out of the city to Bethany. He spent the night there. The Fig Tree Dries Up
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
Every stranger, near the road. He judged him.
Their eyes turned away from this, and they became blind. They asked, "How did this fig tree wither so quickly and happily?"
Jesus replied, "What I am about to tell you is the truth. You must believe and not doubt. Then you will be able to do what you did with the fig tree. You can even say to this mountain, 'Go and throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done."
If you believe, you will receive what you ask for when you pray. Jesus' authority is in question.
Jesus entered the courtyard of the mosque. While he was lecturing there, the priests and members of the crowd came to him. "By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked. "Who gave you this authority?"
Jesus replied, "I will ask you one question. If you answer me, then I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
Where did John's baptism come from? Was it from heaven, or from men? They argued with each other about it. "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Why then did you not believe him?'"
But what if we say 'of men'? We are afraid of people. Everyone thought John was a prophet.
Jesus answered, "I do not know." Jesus said, "Then I will also not tell you about the authority by which I do these things. The story of the two sons."
What are you doing with this? A man has two sons. He went to the first one and said, "My son, go and work today in the field."
"Okay, we'll do that," the son replied. But then he changed his mind and left.
I saw, after that this pope went to the second son. He told him the same thing. The son replied, 'I obey, my lord.' But he didn't leave.
"Which of the two sons did what his father wanted?" "The first one," they answered. Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John saw the right way for you to live. He was with you, but you didn't listen to him. But the leaders and the girls believed him. I saw that. But even after that, you didn't give up your sins and believe him. The story of the tenants.
Heard another story. A man had a piece of land, he planted it with vines. He put a fence around it. He dug a winepress in it. He also built a watchtower. He rented out the vineyard to some farmers. Then he went on a journey.
As the harvest time approached, he sent his servant to the tenants. He commanded them to gather his share of the fruit.
But the tenants took his slaves. They beat one of them. They killed another. They threw stones at the third to kill him.
I saw, the grocer, who is very diligent, sold another service to the neighbor. He sold more than he did the first time. The neighbor treated him the same way.
Finally, he sent his son to them. "My son will respect you," he said.
"There's a greedy one, he wants the whole house for himself. They said to each other: 'This is the one who will inherit the entire house one day. Come on, let's kill him. Then everything will be ours.'"
They didn't take him. They threw him out of the window. Then they killed him.
He doesn't need to go back, what can he do about those who imitate him?
"The wind will ruin this crop," they answered. "But he will sow the valleys for the next harvest. They will give him his share of the crop at harvest time."
Jesus said to them, "Have you not read what the Scriptures say? 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes.' " (Psalm 118:22-23)
Here is what I say to you: The kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to people who will bear its fruit.
Anyone who falls on these stones will be broken to pieces. But the stones will crush anyone who falls on them.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' stories. They knew he was talking about them.
This means they sought a way to stop him. But they feared the crowd. People believed Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Tale
Jesus told them more stories. He said,
This is like the kingdom of heaven. A king prepared a feast for his son.
He sent his servants to those who were invited to the dinner. And they told them to come. But they refused.
I saw, he sent other servants. He said, "Tell those you named that I have added dinner. I have turned over my cows and am boiling my sheep. Everything is ready. Come to the wedding dinner."
But the people paid no attention. One went to his farm, and another to his work.
The rest, they kept as slaves. They treated them with cruelty and then killed them.
The king was furious. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed those murderers and burned their city.
I saw the king's servants and he said, "The wedding feast is ready for tonight. Only those who were invited haven't arrived yet."
Go to the corners. Invite anyone you find to dinner.
Those servants went out into the streets. They gathered all the people they knew, every good person and every bad person. Soon the wedding hall was filled with guests.
The king entered to see the guests. He noticed a man who was not wearing wedding clothes.
"Father," he asked, "How did you get in here without your clothes?" He couldn't think of a single word to say.
I saw the king's servants and said, "Tie his hands and feet. Leave him outside in the dark. There, people will cry and gnash their teeth."
Many are called, but few are chosen. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went out. They planned to entrap Jesus in his words.
"They carried their leader to him. They carried the Harudites with them. 'Teacher,' they said, 'we know that you are a man of integrity. Teach the way of God truthfully. Do not let the hypocrites tell you what to do or say. Do not be concerned with their importance.'"
So, what's your opinion? Should we pay taxes to Caesar or not?
And Jesus knew their wicked plan. He said, "Why are you trying to trap me, you hypocrites?"
Show me the currency that people use to pay taxes. He showed them silver coins.
"Is this his picture? What is this talk?"
"Caesar's," they replied. Then He said to them, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left and fled. Marriage when the dead rise.
On the same day, the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They do not believe that people are raised from the dead.
"A teacher," they said, "this is what Moses told us. If a man dies without having children, his brother must marry his widow. He must father children with her so that his brother's name will not be blotted out."
There were seven brothers among us. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened to the second, third, and the brothers up to the seventh.
Finally, the woman died.
Now, when the dead rise, whose wife will she be? For she was married to seven husbands.
Jesus replied, "You are wrong, because you do not know the scriptures. Nor do you know the power of God."
When the dead rise, they will not marry. Nor will they be given in marriage. They will be like the angels in heaven.
So what if people die? Didn't you do what God told you to do?
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." (Genesis 3:6) He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
The people departed when they heard this, amazed at what He had taught them. The greatest matter.
The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus' question, so the Pharisees gathered together.
Someone was an expert in the law. So he asked Jesus a question.
"What are the most important commands in the law?" he asked.
Jesus answered, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind." (Torah of Moses 6:5)
This is the first and most important thing.
He too is like that. "Love your neighbor as you love yourself." (Deuteronomy 19:18)
"All that is written in the Law and the Prophets is based on these two things." Who is the Son of Man?
The Pharisees were assembled. Jesus asked them,
"What do you think of Christ? Whose son is he?" "The son of David," they replied.
He said to them, "Then why does David call him 'Lord'? The devil has entered him."
"The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at My right hand, till I make Your enemies Your footstool.'"
So if David called him 'Lord,' how could he be David's son?
He could only manage to utter a single word. From that day on, he never dared to ask another question.
Jesus judges the Pharisees and teachers of the law according to Jewish law.
Jesus spoke to the crowd and to his disciples.
"The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat," he said.
"You have to listen to them. Do everything they ask you to. But don't do what they do. They don't do what they say."
They load the heavy weights and strap them onto people's shoulders, but they were not prepared to do any of it themselves to move them.
Everything they ask is not to leave it as unclear as they can, on their heads and hands they wear a small craft bearing verses from the book. These crafts are too large. And they leave the threads on the coats very long.
You will be loved and cherished, and you will have the best seats at the table. You will be loved and cherished, and you will be given the most important places in the churches.
They love to be welcomed in the markets. They love it when people call them 'Lord'.
But do not let anyone call you 'Rabbi,' for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers.
Do not call anyone on earth 'father,' for you have one Father, who is in heaven.
Don't take the name "Teacher" in vain. Do not use the name of one Teacher, who is Christ, in vain.
The most important person among you will be my servant.
He who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You lock the kingdom of heaven in people's faces; you yourselves do not enter, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in.
"Please"
Woe to you, professors of religious law and hypocrites! You travel everywhere to lead one man astray, and then make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves!
Woe to you, blind leaders! You say, "Whoever swears by the temple, it means nothing. But whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is obligated to fulfill it."
You are my uncle and slow of understanding! Which is more important? Is it the gold? Or is it the temple that makes the gold sacred?
You also shall say, 'If anyone vows a vow to the Lord, or swears an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.'
O blind ones! Which is more important? Is it the gift? Or is it the rank that makes the gift sacred?
Those who swear by the threshold, they swear by it and everything about it.
And whoever speaks in the name of the temple, speaks in his own name and in the name of the One who dwells in him.
And whoever invokes the name of the Lord, invokes the name of the throne of God and the One who sits upon it.
Woe to you, professors of religious law and hypocrites! You give God a pinch of your spices, like mint, cumin, and tamarind. But you have not practiced the most important matters of the religious law, such as justice, mercy, and faith. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former.
Oh blind leaders! You remove the smallest insect from your food. But you eat a whole sentence!
Woe to you, religious scholars and hypocrites! You pretenders! You whitewashers of the outside of cups. But inside you are full of greed. You only want to satisfy yourselves.
O ignorant one! First clean the interior of the cup and dish, and the exterior also will be clean.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead people's bones and everything unclean.
This thing is like you. From the outside, you seem to be doing the right thing, but inside, you're full of emptiness. You act like you're doing something, but you're not.
Woe to you, professors of religious law and hypocrites! You pretenders! You who build the tombs of the prophets. You who adorn the graves of the righteous.
And you say, 'If we had been living in the time of our children, we would not have done what they did. We would not have been complicit in the killing of the prophets.'
So, you bear witness against yourselves. And you acknowledge that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
Finish the sins that those before you have started!
You're a nest of venomous snakes! How will you escape the carpet sentence?
So, I am sending you prophets, wise men, and teachers. You will kill some of them, and you will crucify some, and you will flog some in your synagogues, and you will drive them out from town to town.
"You are the one who will pay for the blood of every noble person on earth, from the blood of Abraham the Noble to the blood of Zachariah, the son of Bakri. It was Zachariah whom you killed between the ranks and the frames."
What's coming for me is the truth. All this will happen to those living today.
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!
Someone left your house empty.
I heard you, you're not going to come near me again until you say, "Peace be upon him in the name of Allah."
End flags
Jesus left the synagogue. He was walking away when his disciples approached him. They wanted to draw his attention to the synagogue buildings.
"Have you seen all this?" asked Jesus. "What I am going to give you is real. There will be no more stones left on top of each other. Every stone will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. There his disciples came to him privately and said, "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end?"
Jesus answered, "Watch out! Let no one deceive you."
Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ!' and they will deceive many.
You will hear about wars. And you will hear people talking about wars to come. Don't be afraid. These things have to happen. But the end is not yet here.
The nation will engage in combat with a nation. The kingdom will engage in combat with a kingdom. People will suffer from hunger. Earthquakes will occur in many places.
This is all the beginning of the birth pangs.
Who's going to deceive you, write to you, and kill you? All the countries hate you twice as much as they hate me.
At that time, many people will turn away from their religion. They will curse each other, despise each other, and fight against each other.
Many false prophets will arise. They will deceive many people.
For the abundance of evil will cause the love of many to grow cold.
But he who stands in the end will survive.
This good news for the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the world. It will be a witness to all nations. Then the end will come.
The prophet Daniel spoke of 'the abomination that desolates' (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11). One day you will see it standing in the holy place. The reader must understand this.
Then those in Judaism will have to flee to the mountains.
And if anyone is on the roof, they should go down and enter their house and take anything with them.
No one in the field returns with their bag.
I wonder if it will be very bad in a few days! I wonder if it will be very bad for the mothers of the mosquitoes as well!
Seek forgiveness from Allah lest you be compelled to flee in winter or on Friday.
This will be a great pain in those days. It will be worse than any time since the beginning of the world until now. And there will never be anything like it again.
If time were not cut short, no one would be saved. But for the sake of God's chosen people, it will be cut short.
At that time, someone may say to you, "See! Here is the Christ!" or "There he is!" Do not believe it.
False prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders. They will deceive, if possible, the elect of God.
I see, I've told you this before.
"And if anyone tells you, 'It's far outside the desert', don't go there. Or if they say, 'It's deep inside the house', don't believe them."
The lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west; so will it be on the day when the Son of Man appears.
Eagles will gather wherever there is death.
After the terrible suffering of those days, 'the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will be shaken.' (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
At that time, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with great power and great glory.
He will send His angels with a mighty blast. He will gather them from all directions on the earth. He will take them from one end of the sky to the other.
Learn a lesson from the wake-robin tree. As soon as its branches become tender and its leaves appear, you know that summer is coming.
In the same way, when you see what's coming, you say its end is near. It's still at the door.
What we're going to tell you is true. The people who were living in this situation will surely not die until all of this happens.
God and the soil will pass away, but my words will not pass away. No one knows the day or the hour.
Neither do they know this weather nor this hour. Even the angels in heaven do not know. Not even the child knows. Only the father knows.
Remember how it was in the days of Noah. It will be the same when the Son of Man appears.
In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking. They were taking wives. They were giving their daughters in marriage. They were doing all these things until Noah entered the ark.
And we knew nothing of what they were thinking, even until the end, and they all took them. That's how it will be when the Son of Man comes.
Two men will be in the field. One will be robbed and the other will be left.
Twice as many scythes as sickles. One sickle to give, one sickle to keep.
"So watch out for yourselves. You do not know what day your Lord will come."
You need to understand one thing. Imagine if the homeowner knew what time the robber was coming. Then he would have been on guard. He wouldn't have allowed his house to be robbed.
This too you must be ready for. The Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
Imagine a master who puts one of his slaves in charge of the rest of the slaves in his house. The slave's task is to feed them at the right time. The master wants a loyal and wise slave for this position.
This will be good for the servant if he finds his master doing his work when the master returns.
Whoever goes will tell me the truth. The father will leave this whole matter in the hands of the servant.
But imagine that this servant is a devil. Imagine him saying to himself: 'My master has been absent for a long time.'
If he starts beating other servants. And if he eats and drinks with those who drink greedily.
The master will review these servants on a day they do not expect. He will return at an hour the servants do not know.
The governor sent him, and he cut him with the hatchet. He sent him to the place of the traitors. There they are shackled and their teeth are filed.
The Story of Ten Grooms
This is how the kingdom of heaven will be at that time. Ten virgins took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were foolish. Five were wise.
The disease
The learned ones are like candles in the darkness.
The Godfather hasn't been active for a while. All the bodyguards are tired and asleep.
At midnight, someone shouted: "Here comes the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!"
All the virgins were called, and they took their lamps with them.
The ignorant said to the scholars, "Give us some of your oil. We have none left for our lamps."
"No," they replied. "There can't be enough for all of us. Instead, those who can, leave with those who can, by oil. Buy a little for them."
They met to buy oil. But on their way, the groom arrived. The aunts who were ready went in with him to the wedding dinner. Then they closed the door.
Later, the rest of the brides also arrived. "Oh sir! Oh sir!" they said. "Open the door for us!"
But he said, "What I am about to tell you is true. I do not know you."
Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. The parable of the three servants.
Once again, here is what the kingdom of heaven is like: A man was going on a journey. He called his servants and entrusted his property to them.
He gave 10,000 dinars to one. He gave 4,000 dinars to another. And he gave 2,000 dinars to the third. The man gave each servant the amount of money he knew they could handle. Then he set out on his journey.
The person who won the $10,000 immediately started investing it in business. He made another $10,000.
He who earned $4000, earned an extra $4000.
But the man who took two thousand dollars went and dug a hole in the ground. He hid his master's money in it.
After a long time, Sadir returned from these slaves. He wanted to seize all the money they had earned.
The man who borrowed $10,000 brought the other $10,000. He said, 'Sir, you trusted me with $10,000. Look, I've made another $10,000.'
The lady replied, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful in a few things. I will set you over many things. Come and share in your master's happiness!"
The man who had $4000 suddenly said, "Sir, I trusted you with $4000. Look, I've made another $4000."
The lady replied, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful in a few things. I will set you over many things. Come and share in your master's happiness!"
The man who demanded $2000 was occupied. He said, 'Doorkeeper, I knew you were a tough man. You avoid where you do not sow. You gather fruit where you do not cut down.'
I was scared. I went out and hid your $2000 in the ground. Look, this is yours.
Musto said: "You evil, lazy slave! Surely you knew that I was sowing where I had not sown? Surely you knew that I was reaping crops where I had not sown the seeds?"
Hadi, you should have deposited my money in the bank. When I returned, it would have come back to me with interest.
The master's order was conveyed to the other servants, saying: "Take the $2000 from him. Give it to the person who has $20,000."
He who has it will be ignored. He who has it will be ignored more than enough. What about those who don't have it? Even he who has it will have it taken away from him.
Throw this lousy service out. Out there in the dark, people will cry over it and gnash their teeth. The burden and the lamb.
The Son of Man will come in all his glory, and all the angels with him. Then he will sit on his glorious throne.
All nations will be gathered before Him. He will separate people into two groups. It will be like a shepherd separating the sheep from the goats.
He will take the sheep in front of him and the rams in front of him.
"Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father, take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.'"
I was hungry. And you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty. And you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger. And you invited me in.
I was in need of clothing, and you gave to me. I was sick, and you cared for me. I was in prison, and you came to visit me.
Those who did good were driven to Him, and they will say, "Our Lord, when we made the earth a resting place for us and chose it as a place of residence, will You then bring us out of it again? Have we then returned to You in true faith?"
When did we see you a stranger and welcome you in? When did we see you in need of clothes and give them to you?
And what are you doing? Do I see you as sick or outside the yellow line and ignore you?
The king will answer: "What I am about to tell you is the truth. Whatever you have done for one of these least brothers of mine, you did for me."
"You are accursed!" said Shazah to the Levites. "Depart from me to the fire that burns forever. It was prepared for the devil and his angels."
My stomach was tormenting me. But she didn't bring you anything to eat. I was thirsty. But she didn't bring you anything to drink.
I was a stranger. But you did not invite me. I needed clothes. But you gave me nothing. I was sick in prison. But you did not take care of me.
They also will answer and say, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to You?'
He will answer, "What I'm going to tell you is the truth. Anything I didn't do for you, I didn't do for myself either."
RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
The plan to kill Jesus
Jesus ended his speech with these words. Then he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is very close, it's in two days. The Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
The religious leaders were engaged with the elders of the people. They assembled in the palace of Caiaphas, the high priest.
They plotted to arrest Jesus cleverly. They wanted to kill him.
But not during Eid al-Fitr, they said. "They should not cause trouble." A woman anoints Jesus with perfume.
Jesus was in Bethany. He was in the house of a man named Simon, who had a skin disease.
A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster jar filled with a very expensive perfume. She poured it on his head as he was reclining at the table.
They ignited their anger when they saw this. "A little bit of this?" they asked.
The oil could have been sold at a higher price. The money could have been given to the poor.
Jesus knew this. He said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing to me."
There will always be poor people with you, but you do not always have to be upon them.
She covered my body with powder to prepare for burial.
What I'm going to tell you is right. What you've done will be said by anyone who hears these good news all over the world. They will talk about it in their memories.
One of the twelve disciples went to the chief priests. His name was Judas Iscariot.
He asked, "What are you giving me to bring Jesus to you?" They offered him thirty pieces of silver.
From that time on, Judas watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. The Last Supper
It was the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal for you?"
He said, "Go to the street to a certain man. Tell him, 'The teacher says: 'My time has come. I will hold the feast of the flock in your house with my disciples.' "
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them. And they prepared the Passover.
The darkness was past, and Jesus sat at the table with the twelve.
While they were eating, he said, "What is turning against you is the truth. One of you will surely guide me to my enemy."
The pupils were deeply saddened. One by one, they began to say to him, "Not me, Lord, is it?"
Jesus answered, "He who has dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me."
The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But how terrible it will be for the one who betrays the Son of Man! It would have been better for him if he had not been born.
Judas was the one who was going to betray him. He said, "Not me, Lord, is it?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is you."
Jesus took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is my body."
Then he took the cup, gave thanks, and offered it to them. He said, "Drink from it, all of you."
This is my blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.
This is what I'm telling you. From this moment on, I will never drink wine with you again until I drink wine with you in my father's kingdom.
When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said, "This very night, Peter, you will deny me three times."
Jesus said to them, "Tonight you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'"
But after I am raised from the dead, I will go before you to Galilee.
Peter replied: "Everyone can leave you. But I won't."
"What I am telling you is the truth," Jesus said. "This will happen tonight. Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times, just as you do not know me."
But Simon said, "I may have to die with you. But I will never say that I don't know you." All the other disciples said the same thing. Jesus prays in Gethsemane.
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
And he took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him. And he began to be sorrowful and very distressed.
She told them, "My spirit is very tired. I feel close to death. Stay here. Work with me."
He fled a little more. Then he fell with his face on the ground. So he called: "My Lord, if He remembers, then read this cup of affliction from among the lessons. But let it be as You will, not as I will."
"My steps were healed for my disciples, and I begat sleep in them." "Could you not watch with me for one hour?" asked the Messenger Peter.
"Look and remember. And then do not fall into sin when you are tempted. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
Jesus went away again. He prayed, "Father, can this cup be lifted from me? Yet if I must drink it, let it be done as you see fit."
Load up again. They called them again. They couldn't keep their eyes off them.
He left in a rage and went away. The dragon forgot about this once again.
Then he returned to the disciples. He said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Look! The hour is near. The Son of Man is about to be handed over to sinners."
Hello! Let's go! "This is the one who hands me over to them!" Jesus is arrested.
"But now he is silent, as if he were speaking. Then Judas came, one of the twelve, a chief among the people. He was armed with a sword and a club, and the chief priests and the scribes had given them authority."
Judas, who was guiding the authorities to Jesus, signaled to them. He said, "The one I kiss is the man. Arrest him."
It was as if it were Jesus. Judas went immediately and said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you have come to do." Then the men advanced and seized Jesus, arrested him, and bound him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' followers reached for his sword, drew it, and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
"Put your sword back in its place," Jesus said to him. "All who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you think I couldn't ask my father for help? He would send an army of over 70,000 angels in an instant.
But how could the scriptures possibly be true? They say that they must happen this way.
At that time, Jesus spoke to the crowd. "Did I lead a band of armed men against you?" he asked. "Did you have to come out with swords and clubs to seize me? Every day I was in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me."
But all this happened so that the words of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him and fled. Jesus was led away to be crucified.
Those who had arrested Jesus brought him back to Caiaphas, the high priest. The scribes and the elders had assembled there.
I walked, longing greatly, Patrick following behind Caesar. He read near the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and kissed the guard to see if he was alone.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could have him executed. They wanted to kill him.
But they found no evidence, although many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two other witnesses appeared.
This person said, "He claimed, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God. I can rebuild it in three days.'"
I saw the high priest standing and said to Jesus, "Will you not answer? What is it that these men testify against you?"
Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us, are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
Yes, that is true as you say, Jesus answered. "But this is what is written: In the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."
The deputy tightened his clothes and said, "He has spoken an evil word against me, may God avenge it! Why do we need two more witnesses? You heard him say this evil word."
"What do you think?" "He must die!" they answered.
Someone threatened him in his face. They hit him with their hands. Whatever they asked him, he agreed.
They said, "Tell us, Christ, who struck you?" Peter said, "I do not know."
Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. His wife's servant came to him. "You were also with Jesus of Galilee," she said.
But before them all, Peter said that wasn't so. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.
His heart was healed, and he went out to the gate by which he entered the wall. And there another maid saw him, and said to the people, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
Once again, let's admit that we didn't know him. Right, ki-ki-ki-ki-ki-ki-ki-ki-ki
A little later, those who stood there came to Peter and said, "Surely you are one of them; your accent gives you away."
I saw Peter start to curse himself. He swore at them and said, "I don't know this man!" Suddenly the rooster crowed.
I saw Peter denying the words that Jesus had spoken. He had said to him, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." Peter went out and wept bitterly.
Yusuf hanged himself.
It was early in the morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people came together and decided to kill Jesus.
They bound him and led him away and handed him over to Pilate, the governor.
Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned to death. He felt deep shame and remorse for what he had done. So he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
"I disobeyed," he said. "I delivered an innocent man." "And what does that mean?" they replied. "That's your problem."
Then Judas threw the coins in the temple and left. After that, he went and hanged himself.
The priests collected the coins. They said, "It is not lawful to put this money into the treasury of the temple. It is blood money. It is the price of a man's life."
They have decided to use the money to buy a cemetery. People from other countries will be buried there.
That's why it's still called "Field of Blood" to this day.
Then came the words which the prophet Jeremiah spoke. He said, "They took the thirty pieces of silver. And this was valued to them by the children of Israel."
They used the money to buy land for the poor, just as the Lord had commanded me.
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "Yes, as you say."
He cursed when he was urged, but did not respond.
Pilate asked him, "Do you hear the accusations they are bringing against you?"
And Jesus gave no answer, not even to a single charge. The governor was amazed.
It was the governor's custom at the festival to release one prisoner whom the people asked for.
At that time, they had a famous prisoner named Barabbas.
And so, when the people were gathered, Pilate asked the chief priests and the rulers who had been appointed by the world-wide ordination, "Whom do you want me to release for you? Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Pilate knew that the chief priests were envious. He knew that this was the reason he handed Jesus over to them.
While he was sitting in the judge's chair, his wife sent him a message. She said, "Do not associate with this man. He brings nothing but trouble. I had a terrible dream about him today."
The chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus killed.
"Which one of the two should we support?" asked the governor. "Barbasch," they replied.
"Who permitted you to do something against Jesus, who is called the Messiah?" asked Pontius Pilate. Everyone answered, "Crucify him!"
"What? What did he do wrong?" asked Bellat. But they shouted louder, "Crucify him!"
Pilate said, "I find no fault in him." But the crowd began to grow angry. He took water and washed his hands before them. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "See to it yourselves!"
Everyone answered: "I and my children will take responsibility for his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas in place of Jesus. Then they crucified him.
Soldiers and kings took Jesus to the palace, which was called Praetorium. The rest of the soldiers gathered around him.
They took off his shirt and dressed him in a purple-adorned robe.
Behold, they led him out, wearing a purple robe, and placed a crown of thorns on his head. They put a reed in his right hand, and they knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
They throw dirt at him. They hit him on the head with the stick again and again.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him of his robe. They dressed him in his own clothes. Then they led him out to crucify him. Jesus is hanging on a cross.
On their way out of the city, they met a man from Cyrene named Simon. They forced him to carry the cross.
Joe was a clever and witty man. The word Golgotha means "skull".
Here they mixed wine with bitter spices and offered it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it.
When they crucified him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots.
They were sitting and watched him there.
Above his head they placed the written charge against him: "THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
Two thieves were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
Those who paid attention shouted at Jesus and made fun of him. They shook their heads.
And he said, "So, you will destroy this temple and rebuild it in three days? Save yourselves! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"
Likewise, the scribes, the Pharisees, and the priests mocked him.
"They forgave him, they said. But he cannot save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross! Then we will believe."
And he trusts in God. O Lord, save him now if You will. He himself said, 'I am the Son of God.'
Likewise, the soldiers who were with Jesus also mocked him. Jesus dies.
From noon until the late afternoon, the whole country was covered in white.
"From the cross, why did Jesus cry out loudly, 'My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?' This translates to 'My Lord, my Lord, why have you abandoned me?' (Psalm 22:1)"
Some of those who were there heard Jesus say, "He sees Elijah."
One of them ran and got a pot. He filled it with the wine he had made and put it on a stick. He offered it to the horse to drink.
Comfort said, "Leave him. Let's see why Elijah comes to save him."
Again Jesus cried out in a loud voice, and breathed his last.
At that moment, the temple's curtains ripped from top to bottom. The earth shook. Rocks split.
The graves opened. The bodies of many innocent people who had died came back to life.
They came out of the tombs. After the resurrection of Jesus, they went to the holy city. There they appeared to many people.
The Roman centurion and those who were guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and all that had happened, were terrified. They cried out, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
He gave him a few waves, and the many faces were seen as watches. They followed him from Galilea to serve him.
Mary Magdalene was with them. Mary, the mother of John and James, was there as well. So was the mother of Peter's son, Zechariah. And Jesus was placed in a tomb.
As the evening was drawing to a close, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came. He had himself been a disciple of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Joseph took the body and wrapped it in unsoiled linen cloth.
He placed it in his new tomb that he had hewn for himself out of the rock. Then he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb. Then he went away.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The guards were at the tomb.
The second day was the day after the day of atonement.
Sir, they said, "We remember something that liar said while he was still alive. He claimed, 'In three days I will be raised again.'"
So, give the order for the tomb to be secured until the third day. If you don't, his disciples may come and steal the body, and then tell the people that Jesus has been raised from the dead. That last lie would be worse than the first.
"Take a guard," Pilate answered. "Go, make the tomb as secure as you can."
They went and made the tomb secure. They put a seal on the stone and set a guard.
Jesus, the resurrection and the life, is alive.
The Sabbath was over. Dawn was breaking on the first day of the week when Mary Magdalene and the other women went to the tomb.
There was a great earthquake. The angel of the Lord came down from heaven. The angel went to the tombs, rolled away the stone, and sat on it.
His body shone like lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so terrified of him that they trembled and became like dead men.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified."
Come here! It's done, just as he said it would be! Come and see the spot where it was.
Hurry! Tell his followers: He has risen from the dead. He is ahead of you, handing over Goliath. That's where you will find him. I have told you so.
And so the women fled from the tomb. They were afraid, but also full of joy. They went to tell the disciples.
Suddenly, Jesus met them. He said, "Peace be with you!" They came near to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, where they will see me." The guards reported this to the chief priests.
"Reaching the utmost limits of their wandering, some of the houris came down to the square. They gathered at the edges of what they had chosen as their preferred spots, like rows of pearls."
The chief priest conspired with the elders, devised a plan, and gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
Tell the soldiers, "We want you to say, 'The Gileadites came at night. They stole his body while we were sleeping.'"
If the governor hears about this ruble, we'll have to pay him off. That'll keep you out of trouble.
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus' final orders to his disciples.
The eight disciples occupied themselves with the nineteen disciples and went to Galilee. They went to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
The people turned away when they saw them, and worshipped them. But some of them kept asking questions.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
Teach them to obey everything that I have commanded you. And be sure that I am always with you, to the end.
John the Baptist is present at the entrance of the Messiah.
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
From ancient times, Isaiah the prophet wrote: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
A herald cries out in the desert: "Prepare the way of the Lord. Make straight his paths."
And so John went about. He would seize people in the desert. He would also preach that people should seize themselves and come near to their sins. Then God would forgive them.
All the people from the region of Judea went out to meet him. And all the people of Jerusalem came with him. When they allowed him, they baptized him in the Jordan River, and the most righteous of them descended into the water.
John was wearing a shirt and a camel's wool cloak. He had a leather belt around his waist. He was eating locusts and wild honey.
This is what John was saying: "After me comes a man who is stronger than I. I am not good enough to stoop down and untie his sandals."
I baptize you with water. But he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit. Jesus is praised and tested.
At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
Esau was coming out of the water. Suddenly, he saw the sky opening, and he saw the Holy Spirit coming upon him like a dove.
A voice called out to him from heaven. It said, "You are my son, and I love you. I am very pleased with you."
At that same moment, the Holy Spirit sent Jesus into the desert.
He was in the desert for forty days. There, demons tempted him. Jesus did not harm the wild animals. Angels submitted to him. Jesus chose his first disciples.
After John was imprisoned, Jesus went to Galilee. He was preaching the good news from him.
"The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God is near. Repent of your sins and believe in the good news!"
One day, Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. He saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the water. They were fishermen.
"Gather. Stand behind me," he ordered. "Here come the Bani Aqil hunters."
In a moment, they left the windows and followed him.
Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
"They were allowed to go, and they turned to their father, Zebed the glorious, in the gates with the devoted worshippers. Then they followed Jacob. The Jews dedicated the spirit of demons."
Jesus and his disciples went to Capernaum. And when it was the Sabbath day, he entered the synagogue and began to teach.
People were amazed at his teaching. He taught them as one who had authority, not as the scribes.
Thus, a man cried out in the midst of the market. He was possessed by a demon of the street. He said:
What do you want from us, Jesus Christ? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Victorious One of God!
"Be silent!" Jesus said sternly. "Come out of him!"
The demonic spirit violently shook the man. Then it exited him with a scream.
Everyone was surprised. They asked each other, "What is this? A new lesson! And a very powerful one! Even the elders are receiving orders from him, and they are obeying."
News about Jesus spread rapidly everywhere in Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Esau and those with him abandoned the synagogue. Immediately they went with Justus and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed with a fever. They told Jesus about her.
He is charming. He took her by the hand and helped her stand up. The fever had left her. Then she started serving them.
One evening after sunset, people brought all the sick to Paul for healing. They also brought all those who were afflicted by evil spirits.
Everyone gathered at the door.
Jesus healed many of them. They were afflicted with various diseases. He also cast out many demons. But he would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prayed in a solitary place.
It was very early in the morning, and the night was still dark. The shepherd got up and went out of the house. He went to a place where he could be alone. There he prayed.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
If they had let me, when they saw him, they would have said, "Everyone saw you!"
Jesus answered, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages, so I can preach there also. That is why I have come."
So he traveled throughout all of Galilee. He preached in their synagogues and also cast out demons. Jesus heals a man who had a skin disease.
And the leper who had leprosy entreated Jesus, kneeling down and saying, "If You are willing, You can make me clean."
Esau was filled with deep emotions. He reached out his hand and touched the man. He said, "I am ready to do this! Be 'purified'!"
Immediately, the disease left him. He was healed.
He immediately called on Christ. And he gave the man a severe warning.
"What he's saying is for anyone. He said, 'Make yourself clean and present yourself to the priest. Offer the sacrifices prescribed by Moses. This will be a testimony to the priest and the people that you are 'clean'."
But the man went out and began to proclaim it freely, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town. He remained in secluded places, but people kept coming to him from all quarters.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk.
After a few days, Jesus entered Capernaum again. The people heard that he had returned to his home.
The people gathered in large numbers; there was no more room, not even outside the door. And Jesus spoke to them in parables.
Four of those who came were carrying a man who couldn't walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after removing some tiles, they lowered the man on a mat.
Esau saw their faith. Then the man said to him, "My son, your sins are forgiven."
Some law teachers were sitting there. They were thinking,
Why does he talk like that? He's saying something really bad! He's just a yes-man!
Immediately, Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to them, "Why are you thinking these things?"
Is it easier to say to this man, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Stand up, take your mat and walk"?
"This I say to you, that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he said to the man who was paralyzed, "Rise, pick up your bed, and go home."
"I saw you," he said, "Get out of here. I'll take your car and whatever comes back to you."
The man got up, and at once he could see. Then he went away, and they all saw him. They were all amazed. They praised God and said, "We have never seen anything like this!" Jesus chose Levi.
After this, Jesus went out again beside the Sea of Galilee, where a large crowd came to him. So he taught them.
The tax collector Levi was sitting at the tax booth. When Jesus saw him, he said to him, “Follow me.” And he got up and followed him.
Later, Jesus was dining at the home of Levi. Many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him, along with his disciples. They were part of the large crowds that followed Jesus.
There were some teachers of the law who were Pharisees. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and "tax collectors." So they asked his disciples, "Why does Jesus eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
Jesus heard this. He said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance." He was asked about fasting.
John's disciples and the Pharisees' disciples were fasting. People came to John and said to him, "John's disciples fast, and the Pharisees' disciples fast, but your disciples do not fast. Why do they not fast?"
Jesus answered and said, "How can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast."
But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him.
People don't sew a new piece of cloth onto old clothes. If they do, the new cloth will come off and the garment will be ruined.
People don't put new wine in old wineskins. If they do, the wine will burst the wineskins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they put new wine in new wineskins. Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and his disciples began to pick some heads of wheat, rubbing them in their hands to eat the kernels.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! It is against the law to do this on the Sabbath. Why are your disciples doing it?"
Clean
Now Abiathar was the priest. David came to Ornan's house and bowed down to God. The priest offered the hallowed bread, for only the priests were allowed to eat of it. David also gave some to his companions.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.
Treatment on Saturday
A visit to the doctor is advisable, as a person has a hand that has weakened and become deformed.
Some Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They watched him closely. They wanted to see whether he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus said to the man who had the withered and crooked hand, "Stand up before everyone," he said.
Jesus looked around at them and said, "Then what does the Law say? What do you think it means when it says, 'Do not murder'?" No one answered.
Jesus looked at them with anger in his eyes. He was very angry because their hearts were hard. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he did, and his hand was restored, as good as new.
The Pharisees were occupied; they went out and began to plot with the Herodians. They wanted to kill Jesus. The crowds followed him.
Jesus went to the Sea of Galilee with his disciples. A large crowd from Galilee followed him.
The people heard about all that Jesus was doing. And large crowds came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan River, and the region around Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowd, Jesus told his disciples to prepare a small boat for him. This would prevent people from crowding around him.
Jesus healed many people. So those who had been marginalized were no longer ashamed but came to him for help.
And when the evil ones saw him, they bowed down to him. And the spirit cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
But he commanded them that they should tell no man who he was. Jesus appoints the twelve apostles.
Esau went up to the hill. He called some people to come to him, and they came.
He appointed twelve of them as messengers, and they have been with him ever since. He also sent them to spread the message.
They had the authority to cast out demons.
And Jesus did not appoint the twelve. Simon was among them. He gave him the name Simon, who is Peter.
There were James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. Jesus gave them the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder.
There were also Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, and James, the son of Alphaeus. And there were Thaddeus and Simon the Zealot.
Judas the Israeli was also among them. He was the one who would later hand Jesus over to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebub
Jesus entered a house. Again a large crowd gathered. The crowd was so large that Jesus and his disciples could not even eat.
His family heard about it. They were shocked. They said, "He's out of his mind."
Some of the teachers were heretics. They had come from Jerusalem. They said, "He is under the power of Beelzebul! He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons."
Jesus' parable about them and His reference to them in stories. He said, "How can Moses drive out Moses?"
If a kingdom is at war with itself, it cannot stand.
If the family breaks up, you can't bear it.
