What a pity! This is an opportunity we won't waste.
Also, I'm not going to interfere in this matter. It's my right to take it, and you have the right to take it before me.

"Arrogance, it doesn't suit you..., oh my naive friend!"
Oh God, is there a brother who speaks to his brother the way you're speaking to me?
partnership partnership partnership partnership
And I found a big party.
The celebration doesn't concern anyone.
Tell yourself that.
This holiday won't come around again.
Alright, Saleh, don't do anything weird!
They took the opportunity from us.
No, no, no, no, don't think you can convince me, it's impossible, impossible, I'm not doing that.
The problem is that he's afraid.
What are you afraid of?
This is a government project! Everyone is taking.
It's the law!
Even those who don't participate benefit from it.
And he is the chairman of a massive project.
This means he's in control.
The third millennium international beaches, specifically the first phase of the infrastructure.
You fool, you're doing great.
Here we can steal!
If he refuses to take
Who did you take the curtain from?
You don't have the right to exploit her.
Since his car wouldn't start.
Who was taking him to the project site? Wasn't it me?
No, if that's the case, you're right.
Who gives you money to wash your car four or five times!
Leave it to me.
McLoch is stupid and stubborn.
Serve your own interests.
Look, Uncle Thursday
And now, as they say, they call him a millionaire.
One third of the project
The remaining third is commission.
The musician playing in a traditional band.
People say there's a national celebration.
And he bought 100 branches.
Do you know what they did?
I added the zero.
There's no use, auntie!
No, God guides him if he is pleased.
Eat with us.
I spent last night trying to convince him.
This is an opportunity.
So that good prevails.
And God willing, good will prevail.
This is common.
Let's be modest.
Don't tell anyone this.
Do we have to be afraid?
But, my friends
Neck pain.
The man began to change his mind.
I spoke with him today.
Two hours in the morning.
His resolution began to waver.
We have a meeting with him soon.
We need to convince him.
They betrayed our trust.
The atmosphere was so overwhelming that it made him change his mind about the meeting.
Brother Ali, Brother Uthman.
I don't know, I guess.
Today is my first day of work.
Your trust in me
How not to reach!
Sure. But are you sure I'll get it?
I want to ask you
If you're hungry and walking down the street
Are you eating or not?
I am a person who eats a lot.
Alright, Uncle, don't worry.
The dish is large.
Softly, softly, softly, softly, softly, softly.
If you're not okay,
If you have any concerns
The thing I really want to know
It is permissible.
Oh God, guide you, Saleh!
That's reasonable because you're voting for a committee chair for the first time in your life.
This is very easy.
We will list our share.
In the project budget?
What do you see?
So that no one suspects what we're doing.
We put our share as a separate item!
This amount of money has been stolen.
In the hands of the users who are implementing the project.
Cannot
No, no, no, Ya! Saleh!
Do you know how this happens?
But it seems you have some concerns.
They have a right.
First and last,
Everything is in our hands.
I told you he's a liar.
What happened to you?
It's natural that the new car follows its owner, and you believe it.
He said!
He's still riding his friend's car.
In a very special place, too!
Except for a very rich man.
I haven't heard that from the people.
He vacated and told me that he had purchased the land and registered it in his name.
He said, "Please."
This is his money now.
Now he will start lying.
Won't our parents forget him?
What?
Aren't we going to do anything?
They're waiting for something!
He increased her loneliness and isolation.
Don't lose your head!
Not even your brother
Sit and everything will be fine.
I talked with him all night.
I told him that no matter what, they are your relatives.
Finally, he agreed.
This is what's required.
And please don't let it happen even once.
This is the third thousand international beaches.
More specifically, infrastructure.
Then they'll start the second cycle.
And you will end up with him.
May God grant you the best provision.
Praise be to God that you made them agree.
You're no different from them.
Just forget it.
I wish you had explained it to him.
We want a percentage.
Everyone is calculating the percentage.
Until he said, after I convinced him.
They asked their friends to come to a meeting to determine the project budget.
They need to follow up, it's their money.
They built it and are sure of it.
Send it back as soon as possible for approval.
Be careful.
Who is this? Do you control him?
He is my uncle's brother and he shares with me.
Do you mean that?
You will be responsible for doors, windows, and all aspects of finishes.
Okay, okay
How much do you want, so we can finish?
How much do you receive?
Is this what we get paid for?
We need a week to think about it.
And we'll determine the amount of money we'll get.
People are waiting and they want
Abdulaziz is right.
If someone decides to take half a million.
During this week, everyone will think carefully.
And they specify the amount they desire.
They'll decide their opinion and how much they want.
"Mashi Shank" does not translate directly
Okay, so you're still the one who chooses?
Don't forget it.
My friend, how are you? What happened to you?
I don't know what he's doing here.
I wonder who allowed you to come to this project?
This is a government project.
Sultan, that's your brother's name!
He's our neighbor's driver.
Sometimes we get to the point where the car doesn't start.
Write
Sanad Abdullah.
Okay, there are three other people.
What else can I say, I'm tired of it.
I told him, "Enough! Man, let's discuss the budget and finish."
Okay, that will be very expensive.
How much do I need to put in?
You wretch, does he have children?
Yeah, he has it, let's make it twenty-four thousand three hundred.
Four hundred
They criticize him harshly.
How much will you put them for!
That's too much.
This is my mother, as we were just talking about her.
Yes, Mother.
Yes, no, no, no, this is the last one, son!
Alright, my love. Your wife wants to go to Thailand for treatment.
Wait, wait, what happened?
What's bothering you?
Only from the first stage, specifically the infrastructure.
Not new
Add three thousand.
Sell me Thai hours in a bottle of minister color.
Did you add her?
Yes, Mother.
Mom, because I didn't add her yet, I just wanted to confirm the name.
Oh my darling, my mother.
Let's make the celebration bigger.
Yes, but the budget needs to be set; it can't be open-ended like this.
Tomorrow is our last meeting and everyone needs to decide on the amount they want.
I have this.
Will a million be enough?
Oh my darling, that's too much.
Guys, guys, wait, he's crying, give us a chance.
The committee is meeting now to approve the project's budget. Financial matters will not be discussed at this time. That's all there is to it.
I want more.
You told us not to do anything to make us happy, we are in the ministry's square.
Oh no, they're talking, don't look at us.
If someone came and told you what would make you all happy here
We'll let him know that the power is out or if it's just flickering.
There is no noise in the ministry square.
%pw Silent %pw Silent
Thread! Can you hear me!
Were you with them? What's the budget now?
Without counting my brother
Fully, 50 million
Fifty million, that's just for phase two.
How old is Heidi?
What's up, Saleh?
Share means care, man!
"Look, enjoy your meal."
Come on, let's hurry up and get to work, all the beneficiaries are waiting for us.
Alright... the main thing is, we don't want any discussions. If they agree on the budget, that's it.
And start implementing tomorrow.
And it serves a very large segment of society.
God bless you, this is the third millennium international beaches project.
This is the first stage.
More specifically, the infrastructure.
For the coming days
Absolutely, and on behalf of our team, I would like to welcome and congratulate you on starting the project tomorrow, as I understand.
What took us a year and a half
Half a year and a half
"In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. From the items of the receivers' program,"
This project
And future generations
May God preserve the blessing of oil for us.
Second, third, and tenth round.
Agent
Welcome aboard, passengers.
Why have we been gathered here, and when will our cars take us?
What? Where are they going to take us?
Praise be to God, I've grown up and become crazy.
Come on, let's go, the sun is getting hot.
Yes, she's a good girl.
But I can't see anything.
Anything but the sea.
Why were you fired?
It was Amna who told me that my sister Munira is here.
My father's land in the desert.
I wish I knew who lied to her and gave her wrong information.
That's not the ground.
I saw a farm in the desert and thought it was yours.
Moreover, why do you ask about these things?
Do you have brothers?
Who takes it seriously, invests in land, real estate, companies, and exerts effort.
Free from headache
Oh Iman, I'm afraid of you for you.
Also, my sister.
How wouldn't you know?
I need to give it to her.
They are your sisters.
And there is nothing better than truth.
"Because of the money."
Now we help her and drive her to the hospital.
I don't know how many years she spent with her brothers in court.
Nineteen years, if not more.
No, just.
Salma's brothers are thieves.
Oh no, she was telling me yesterday that
She wants to build a mosque before she dies.
Don't know.
I won't say your sisters are like hers, God forbid they are.
My father died a few years ago.
Why are you asking now?
And she saw the farm.
What else do you want from him?
Is the check paid to her every three months?
Calm down, let's understand the story first.
It doesn't have to be her responsibility.
If it were someone else, even his sisters wouldn't get a penny.
I have
Where from?
As if it's not mine.
What do you see, Morena?
Look at him.
Consists of fifty thousand.
Because I had the courage to ask about my father's land, the one in the desert.
I'm sure my share is more than that.
Everyone lives in a villa like this.
Their children are in the best schools.
What can I say, Munira!
I won't apologize for standing up for my rights.
I will take my right hand.
The best thing is to invest your money in the company! Not grateful.
Everyone is quarreling with each other.
People have no mercy anymore.
What do you eat when your brother is angrier than me?
Look at me.
Twenty years
I used to go to the court a lot.
And in the end
I didn't benefit from it at all.
Why are they doing that?
That's what's happening, my dear! Be nice to them.
Treat them kindly.
"And they are the ones you will miss."
And why do courts take so long?
We are four hundred thousand strong.
If we get a million like others.
I am so eager, my dear, to suspect something.
See my sisters.
I swear by our Lord, I don't want all this.
I'm not talking, my God!
I can only say that God alone is enough for us, and He is the best manager of our affairs.
God is sufficient for us, and He is omnipotent.
Didn't you take last month's case?
"By our will, my dear friend!"
The sheikh asked us to write a memo.
We've been wasting this a lot.
My dear, they invest millions, and you'll just get it in the eye.
And as I told you, you'll be tired of the courts.
And you're ready to take what's yours.
That's what makes me talk to you, if I were in your place.
I'll take whatever they give me.
Because the woman
We don't owe you anything.
The men are asking for your permission!
She has it.
But a few questions about her class and
She just wants to know something and come.
If I don't find you
With my tail I will guide you, and I will show you the way.
He'll find his way.
You signed a resignation document.
Two and sixty and a lot of work is enough for her, her husband is working.
Either you do it or forget about it.
Why are you asking now?
But he desires things a lot.
As if it's not real.
This is my dead father, and he wants to decide how much to take, take it or twist it.
What's between me and him is decided.
This is an order from God.
Why are they tormenting my father in his grave?
I didn't expect that from them.
For money.
Opened thirty years ago.
Oh, Nasser, I don't know what to do.
Land, buildings, and real estate are easy to understand.
I don't know how much they take.
Even the company,
You have the right to ask about everything that empowers you.
And I won't leave them alone.
How will you find them again?
This can't be your original work.
And you don't have the right to do that to me either. I have the right to know everything.
Please provide
Your sister gave him power of attorney.
He is allowed to see everything in the company.
Saquar, Sa'id
He's always getting angry with us.
"Saquar, enough."
Nasser's brother
Drain, absorber
Yes, sir.
Get out, now.
If you understand, leave.
Don't give him a chance to attack us.
Now, if he went and accused us,
And he said, "You struck me."
Okay, do we let him do what he wants?
He has an official document.
Official! We can't stop him.
He has the legal right to examine everything.
If he sees the budget and accounts
Dina gets a bonus of 40,000 every 3 months.
If he examines the budget,
Multiply nine by nine.
Qassem is divided into three.
Twenty-three
Do you know how much?
This is the amount we need to pay her.
Except for lands and projects
We are free to do whatever we want.
I'm not afraid of anything, I'm not afraid.
If you don't agree, that's what happened. If you agree, well, welcome.
Leave them alone and deal with them.
She just gives her money to her sisters to live on.
She is married.
She has a husband she trusts.
What do you want to do with the money?
This is what was required from the beginning.
Yes, sir.
As he likes.
Even my desk.
Rashid's brother, this should have happened before.
Okay, boss.
One file after another
When she learned about her true heritage.
Villas and lands you didn't know about
They came out seven.
They are 16.
I don't know.
She was weak, and in astonishment.
This is unbelievable.
Don't leave them alone.
Oh God! My son, I don't want to hear about courts.
All you're worried about,
All that the judge diminished.
For a quarter of a minute
And then he'll say his usual phrase.
To the seventh, fourth, two thousand, I don't know how much.
They are very nurturing to my child.
I can't even get out of bed, Mom!
May God heal you.
Okay, okay, Mom, don't hesitate.
Nasir and my sister Manar
After we knocked on the door and they kicked us out of the company.
This is a message from one of my old school friends.
His name is Abdullah.
And now
I'll allow it.
Does he have the ability to influence them?
"Ya rab yekoon" Translation: "Hopefully it is" or "May it be"
AAA
Don't burden the courts.
Courts do nothing but submit reports.
Delays and battles, neglected lawyers.
The years are passing by.
And time passes by.
And you won't take a single real.
God have mercy on Umm Salama.
She advised me a day before she died.
Don't take it to court.
He said that our courts
She died without claiming any of her inheritance.
She died while the judge was still working on her case.
So, what if we were like other countries?
O Abdullah
Abdullah's brother
The years have passed.
This is my brother, Saad.
Perhaps you will grow in good character.
The most important thing
This is brotherhood.
Rashid's brother
You are a brother to me.
Don't mix business with pleasure.
Can we talk about something other than my sister?
Insistent
Why should I ask him to stop talking?
It's correct.
It's not right for him to sell me my share of my father's inheritance.
My mother told me today that my sister, Saad,
Her father works in the ministry.
All this is from my father's money.
"You are being too nostalgic."
We'll try one last time.
You sent them your friend, Abdullah.
They didn't respect him, and they even expelled him.
Let's see what Sheikh Abdurrahman is doing.
He is a very kind man.
Surely Nasser said.
Don't be afraid.
Scaring them with the law.
Did you forget what the weak Umm Salama said about the courts?
The brothers of Mother Salmin may not fear the courts.
But, my brothers
He might be afraid of what people say.
They might be fermenting the idea of going to court.
We are waiting and watching to see what will happen after Sheikh Abdul Rahman's visit to them.
God bless you.
Is this a yeast sermon?
If you don't have it, leave.
What are you saying, son?
This is the truth.
Go, %pw go
I'm going to the court tomorrow morning.
And why do I have to postpone until after tomorrow?
I'm the one who decides, not you.
What will happen if I wait until tomorrow morning?
Oh brother Rashid, peace be upon you.
This is a promise.
I've told you this before.
Let's threaten them with legal action.
Now, he is urging me to postpone going to court.
So I knew you were serious, my love.
It's important that we go visit your sister Mina.
What is this?
You asked me, "What is this?"
God bless you all.
This is a miniature model of the courthouse.
God bless you.
And all of you
May God keep you well.
Didn't I tell you?
I told you to come today.
And we will restore it to its right after a while tomorrow.
To %pw get this sample from %pw Court Building
Ready to show you the way.
Enter through this door, this one.
When you enter through the door,
You laid out all your belongings there.
Mobile and anything metallic so it doesn't make a "beep beep beep beep" sound.
Register the case, they'll tell you to go to the eighth floor, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, take the elevator.
Circle around the desks.
See the judge, if you really need a specific judge, for example.
Also, these.
They want to hurt us.
We're here to show her the way.
We'll see when you'll get your revenge.
Either take the six thousand.
As he said.
Goodbye
We're having dinner at my sister's today.
I wonder, has the bill been passed yet?
My sister told me he was very happy, I didn't believe her.
He said, "If you agree on the project, I'll invite you for dinner at my place."
Praise be to God, luck comes in pairs.
How happy you must be, Abu Al-Waleed!
Praise be to God in all His states.
My sister told me he was very happy and couldn't sleep last night.
Praise be to God! Oh Manal!
He doesn't have experience in the job, but good people are helping him.
Okay, tell your father.
I hope you liked the food.
Thank you, mom and dad!
Thank you, Abu Walid! May God bless you.
May God make your life rich.
A newborn meal, Mother of Khalid
Hire an accountant and a secretary to organize your work.
They told me to just rent an office, and they'll take care of everything.
Please take a few, Uncle.
Oh my darling, my son.
I want a BlackBerry.
We feel like we need a bigger house.
Look, it looks better now.
Dad, didn't we agree that I would speak after lunch?
And now, ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming the project's founder, my father, Bou Walid.
Excuse me, sorry.
Congratulations, O father of Waleed!
You deserve
But frankly, you're not an expert in business and trade.
Man, there's a story behind this project.
They'll tell you how!
Praise be to God.
Last year
Why did the Japanese player play with our national team?
I was at Souk Waqif.
Not deeply into it right now.
This is a manufacturer's catalog for multi-purpose halls, our ministry is looking for them, please forward to them.
Any contractor can build it for you.
He doesn't understand.
Any contractor
Japanese people are wonderful.
When you open it, the computer says:
Cinema, if you like.
I want a kitchen, press on kitchen.
When I presented the catalog to the ministry committee,
So, what about your contract with the factory?
I paid a little.
Deposit
Most importantly, your contract with the factory.
I signed it, praise be to God.
And give me time until I order first.
What are you waiting for?
Surely they endorsed him.
But we're still waiting for Bu Fahd's signature.
Who did the snake bite?
He said that Bu Fahad didn't show up.
Come on, do you want some tea?
Oh, Waa'd, what have you done!
You don't know Abu Fahd, he might come, and he might not.
One day, it will come.
He doesn't have time.
I wonder, come on.
You are the boss here.
Are you going to kill me?
No, he has to sign.
See all these files in my library, all of them need the signature of Abu Fahd.
Okay! What can I do?
God help you.
Only fifteen minutes until two! I promise.
The time has come for us to go to our house.
I don't think Bou Fahd will come.
God help you, she'll be here tomorrow.
You said you've known the manager for a long time and he's your friend.
What happened to you?
He is a desk manager.
Oh eccentric manager, they don't do anything.
What a pity, wise men like that don't exist.
They don't do anything useful.
Do they ever do anything?
They don't move a chair without Bu Fahad's permission.
The manager didn't ask about you today.
Popular matters are pending.
It seems like you're going to them today as well.
I'm in trouble.
I suffer from problems every day.
Because the factory gave me limited time.
No, please don't let it be like that.
And if they ask about you
It's not reasonable, but you're the one waiting for Abu Fahd.
Look at these files.
Everyone needs Abu Fahd's signature.
I think he'll come today.
Please sit down.
Walk, or take a walk.
I will kidnap you.
If anything happens, you'll call them, don't disturb them.
Welcome!
I'm sorry, I was worried about you. She's my wife.
Oh my God, they finally agreed to my appointment after two months!
He just needs to sign, what's the big deal?
My son, this is the time for enrollment. My daughter will miss the university scholarship opportunity; her documents need to be processed.
My problem is with the factory, the deadline, and the deadline.
Wait a bit.
All your papers will be signed.
He's drinking his coffee, once he's done, you can come and see him.
Please, I asked you calmly.
Yes, sir.
Goodbye
Wait, wait! Hey, guys!
Wait, where are you going? Wait.
What happened first?
What happened?
He has an urgent trip.
He has a special exit.
I'm tired of this.
Our interests stopped, my brother.
We see Abu Fahd every day.
What can we do, wait for Abu Fahd?
Peace be upon you, my father.
He is not to blame.
Everyone is getting fat.
The factory is in Japan.
I told him that the confrontation had ended.
And your sister is a different story.
Oh, nonsense! That's just throwing money away.
You'll find problems coming at you from every direction.
Oh mother, I am very worried about father.
Leave it alone.
What are you going to call him?
Yes, who is this?
Bu Waleed
You're talking about the factory and your aunt's money.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Oh father, how long do you want me to wait?
Oh, their manners!
We miss Abu Fahd.
Oh grandfather, you ran in the most eloquent of moods.
But all my friends are going to the university next week.
What is this?
Phone, my love
Okay, but give me some time.
Okay, who are you going to talk to?
Wait, Abu Fahd.
I don't know what to say, sister.
You are very patient with us.
God help you.
Bu Waleed is in a bitter situation.
And it turns like a leaf due to the wind.
This is because the appointment is almost over.
Five days remaining
He's going to lose all his money.
God is sufficient for us.
This is worse, right? It disgusts me, disgusts me, disgusts me.
I wish I felt better. I feel awful.
I have a strange fever.
The cat is chasing its tail.
Not at all.
Fifty percent of my body is useless due to the poison.
This is a discount.
Alright, Uncle, don't worry.
Everyone will be fine.
My sister is helping.
You will wait until we refund her money.
May God reward her generously.
Aren't you worried about your sister now?
Main violin, God help me.
It seems he heard.
God knows what He has in store for me.
I'm annoyed with him and Bu Fahd.
You're getting on my nerves, that's a problem.
Tomorrow is the last day.
My wealth is disappearing.
Don't mess it up.
In the brain, in the mind
How will you be able to speak?
Pay me back, and we'll see who's welcoming whom.
Mr. Bou Walid
I'm asking for your permission because I feel for you.
Be on standby.
Goodbye
I was a committed person throughout my life.
Your role model was...
Don't you notice that you leave work every day?
I can deduct from your salary.
What's on your phone?
Instead of taking away from you
I'll put you on the stock committee.
Are you coming with them today?
You never leave work during work hours?
If I work
Please, don't blame me.
Today is his last chance.
Don't you see him looking anxious, holding his phone waiting for their call?
I'm afraid he's being considered for a promotion.
These are my mobiles! Oh, father of Walid.
He is very sad.
Leave it, you idiot.
Oh Wael!
Yes, hello
What happened to you, Abu Walid? I'm talking to you, not the phone.
Conclude your research.
Alright, Uncle, don't worry.
Many thanks
It seems that Boo Fahad is here.
Is there anything I can help you with?
He is a very important officer.
Where are you going?
Let's go to Uzbekistan.
Brother, where is Uzbekistan?
This is the third office on your left.
Don't choke.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
What are you eating?
Don't look at me.
Or do you want to?
House by house
Forward-looking
Guys, this guy is crazy!
Do you know how much you spent?
Out of all these years, you.
Take the papers, return the papers.
My knee is weakening now.
Waver, waver between all these Ministries
But we were young.
Sometimes I would carry bags of rice on my back like kids' potato chip packs.
After that, God willing, I learned how to ride a bike.
Especially the bicycle that I learned to ride and bought.
Green olives
They're giving me a hard time while I'm driving this car, God.
This is our daily bread, raising our children.
The manager has arrived.
We should celebrate after you finish.
Praise be to God, praise be to God.
Okay, are you going to quit your job or not?
I assure you that you are truly a good citizen.
Now I want to rest, brother. Goodbye.
We are all for you.
Won't you want us to give you a one-year extension?
Enough, enough
May God reward you with good.
You already gave me a four-year extension.
I should have retired a long time ago.
All my children have jobs now.
The last one, yesterday was his first day of work.
And now, oh! Abu Abdulaziz,
I want to rest.
And you're just a delivery guy.
With the traitors
Do you think that
I missed you for four years.
Oh, wow!
I can smell it now.
Let's do everything we want.
Take me to the HR department.
Have you finished all the papers?
Yes, since yesterday.
Your papers will need to be delayed.
I'm bored.
Complete
Stay in touch.
O sons of Khalid
From this moment on,
Oh Lord, grant me ease.
Wonderful, wonderful
I'm at work and I can't leave.
Can you stop by the general human resources department?
I have some papers over there.
I want you to take them to the Civil Service Office.
Thank you, thank you, Father.
Evak, where are you going?
I need to go to the bank.
And she always leaves us all.
Yes, now.
I need to go to the bank.
Send it with someone else.
Oh, sister, I won't be able to get out of work.
Okay, bye.
It seems he didn't agree, did he?
He said he couldn't leave his job.
What are you going to do?
I'll go to the bank tomorrow morning.
He walks to work every day.
I'm sure he'll feel bored.
This is why it's good.
Is this the one you will allow to prosper?
You sneaky thing, happy that he'll be back early.
He disconnected and said that Khalid...
Send him to me to finish his papers.
Be humble before God.
Everyone needs to be confident.
My mother regrets buying the car.
Oh Mama, it doesn't hurt.
No problem with the bat! My daughter,
But I'm saying because he resigned from the job and left.
And Khalid gave him tasks to do.
He's sleeping in his room.
Those who are struck by the sea (sing).
Good morning, Father.
Oh, my daughter!
Oh Father, please.
They just told me to call them and said the manager was upset.
Show me your papers.
Yes, O Mother of Saeed
I told you, let the children be independent. Why don't you listen to me?
As if you hadn't resigned.
What a pity.
I'm waiting for you, and the firefly is in front of me.
We'll put it today.
Goodbye
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.
My dear father
God help you.
Yes, the one next to the market.
Get out of here quickly.
I'm gone, oh! My daughter, I'm gone.
Oh Lord, in Your name, O Merciful, Most Merciful.
God willed it.
Praise be to God that you found your house.
Sitting, sitting, sitting
I told you to stay home.
Let your children do their own work.
What can I do, Umm Saeed?
We put them in a bind, I need to help them.
Enough, enough, relax.
I'll get you a glass of water.
And the hen eats it.
You wicked woman, he is very tired.
And there are taxis.
He is unaware.
He went to the market branch.
And Babygo its identity.
I don't even speak Arabic.
And she gave him the papers.
I'm feeling better, praise God.
Have faith in yourselves.
I told you.
You are relaxed.
Take a chair and sit with us.
The view is very appetizing.
I went from one ministry to another.
I run from one ministry to another.
I'm doing my kids' homework.
You cared for them when they were small, you worry about them now, and you are overprotective of them.
My children are in good positions in their jobs.
And they're always doing things, what can I do?
Meetings happen every day, with the manager, or with the boss, or with the minister.
They have good jobs, when they are in demand they need to be present, this is 100% work.
So you can go out and get your work done, others have to stop and pay you to sit all the time, what were you thinking?
"Okay, I'll be there. May God be pleased with you."
Now, goodbye.
Sorry, sir! Yes! Yes, Mr. Bo Shahin.
They would have said about me and told me that he is ready.
If you take your father tomorrow to finish your work,
If so, I'll still be late for work.
Oh Lord, have mercy.
Maybe, especially tomorrow, I won't know.
He loves you, that's why.
Although he is upset and tired because you have treated him badly.
You don't respect him at all, you don't even respect his age.
He was tired and fell asleep in the morning two days ago.
Due to walking in the streets in extreme heat.
Yes, he gave him the signs.
And leave immediately to accomplish it.
A committee, starting from early morning until afternoon.
How are you, Mama? Did you hear this news?
Do you know I want to delay the construction of my building?
For your sake, and I'll ask the committee tomorrow.
Your papers need to be ready by tomorrow.
Some of them at night.
He has a committee meeting tomorrow, he needs to be present.
Is there a problem, sir?
He choked back his tears.
In fact, I didn't lie to Abby.
The committee changed its mind.
And they said they would come before the end of the week.
Okay, why didn't you tell him?
Oh grandpa, don't go!
I'm waiting because the committee isn't coming.
Instead of sitting with those girls in the living room.
I found you.
Okay, enough.
I will apologize.
I will do it.
Thank you
Oh grandfather, Khalid is
It's wrong.
And also greedy.
When he found out the committee wasn't coming.
You are obliged to accommodate me.
And from now on, yes! Father
We'll do our personal work without asking anyone.
Fear God and stay at home.
Let me press my lips to your head.
Hello, hello my son!
Good morning
Oh, my dear friend!
This is all for me.
No worries, don't stress.
Not feeling well, slightly irritated
As I told you
After you finish this study
I wanted to do it myself from the beginning.
And he asked me to come quickly.
I have a meeting.
In his greatness, the minister.
On my stick
You meet distinguished guests.
I'm happy when they say my children are with him or with him.
Don't be afraid and go to your work, (sing)
Where is Saeed?
Please, Father.
The message is with me, I'll leave it with the tea boy.
Now walk next to me, I'll send him with the tea boy.
My dear father
So you're saying it didn't happen?
Maybe I forgot.
Because the committee will deport her after an hour.
No, God bless you.
My son has a meeting with the minister today.
Give me the papers.
This is my daily routine: work, home, work.
I'm not seeing anyone.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, welcome.
I didn't tell him anything.
He's going on a week-long vacation and going to the sea.
They said he was happy on the farm.
He goes out early in the morning.
He enjoys himself a lot there.
And imagine what.
They say he's good at cooking.
And he is traveling.
Goodbye
What's up?
What's up, sir? Is something wrong?
May God guide you.
Okay, okay, son, I'm fine, nothing.
Your papers are scattered.
He is sitting on the farm.
And she
Her friend's papers
I'm thirsty, I want water.
Dina, water.
My dear children
What, what, take this, I don't want it.
What is this writing?
I want to amaze them with my cloak.
Thank you, sister.
You are right.
"Okay, okay, okay, I told him."
You are right, sister.
I'm sorry, sister.
This is his name, Davey and Casey.
Talk about the gamekeeper.
He started speaking fluently.
And they gave him a nickname, "Stop Corruption."
People started urging him to do that.
And he speaks vain talk which he hears on television and radio.
And also
They found him in prison.
Believe it or not, my sister.
These days, everyone is only interested in themselves.
Why is he looking at the problems?
Now, I will never activate.
Let him speak, and say his famous line, "Corruption has reached its peak."
Praise be to God that he is well.
You are thanked for your attendance.
Goodbye
I'm late for work, mom.
Listen, son.
I was warning you.
Last night
Now I just want to remind you.
Oh, Mother!
I'll try it.
No radio or TV, and I won't call Q-tell.
Your sister, Aisha, was
And your engagement is tears all day long.
Please have mercy on us, may God have mercy on you.
Your words are correct.
I'm not going to continue talking nonsense.
So you won't be sad.
Your uncle, Abu Munira
I came here two days after I entered prison.
And he said it was over.
It will be cancelled.
After many attempts, he finally left.
But next time, it's going to be ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Okay, Mom.
I promised you.
Please, you won't see any good result if you call a TV or radio show again.
I told you I wouldn't do that.
Sorry, I have to go now.
I want to tell you, but keep it a secret.
The manager told me.
What did the baby who served you do here?
So that you can talk about management.
And you start involving us.
How will the manager implement this decision?
Even if he had a million excuses to say
Where am I going?
Are you seriously doing that? Resignation.
What did I tell you before?
Hello, what?
Goodbye
I told you.
I wonder, because of this great interest of people.
We need to reduce the number of correspondents in the ministry.
You're right, though.
Please, just once, tell us "Stop the corruption."
This is good.
Stop corrupting.
Sure, yes.
Oh, you're still here!
We have work that we need to do.
This is a disaster.
Until this problem is solved
What did I tell you?
I told you they'd say to fire him.
And Mina is standing here and heard me say this.
Yes, Father, I did.
I heard them say it themselves.
Please go, and let me talk to your father alone.
Talk to your father.
He went to prison, we considered it a second opinion and forgave him.
I guess we can forgive him after he was fired.
Because we are relatives,
Heard?
Calm down.
Oh God, everything will be alright.
May God guide you to the straight path.
I didn't come to drink coffee.
I know you.
I'm bored.
Your uncle gave you two weeks.
I swear to God, he will force you to sign the divorce papers for his daughter.
If I go up,
Why do you want to get into trouble?
But beware.
Even if anyone asks you,
Ignore him.
Isn't he the one who stops corruption?
Yes, man, that's it.
Dima is not himself today.
We envy her hearing, at least once, please let us hear it.
Okay, great.
Are you police?
What, what, oh Mother, you didn't understand
He was asked to speak on a radio show about a problem faced by my relatives.
He was hesitant.
I felt he was hesitant because of our saw-like conversation.
So I told my brothers to go to his house and talk to him alone.
Did you feel like he agreed?
He was hesitant.
And leave.
Enough, enough, enough
"I'll speak to you in plural forms, and I'll shout and get angry at you, will you understand?"
Are you Saleh Saad?
No, God accepts from you. No, I've already quit that habit, praise be to God.
You have a very good sense of responsibility.
Ideal employee
But unfortunately,
Although I tried
Peace be upon you
We came to you, you didn't need us.
I was going to call the secretary to tell you not to come.
Shahin, what happened?
I didn't know that
Is there anyone living in Qatar who doesn't know about Saleh's anti-corruption campaign?
Are you the righteous one, known for stopping corruption?
Stop corrupting.
Oh, the job.
There are no jobs, you know.
Okay, it's good you didn't rent it.
Am I crazy to drag him here?
I went everywhere, city.
Not even one of them told me five minutes ago that there was a job opening, but they sold it, meaning they gave it to someone else.
My sister, Aisha, got divorced yesterday.
I'm responsible for them now.
I have a very big responsibility now.
I don't know what to do.
He ingratiates himself with the minister.
But I didn't feel like it was the right thing to do.
I'm afraid this will change my position.
Enough, stop.
Who said I would be silent?
But I want this to be done in a way that doesn't affect me.
I'm thinking of a way to remove it.
"Wil ends him."
But how?
I know him.
Is he the one who fills his head with nonsense on the radio?
I'll bring it to your house.
Just give him the information.
You are loyal, patriotic, and...
A very enthusiastic citizen.
Thank you
I really left that.
I consider your voice a voice for justice.
Bu Fahd, I spoke to them.
"By God, if I had a choice, I would choose Saleh."
This is his speech, the last time we heard his voice saying, "Stop the corruption."
How are you?
This is natural, valid.
I am walking in the tent.
Come on, come on, come on
You are one of a kind.
Thank you for your kind words.
Your words on the radio are much better.
Let's stop the corruption for a while.
Oh, please, just one, Bou Fahd will say, Listen, listen, listen to him.
Stop corrupting.
This is the original, sir, this is.
Oh God, don't forget, I don't want you to stop.
I can't
And then forget.
Although I want you to continue solving people's problems and issues.
You are not a commodity.
Great, I'll tell you one problem.
You are the voice of justice.
I want to talk to you alone.
He is a very important person.
It's impossible to say no, you have to say 'yes'.
Yes, correct.
This is your chance.
Opportunities don't come twice.
No, that's %pw.
Don't you deserve it?
Wait, brother, please.
From these problems and these matters.
O our respected minister
The ministry requested eight thousand tubes in its latest project.
The wolf carries a sum of one hundred and seventy centimeters of pressure.
But this employee
To approve the pipes that
Because he wants to maintain balance.
Stop corrupting.
Thank you, thank you very much, brother Saleh, stop the corruption.
No, God bless you.
This is a special request.
Oh God, hear her.
The final station for corruption... Stop the corruption.
Do you know?
Difficult circumstances compelled him to do that.
This is the last one.
The sultan is abdicating.
The minister fired him immediately.
He provided accurate information.
Now, Bu Fahd can do what he wants.
I do all the work.
Yes, sir.
Sure, Minister.
Goodbye
Stop corrupting.
He was the last one, for sure. I won't do it again.
And this is my job application, sorry, I was winding down.
They got what they loved.
Listen to me.
Because he is afraid, God willing, that one day
And he causes a scandal with his bad actions.
To claim and expose corruption
They wish you harm.
My wise sister, Aisha.
You are kind.
Your uncle, Abu Munira
I assure you that I will find a job.
People who appreciate and care are funny.
These people are stingy, they hate our country.
Are there any problems with us?
We have no relationships or preferences based on lineage.
I've never heard this word before.
In our government departments,
We don't have any bribes.
I can't find it.
Employee
Does the stranger get more than the native? No, never.
We do everything locally.
The problem that determines which family you belong to, we don't face it at all.
If a manager or supervisor gets upset with you,
We are the best people.
My country is the best country.
I'm walking and it won't hurt.
And thank you.
What did you say on the radio yesterday?
Mom, I want chocolate.
No milk until dinner.
Okay, there are no sweets.
Why is your shirt wrinkled?
Oh mom, we were playing, Adoul and I.
I know you were playing.
But what untied your shirt?
God is the One who judges justly for you, Adol.
Go see what your lost brother has done.
I told you it was expensive, but you said it was worth it and that it would look good on your father.
See what he did.
The shirt isn't working currently.
That's what makes him unafraid, and no one pats him on the back.
Oh mother, where are the sweets?
See how he wanted to peel it off, that's clearly the intention.
Wael is weak.
He was happy wearing this shirt for the first time.
He will see.
Where is the bathroom?
In the garden
Why, what happened?
Something between me and him.
Don't give up.
Woe to you, shame on you.
What's up with Waleed?
A child should not be allowed to do as he pleases.
Changed Rebel
Don't ask me to take back my words.
Are you a repairman?
We will support them.
Behave well.
Don't mess with him.
Why do you kill like children?
Keep this from your mother.
What are you doing?
He raises his children well.
He is a boy.
You won't be able to distinguish between a child and an adult, because your brain isn't right.
Do you know?
It's not your story.
Let's go up.
They deserve it.
Waste our time responding to them.
Should not
A place where people loved each other.
Okay, okay, bye, bye.
Alright, some spices need to remain registered in your name, and the minister wants to see them.
Alright, I'll tell the minister. Don't be angry.
I saw the tragedy, the catastrophe?
This is new, there's no portion for you.
This is not a child's toy.
You are right.
He ruined his clothes.
Look, look
This is unwearable.
Look at Adam's pants; he can put one leg in, but the other will be exposed.
It's clear that this wasn't done by hand.
It seems to have been cut/cracked using a power saw.
I can say, but God is sufficient for us.
I want to tell you
Who wants sweets? Come.
I know too.
If you don't know, walk around the villa.
I love you not just because you can ride a bike,
Also for another thing
Do you believe it?
Okay, will you make a fork for you?
Yes, we want two.
They are talking.
Who spun us in the closet?
How did he interrupt his father's operation?
He has a big pair of scissors, he can even cut a car with them.
Under the bed, take all the candy.
Mishtey, mishtey
No one can do something like that.
Why do we have to be silent?
The most important thing of all
This is what we declare, meaning what we say.
Who broke the child's clothes, Walid's father or Walid's son?
Which computer?
What is he talking about?
It's impossible for a child to make these cracks.
Why don't you believe me?
How did you part from your friend?
Give me a second.
You always love this.
Oh my son, fighting all day, oh my God!
Yesterday
I ask Allah for repentance and good health.
May God guide you.
Who can carry such a big pair of scissors?
Go make some friends.
Either lying, or my mother.
He went to get these big scissors.
Behave yourself, Sultan, ouch!
Come on, let's find a solution to this, come here, son!
How do I start?
Each one of you
You are fathers.
A child was born.
When a child is born,
You are my brothers.
Hear me and make peace among yourselves.
Okay, tell me, what's he going to do now?
Okay, it doesn't matter, I broke their clothes.
He doesn't deserve anything, compared to the disaster he caused. I lost all my documents and information. He destroyed everything.
He pinned him down.
He speaks in very formal terms, like people do in museums.
Don't forget it.
He'll keep banging until he gets tired and leaves.
He's like a madman; my brother and I know him well.
And you were his handmaiden.
He's full of hatred and malice.
He's upset because I broke the computer.
Oh, Fahad
Sulan, applaud him, clap, clap.
Oh children, fear God!
Hit him, hit him, [silence] be careful, [silence]
Take your brother and play with him outside.
May God guide you.
God damn you.
Big men
What did you leave for the kids?
Okay, Mom.
Your brother, Abdurrahman
It might be the last time, son!
He is your older brother, my daughter/my daughters!
He knows how to talk to people.
And he argues
Don't destroy yourself because of us.
You are required to
His role was played.
May God guide you.
Even you, you've become like them, my son!
Mother, they hit my son, it's a conspiracy against us, and you're saying, %pw, stay away.
Far
My son is bleeding.
You've embarrassed us, you rascals!
It was the boys who were throwing them.
It doesn't seem so.
I saw them.
We told him about the children's issue, we don't understand why he doesn't believe us.
He said from his window.
He saw boys throwing stones, and because they were far away, he thought they were birds.
I'm not crazy.
Good health to you, you can walk.
You might be tired or off-balance.
Do you know who these people are?
And you're promising me they won't throw stones?
It seems
Oh, my beloved!
I'll tell you to walk and the presence and kindness, gently gently gently gently gently gently gently gently gently gently gently gently
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
What is this, oh God, oh Allah?
God suffices him.
Mother, mother
It's all because of you.
Because of you
Your children, they just behave like kids, their minds are very sick.
Take me to the hospital, this will ruin me, this will kill me.
Yes, and it's not the first time I've seen him.
And I noticed that he doesn't take his eyes off yours.
What is registered in Business Class?
But he has been preparing the lesson with us for about a week.
It's clear he's waiting to meet and get to know you.
Don't ruin it just because he loves you so much. Don't be embarrassed.
No, my sister.
I'm not easy.
Ran after him.
Let's forget, it's fine.
Now he's chasing you, muttering his knowledge of you.
It's true that I love him too.
But, I don't feel like this is the right award right now.
One hundred percent
I saw you yesterday.
You were talking to who when she came up and said, "Excuse me, may I introduce myself?"
Complete the initiative.
You are right.
But I'm waiting for the right opportunity.
The right opportunity
What are you waiting for? You're enrolled in the same class as her.
Did the teacher say anything?
Please ask her, madam.
I wonder what her name is.
We've been exchanging glances for two and a half months.
But you don't know each other at all.
You're too old.
Which means you go and say "Sorry,"
May I introduce myself to you?
Very busy in this.
I need to wait for the right opportunity.
A quiet and kind girl.
I don't know what you're looking for.
We finished filming all the episodes yesterday.
Sure, correct.
We never forget about you, even when you're not here.
Firstly, I am not free.
So he can buy the villa behind our villa for Waleed.
By tomorrow, when it passes, it won't live far from us.
What's the use now?
I'm late.
I don't know
I saw it empty a few days ago, who bought it?
And they bought it with a housing loan from the Development Bank.
God bless their home.
My beloved, good morning.
Come on, start the engine.
Thank you, my son. May God bless you with goodness.
Oh Nouri, come outside, the car is working now, come, I'll take you.
Peace be upon you and God's mercy and blessings.
What do you want?
The two neighbors are talking to each other, what do you want?
Go leave us alone.
The two neighbors are talking to each other, you are not in agreement.
This man parked his car behind mine, I can't get mine out.
Okay, if you don't mind, give me the car keys.
Even the car key
I'll leave you in this Titanic moment.
May God be pleased with you.
Goodbye
The man now knows a lot about me.
I know you're a father.
Walid Rashid Abdullah
Sure, when people hear your father's name, many will think you're the son of the famous actor.
Same name, God willing.
In fact, my father is Rashid Abdullah, the actor.
Is Rashid Abdullah, the famous actor, your father?
You're eating cookies! Why didn't you have dinner with him?
Tell me,
How did you know that the famous actor, Rashid Abdullah, is our neighbor?
Oh comfort.
My friend at university, she knows them, she told me so.
He loves his acting job, and only watches his own works.
He finally said that we live next to a famous and influential person in the community.
Oh my heart, oh joy!
He's very sweet, he has a great sense of humor.
And his son is a good man, he helped me, may God reward him.
They said that
What do you know?
Do you know why you want to take pictures with him?
Oh mom, talk to Uncle Abood.
I read an interview with him in the newspaper.
He said they would film a series about diving.
Praise be to God for you, He brought you a sheep, a gift for your new villa.
He proved to be a good neighbour.
Oh Salem, is there something new?
In fact, we have many names.
They told me, Abu Saad, may God bless you, that my name is on the (list).
This will be determined according to the needs and experiences of the employees.
We don't know.
It might not be possible to move you.
I wish you could forgive me, there's nothing I can do for you.
Thank you
We wanted to move and settle first, and then when God provides us with money, we'll buy furniture.
I did the right thing.
Hey! That's Ali.
Don't take me for a stranger.
Anything you need
I'm ready to help.
The neighbor, how much, how much with each other (a meal)
But now I heard and saw.
That's good, God willing, you are an expert in furniture.
Okay, I'm coming with you.
Sister, no worries.
Whenever you want to choose the furniture, let me know.
My darling, Papa took out a loan. If it's approved, we'll change all the furniture.
And I repeat it again,
Don't even think about asking me anything.
You and I are family now.
Can't you study without your help?
But I want her to be independent.
You're definitely talking to her!
You're making me say he was my friend?
Oh my son, oh Ali!
I don't have any objection to that.
As long as you love me and I love her, I'll solve the problem.
You persist.
Let me suggest to your uncle.
Leave it to me.
So that you like it.
Harooh will reject you.
Carrying to see
Inverse good
Inverse good
What's up, Abu Ali? Anything wrong?
Oh no, the car broke down!
From time to time, it bothers me.
Oh my daughter, may God have mercy on you, she has a lecture.
That's why the car always breaks down.
Your daughter is our daughter.
Okay (Note:
Don't mess yourself up, my brother Rashid!
"What God has willed for you" or "Praise be to God for you"
The keys are left in the car, and the driver is just sitting there.
It seems the Development Bank bought you a house and a car.
What is this our vehicle
Our neighbor Rashid Abdullah's car.
She consulted me about improving relations.
We will discuss matters of mutual concern and serve their common interests.
I wonder if this is a huge evolution.
Come on
Oh mom, this is embarrassing.
He wasn't agreeing.
She said: "Nour is like my daughter, and the taxi will take her to university every day."
Did you tell her that my father's car will be in the shop for repairs for a week?
I swear by God, no.
She said he would drive her every morning.
Oh, how peaceful it is! Oh, Mother of Ali!
They are good people.
No, no, no, man!
There is no power or might except from God.
Oh my, oh my, what am I doing right now?
What can I do, I have responsibilities.
Who can take my daughter to university?
O Ali, as long as you have recommended me, O my master Rashid Abdullah.
No one can refuse your request.
Bu Saad, Bu Saad
I'm sorry, Badr Alsad.
Bu Ali knows how much we love him.
Thank you, may God bless you with goodness, Abu Saad!
Please God, God willing.
This is nice.
Guys, Mr. Rashid is busy, let him go.
Of course, of course, Mr. Rashid, if you don't waste our time.
Okay (Note:
Praise be to God, you have good relations.
We are your friends and brother, take care of us when we are in need.
Tell me where you want it, I'll show it to you.
What happened, what's wrong, why are you pushing me?
We suggest you try it.
They agreed, mother, they agreed.
Manal spoke with her mother about me.
Why don't you believe?
Mother of Al-Waleed
Violin outfits, do you have a party?
I don't understand.
May God protect him and make his marriage easy soon, my soul and light of my eye.
She told me, "What a pity."
Taking a chunk from a poor person.
Walking! Jewelry! Not accessories!
Is this my mummy?
She's also going to get a luxurious car.
God willing, God willing.
God willing, I won't be able to put up with you.
It was kind of her, but she refused.
In addition to all that, the car gave you
With the driver.
If I went with you in my current state, they wouldn't believe that this careless man is your husband/wife/spouse.
Oh my God
Do you wear that?
Ah! No, no, no, no, no, no worries.
I need to change my appearance, you won't recognize me.
They are smiling and happy when you call them "Sheikh."
Get him coffee, may God prolong his life.
Bu Ali, I never knew you. I thought you were a VIP, but you're not Bu Ali. You're not the real Bu Ali.
What do you see?
You even walk differently.
"God bless you, and the people I am presenting to you."
Distinguished clients
I organized everything from helmets to the car.
I'm sure I'll find it with you.
In the last series you're in.
There was an action, as I remember, joy.
You were wearing a shiny black suit.
And I also want you to teach me how to wear a bisht.
Look, God bless you, I've never responded to anything.
God willing, you look very beautiful.
Like this, so when you enter the guest room
This is not wrong.
My brother Rashid,
Do you have collar buttons?
Good evening
Who is always with me and Khadoud?
That's what makes us
You consider me a baby.
You and I are family now.
And we want our daughter Nouri to be alone with us.
Noura is good with Waleed.
He told me he sees her at university and that he won't find a better wife than her.
Praise be to God for this.
I will tell her father, God accepts our best.
Why did they reject him? What's the reason?
Because his father was an actor.
Ask your father to come.
Quickly, tell him Rashid wants to see you.
Where are you?
I cry from sadness.
Because his father is an actor.
Your walker doesn't have a brake.
I am an actor.
But I act frankly.
I perform on stage for several hours and my role ends.
When the acting is over.
You play roles.
I do
I'm sending a helpful vision.
But you
I wear costumes to role-play.
On the stage
But you
She wore it in the guest rooms.
The role of the wealthy and well-off woman.
Who is the actor?
Who is the real actor?
Longing man, promised
Lift your head up.
This is a
I found the scene.
I heard her scream at him, "Don't look back, don't look back." Oh, if only it were that simple, it broke my heart.
"And walking therein in a straight path."
"Complete like a horse" or "Perfect like a horse" (depending on context)
It's Thursday, man, Thursday!
It's Thursday.
His wife is crazy.
She gets jealous when she sees other girls.
That's what makes him walk like that.
So he wouldn't see the mirrors, and she had no one to see her.
See how his wife drives him crazy.
Straight, do not twist your face.
By His permission, I will manifest it in the descriptive place tomorrow.
Thursday, please show them the city center.
Thursday, show me the city center.
Doesn't your wife call the city center that way?
Let's go, Thursday
I'm going to see what Salim likes.
You coward.
When will this change happen?
If only I listened to what they say about you.
Even the elders say this isn't everything.
Why are you doing this?
She gets upset by the women around her.
Why was she getting so upset?
When I put myself in front of the TV sometimes
She, she
I swear by God.
Okay, okay, fine.
Peace be upon you, my sister.
Look at this.
I spoke to her a moment ago, in front of you, I heard a man's voice.
I swear to God, sometimes she throws my clothes in the street.
Respect yourself and leave me alone.
I'm too tired to stop.
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay
My friends, wait here.
What's on your mind?
Not another thing wrong
Who are you talking to?
You're wasting your time with people who are of no use.
Especially this person who is leaning, he is the one I like the least among your friends.
The one with big cheeks and hair like a small plant.
He is a despicable person with no honor.
I imagine you tasting me in my grave.
Let me talk to her.
Hi, how are you doing?
What are you talking to him for!
I don't see anyone here.
Oh my goodness, what's the reason? What happened?
His friend Thursday became a collector.
After a while, he sat down against the wall and started talking to himself.
He burst out laughing.
Thursday is a poor man.
He always imagines his mother, and thinks that Zian is talking to her.
God is the Provider for His wife.
I understand, Thursday is with you.
He is busy right now, he's on an international call, once in a blue moon, even the clock is ticking backwards.
What's the pen saying?
"God willing, success will be yours, Thursday!"
What, Uncle, are you sleeping?!
I'm not sleepy, I can't find sleep.
Regarding tomorrow's meeting
With the women's delegation at the ministry
Could it be possible if they were?
Oh, Lord, guide Thursday!
These names were selected by the Office of His Excellency the Minister.
Just, hurry up
What am I afraid of?
If you were talking to Salem, why were you shouting like that afterwards!
Speak the truth.
Why are you hiding behind the water tank like that?
Just, like that
I saw the last number you dialed, I read it, it's with you.
The other one is a number!
I accidentally deleted the last digit after erasing the number of the woman I was talking to.
Tell me, what's her name?
I told you, I told you, I told you.
I told her I was talking to Salem.
My colleague, Salem
I don't believe you.
What are you wearing?
Are we going on a diving trip?
Oh, my dear, hurry up! Brother, I didn't allow me to change my clothes.
Who do I want to tell!
Tell my mom.
Tell my mom.
Tell her, "Blessings," brother, give me the password, a pen, connection, I'll tell you the number.
Help each other.
You guys are always like that.
You're a liar, just like always. I'll show you.
If I don't get a response to my intervention again, I will go to the minister's office.
You bathed me.
And she threatened me that she would report me to the minister's office.
She is true courage.
You're planning to destroy my career.
It's my mistake that I heard you and spoke to her.
Listen up! Thursday
She complained about me in the minister's office.
Come with me and tell me the whole truth, and keep me away from this matter.
It's not mine, dude.
You are a coward.
Brothers and sisters
Good morning, everyone.
I'm pleased you're coming to the meeting.
Where's the rest?
Fled
Where is Thursday?
Be coming
Turn off your phone.
Okay, it's stuffy, open a window in the office.
Trips are just an hour.
This is not my mobile.
The war has begun.
Goodness, it's only been two days, is he still living with you?
Where could he go?
No one can go.
And for the past two days, his condition hasn't changed.
Tense, tense at the approach of women around him.
These are harmless feelings.
He's sitting alone here in the living room at night.
This is what my mother says.
Oh, my mother! My mother has passed away.
That's what made me hate you, so I could find a solution for myself.
I asked you to stay away from the section with women.
Is this a military decision?
Look at his signature very carefully below.
Oh brother, sorry, I've moved to the social welfare department.
Luxury ward! Are you sure they transferred you there?
Why is this strange?
Thank you, God bless you.
You, madam, I'm sorry, Mr. Khamis?
The minister's office called and informed us.
What have you focused on in your new department?
Who's with you in the office?
Article, Saleh, Jasim
Oh Thursday, the minister decided to dismiss you the day before yesterday.
And you just moved to the new department today.
I told you about my problem with my family.
The minister decided to transfer you.
I have to go to the ministry.
He started his annual vacation today.
He will be back in a month and a half.
What a pity.
If you want my opinion,
The minister will tell you the same thing.
Work there until we find you another place. We're moving you today because many people have told us about your problems with your wife.
I'm telling you the truth.
And what can we do!
Don't talk when your wife calls.
He doesn't know, they might give in to you, they might insist.
I asked them to put the abayas in the car, I put them in the box for you.
How much?
I wrote it as ten because you are five in the office, so two each.
He is always very worried about his wife.
Imagine he gave us all the men's names.
And they call me Abdelkader.
What's his name?
And he's sweet and handsome, so she's afraid another girl will love him.
In the name of God, what's wrong with it?
Who called my name?
Ya Abdelkader, the one sitting next to Hassan, over there behind Khalil.
Here are the abayas, each one can choose what she likes.
Look at this.
How much is it?
What's up? What happened?
Insistent
Where is the welfare office?
There were supposed to be five employees.
What's your name?
I am sweet.
I'm crazy, my wife drove me crazy.
I am crazy.
She opened the project in front of us.
And I met them.
What did they say?
They said.
Manor, prepare tea.
I won't be able to
Come on, do you want me to go back to the kitchen and ruin my clothes?
Come on, how about some tea?
Come on, it's useless.
Come on, listen to the men.
You seem to have forgotten, we're the children of the spider.
Come on, and bring me some nice, strong tea. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
The bank said the project was good.
I told him many times, his phone is busy.
What a pity, they were waiting for you for a long time.
He's my brother, he's everything.
One of them took a month-long leave, traveled three months ago, and hasn't shown up since.
God is generous, goodbye.
And all the changes are in our favor.
Give us
Oh, if only I had a garden.
This will take up space for at least two or three houses.
The park is a place for recreation, located within a residential complex.
Men don't need a woman's opinion.
I kept it for myself.
Pay for the tea and leave.
There is no garden.
In an instant
Sister, you know I love football.
Your uncle, your brother, and your sisters will kill you if they find out you're playing hooky at school.
What are you planning, to suffocate yourself?
See, I told you.
I suggest you forget about this topic.
You're hurting yourself.
Okay, okay, okay, okay, I'm upset with you.
I was busy.
I wish you would act like men, you are our blessings.
Is Uncle Shahin available?
Inshallah
Is it Thursday?
Elderly
So, Rashid.
I'm tired of looking for a wife for him, I didn't find one.
I come from a family with deep roots.
I wonder...
Leave his marriage problem to me.
Is this from the HR department?
Yes, God grant you a long life.
Set this aside.
I need some notes on his suggestions.
Alright, may God grant you a long life.
Anything else?
No, I can give you a long life.
I want to prepare for them, and I will meet them when I find the time.
What did you do with the workers I sent you yesterday?
What's up?
I'll leave now, I'll call you later.
What happened?
Are you crazy?
You are my older sister.
And we suffered from it.
Did they ask you about what you play at school?
I told them you play table tennis.
Praise be to God, they didn't kill you.
That was just the appetizer.
Do you know who we are?
What are our roots?
Do you know what this means?
This time I broke your face.
The leader is the guardian of the sands.
Small lizard
Oh uncle, let me slap the sheep on its face.
That was enough.
Save it for next time.
You've changed your mind! Isn't that what you said you wanted, architecture?
Are you crazy?
The carbon daughter cannot work in the workshops with men.
Engineering and Architecture
You're putting us in an awkward position.
Let it break.
Okay, okay, Sultan, let's go.
Of course, Sir Qandil.
You just beat Fatoom.
Let him have it, Saker.
This is me.
Okay, fine, at least I got a slap in the face.
Look at my beggars.
Why do they want you to go with them tomorrow morning?
What do they want?
Come on!
Come on, old-timer.
"If, then, what?"
Don't say a word.
"If, then, what?"
"I've asked you to be quiet, don't say a single word."
And education
Or even nursing, we don't care.
What else do you want?
You have two options.
Just so you know, we're funny.
You'll never say that we pressured you to change.
Child rearing, or nursing.
Run away
Get us a picture of the brochure.
Get out, leave.
The leader is the guardian of the believers! O my son!
The big shark himself suggested it to you.
Thank you, uncle, but when is the wedding?
Our Lady
What you're asking for is difficult.
I can't travel, Abu Khalid!
I have personal circumstances.
Recommended by the minister.
I'm tired.
Think about it again.
Don't copy the decision right now, think about it until tomorrow.
What on earth makes you do that now!
That's what makes them not shut their mouths.
I have a suggestion.
Ask one of them to accompany you.
Girls shouldn't travel.
This is not a thing.
Not a human!
You should be thankful that we allowed you to go to work.
Go tomorrow and tell them you won't be able to travel.
Be quiet, my son, don't argue.
Listen and stay silent.
Thursday's son of a spider
He is one of us.
He's stupid and he doesn't have a degree.
But he is a falcon.
What's going to do it, my sister?
Yes, Fatima, what can I do?
I am weak and I have no money.
What can I do?
Not my cup of tea.
What's he going to do?
The commitment is next Monday.
I'll give you a call when the check arrives.
What a beautiful laugh!
Go buy a new dress.
Go and get a new dress, son!
I love this laugh.
Oh brother, please.
I won't hear a word of it.
Prepare tea, coffee, and cake for us.
How lucky you are, Aisha! Now you're the minister's wife.
I'm afraid this is just a rumor! Oh, Khalid!
Munaira is being groomed to be a minister in a new ministry within the new ministerial structure.
Munaira deserves all good things.
Oh God, let it not be nonsense.
Are you doing your work tomorrow?
And we must all cooperate to serve this homeland.
Thanks to the efforts of each person in their position.
May there always be success for everyone.
Thank you, sir/madam.
Thank you, Your Excellency.
Thank you
Hello, please come in.
Peace be upon you
Yes, with soap as you requested.
He is the overall supervisor of the women's football league.
Ask him about Fatima's game.
Inshallah
Captain Fatima scored two goals as a professional player.
Captain Fatima is talented! Oh, my brothers!
Captain, what do you think about playing Fatima tomorrow?
She's a good forward player.
They are going to travel to China.
Captain, isn't that a bit far?
God bless you.
Your sister is going to referee an important match.
She was studying education, but I went today and submitted a transfer request to her.
She will major in architectural engineering.
Nothing distinguishes a man from a woman.
What does that mean? Go get coffee.
Ava, where are you going?
I'm tired of this absence.
Fool, are you a fool?
Come on, tell your mom "peace be upon you" and inform her that you've been expelled.
Come on
Oh stupid one.
The coffee in the pot you have is gone.
They don't call all year round, but when they find out you have a show, they call.
Hello, how are you? Have you caught a cold?
What did you tell her?
I told her you'd be in the series with us.
Sure, she'll be the main heroine.
Look, Ali, Shawul is going to play the role of Nouf.
There's something called makeup, which can make her look younger.
Mary's role will be for only 26 or 7 episodes.
Let Shawna benefit.
He will never stop giving us long lectures.
I'm afraid it will be a big stain on us.
The most important thing is that he doesn't know that the company that produces your product is yours and Hamed's.
Please let me not be late.
And Rashid is also present.
That the director and actors are ready.
In due time, folks, let's start the meeting.
"Let's hear your opinion."
Hamed, do you want to tell me something?
Frankly, I think this is the best.
See when the service did the selection.
You know the most painful part for me.
It was when the servants committed suicide.
When she hanged herself from a fan, she spun around and withered to death.
They found her weeping for her son, it's heartwarming.
And he kept hitting until he reached the house's yard.
Is it excitement?
The police come, search the house, and take the mother.
This is a very nice series.
I was about to finish this sequence on this table.
This is indeed an extraction from the conscience of art.
Community
All this is about strange events.
This is nonsense, I can't find the words.
Seventy-seven cases of murder.
What happened with the crying?
You are known to hinder people.
Alright, Mr. Hamed, let's think about this rationally and realistically.
Let's take a majority vote.
Oh Nasser, claiming openness while using the majority as an excuse, that won't work with a critical assessment of art production.
You're involved in this because of your government job.
Goodbye
I heard the doorbell ring.
There was an Indian with a bag in his hand.
Ask me, Madam Hessa, she replied: "Yes"
I opened the suitcase.
It was a ring worth around seventy or eighty thousand.
I'm afraid the Indian man brought these things by mistake.
Okay, not by mistake.
She is Samira.
Hamid's wife, the supervisor at the company.
This is a gift from her to you, may God accept it from you.
Yes, it's for you.
The ring is a very luxurious ring.
He never told me I'd have a ring like this.
Oh, dear God, please keep Huda, my beloved!
Ah, that's it, I call it the series of blessings.
Ali and Hamed own the production but they are employed in it, they cannot present them in their names.
What if we build more than the ring?
Don't share this with anyone, keep it just between us.
Am I crazy to do that?
Your brilliant, wonderful husband
Who called him the wizard?
Only five percent, that's a small amount.
Alright, it's good they approved it for four million.
Your husband will get 100,000 riyals, okay.
I think we'll give the college girl role to Nada.
She had a fight with a man and left on her bike.
The series we're making is called "Extracting Conscience."
They spoke about my role in the series before me.
I really want to know.
Gulf soap operas are always like this, this year's blackmail trend.
Alright, tell my brave soul, what is my role?
You too, my love, your turn is guaranteed.
Don't lose weight.
Jay, Jay, now
I did all this for you in the morning, don't be a burden and leave me.
This is Omar, the manager's secretary.
God protect us.
It's impossible for him to ask to see me at this time.
And he told him that it would be a weak and silly chain.
Don't waste your money on this.
Okay, so what did he do next?
Oh God, protect me. I'm afraid that Rashid might have told them something wrong about the series.
Don't be afraid.
Leave it to me.
A mentally ill person.
This is a social series.
I remembered him today on television.
"Hail, O Lord"
The series that's airing on TV right now is called "Extracting a Little Rose."
But, I think the budget they're asking for is too much.
He needs a large budget.
But don't forget that the producing institution is local.
We need to support her.
Okay (Note:
Have you read the arts page?
We heard they're starting to film the series "Conscience Extraction."
And that means a very large budget is allocated to it.
But it was said that the series was weak.
And others said that the series consists of a school that teaches vice.
They can stop shooting.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
Welcome. Please have a seat.
Good morning
Good morning, welcome.
I am Elias Munir, a journalist, and I have an appointment with Mr. Hamda, please.
No problem, could you please walk around a bit? He's in a meeting.
Mercury, that's going to make us use a galaxy design.
And specifically, we'll respond to every news photographer in the world to connect with you.
This is your job.
Mercury Media Creativity Company
And he discusses his problems in a way that makes him the most productive in the history of the world.
It's impossible to believe who wrote this.
He has no honor.
Is there a journalist like that?
Is there a journalist like that?
A journalist must have a conscience.
Working
Do you think they are here for *
I met His Excellency, the Minister. Do you know what he said to me?
This is very tragic and its events are extraordinary.
The first volume of the encyclopedia will be released tomorrow, I'm going to check it out with the people.
What do you think, Mother?
Mama, it's fine, this is just the first episode.
Have you ever seen anyone talk to themselves, except in Gulf soap operas?
Also, have you seen a mother who loves to kill her children except in your series?
My son, art is cunning, it's not unnatural to impose it on people and society!
Oh Mother, it could be in plastic arts, but drama looks completely different.
Don't make me look!
It seems they are imitating the Turkish people.
What you're thinking right now, just watch the first five episodes at least.
This series is a failure.
You can't let them see it.
Longing, my brother.
There are worse shows on TV.
In fact, not anyone.
It was your mistake.
The enemy of all, in every house.
Mount and gather people who understand these dimensions and hidden lines.
And they see them.
So-so.
Tell me, what happened?
The minister passed by with some guests.
I followed him to welcome him.
We agreed to produce the series.
How will the minister like him?
Okay, let's hear Nasser's opinion.
My colleague wrote
I only sold the messages that make you happy about the series.
Okay, okay, no need to worry.
Read the newspaper tomorrow and I will publish praise messages of my own and will mention that viewers sent them.
Inshallah
You'll find yourself happy.
For this year
Fine, if they had an agreement with him.
This is the best series in the history of Gulf drama.
Everyone agrees on them.
Alright, let's say they all agree on them.
I'll read the subtitles.
Oh God, please rerun the series "Conscience Extraction."
Thank you, Minister of Arts, for that series.
I wish they would repeat it again.
"When the minister's office first called me."
We can come to pick up the last batch of serial numbers.
They were right when they called you the wizard.
That wasn't everything.
The profits were rewarding, and we took our money.
And the experiment failed.
The author himself told me that he regrets writing it.
I'm here to suggest a second season of the series.
The minister entrusted you with the media deception that you initiated on your own.
He was convinced that the illusory success we created
He's not always happy with the series.
That means it's impossible for him to agree to a second term.
I assure you that the minister himself will request Part Two.
I am capable of
Thank you
To all people
Who worked on this series?
And our congratulations to them on their success.
They all deserve it.
In fact, winning those prestigious awards at distinguished festivals.
Proves that
That's what you remember.
You are a genius.
Surely he will win the golden award.
What was it?
He said, "If the readers and the press lie to me."
Oh, why don't we make a second part?
When Arab and Gulf TV celebrations are artistic washing.
Wash art!
I've heard about money laundering.
Not art
Illicit funds
The chains are the same.
What can we do with "won't"?
What are you talking about?
We haven't signed a contract with them, so they shouldn't be bound by it.
Write them.
Our products are exported worldwide, various types of bread, flat, large, small, triangular, and diverse.
How much did we agree upon in the contract?
Two million dollars
What did you do in Australia?
He is the inventor of bread.
Has anyone heard of his product?
Not much, but he told me it's bread, but I don't know what it contains.
This bread has clouds in it.
You call it (Soustha)
Instead of slicing the bread, just tear it apart as you call it = "Smoo'an" bread.
The inventor tried to simplify it.
Cheese pants
That's the secret.
Eating bread with a zipper.
These people do very strange things.
This zipper (button) is a masterpiece, it's made in a way that when you put it in your mouth, it dissolves.
There can be different flavors, strawberry, ketchup, coffee.
Do you know how much money I invested in this project?
Three million dollars, with patents.
Get out, Sam!
Yes, Abu Nasser.
Yes, sir, I am at your service.
We received it today, sir.
"He said, 'Oh, Samih! Forgive!'"
I was with your son, Nasser, yesterday, playing football in his team.
I agreed to it.
To form his team of drivers and security personnel
And the team is not complete, we only have one goalkeeper, if he gets injured, we'll be in trouble.
I shouldn't have fans either.
When you have appointed sixteen players,
Machial.
Important people in the company
Indispensable ones
The bakery took the sweets from the hospital.
Why are you yelling at this man?
You said he couldn't, that he's from a well-known family, he can't run after a ball and make a fool of himself.
No one can do what they want.
But don't take essential things.
Yes, Mom, our team has a match and I need four players.
No excuses.
Okay, what's done is done.
Hamad didn't bring the work today, sir.
I went with him.
He said: "Wear it!"
And they used to lift me in the penalty area.
The match has started.
Secondly, I didn't feel anything.
They told me the ball hit me while I was distracted.
Did you previously work as a goalkeeper?
I was just playing because Nasser asked me to.
"There is no power or strength except by Allah."
We're tired of your love for football.
From now on, yes! Nasser
No football.
You need to disband your team.
And all the bakers must return to their bakeries.
What do you think?
Opening, this
Okay, I don't want to hear anything.
Please! Hey! Bou Nasser
Listen to what he's saying.
Okay, I'll do it, just because you asked me.
Say, what do you want to say?
Tomorrow they will play the final match in the tournament.
Don't ruin it, Abu Nasser, take it easy, I'm asking you.
Oh, people, oh dear.
Congratulations, congratulations
Okay, okay, okay, congratulations.
Mr. Nasser, I'd like to speak with you for a minute if you're available.
Thank you, our team was on time today.
Oh Nasser, you must
You promised us so-and-so.
Come on, do you want me to call and book a hall at the hotel?
And they called the press and journalists to head there.
Alright, Rashid. You'll stay at our house.
So that when my father sees the players and their success, it won't stop them.
They won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup.
Oh God!
No, no, I saw him taking pictures with the players, and he was with them talking to the press.
It seems that Sami, the sports editor, is the one being interviewed.
Picture
My relative bid me farewell.
I took a good screenshot.
He is happy.
Your comment on your children's, the bakers', victory made them
Effervescent of spirit
And the effort.
Loyalty to the bakery.
Oh, Abu Nasser, let's watch the team play 4-4-2.
Loyalty to the team's bread and the coach's plan.
Thank you, Uncle Bo Nasser.
May God bless you.
Oh, goalkeeper!
Al-Dawari and Al-Kadhimi are journalists who will come to interview you.
Oh, these aren't diamond sessions.
They sent their representative to conduct the interview.
They brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought the cup.
Let's encourage the youth.
I expect a bright future for them.
Yes, goodbye.
God willing, your phone is always ringing, and your pictures are in the press. God has blessed you with football.
Do you know who was talking to me on the phone?
He said, "Lower the price of the engines." Agreed.
Oh, you've become famous now. Under every picture of you in the newspapers, they write your name as the first athlete of the International Confectionery.
Didn't you ask me to take care of the ball?
What are you saying?
Since I was in school
The one who used to sit next to me loves football.
You say you're not close to the ball.
I like to play soccer, I am close to the ball.
Being close to sports means I'm athletic.
Okay, we're no longer the international "backwards" ones, we've advanced as international "football".
I heard him say a few days ago that he was going to exercise.
And today we meet the first international athlete in baking, Bo Nasser.
To improve football
Before the match, tell me your predictions before you go on stage.
The boy is playing hard today.
The team that will control the midfield will be *...* today.
Oh, if God wills it, we will continue with professional player agents to develop the International Bread Team.
His name is Saud. Listen, we want commitment.
(Yeah, he wants the last deal for the players)
Kanshi Fayed.
When you gave me the prices
I gave you the international exchange rate.
Okay, isn't the Gulf part of the world?
Sure, I'm coming.
This is none of your business.
You just need to let me know when a buyer from the Gulf arrives.
Open your fax line.
Two of them are defenders, one is a midfielder, and the other is a central player.
Look, these are four players.
The third one will be expensive.
Two hundred thousand dollars per player
Take them all in one bundle.
This will be six million and one thousand, I will give them to you for five million and fifty thousand dollars.
Okay, that's about African players, now for the Brazilian player.
He is the player of the season, he only costs one million and a hundred thousand dollars.
They imposed this price, and then they sent me a fax, here it is. Come, see, they sent it to me from a club in the UAE.
The decision is yours.
Thank you
God willing, look at his trap.
How is it?
Knee, knee
The knee is fine.
Walking, please don't let there be a calf strain.
Oh, Nasser!
What is this problem?
Oh fly! Make a dish of rice and meat (a traditional food).
Frankly, you're lucky to have Brazilian and African players, congratulations, congratulations.
Thank you
Supermarket, supermarket
Oh God, do you have another job?
No, no, no, just players.
I'll consult them tomorrow.
Youth! Oh, we want them from the African forests.
Oh, why?
Karim, open a can for him.
He is a human being.
He said, "O young man, what did you hear?"
They said they were young.
"Bant lama" translates to "It's been a while."
Why don't you give us that little man as a free gift?
Listen, Abu Nasser, if you take good care of him and guide him well, he will benefit you in the end.
And they bring him out and demand him at the stadium.
Come on, come on, come on, come on
I wish you would be nice to him, he's still young.
Put it in the hall, and let him take care of it.
Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything, all the players are with me.
Your coach needs to understand.
We won 2-0, we were in control of the game.
Abu, he is the coach of Spain.
I don't love you.
Successful coach
The game must be controlled.
And this, in front of it, is the creek road.
Fine, we won't let your coach do what he wants.
He was with the team for less than two months.
We need to finish this.
If he were an expert in football, he would have called for the strikers, not attacking from the middle.
Ah, it relied on a trap for intruders.
Oh mother, don't make my head hurt.
One should not do without Kakoni Malaluy.
And he changes it with a black cloud full of smoke.
No, no, no, no, no, I don't want him to play.
Forget about Sholo, my sweet darling, let's go.
Which line?
The plan is carried out.
And forget Hololo
This is what was supposed to happen between the coach and the team manager.
The star of the game, the star of the team.
Are you saying we're not good at soccer?
Listen, hey! Sultan
Let him go back home.
Don't take him in your car, let him take a taxi.
"Make do, it's fine."
Stay informed.
Do you see what I want to do right?
The coach departed and sent him back.
What's he doing?
This is destroying the team.
Goodbye to our team.
Oh my mother, oh my mother
No, he's like crazy. I mean, he told me you're divorced. Tell me the truth, what happened between you two?
From the first day I saw him, I told your mother, I don't like this boy.
He feels he can't handle the responsibility.
Forget the nonsense and talking about the past.
You have to go to his father and find out why your daughter got divorced.
I don't know what to say, man! Oh, brother.
Why did he divorce her internally?
Not right, Abu Abdullah! We need to know, we have the right to know, why is she divorced?
I wish you wouldn't interfere. It's none of your business.
How, why didn't he want to interfere? And the man is waiting in the salon to know why his daughter is divorced?
She is not my beloved; she doesn't make me happy with her husband and doesn't respect my feelings.
Who is she from Barcelona?
Your problem is that you don't know Spanish.
Barcelona is not a lady.
This is Guardiola's team.
It means I'm going now to the trainer who walks me in the salon.
If I don't come back, I'll return. Alright, stay here and take it from me.
You need to stand up and not give in.
That was enough for her to criticize Barcelona.
Messi, the magician in football, who scores three goals in every match.
Maradona himself said that Messi would be better than him.
And your Baghdad daughter is laughing at him. Listen,
Your daughter doesn't like Barcelona and she's not suitable for us (Egyptian Arabic dialect).
What's the meaning?
Listen, may God guide you.
Don't say you want a son.
It allows her and pleases her.
Oh, sadness!
Praise be to God, we have a lot of money with us.
What's the point of our money if we don't keep our man happy?
I wish you would calm down.
Most importantly, I'll look for a Barcelona fan.
Oh mother, I'm not upset.
She's crazy! Son, forget about her.
Drink your tea, son!
You know, son! They're losers.
A thousand girls wish to marry you.
Drink, my son.
I feel sorry for her.
Oh, what a pity, she was divorced just two days ago.
After one month of marriage.
What happened to you? Do you want me to intervene with him?
I didn't want to be in a bind with him.
Who told you those meaningless stories?
You don't use it.
I don't know who he is.
Why don't you walk more?
Her wealth only.
Do you remember the building I want to buy and turn into a small hotel?
The one in the ditch.
Proud of his father's presence, and at his son's wedding to our daughter, he asked for this building.
If I can't.
Talk to her brother.
Listen carefully.
Your son, who is friends with the millionaire, suggested that he marry you.
Do you know what it means to be a millionaire?
The opportunity only comes once.
These people are so rich that they bought a palace in Spain so they can spend every summer there.
Oh, and what about Barcelona?
Maybe the girl's parents spread this story to prove that their daughter is innocent.
Let's assume the story is true and the man loves Barcelona and is loyal to Catalonia.
His wife should have respected that.
And don't insult the team.
If you imagine that this story is true.
God bless you, they call him Abu Burjan because he has two towers on the corniche.
Design them in a strange way, like complexly intertwined ropes.
When they saw them from a distance, they thought it was a single block.
What do you think? All the luck is yours.
%pw welcome
God bless you. Here, take something, eat something.
Oh, my darling
Just tell me, my son Abdullah, the light of my eyes, I'm waiting for your reply.
Okay, don't worry, dear Mother of Abdullah.
If I search the entire Gulf, I won't find anyone better than you.
They should give us their estimates for building the structure.
I'm done, Your Excellency. Anything else?
Oh, the family is the same.
Check their requirements for the node, prepare the check, and I'll sign it.
In the name of God, God willed, in the name of God, God willed, with your permission, sir/madam.
Abdullah divorced again as well!
Oh Lord, may the children be from you and the money from him (economically).
Oh auntie, God bless you!
You're wearing it because of the cold.
Oh man, I just don't know the place my mom booked for us?
What did you write for us, Mama?
Mom says she booked us a trip to Malaysia.
What's the problem in Malaysia, frankly?
Goodbye
What happened to you? I heard someone coming back from their mobile holiday crying?
What happened to you, my daughter?
Tell me what happened, girl!
Oh, Mom, she's being very arrogant.
Why like that?
She's being stubborn, forget about her.
I did the right thing when I fired her.
I'm upset about her.
This is her mother.
Why are you sad?
What happened to her?
God bless you. Don't forget to bring us some olive oil from Spain.
Oh man, Spain. Where are we going?
Done.
Mom says she booked us a trip to the Maldives.
Alright, alright! Yes! The daughter of the Maldives is also cute.
And she also makes you laugh.
I thought you came back happy from your trip.
What really bothers me is, why them?
Come on! Take the bag.
What happened to them?
Why are you sad? Oh, light of my eye?
Silence! God bless you, tell me about my son's tattoos.
Oh son! Why are you sad?
When I see the peel, I feel annoyed.
"May the one who upsets you die, son."
Forget it, swear it, swear it. Your father has a lot of money and many girls.
He's my son, I know he's sensitive to everything, why shouldn't he live happily!
Oh my lord, call her and divorce her.
God punishes her.
Say "Dhalhini" three times.
You are divorced. Wait, wait, don't end the call, twice.
Pansy, pansy.
It's driving me crazy.
My son, my dear, relax and be optimistic, there are plenty of girls, as they say, my son.
I wonder if there's a problem.
Not just because they saw you at the disco.
Tell him, tell him, but he must share it with me, right?
What do I call my mother? He's divorced me now, he says I'm divorced, divorced.
Why did you divorce him? He's not my equal.
Now if someone goes to a disco, what will they do!
And one if necessary %pw.
What's wrong with him! The world is upside down!
You see, I'll go to his house and wait for him, and he doesn't even know who you are?
I, I, my daughter is divorced, Abu Abdullah!
Oh, I, my daughter is divorced!
Your daughter is different.
You buy and sell them at Toys R Us stores.
Because you're feeling the bad taste in your mouth right now because of your daughter and you're upset.
And they didn't do anything.
She didn't bring you the apple peeled, break up with her.
Your problem is that you don't let them, just as they don't suit you.
She is newly married to a man.
Does this confuse you? Let's give him hell!
And I feel the same as I did to others.
The thing you don't accept in yourselves.
He won't tolerate this from anyone.
Do you know who owned the Desvalls land back then?
And in a strategic location?
Alright, leave it to God.
And also at a very low price.
Close.
I need to get Abu Sakr's approval.
Yeah, I went to his office and didn't find him.
And I went to his office a week ago and they told me he was traveling.
He has a meeting, he'll be here tomorrow and the day after, I'm off work, and the problem is I need to get Abu Sakr's approval, I do.
Clear the way for his seat.
No, no, no, no, this is official business.
The right place for that, God protect you, is the office, not the house.
Does he eat too?
What will keep this faucet open?
Everyone has a key.
Oh, Abu Fahd!
What about your brother, do you know him?
I don't know him, I've only seen him on TV, and you told me you met him during the Umrah.
We don't know each other very well.
Go away.
"May God guide you, you've come for one, I wish you would ask about the reason for this lighthouse."
This is unnecessary, may God guide you.
The month is 30 days long and he makes 50 invitations.
I suggest, sir, that you be put in the Guinness Book of Records.
I am the most famous wedding planner in the world.
Look, who's that guy with you?
Hello, this is a blessed time.
What an honor, what an honor.
Oh no! Abu Falah
They say Abu Sukkar sets up a big table every day?
This is what we see.
Come on! Abu Falah, we're having dinner tonight for a special occasion.
Today, God protect you, my son Saghre.
God commanded, your honor is worthy, congratulations.
He's here, welcome, my son!
Peace be upon you.
Why?
For this reason, my son, Fadil Saqr, works diligently at the desk, and he reads the book attentively.
I've been waiting for approval for a year and a half.
I was coming back from work.
I turned away while I was reaching for him.
And I give him money.
May God guide you, Abu al-Sa'ad.
Things won't work like that.
I told him, perfect.
He needs to go and buy the car he likes.
We will celebrate three times.
I'll put it for you!
Gabonelle.
You told me you met him during the pilgrimage last year.
Today, his youngest son is Shahin.
Game is parties.
This is your chance.
Pass by his situation and preference.
He deserves to be perfect. Oh, pride!
Oh Shahin! Oh Abu Sakkar!
God bless you, thank you all!
Praise be to God, the falcons are well, oh young one.
God bless you
Look, who are you?
My lord/My master
He doesn't see me.
I can't lie to you (idiom).
Sir, I was with you on the Umrah last year.
And remind him that I bought you a red rose.
God bless you.
I was in the hospital.
Visiting a relative
I would be honored to meet you.
Okay, Sagar, so are you not in need, or are you still hesitant about entering the business field, or have you made up your mind?
I'm tired of him.
Alas! O children of Sakar, trade is sweet.
You need to start, open an office, and then see.
Abu Sakkar
Oh sir, please say yes.
Why?
I have a sweet gift.
Full circle
Even if you offer your love and it comes to you, they will say no.
Who has everything they have today like you, since you got the license, everything has come easily to you, a free car and a better office in the Corniche area.
Yesterday, Abu Abdelaziz was telling your father that if Sakr wants to join the business, I'll allow him to be my partner with a 50% share.
Oh mother, how can I balance between business and university?
Mom, don't make me do something I don't like.
And you're lucky if agencies, offices, and cars are meeting you for free.
Son, this is an opportunity! Who could start a project nowadays without money?
Your only legacy is that people loved your father.
Be smart and invest in it.
Believe me, son! This is your chance in life.
Rose, quickly prepare lunch.
He also reached the pickle and the sauce.
They won't go, they won't go, they're afraid he'll get the samosa franchise.
Your son has a good appetite for work.
This is what I was waiting to see. Do you know what he told me today?
He told me, "Mom, I want to save on the investment."
He wants to enter the Caribbean and invest in these islands.
And God protects him from evil eyes.
Abu Sultan told me today, "Your son is getting into work."
He has twenty agencies, six restaurants, and is a shareholder in two banks.
Please provide
I think, God knows best, that they haven't opened it yet.
Oh man, what's wrong with the area north of our office?
No, I just love her.
Thank you and may God reward you, congratulations a thousand times, Abu Salah!
In the name of God.
God bless you all.
Never give up.
What are you saying, man! A whole year of hard work and preparation for the supermarket.
What happened! I see him passing by the shop every day.
He saw her and sent his secretary, Samer, to me.
He told me this is Sa'gar, son of Abu Sa'gar, he wants to be a partner in your work instead of taking the store from you.
He also wants to be your partner?
"There is no power or might except with Allah."
You were talking to him, weren't you?
Who asked you, my brother?
I said actions!
Why did you tell him you had an Iranian bakery?
When we were walking by that pasta shop, there was a small sign. What did it say on the sign? What was that sign called?
It was written: "The Neighborhood Bakery."
No, I want another name.
Peace be upon you too.
Okay, how's work going for you?
Sir, with God's blessing, hopefully we'll finish the workers' housing designs for the Future Company tomorrow or the day after.
No, Mr. Saker, she is my wife Eliza. Allow me to introduce you to Mr. Saker, the owner of the company.
Hello, how are you?
Let him take one of the company cars.
Thank you very much, you're so kind.
Modern cooking now depends on science and study.
Today, someone told me that I want to work in business, he has money and wants to invest it.
He just doesn't have enough knowledge, understanding, and expertise in economics, let alone trade.
As people do.
Do you think he'll be able to succeed? I don't think so, he'll waste his time and I'll lose.
How are you, Abu Nasser!
How are you? Have you heard what those flamingos are saying?
What is this?
You have a son, Hamoudi, Sakr.
Look at him.
See him today.
Sir, we are not talking about your son, Saqr.
We're talking about the rule.
Your son is a prodigy, no matter what God wants, and I don't want to praise him (exaggerate), he is an exception.
Thank you, he's talking about the rule.
You've got to be kidding me, son. Saker is building his daughters' house himself.
Making an Arabic gift once in a while.
He sold it and invested his money on his own advice.
And as for what God wills, see it now.
Oh, sacred one, we're talking about ordinary people.
I'll drink one of them, and that's what his father Nasser did to him. They took him and left him on the road.
Saqr has business talents.
And strong economic preferences.
We need to ask who his father is.
I swear to God, I'm surprised.
Machine Allah. (Note:
The Gulf Financial Magazine in the Economic Poll
Let's go.
Peace be upon you, hello Salem, hello.
What happened to him?
I swear to God, I don't know what to say, man. Oh, Salem.
Yes, I remember.
The story was true.
This is a fax from the company to my uncle.
And they said to him,
You vile woman, he couldn't bear it.
As you see.
They say that when he heard the news,
He fell in the office and the fax was in his hand.
And he did a lot of good for himself.
In the words of the people, I taught him archery, and when he gained strength, he did the same to me (idiom).
What did the doctor say?
"Pray for him, Salim!"
Oh, I wish!
I can't believe there are people like that in this world.
A man who feeds the poor with his right hand does not know what his right hand is doing.
Donations from this organization are delivered to all Muslims in Asia and Africa.
But I also want you, please, to explain to us your goals and future endeavors, God willing.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, the goal of the Sakar Charity Foundation is to achieve solidarity in this homeland.
In addition to sixty blankets for our earthquake-stricken brothers in Pakistan.
Last but not least, we are now also supporting seven poor families.
He only earns 132 riyals a month.
We're going to be late.
And then we'll be right back to you.
Who is this, my love?
This is Khalid and his wife. They're taking us to the hotel tonight.
Oh, any place, any place, you and I together, I'm happy.
My beloved, (may God keep you for me)
Oh, my darling.
This isn't fair. This is my livelihood.
This bakery
Take money for your attention.
Five reales for beans, three reales for hot bread.
Fava beans
Five broad beans, perfect, perfect.
Cook six broad beans!
Come on, sailors!
The captain is here and he brought breakfast.
Needs men.
Oh, sir!
Okay.
No, no, what you're asking me is that I want to hear "yes" echoing in my ear.
Oh, Nuri.
Anwood is upset with you.
Can I tolerate your distress?
What's up, man? What's going on?
What is he longing for?
Noura chose a simple and easy dress.
You're saying Anwood will be upset.
Oh my God, Lebanese people speak so well.
And we don't eat with him much.
Me too, I'm upset about her.
The best dress for the most beautiful occasion.
He calls her "my little flower."
Let our blood boil, how many watches will be taken?
I paid twenty thousand riyals, and twenty thousand riyals are remaining.
Earn your livelihood, O Lord, congratulations a thousand times!
God be with you
O pride of Umm Salih,
Oh, I don't want to waste your time, you seem busy.
I'm at your service.
Welcome, welcome.
Did you receive the text message yesterday?
Oh, I wish. Oh, what a pity.
What's your opinion on jokes?
Okay, did the design work out for you?
Okay, I didn't have time to do them. Show me your designs and I'll choose from among them.
Frankly, you have better taste.
They are leaving us, the game has begun.
When he found out that my project was good and started generating income,
People say he will do a project like mine.
Boutique for designing and tailoring clothes
Women's clothing
This Abu Nasser has nothing to do with trade.
There are banks.
He's going to cry.
That's the way it is these days.
Yes, Uncle.
You know I was sleeping and they woke me up saying your brother/aunt wants you.
Everything is great! Ask me anything you want!
Everything is fine, everything is fine.
Oh God.
You don't want to do any project, I mean, I mean
Are you coming to look for a partner or something else?
I heard you're a tough designer, so I thought I'd better come by, maybe.
Welcome.
If you need the lift, it's available.
Praise be to God, work is going very well.
What's up, Abu Saleh? What can I do?
But we're late, they only brought it out a week ago.
Yes, they did that.
Okay, well, if God wills it, goodbye.
Okay, that's it.
Are you sure?
And with sophisticated practices, do you know the great catastrophe!
What is this?
He rented a shop next to yours.
(Ad) You're evasive! (Ad) You're contradictory!
Before you knew the market was open to everyone,
Perhaps you know.
Your heart must be open to your aunt.
I won't ask you again.
You deny, you lie, you mock me, although you told me, about me,
I wanted to do my work in secret.
You're taking from over there, the shop next to it, you want to make my work stop.
But he didn't say come and be like a headache next to wisdom teeth, you're driving me crazy.
This is jealousy and desperation, I swear, I swear I'll beat you up, this is desperation, leave me alone.
Come on, you're relatives! Right, guys?
Oh, how sad! Oh, Abu Saleh!
Leave it to me, I swear I'll pay you.
I want to make you happy as you made me happy with the apple of my eye.
Hey everyone! Let's go!
Hey everyone, peace be upon you.
I swear to God, I swear by God, I didn't do anything.
He asked me to carry a designer from the Philippines.
What someone asks of you, they lie to you.
Why, specifically why Lebanese.
They are talking, joking, and laughing, and they feel very happy.
That's what made Abu Saleh bring a Lebanese person.
He started talking to me sweetly and persuading me.
I liked it very much, and it amazed me with its words.
I persuaded him to buy three pairs of shoes for a hundred riyals.
And after two days, I went to the Haraj shop and found the same cabinet, similar to nine hundred riyals.
Wax, wax money.
Bring a Lebanese designer.
Can I meet with the boss? You told me yesterday that it was difficult, and is it still difficult today?
Oh, today is also very difficult.
I feel like Abu Saleh has changed lately.
What happened to him?
Okay, so I don't understand. What's the problem?
Abu Saleh is very psychologically tired after his uncle's brother opened a shop and hired a Lebanese designer like him.
For some time now, the store's sales have been declining.
This is the problem here in Qatar; no Qatari will open a business unless another Qatari comes along and opens the same business right next to them. Can I go in?
No, no, no, no, he's with Fadi the designer now, they're thinking of a solution.
What can we do now?
We felt as if we had eaten poison.
If we keep going like this, I'm afraid we won't even cover the rent for the shop.
A place far from them.
That means we'll clear the field for them.
Okay, thank you. And what is the discount amount?
Okay, why don't you give a prom dress to Lily with every wedding dress for free?
Okay, let's go.
What happened? What's wrong? We'll go to the store next to you; today they advertised that with every wedding dress, you get a free evening gown and an additional 25% discount.
Okay, let's go, let's go.
During this period, wait for two weeks, they will announce the same offer, and you can buy a wedding dress and get two evening dresses for free with a 25% discount.
They're eating us.
I think so too, if we summarize them, they'll ruin it for us.
Don't destroy yourself.
What else did he do?
This remains a real challenge.
Of course, it's a challenge.
Bravo, this sneaky boy deserves it, he doesn't know how to provide for anyone.
If the matter happens, you'll hear the news in two or three days, I'll close his shop.
Well done.
Wait, wait, ring, ring, I'm coming now, goodbye.
What is honesty?
Saud says the shop is disgusting and no one can sit there, he says he doesn't know where this bad smell is coming from.
The smell has nothing to do with this air conditioning, ever.
Her scent won't fade from the shop for six days.
100% sure
The night is coming.
He steals electrical wires from the shop.
Is this fair?
Now will you sign an undertaking, or shall we start proceedings and open a file?
Don't do anything.
I'm going to throw him out of this life.
Hey! Abu Nasser, something strange has happened, no one is coming to our village.
Abu Nasser, focus, focus, there's a customer coming. I'll tell you later. This is strange.
He's sleeping in his bed and he's making a noise.
He's saying it's a psychological condition, and I was afraid to tell him that the bank called and said they need the installments.
Debts accumulated on him because of his miserly aunt.
What happened to him now?
Alas for them if they entered by mistake and saw the designer Saeed, they would scream in his face and run away from him.
Namus! Ya harami, he never feels sleepy, his eyes are wide open and he's staring at the ceiling.
I don't know what he did to me.
Saad is present in the shop.
He turned it into magic, he's not afraid of what he did to it.
When girls see him, they're afraid of him.
I don't know, what changed him!
He was losing me, he was losing me.
I have a lot of debts.
I'm afraid they'll imprison me.
And I have no evidence against him to sue him.
I don't know what he did, and I won't know what he did.
Forget him, he deserves it.
I wish you'd tell me what spell you cast on him. You turned him into a monster, and women scream when they see him.
I said a rumor.
Come on, man! Guys, tell him the photography group needs him urgently.
Oh, everyone! May God accept your deeds, may He protect you. Tell Him that we need Him desperately, very desperately.
I swear to God, they are the ones who lift my breasts, milk me, and throw me on the ground. This is not fair, Mr. Abdullah.
Alright, Uncle Ahmed, don't get upset. You have heart problems, this is not suitable for you, man!
Oh sir, I swear I've talked to him a lot, my ear hurts, but he's stubborn. I'm going to miss all these things, I'm going to miss them.
You don't do anything, I take responsibility for everything!
Listen to me, I'm going to tell you something important.
Chapter Twenty-Five, Scene Sixteen, Ahmed wants to finish.
Alright, I'll keep stopping the filming because the supporting actor/actress isn't showing up.
What a production!
I don't understand anything about this topic, Uncle! Professor Abdullah, why are you yelling at me?
My dear, if you don't want anyone to shout at you,
What happened, Abdullah?
The assistant arrived late and there's a problem with the subject.
Oh Ahmed, I don't need anyone, my dear.
Look for someone of high standing who can prove to people that he is truly capable of becoming a millionaire, not just anyone.
Sir, come in, order, and your request will be ready in half an hour.
Not just anyone, Ala! Not just anyone, I was just explaining to him.
Alright, I'll treat myself to two plays instead of one.
You are responsible, and the production manager is responsible.
What are they going to do now?
They'll do everything, see the manager is nervous and the situation is tough, but they'll handle it.
He needs someone with special qualities. Where can I find such a person now?
Are you my grandfather?
Don't remember what the manager was saying?
I know one person, God protect you from him, hopefully he's suitable.
%PW Saud Boothorn !
Saud clean! I remember him as Saud the cleaner.
Oh, when he was young, they used to call him Saud "Bandooq." And when they grew up a bit, they called him "Aleb."
Why bottles?
I felt sorry for him. May God have mercy on him, he used to walk the streets collecting cans and selling them by the ton.
My rich and famous brother, do not be sad.
The appearance is suitable, as I remember, his body is oily and rural, not tall and not fat.
Are you sure it's appropriate?
Oh my god, but you have to do nice makeup on him, and I guarantee he will be suitable and also has a sense of humor.
Okay, what are you waiting for? Call him!
I don't have his number.
I always take Amir with me and I always go to him.
Where was Saud's house?
What's he saying?
Silence, silence.
Buy shoes.
We don't have anyone in the neighborhood named Saud Qans.
Sure, I'm certain he's from this neighborhood, but I've forgotten which house.
This house belongs to someone named Saud, and he lives with his mother.
Yes, that's correct.
But this isn't Saud's bag.
This is a tablet for Saud.
Sure, that's it, but it improves over time because the laptop is like a can.
He is tall, fat, and a bit brown.
Albathe canceled and started collecting old laptops. Come on, come on, come on! Man!
He went to the vegetable market to buy them for me. Am I a sheep? Where's the other one?
I don't know, son.
This is what you always wear.
I have two tans, where is the other goth, where is he?
Slaves
This is what I'm working towards.
Vicks and Axe brand oils.
I wonder, do it a little so it cools down a bit before you go out, it's popping.
But now I feel worse.
Oh Mother, may God guide you, I've been telling you for two days to go to the emergency hospital, but you refused.
Oh mom, they said they'll take care of me.
Alhamdulillah, you're working now instead of being unemployed.
Oh mama, bye-bye.
You're loading it, it's going to be early, and it's going to go up to the highest level.
You wait and walk slowly, slowly, and the camera is with you, it will move next to you.
Yes. Javer! Yes.
Whose computer is it?
Abbud, that's a very well-known actor, Abdullah Al-Lama.
"It's like this, like that, his father %pw, what is Abud doing?"
How are you, Abdel?
Come on, you need to be a little better in the eyes of people.
Yes, we're from the same neighborhood.
Calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, stay calm, stay calm.
I love acting, do you think they'll make me hit you in a scene?
Not your business, buddy!
Oh my, I'm so tired, did you know she didn't sleep yesterday! Welcome, Burhan!
Alas, my brother, may God heal you.
May God heal her.
Your life is just a dish of peaches (laconic expression).
Oh my lord! Oh my lord!
Does he have medicine for my mother's hearing?
He's a director, not a doctor.
Look at yourself, listen to what he's saying, he has no direction.
What's his mother's name?
Woe to you, what do you think?
How are you doing with regard to what was said about you?
This promises that you will do unnecessary things, you need to be more careful and responsible.
Give me, give him, give him, give them, give me half a million so I can bald my car's tires.
And he gives him three million to get me dinner.
I was going to tell you why I speak this way.
At the request of some people, I am drunk.
See, Pasha Gavil, the production of the neighborhood, actors of the highest level.
He is currently excellent, he is suitable for the role.
Okay, I'll help you. I don't have sensors, right? I don't have any at all, right?
Did your family buy it?
Your life is just a dish of peaches (laconic expression).
They took the lady to the makeup room, did her makeup, and I told Salman to bring you the shield and come to you.
Come on, come on, come on, this is a masterpiece.
Oh, cold, cold.
Listen, brother, keep the car with us until we finish shooting, I'll let you know when to pick it up.
Okay, but can someone pick me up?
Get down! It's okay, I'll ask the driver to take you. Alright, thank you, brother. Thank you, thank you, stay.
Okay, your friend called, the extra one, call him.
Guys, people are calling Saud's standby from the makeup room.
Yes, he wipes my teeth.
It's already written in front of me.
Okay, let's review.
That means I!
I didn't expect that from you.
We will fight, man!
We'll fight for our rights.
Oh, wait.
And you know who you're talking to, Abu Abdel Aziz.
Why divorce her? Brother?
So He left her, and thus is the case.
And we will not marry a girl to a thief.
Okay, what do you see?
He's going to do it, but later. The most important thing is that you get ready to go into the changing room to alter your appearance, and we'll be ready to start cutting.
My teeth, toothpaste is expensive.
Guys, the shooting of this scene has been postponed.
Why like that?
I don't need tea either! I'm bored and my stomach is full of tea. What's this? I've been waiting for an hour, how much longer will I have to wait?
I can't see anything, that's very likely.
May God give you health.
Do it quickly.
Thank you, Your Highness. May God preserve you.
Send my regards to your people.
They say, "Abu Abdul Aziz, peace be upon you."
Welcome, Sir %PW
It wasn't interesting, was it?
"Who's like you? They greet you and even kiss your nose."
For the first time, someone kissed my nose.
How do they kiss each other's noses?
This is a problem.
His nose is like a yogurt stick, it cuts his lips. That was funny, that was funny.
Not funny!
Okay, okay.
Can I be an actor?
What's up? What happened to your voice?
Oh my son, oh my son, I am very ill, I am waiting for you.
Come on, quickly.
Welcome, Sheikh, welcome.
See it for yourself, man!
Listen to me, you!
Sure, go now.
I see a lot of admiration behind me.
What happened, my son!
And peace be upon you, my lord. What has happened to you for your sake?
Come on, come on, come on, come on
And don't worry, God willing, it will be, Dr. Hassan, come here, come here.
Ah, Dr. Hany, what happened?
Let him welcome in the place of shame.
Okay, don't frown.
She is the mother of all, may God keep her safe.
Welcome, please come in, welcome.
Silence, or I'll slap you in the face.
Here my name is Abu Abdelaziz.
Oh sir! Tell me!
How are you, boss?
Woe betide you.
Welcome, sir.
Welcome, sir. Please have a seat.
God bless you.
With this ugly face
Come on, man! Oh, Pasha Rashid.
I swear to God, if you don't do what you need to do, tell me and you'll see what I'll do to you.
Hey man, can I find a doctor quickly, please?
Doctor, my mother is sick!
Wait in line, it's your turn.
Listen to me, you!
Can I ask you, my friend?
Son, hurry up, I'm sick.
"They visit very rarely, and they call your mother every week, but they don't find anyone, they are distant and accept everything."
Unlike the native ladies.
Don't forget the citizen ladies.
Alright, now we just need to find a marriage in the hospital.
I love her.
Stop! My brother is forgetting me.
Okay, you tried to be close to her, laughed at her, looked at her, gave her your number, and your intention was good.
Okay, okay, there's nothing wrong.
Behave well.
Get out, get out, if you don't leave, I'll call security so they can teach you a lesson.
No, no, I don't need anything.
Sir, you must eat.
Lina
No, thank you.
You can take her and leave the hospital.
The person speaking to you is Fahad Al-Marzouk.
You're going to marry him, meaning you will marry him.
No, no, I need the money, the clothes, and the car too. I'll rent them from you.
So I can give you your money.
What, what, what, wait.
Come on
What's this %PW in the context of Fahal Al-Marzouk!
Welcome, welcome, welcome.
Noor Ayn signed the marriage contract with him yesterday.
Oh, I hope you came.
They were surprised by what I did for them. It was a very elegant and unique party.
One does heavy work and one does light work.
Now there's no excuse.
What is this?
Oh mother, I promised my friend I'd help him at work tomorrow.
Hello, will you take this for them?
I wonder what's wrong with him?
Noura, come here!
What is this?
He is the glue that holds his friends together, for matters.
Don't take it, and everyone will be talking about you.
I wish you could give me money, tomorrow I'll buy you something fancy.
Oh, but I've already committed to them now.
And the day will come when I'll have to take it.
Okay, we're still open. Go change into something else so we can find something that people will like.
What happened to you! Come on, let's go.
It has a good price and excellent quality.
Above average, not the best!
Of course there are expensive chocolates, but I'm sorry, I thought you wanted something affordable.
It's very expensive. Why are you looking for something more expensive than that?
This is not natural, look at this artistic touch.
This is called royal chocolate.
The same chocolate you always order at the Spanish court.
This is one.
Congratulations, and by the way, there's a warranty certificate.
Welcome, welcome, O Joy!
Oh, Barry, come here, give us some chocolate, Barry.
What's happening, man?
No, Saleh Abduljader, the one in accounting.
God guides him, he deserves it, give you another one.
And quickly, bring the coffee, O Prophet.
Oh auntie, are you happy for them?
Oh my darling, I was at their wedding, it was embarrassing, disgusting. Do you believe me, my sister!
Did you listen to your sisters' words?
This text doesn't translate into meaningful English as it appears to be a repeated character with no context or recognizable pattern.
Okay, no time, you only have one and a half months.
I'll shave everything.
He just won't let me do anything.
You don't live in the community, you don't see how people spare no expense in their joy.
And I saw it with your eyes.
When I bought something sweet, I saw how people grabbed at you and your taste.
They didn't tell you it's legendary and amazing?
You're right, but how much did you pay?
The money we buried for the chocolate will buy four goats for the contract.
Just give her the money and be done with it, your mother knows everything.
That means they'll accept anything we choose.
Oh sir, your taste is very bad.
What's your opinion on this stage?
But excellence is too expensive.
Why, why, the past was beautiful!
What do you think about this?
This is the first time anyone has ever thought of doing something like a computer.
Sorry, again.
Talk about everything except the stage and equipment, this is the place where you'll leave things you can't find, but just talk, calm down.
The man is hitting on us.
We're going to the mouse stage.
This is a very strange scene.
The latest model in 2011.
We've already chosen the mouse.
Level, all of this is for you.
You have to choose, if you choose Noah's Ark, you have to pay two-thirds and take care of it, and if you choose the mouse, you'll pay eighty-two and fifty thousand.
Two and ready.
You're not the first one to get married.
What are you thinking, getting married in the Comoros? That way, you'll lose your job in our country.
We're just at the beginning.
If you don't need a platform, where will you put the bride? In a box?
Iron, paint, and a fork.
People are happy.
They exploit us and lie to us; in reality, they are thieves.
What's up, Uncle? What happened today?
Are you upset and annoyed?
If you don't want to get married, that's fine.
I'm going to tell the mother of the bride that Saleh has very difficult conditions that are killing him.
Maybet maibgh yinzog? Mayuqadr 'ala kharajat al-zawaj? Maihuwi. Tibgh as'alha? Bina'am, bas'alha. (Translation: Maybe he doesn't want to get married? Maybe he can't afford the expenses of marriage? He doesn't have (the means). Do you want to ask her? Yes, I will ask her.)
We received a bouquet of flowers from the Netherlands.
In my opinion, if you put it on the wedding tables,
Are you sure it's your first time in Doha?
Middle East bow!
Put it on the bill.
How much will it increase?
One hundred and seventeen, perfect.
Just Samir, I don't want to see this bottle at any wedding.
You know what people say.
Okay, they're reserved.
Your salaries are higher than mine.
A problem we can't deal with makes us happy.
Oh God, hold you from within, Saleh!
Oh, I hope God guides you, you should have tried to reconcile with them.
I wish, praise be to God, I've decided to look for a wife in any Arab country.
People say your joy will cost you a few thousand dollars and you'll enjoy it.
God have mercy on you, my beloved.
If God wills, Farah will get divorced next month.
Tell me how many cards you want, that's all.
If invitations are sufficient, that's great. The most important thing is that people know they are invited, where, when, and so on.
You're only interested in him, you don't care about what people say.
People know the standards of marriage from the invitations.
I'll know what to say when I see those invitations tomorrow.
Look at their joy. If these are their prayers, they haven't seen prayers like these before.
Okay, we didn't say we needed this, we'll order it online.
There was a cloth cover, made of panda skin, with a silver glitter finish.
No one can blame you, I won't be able to stop myself.
I won't be able to be the topic of conversation for the ladies, we'll have to ask for invitations, we'll have to ask for invitations!
What a waste of potential. Man.
You lowlife, of course his family pressured him a lot.
I wonder if that man is taking money from everyone.
What are you saying? He even sold his car.
And he looks over 20 years old, today I saw him talking to himself.
Don't talk about him, my friend! How embarrassing, how weak, I don't know when we'll arrive.
Close the door, please.
O my beloved, I would sacrifice myself for you.
Why don't you try to get them to throw a party within your budget?
What does "within my budget" mean?
Why, am I living alone?
The problem our society suffers from is the disease of boasting, showing off, and arrogance.
It will cure you of Zayed's disease.
If you want to live there.
Once, I told her as a warning, "the mother of the bride."
Her words had hurt me.
Trust in God.
Look, tell me,
How did you get married?
And I don't want to get married, it's driving me crazy.
Even if you decide, my dear brother, to get married,
I'll talk about the topic of marrying a foreigner or even an Arab.
And he says your country!
We decided to hire a DJ for the music.
But because Um Nasser brought a famous singer to celebrate her son's engagement.
He's a very famous artist, but I forgot his name.
What's bothering you like that?
It seems like you don't like what I'm doing!
It's enough that he sold his car and every day one of his friends gives him a ride.
Earlier, I entered the room and found him talking to himself.
Okay, now you've changed your mind.
Because my brother Salem is sick, my mom stopped this matter.
It's none of your business.
I'm not less than anyone.
Don't let us laugh.
Oh, Mom! Enough! My brother has spent everything he had and took money from everyone.
I wish you would pamper me.
My mom has new demands for the dowry, and my brother told me he doesn't have money, so I got angry at him and he raised his voice and told me we'll remove the dowry, I don't want to get married.
How is she now?
She's inside, and they're giving her first aid.
He said she was better now and they would find a room for her in the hospital.
What a scandal!
Sister, relax!
The doctor told you to stay calm and gave you a dose to help you sleep.
How can I relax when he wants to make a joke out of us, good times and bad.
I was telling him to play Abdullah Al-Ruwaished, and he said he didn't have any money.
I feel sorry for your loss.
Take care of her.
Go to her, go to her and cover her head.
And tell her I'll do what she wants.
They invited him to their party.
Abu Yusuf is kind; I don't think he won't help me.
Unbelievable, I couldn't find anyone but Abu Youssef.
What's wrong with it?
Is it crazy, Saleh?
But the minister kept him because he was an old man, and moreover, he was diligent and honest.
He deserves my opinion, if I told him the same thing I told him about myself, there's a good chance his heart would stop.
I did that.
This is because you're the one who's upset about this bloody problem, and you want to ask Abu Youssef for money from the ministry, of course.
And Allah knows when you will return it to Him.
Even if the auditors bring them and ask him about his money,
Of course, there might be a problem.
No one will know, and he'll know how to deal with it.
It's up to you, the man is in his office and you're responsible if anything happens to him.
I'm stealing in my last days!
Come on, they call it theft.
In the first place.
I wonder, I wonder, there's a white box wrapped in blue ribbon, with a circle containing a picture of a bird's wing, bring it, bring it.
My professor, Uncle Abu Youssef, it's me, if there are no difficulties,
I'll give you all my money back.
This is my name, Abu Alyawsef.
And I came in my final days.
"Corrupt me, Thursday!"
Shield, shield.
Alright, listen to what I'm saying. If it was someone else, they would've been beaten or something bad would've happened to them. Come on! Come on! Come on! Khalid.
Shield, shield.
I've tried every way I know, Uncle Abu Youssef, but I'm still stuck. I'm drowning.
I can't back out of the marriage.
And you know them, they're all going to waste.
What happened to you?
No, no, the second one, O tension computer, O tension computer.
In the drawer, in the drawer.
Uncle Abu Youssef, the stairs are full of tablets, which one do you need?
The man who jumps from fear with his picture.
I have already booked two rooms for hair and makeup in Salzna.
We'll be there from tomorrow.
Mr. Abdullah Al-Ruwaished and his team visited us.
Oh dear, you will see.
No, I won't tell you.
Will this season be the hit song?
The first to conceive of it in the world.
Meme or mime.
I wonder.
There is no god but God.
My son, don't forget to read the promised text when you enter the hall.
The women here have an evil eye.
I told you she's ugly.
The sweetest moon of ages, may God protect you, I don't want to pretend to be you.
Mama, mama, the police are knocking on the door.
I was wrong to obey you, God.
Unbelievable, today is my wedding day.
The people who are trying are coming.
And now solve it, here I go, come on.
Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf!
It's still early.
But that's not fair if that happens!
The company offered a contract of three million, two million of which was just for materials.
He wrote a letter to the minister.
We know there are bribes, but they don't reach this level.
It seems like you're not living in my world.
Tell me, what did the minister say to Ahmed?
And why didn't the capitalist object? They say he was in on it!
I'm not ignoring it, I swear to God I don't know.
"Where, then, is morality?"
Justice has become wrong, and wrong has become justice!
Oh Saad, are you sure they fired the minister? Guys, what's happening in this world?
I just fired him!
What else?
This is the minister's sister's son.
The girl is betraying the minister.
What a strange world.
What happened to you? Don't you know who she is?
This is the new employee the minister said would replace Lucky Osman.
Come on, come on, come on.
What do you want me to do, Saleh! So we can protest against the minister!
Crazy!
Listen to me, my friend.
We have children, we want to live.
We just want to live.
What happened?
Here he is, standing by the elevator.
This is the fruit of honesty and integrity, my brother Saleh!
O my Lord, grant me benefit from it.
Praise be to God, praise be to God for everything.
What happened to you, Saleh?
These are among the strange things we see before us in this world.
Watch unnatural things.
I'm at your service.
I want you to walk past the supermarket after work and get some vegetables for the salad.
Sell it to me, okay, bye.
Who's taking my sister home?
And her friends were laughing and talking nonsense in front of her. Who is he?
This is my colleague at university, what's the problem if I hide him from here? Everything is fine.
Oh my God, I can't believe it, you look just like you used to!
What are you saying?
Don't you understand what we're saying?
You are an old tradition.
This has old and new on the right and left!
Right is right and wrong is wrong.
Life has evolved, and we live in the age of technology.
International variables are constantly changing and adapting to the world, and no one can keep up with them.
The more you live, the more you see!
Don't eat me, Munira! I can't be nervous and fasting.
This is what he sees in his diary.
Tell her he's taking a break.
Life isn't going well.
Don't mess up, I came to eat lunch.
Let me sleep to rest.
The manager isn't angry with you.
Is the manager not angry?
No, he's not upset, he just washed his face and ate lunch.
My love/My life.
I'm very excited to meet you on my first day of work.
What an honor, what an honor.
Of course, of course.
Of course, I know you don't need anyone to remind you of the work rules.
But at the same time, it is very important.
To remind you of some of the values and principles you uphold.
In the public interest.
This is what should be your honor.
We're all forced.
Distribution is very important, sir.
It is thieves.
Thank you, thank you all.
I want to say too
And to warn you about my first day at work.
Among you is one employee.
Who is sincere, true-hearted, and loyal, and who is full of these evil things?
Just one doubt.
That there is an honest employee.
So that we can initiate the necessary legal proceedings against him in our ministry.
No, things will be as you honor them.
Praise be to God, we are all thieves.
God bless you, I'll say it in front of and behind my colleagues.
Where is Khalid?
Welcome, sir.
Khaled, you were very missed, God bless you.
O pious one,
Oh sir, you know how to choose.
May God guide you.
Why did you let the devil control you?
You should thank God that it was just a lie.
Oh mother, why is father in prison?
Oh my daughter, be quiet!
No, no, I won't do that again.
Oh mother, why is father in prison?
Stop.
That means he became honest.
What a pity to say your father is honest.
This is clothes!
Your whole body is covered.
What will people see?
And I wish you were looking for a job, no one will ask your permission if you stay as you are.
Is there a respectable woman who covers her body and appearance?
She covers her chest, she's wearing this much, and she's biting herself.
"Al-Abbaas is from me, my son."
I bought her a sweater and pants that expose her midriff above the belly.
It's just a lost cause, she doesn't want to go the right way.
I'm telling you!
It will be at your expense only.
Let the hand of our daughter Sara choose the umbilical cord of our son Rashid.
We're looking for a good man for her sister today.
O Rashid, my son, listen to me.
He is a very good man.
He doesn't stop drinking.
It is my financial matter.
Tired, broken, and in a bad mood since morning till noon.
And don't ask about the voice of the people.
He is sophisticated.
And I wish I could also say that he is a liar.
And what's the point of stealing?
That's what I expected from you, what about drugs?
It's clear he's finished. I'll give you five riyals if you find a single flaw, I'll hold a competition on him.
Look, Abu Sara, we're only here to ask for her hand.
You know how to have fun and relax.
Dina didn't know she came from a good family.
My son, congratulations, congratulations, this is life, congratulations.
I'm good.
I can't walk.
Come on, let's go.
Oh, goodbye.
Okay, call your father because he's waiting for you.
Why do I need to call him?
So he can come and pick you up.
Where is he?
Look, he's over there, adjusting his keffiyeh with his brown telly.
Originally, I didn't make you cry, he's happy.
Oh my dear daughter, Mona!
Majid! His name is Abdulaziz.
Yes, that's correct.
Oh my daughter, you've broken my heart.
And you know that since the establishment of the State of Palestine and the city of Jenin in 1990, after the signing of the comprehensive peace agreement with the State of Israel.
And Israel continues to practice terrorism, pressure, and siege against it.
The latest accusations raised by the Israelis and their Arab friends against the Palestinians.
They smuggle plastic knives through the tunnels.
Especially the second article, paragraph A which states that our Palestinian people must cut their nails every day.
Let's go now to the decisive meeting.
Oh, cheapskate!
When Israel agrees to the establishment of a Palestinian state,
Dude, what are you saying? Dude? You're ruining our reputation, leave me alone!
Please!
Understood, my lord tiger, understood, my lord president.
May I speak?
Fully committed to comprehensive international consent.
What is the spokesperson for Israel saying?
To pass anything solid, be it stone or plastic, as a commitment.
Alas! They have left us behind.
What do you call it, people of the Gulf?
In Palestine, everything is made of wood.
American companies, according to the agreement, will manufacture wooden cars for us.
And all our houses have doors made of heat-treated wood.
I'm not absent, I'm just silent.
Don't talk nonsense.
Mr. President,
This is a very important matter and I wish to vote on this issue because growing nails is a breach of the agreement.
If you agree, raise your hand.
I just had a very strange dream.
In order to be able to control the students.
I'm tired of telling him that.
This is the fourth school you'll start working on tomorrow.
It was difficult for me to assert my strong personality as a teacher from the beginning.
The boys are watching him and popping his clothes, and he's not doing anything.
How many times has he fetched me without a gotra.
The school principal told me.
Rashid is kind and we don't want to kick him out.
The boys are drawing with pencils.
And they bring him and impose his Gotra in the street in front of people.
And they said, "He's a teacher who doesn't blame anyone and ruins everything."
Should I tell them the ketchup story?
Come on, Mary.
What's the deal with ketchup? It's new, no one told me!
They stuck a full bottle of ketchup on the chair.
He came and sat down.
Not a problem.
When he saw the boys laughing at him in the playground.
Stop.
Look, the principal of the school you're going to start working at tomorrow called me.
But, okay, we'll give him a chance.
Because I'm waiting for you to tell you.
Kindness and weakness are over.
Oh my uncle! Oh Abdullah!
You see Rashid differently.
And we don't need to remind you of an important educational quote.
You are a graduate and I am a graduate.
And we all know this saying,
The teacher taught his son the first class.
You will see Mr. Rashid, God willing.
And if anyone does a mistake
He's in a bind.
When you start talking, he said, be quiet.
You'll see what he's going to say.
Who made me laugh and told me to be quiet? Who?
You're the one who told me to shut up!
No, not me.
The one next to you!
Stop, call the doctor.
And he said to him, "Mr. Rashid expelled me."
Get out of here, you understand!
What do you think about my anxiety?
It shouldn't just be like your first day, you have to be like this all year.
Make sure of the consequences.
If I heard someone's voice
While I explain or speak.
You know what he does.
Tense, you know what tense means?
This means worry.
Did you hear what I said or not?
I heard it too.
Get out of the classroom.
Follow the imam.
Take your stuff and get out now!
Get back to work.
Alright, bro.
Clearly, he's still looking for it.
No teacher, we didn't complain about him.
Look, strawberry ice cream is amazing when it has actual strawberries in it.
Oh Abdel Rahman, oh dear one.
Everyone makes mistakes.
Man, you're kidding, son.
But the most important thing is that your father doesn't know the story!
I don't want it, I want chocolate in my bag.
Okay, where is your bag? Where is your bag? Where is your bag?
In the classroom.
I'm at your service.
He says he's happy with you.
You can't tell the difference between a rich kid and a regular kid.
Oh no, how could the disaster be green or red?
Come on, where are you going?
In the bathroom.
Are you still in the bathroom?
Knock on the door quickly and tell him the first class started half an hour ago, quickly.
I bought them all, one juice and one bag of chips.
I hugged him before anyone else, and I'm exhausted. My friend is Abdurrahman, and to be honest, that's very healthy.
Okay, I'll go to Saud now and get you a PlayStation memory card from him.
Okay, so what are we learning from this story?
The translation
He is not lacking in morals.
This is a PlayStation game. He also told me to get every PlayStation at once.
Okay, do you want anything else, Abdel Rahman, my friend?
Up and running.
We learn for the story.
Guys, we all know I'm leaving next week because I've been accepted to graduate school.
Alright, I thought I should submit the sensitivity report before I go.
Could I pick you up this afternoon? Abdurrahman told me so, but I don't know where he wants to go, he just didn't tell me when!
She hid when her father came back and didn't tell him anything. Thank God, you kept quiet and rested.
I wonder, if I don't take him this afternoon, and he goes crazy, and he tells his father, no, no, no, that's a disaster, no, no.
Oh, my friend Abdul Rahman,
God bless you.
What are you doing?
Do you like it? Do you like it like this?
Today, children, we will teach you a new lesson in science.
Peace be upon you too.
Thank you.
I need water.
I didn't ask, and you didn't ask anything, I'm at your service.
Teacher, teacher. How can you ask the teacher for water?
Is there a Professor Pep who brings water to a student? Are you carrying his coffee? This story won't fly, I'll write it in the report.
And you're pretending to laugh, you're laughing at me.
Don't raise your voice and don't shout at me, did you hear me or not?
How many is this coffee for?
Okay, so how many cars is that?
Four or five cars.
Excellent, this is excellent, nice, excellent.
What's going on?
See, he's going to build a parking lot in front of our houses at the expense of our comfort.
What do you say about the days of Abu Nasser?
Abu Nasser is done.
He seeks permission to study abroad.
Alright, I broke the table.
Come on, don't be afraid!
Why like that?
Are you different? (Expression)
Change your behavior towards me.
Me or you?
No problem! Bro!
What is this?
Listen, leave everything as it is, it's better for you.
Don't threaten me, brother!
What does it mean that there's nothing called "not needed" and that I want to make things easier for you?
What are you saying?
Instead of, what's this name?
It seems you want.
You want it, as you like it.
Faster, faster.
Is this good?
It's not what he loves, that's not fair!
"What does the neighborhood own?" (Colloquial)
We're going to Aunt Abu Nefis' place to talk, not to shout.
Who is this Rashid who does what he wants in the neighborhood?
Did you give me a chance to speak?
Guys, peace, and listen to what the big boss is saying?
Now, that good-for-nothing who isn't worth a penny is playing with your gang!
Leave it to me.
If you don't hit him in the face, he'll stick to the umbrella he made.
The game is played by the players.
Is this good?
I wonder.
You haven't seen anything yet.
Do you know that he has a jewelry store now?
This text doesn't translate into English as it appears to be a string of repeated characters without meaning in any language.
God provides for us.
Walking, why don't you wait in the heat?
It's unbelievable that this mature, mistaken, and poor person has become like this.
He became the vice president of the Global Education Center.
Let him tell you, let him teach you. You are a teacher and he is a teacher, but look where he is now and where you are now.
Okay, okay
Okay, Abdullah, normal.
They'll tell you the secret of the matter.
Professor Jab, Professor Jab.
Professor, I didn't do anything!
Professor, don't you know who he is?
Yes, my love, I know who he is.
I'm telling you, we won't have a chance like this again.
Oh me, I'm going to look for a job! That's funny, I swear it's funny.
Alright mate, the job's in the bag.
Thank you for everything you've done, thank you, thank you.
Send him my regards.
My mother will catch up with you here with details. May God protect you, I'll tell her, he sends his greetings.
Okay, goodbye my love, in God's care.
"Your brother is going to open a ministry, but you understand that, right, son!"
Oh mother, we will work, we will work at the highest level.
Come on, son, if you work with him, won't they say anything?
Just give it to him like that.
This is a good thing, isn't it?
Perfect! It's automatic, without a doubt.
Alright, my love, please make my dream come true.
Before your dream, my dream.
The goal is to build a tower between the Corniche towers.
Come on, what are you waiting for!
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You can do it, Abu Saleh!
It seems your friend is troubled.
He doesn't see it that way, buddy.
You can do it, Abu Saleh!
Are you sure he's standing? Take the mobile and give it to Abu Saleh.
Look, there's something behind this, and I'm a hundred million percent sure that Abu Sultan is upset with him.
His relationship with Abu Saleh wasn't good.
No, Abu Sultan wouldn't do that unless he intended to do something else.
Seriously, to that extent?
Why is the car door short?
Finally, he works on opening the minister's car doors.
Oh my son, don't break my heart, don't break my heart.
For your information, all the stories we hear in the cafes happen in the country.
But I can't believe what I'm hearing!
My heart stopped, my heart stopped.
Oh my daughter, I'm afraid the women will find him and gossip, not mentioning the name of the Kind, the Collector of Dishes; he spreads false rumors about me among the women, oh my daughter.
Say something, Abu Sultan, I'm talking. I'm Shudoukh, I'll fly.
Please, I know what I'm doing.
This topic has nothing to do with you.
Manira, I'm working at a slow pace.
Since I opened the door for him, this is the beginning of the plan in my head.
I deserve to be a minister, not him.
Let me work, for I am a Philistine.
They allow him to throw it.
Yes, plan.
He needs to trust me first.
They told me we appointed him minister because they appointed him two months before me.
Because I'm very sure he'll lose his job.
Ambiguity can spoil.
What is this?
What's this again?
And every activity he goes to, the photographer will take many pictures of him until his image becomes very common in the newspapers.
And floating until it swims to the surface.
Are you sure?
Woe to you, you're waiting. Let me work on it and you'll see.
On the contrary, Your Excellency.
Of course, sir/madam.
Okay, tell me.
Did you thank him for the lamb? By the way, the meat was delicious.
The man is outside, go see him.
McLauchlan, people want to give you a good reputation, and you want to humiliate yourself.
Minister, enter, enter.
No, no, no, don't take my picture either. But a photo with His Excellency the Minister, a photo, Your Excellency.
Another violin waving.
Oh man! Brother, I really loved your plan.
I want you to take it to him.
Picture, picture, picture.
He is a minister, he has it too.
Okay, I'll tell you, yay!
Go to the page before the last page.
Look at the picture in front of him with the groom.
She says: "There is no true deity except God!"
Yes, he has one or two pictures every day.
As you say, he's a social activist, okay, okay, bye-bye.
We all love you, but I don't know what's wrong with you.
He is everywhere (phrase).
Those who endure without losing, deserve to be envied. The tree that bears fruit is seen by the wind. (Proverb)
Show me the way to the market!
Not ready?
Peace be upon you.
Hello, and peace be upon you, hello.
You are very famous.
Yes, your name is Abdulaziz Abdullah, right?
This is Hamoudi.
What did I tell you?
Three hundred and fifty
For this famous person,
Are you home today? Is something wrong?
Leave me alone, I have a headache today, my head hurts, I feel pain all over my body, and my colon is deteriorating.
I'm tired, very tired. It's been a month and I'm still going through it.
Let me rest today.
O Mother of Sultan,
Can I say something?
Ma'am, I just want him to take me.
You're starting to like it.
You saw for yourself what fame does!
I know. Thank God you could.
Frankly,
Your distributor is anxious; it seems he likes this story.
I'll send you my brother Saad.
No, I didn't follow up on anything, and I didn't read the newspaper. I don't know.
Excellent service, with safety.
If God wants to destroy a particle, He gives it wings.
Hello mate, do you have a conference here in the hotel tonight?
Marriage?
So, you're not doing anything like a party, a birthday, or a wedding?
I don't know, but you might be able to see through the bag with your eyes.
Ah, there's a hotel behind me, right?
Can I drop you off at the car and go into the hotel to ask you?
Come on, come on, come on, and take your time. Come on and ask, come on.
God help you all, folks.
Is this minister letting us sleep or go?
That means he didn't find joy, marriage, or any problem that would make him throw one away.
He visited six thousand hotels and didn't find anything to his liking. He has bad luck just like his face.
Silence, please.
Okay, I didn't find his birthday, no.
Come on, you can find the second half!
In every issue, he has a hundred pictures.
I don't sleep! I don't get tired! Oh brother.
I wonder, buddy, the newspaper editor says that the first thing we need to do is prepare his picture, and then I'll get the newspaper.
She said my children participated in a contest about the picture of your minister.
One asks the other, "How many pictures of the minister are in the newspaper?"
And the winner is.
The story isn't like that. You have to come to the cafe and hear the comments every day about his picture in the newspaper. It's an ongoing tale.
I wish, his death is very near.
As they say, when the moth wants to die, it flies closer to the light.
People will leave you and move on.
He became one of the most famous people in the country.
Okay, okay, who is he?
You ruined my reputation.
God bless you and her.
She said that we were all married except Amal al-Ghibah; she is the only one among us who is not married.
It's my destiny.
It's not my fate to get married.
And I forgot about marriage.
God is sufficient for him who has arranged it from behind.
Do you see those sick people sitting over there?
You know, what's the problem with them?
Do you see the person playing with their hair?
Is this a boy or a girl?
After my father dies, it means he was killed.
I saw him, he's grown up, hasn't he?
It's not right to keep him tied to the maid.
Go and make some tea.
I'm happy to talk to Mama. But she only has one hump, she has two humps for her back.
I've told you a hundred times not to interfere; Khaled is my son, not yours.
Nothing but Khulood and the servants and the servants and Khulood.
Oh, Mama, that's not good. Khaled is spending 24 hours with the service and doesn't want anyone else.
Get up. I want to rest, I want to sleep. How?
Oh God, Saud, your brother Khalid has become a girl.
Wait a bit, I won't tell my father about you.
I wonder what's wrong with Khalid?
Saud says Khalid does makeup and acts like a girl. What's the problem? What's the problem?
Oh God, Oh God, Oh God! Saudi.
Khaled is putting makeup on his face! It's just a little makeup. A boy saw a makeup palette and played with it.
I saw a very small dot, and it's not even clear.
He is kind, good, and golden.
I must go back to Saudi.
I haven't seen you in a while.
The last time I asked you, Saeed, what you wanted to be when you grow up, you didn't tell me. Now, tell me what you want to be when you grow up?
And you, Khaloudi, and Saad, you're going to stay in an office, and what do you want to be in it?
This year, I will go to Britain as I did last year.
Yes, contact Raed Al-Zaybi in Bahrain.
Tell him to bring Susan, Khaled, and Fahad.
And say to Saloom for Samora.
I seek forgiveness from Allah.
Today, my father told me to choose.
Should I work on the land that overlooks the sea or the land next to it?
I said I don't want to choose.
I can live with you, my love, anywhere.
Thank you, my love.
And you taught me how to fish?
Yow! Ya Malik, I want to open my eyes and they're telling me I've graduated college.
It doesn't seem to be a men's perfume.
I don't know, but there's a very strange smell.
Oh my God, what's happening to me?
Your way of speaking has become feminine.
I forgot you were a man.
And could you also speak to people like this outside?
I can't believe it, Khalid!
Please, get out of my room!
Oh, what a pity! Oh, Khadija!
I found you disobedient.
Oh, please, don't hurt my feelings. I'll tell mom about you.
He is my son, and I understand him very well.
Oh, what a pity! My dearest, my light, may all children have the same kindness and sensitivity as he does.
And when you meet a man who is gentle and kind, you say he's gay.
Woe betide you if you say such things about your brother.
Shut up, you're making a fuss over nothing.
You sneaky thing, he just puts on very nice perfume. What's the difference between men's and women's perfume now?
I'm telling you here, don't say that in front of your father.
I want it.
I'll take a look at it, but be quiet so Mohammed doesn't notice.
How do these girls meet?
What a pity! A pretty girl like that does that!
Don't ask for it, don't ask for it!
I'm afraid he'll feel there's something tied to him.
Give yourself a break.
I know you're seeing Bluetooth becoming more widespread now.
I'm waiting for Saad, let's wait for him to come.
How are you, Saad?
God protect you.
We didn't play cards, we were outside.
Yes, why?
Are you doing anything to eat?
I've been sleeping here in your apartment for two days!
Because of the Bluetooth story.
Yes, his older brother threatened him.
He's afraid of him.
Don't try, I told you not to try.
O my son, protect me from the devils among the jinn and the envious humans!
I found a solution.
I'm leaving. How can I face people? I can't find myself!
And what am I going to tell your father?
Say anything to him.
Poor kids, they just change a man.
This is final, Mama.
I remember when Khalid was little.
Of course, this is the result for sure.
Stop, please get out.
The right things always hurt.
The box broke.
Maybe I can live in Doha.
I won't be able to face people.
My phone is off for a while.
And you're scolding me, Amal!
You're a girl and you spend your whole day at home.
What can I say as a man who walks around all day and talks to people outside?
Oh my goodness, Amals, this is so difficult!
I can't live while I'm wasting my days, and my head is always down.
My father, for two days, feels that something is wrong in the house and that there has been a change.
How long will my father be absent from the event taking place in this house?
Sometimes I blame Dad and sometimes I don't.
They don't reproach him. Oh, Amal, when I remember his hard work and dedication to his job, so that we could live with dignity among people.
And I blame him.
When he leaves the house, the responsibility is on their mother.
Let's forget about the past now.
Does my father know or not?
But I'm ready.
Bluetooth adapter
I won't give it to him.
I don't want to see the shock on my father's face.
I'll keep feeling severe pain.
Alright! Well,
He knows how to throw at us.
It is much better to know something than to know nothing at all.
What a pity that our house has come to this.
Because a dirty bomb called Chlorine exploded in it.
And the customs and traditions.
We will find
Tighten their voices on it.
And they don't listen to him.
They only hear one voice.
What is this filth and strangeness?
And they walk on all the good.
What comes to mind?
You suddenly decided to study abroad.
We can only say, "May God protect you, my son!"
God bless you.
The people who come second get the gifts, not those who are leaving.
You're right.
This is the law.
But every rule has exceptions.
Amal, dance / get up quickly.
Did he see it, my daughter?
I can't hear anything.
Abu Saad!
Abu Saad
Abu Saad, what happened to you?
Oh father, what happened to you, oh father?
Oh Father!
Don't mess up.
You're a wonderful person.
Any man would be lucky to propose to you.
I didn't leave you because of any fault in you.
I broke up with you.
Because it's impossible.
I accept my children's uncle to be
Man, he's like your brother.
Valid
You're here every day.
Before you come,
You were hidden in the undergarments.
It was a long time ago, when we were down there.
This is very strong language, can you handle language like this?
You're making a thousand and two hundred, you're earning a lot of money!
What Allah wills, Allah desires.
Come on, come on.
You've been here for only seven months, stop complaining and take me home.
Alas and alack! Every time I take you somewhere, people ask: "What does he see in you?" And he's never satisfied, today he asked for a raise.
Dior is laughing at you.
I'll be coming in less than seven months.
Oh my son, he was shouting at me, he was shouting at me.
Return it to him, so we can get rid of it.
Bring him back and get someone else!
Tell your son, he doesn't understand what's behind this word! He doesn't know its cost in terms of time and money.
And driving practice. Return it and let's get rid of it!
The first time I came here was six months ago.
Alright, I'll tell you something new for you.
Bertol is now $114, before it was half a riyal per kilo, maybe 5 riyals, everything is expensive now, sir.
Open your mind and listen to what I'm saying!
What was the salary I offered you when you first came here?
You gave me seven hundred.
You're still new, very new. You've only been here for six months and this salary of eight percent is too much.
I need money.
The leadership I'm talking about is old, old, and you're still new.
This six hundred became a hundred.
Come on!
He told me, "I'll give you a raise, but only by 100 riyals."
And it doesn't matter to three hundred.
Is what I told you correct?
No, no screen. That'll cause a problem when I escape.
No, alas, the screen.
Those who fled from their colonizers.
Are you afraid?
Due to the pre-pastoral nature of these people.
They are paid between six and seven hundred. Do you know how much they earn?
How much do you earn?
Okay, why are you afraid?
Not afraid.
God is sufficient.
I called Nasser and told him to go and see it.
No one.
He was so drunk that he stole the phone I had bought for him.
What did you do?
What have you done!
They did everything they could, took his passport and put it with him.
You are permitted to leave! Sir, you are excused.
They're coming at him from all sides.
That's the problem, that's the problem.
And after all this, they still count.
"They object to us and harm us."
I told you to return it.
But do you think I'll let him go?
I donate his past, too.
He will return, and that means he will return.
Personally, I prefer to pay for my ticket and send it abroad rather than keep it here and make money.
I wish I had gotten here, I want to find my brother.
The man is inside now, no one will buy now.
At the beginning of the game, you seemed nervous, as I observed.
But what are you talking about? We were worried our team wouldn't score any goals.
We need more than three, we want eight, twelve, fifteen.
You made me feel before the match that you were afraid, you were afraid of the rival team.
I'm not worried about the other team, I'm worried about our team. I'm afraid we won't have more than three wins.
This is the level of our team, I know. I'm looking for the level of our team.
That's a lot of trust from you.
The rival team has nothing.
Wow! The Lexicuss team has scored a goal, you're ahead with the first goal.
Ava, where are you going?
Indy misses coming to my house.
Do you have a car?
Come on, I've come to you, I'll hang you.
Thanks, man.
Why are you trying? You won't be able to tie our team!
Sir/Madam, the match has just started and the league has just begun.
How are you? Did you hear what they said?
He said, "This is a big problem."
Mahmoud, bring the tea!
Now my friend is coming to pick me up, quickly.
Man! My buddy Sajjad.
Sir, take it!
What's wrong with him?
Yes, he's coming from India.
Yes, he's football crazy.
What does this thing say about our team, the Foxes?
They are the ones who won, they are the ones who won.
Come on! Come on! Bow down, come on! Come on! Bow down quickly, quickly, the match will start soon. Bring a water with you, the Cubs are going to play today.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have with us one of the most famous fans of the Covex team, his name is Talab.
This talk tells you to defeat them because they were lacking.
What they're saying, what they're saying isn't right.
What's missing? Each team has at least twenty players.
Whether it's him or them, it doesn't matter.
This fox is very clever.
This is our best fan.
Okay, congratulations on your win, Thaloub! Any final words for the Knights?
All words stopped.
When people say Lex's name (or when they say Lex's name)
His name is high in the sky.
This is the good fan.
Listen to me, brother.
You might find him like that, happy like that.
Come on! Sweetie.
Okay, where's the Indian man who loves football?
Haven't seen you in a while?
Wow! That man has become a big star, he doesn't come here anymore.
I saw Aidam a few days ago and didn't recognize him. He was sitting in a cafe in Villaggio called Starbucks or something like that.
I remember this guy, he suddenly sat with us at the cafe, and he didn't have money for coffee.
He gave him ten riyals extra in front of me.
What caused this?
Hey! [Hey man], he's sitting with important officials in the club, they're helping him and doing what he wants.
Can I say something off-topic?
Yes, Uncle.
My uncle says: Whether I come or go,
I don't know why you support a crappy club like this.
D.D.F.R.A.G.I.S.D.H.Y.T.C.H.T. (D.D.F.R.A.G.I.S.D.H.Y.T.C.H.T.) is my heart's team.
When you open my heart
You can hold a lot of wolves in it.
I didn't hear the verse he wrote about justice for your honor.
When we had a match.
Please, please! Read this poem, read, read.
Oh my uncle. Oh God, who knows my secret.
My soul is very tired.
I never sleep at night.
You know we, the Roburs' fan club.
You won't be able to tell me the winner's name because I have a scoop.
We will hold a press conference, and God willing, we will announce the winner's name.
The one who spends.
The beautiful Taoud, this fan who was honored by the management of the Foxes Club today in a kind, rare, and truly wonderful way.
Oh, uncle!
Congratulations, Taleb, on this beautiful honor, and it's a wonderful gift, of course.
What do you think, is it a pen or a watch?
This is your father, Haj, Qesma.
This is a movement.
That's him, I told you.
We need to tell the police.
Don't go anywhere!
The whole audience, all of it, the entire audience.
No, no, no! Son, it's not him, it's a young man who looks like him.
I'm telling you, that's not him.
I was late.
I don't know the match schedules. Brother.
Okay, how can we accept it?
Let's wait until the team called "The Knights" plays their next match.
Here he is, here he is, I've seen him.
Okay, let's follow him.
Oh my, I was running late...
Here he is, here he is, here he is, here he is.
Come on, follow you, follow you, come on, follow you, follow you.
The problem is that I'm not sure if it's him or not.
Oh, father! I told you! That's him!
I say that the right and wise thing to do is to go to them and ask them, "We heard that you have it, where did it come from? How did you get it? When did you get it?"
Oh father, you always make things complicated.
We believe in Him, and we are submitters to Him.
Dirt, God preserve it. Yes, it's mine.
Yes, it's registered in my name, yes.
The earth next to him
Tell your father that Abu Abdurrahman as-Sabi' says hello to you, bye-bye, bye-bye.
No, no, may God guide you, but we realize we were wrong. Oh, my son! You came to us as a friend, and we mistook you for him.
God, glorified and exalted, creates many people who resemble each other.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, please, thank you.
No, no, God guide you. Sorry, sorry, and thank you, thank you.
Okay, with your permission, I'm here to help you. Bye, good luck, bye-bye.
And you say you're sure!
I don't know what your father is going to do! I'm very worried.
What have you done, Walid!
Why, why, why, when I was walking, the bag handles were stuck in it.
And try to solve this problem now!
Clean up your room, clean up.
I wish nothing bad happens.
I wish nothing bad happens.
Now, try to make your father understand this!
Before my father knows?
It was cut into a million pieces.
Oh mom, let's buy something like that as soon as possible.
Before my father comes.
Oh my God!
You know your father, when he's angry, he's crazy.
Clean up your room and don't come out of it.
He didn't do anything.
By mistake, he started popping the cups with his fingers, and they slipped and scattered.
Oh mother, I'm worried about him.
Don't know where he is?
No, no, no, no, his father is just like Maher.
Why are you doing this to the boy, girl? Oh! My daughter.
She scared you and frightened him, do you want the boy to go crazy?
May I say something, my daughter?
Hey, where did you see this boy?
Okay, if he comes, I'll tell you.
I wish nothing bad happens.
Auntie, I know where Wael is.
Come on, I'll go with you. I'll show you where it is.
Come on. God willing.
Here he is.
Oh grandmother, I don't want to go back home.
Hide me with you.
I didn't see the cup.
I swear to God, I don't know.
This is what might hurt you from your father, may God guide him.
Come on, son!
Don't be afraid, my son. As long as I am in the house, do not worry, my child.
I have the solution.
No problem. Abu Walid.
Oh brother, for God's sake, O father of Walid!
This time, I forgive him for your sake.
Didn't you see it at home?
Where is he going? Where did he go?
Where is he? Where?
It's okay, my son, my heart, crying won't do you any good.
Are you sure, Father?
Hey! My son, what is it?
Are you going to leave it here? I'm afraid one of the kids might vomit on it and break it.
He asked me and told me that I need to show him one like the one you brought me, that Wael broke.
He wants the exact same one. I'll go and find it, the one that's left in the shop. He's very lucky. Where are the boys?
In the room, I study.
Alright, take care of him.
That's the game, I'll stop.
O the mercy of God.
Okay, keep studying!
Your father, just this game only and we'll learn.
Oh father, why is he talking about his aunt?
Oh father, don't tell my brother. Oh father, I swear to you, this is the last time.
That's what I tell him.
And you, in particular. You displeased me. Am I your friend at the cafe?
I'll tell my friends about you if you don't listen!
Okay, I won't call. My phone is in my pocket, if you want to talk, that's fine.
Oh my daughter, why don't you take him to a doctor?
God guide you, mother.
He's being severely bullied because he apologizes all the time.
What a pity this boy is.
Patience.
Mom, where's Umoulah? I didn't see her with you today?
And I'm going with her.
My sister doesn't get along with her in-laws.
Yay! My daughter, I didn't tell you about Mona's story with her son Nice.
His son is the age of Al-Waleed, may God have mercy on him.
And the same height.
Last night, she was telling me that she didn't know what to do with her son.
She insisted that he take him to the hospital, but his husband Joseph refused.
I found out about the story the day before yesterday.
He saw her and reminded her.
He said: "Why didn't you tell me?"
This is a psychological condition.
This is rejected.
He must take his son and tie him to the middle of the backyard.
And then he tells you to do it again and asks about your bed.
All this is just hot air (Economy of language).
What did you say, Umm Munira?
I was telling her, eat, eat.
Eat and enjoy.
What a pity.
Mother, Mother.
Thank God your father didn't find out about you.
And otherwise, he'll kill you with a beating.
Alright, go to the bathroom and wash yourself before your father wakes up, or he'll cause a disaster.
I won't listen to what you're saying.
What a pity!
She's crying and moving.
I'm afraid something bad will happen to my children.
I need to take them to their uncle's place so I can beat them.
I'm worried.
Though they failed, they were successful.
Why are you taking them to their uncle?
Nasser did 48 out of 50.
Why don't they get 50 out of 50?
The uncle warned them.
Frankly, I agree with his opinion.
Forget feelings.
And my brother has to whip them.
Okay, I'll do it, I'll do it.
This is the last time, this is the last time.
Fifty out of fifty.
"It disgusts us how much I have to assure them that he is our son."
Why don't you get 50 out of 50?
Silence, silence, silence, I told you, but you're not listening/hearing me.
I yearn for my voice, but you don't listen to what I say.
Go to hell!
Let me catch up with him more, curse him.
Oh no, stop!
So that next time you review very well, review!
Okay, that's enough.
Do you know what he's going to do?
I'll let you take turns jumping, and you'll be like falafel.
Be cautious when going to public places with your family.
He's pulling our leg.
The professor, with a hand, calms his tears.
Why are you crying?
This is an excellent mark.
Stop talking like that, why are you crying?
You're supposed to be happy.
Son, everyone has gone and even the buses are gone. You're waiting for someone to give you a ride.
At the school entrance, it means he is waiting for the bus. The bus has arrived and the boys have gotten off.
What's the latest on the boy who committed suicide today?
They gave him his certificate.
And his father started threatening him if he didn't get full marks.
Father, father. Come back! Father, come back.
Hello and welcome, we are live in a new episode of our program "Without Borders".
Oil accounts for more than thirty-five percent of total energy and various energy sources.
While the rest goes to natural gas, coal, and hydroelectric power.
Therefore, oil is considered the main source of energy in the world.
The Gulf countries and Iran alone have 686 billion barrels.
Iran followed with 12%, then Iraq with 10%, and then Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates with 9%.
Each of them will come to Venezuela with a six percent increase.
Then Russia by five percent.
The Gulf states and Iran account for two-thirds of the world's reserves.
Unprecedented prices and more than one hundred and nine dollars for the first time in history.
And in this episode, we try to understand many of the complexities related to oil.
And the problems facing oil-exporting countries.
Despite their prices being significantly high
Also the problems that citizens and residents face in these countries.
Due to inflation and unprecedented rise
What will appear next on the screen or they can write to us through our website "www.Aljazeera.net"
Because the market is the key factor today.
And not the producer countries.
Today, what determines the price of something is market forces.
What is outside the scope of OPEC
Of course, supply and demand also play a role.
But other factors are
Other reasons are political tensions.
In the world
And real estate markets.
And stock markets and so on.
And move on to pricing in the estimation.
"Goods" like oil, for example
And tomorrow you'll receive a thousand dollars, God willing.
In 2004, oil jumped from $44 to $147.
And today we see that even gas prices are rising.
Fluctuates from day to day
Oil prices fell below $90.
And increased in the second quarter.
Especially with the arrival of spring and secondly because most global filters are under maintenance.
Always... for the second quarter
Seasonal demand for oil is declining.
In winter, it's below ninety.
And all these indicators show that speculations have power and control over the market now.
It meant a lot when we returned to the traditional market back then.
The market used to be influenced by supply and demand.
Seasonal supply and demand
Today, we see that economic growth is
Today or tomorrow, General Fallon, the commander of the Central Region in Afghanistan and Iraq, resigned.
And his resignation sparked a huge reaction because of its connection to what some call America's promised war.
Political or Geopolitical Effects
That can affect the oil market negatively or positively and quickly.
The result will certainly return and will have its impact.
Even speculators respond to political influences.
He can affirm that, he will say, some will tell you that the American war on Iran is coming.
Here, what will happen to the market? The market will be optimistic in a way.
This question, dear colleague, is now in the light of what the White House has announced.
And this brought a tense atmosphere to the area.
This is the mystery.
But Fallon might see this scenario.
Take a quick look at the oil market.
Today, and prove with numbers that there is no shortage.
Let me give you a parable: In sixty-two weeks, once on the Sabbath.
In the United States of America, its oil reserves have increased by more than half over the past five years.
Today, no, I mean...
Not even for the next war, because today I'm telling you that even the world has a profit-making warehouse.
Even today, in any country you choose, you can find long queues in front of gas stations.
This is something else.
What risks does this issue pose?
What number do you expect it to be? I don't know.
$100 or maybe $80, possibly less.
It might escalate if tensions really increase.
That's why, as you said, the Gulf gives sixty percent.
In a country far even from oil-producing countries
You will find that the impact comes back negatively on the oil market.
And it's possible to reach three hundred dollars.
And shifted from stocks and other markets to the oil market. Today you'll see more than two or three trillion dollars.
Today we see printing.
There are more than a hundred speculations a day - meaning
These tensions in the region and we are still awaiting them.
April, as has been said, that this month will be the month to end this war.
God knows, I... I mean... I don't know.
In the area now.
This year is the year of elections.
And the current American administration still has a few months left.
George H. W. Bush launched a war on Somalia and sent thirty thousand Canadians in his final days in the White House.
We sense reality, but we do not anticipate events.
But I don't think that scenario will happen.
Because this scenario is very expensive.
America won't attend anything, you'll pay, along with Iran and the consumer countries.
America Today
Now it depends on African oil, which has many other alternatives.
Look, there's nothing, let's talk clearly.
In your introduction, you stated that sixty percent.
From oil reserves
But now they're issuing eighty...
I am from West Africa.
I'm from West Africa, and anything they export from any other region in the world.
Oil production
Because this is a fixed number and fixed reservations.
What is called "deepwater production" or "offshore production" from the depths of the vast oceans?
Therefore, the Gulf will remain a tough number.
And the Caspian Sea oil.
And I see them as dreams because they are not real or factual.
They are tearing it apart and destroying it.
The most important thing is that there is
Today, Qatar is the world's largest energy exporter.
Liquefied natural gas (LNG), and that's why these countries are a tough number.
and the energy needs of countries
Certainly there's something called secure provisioning.
And despite internal objections in the United States, even at the level of the general public.
But some concerns still remain.
About President Bush, oh dear.
Try to observe how political risks do not emanate from the Gulf states.
It means he didn't care, he didn't care, he didn't care. Not out of kindness, because none of us act with compassion.
There's not much work that you give so generously.
But not in the current field.
We're not involved in charity work.
Or to be wasteful.
But generous to strangers and not generous to anyone else.
With America accurately.
Where is the market?
Where we find economic benefits, we will go.
I'll think about it.
Like oil and gas
You do it because of kindness.
I have the evidence.
I have the evidence.
It can't be more than sixty or seventy dollars.
Not the rise in prices.
But the decline of the US dollar that you emphasize
You are ranked first among people in the GCC and OPEC.
Importing in dollars, and you reject that.
Changed the currency nonetheless despite the currency collapse and thus
Even though returning is not in your favor.
Okay, I didn't say it had to be 70.
And this is the experts' opinion, not mine.
Okay, the dollar has dropped by 30 percent and oil has risen more than that decline.
If we take the base year as 2004
Let's see if oil prices will range from thirty-eight to thirty-eight and eighty dollars.
Sure thing.
The price of oil has increased.
But it's a minor increase, Your Excellency.
If we take it into account.
Now we take it into consideration.
Even at these prices
That is, if we compare it to the year 2015.
Until its price exceeded the rate of the declining US dollar.
Very exciting
React to the dollar's depreciation.
When the dollar falls, oil prices rise.
This is something the market has started to feel.
Our concern now is to reduce.
What, the situation has changed. At the beginning, two years ago, they were saying that, but the situation has changed now and it has become apparent.
And the dollar began to lose value against other major currencies like the euro and the British pound.
The question is whether you peg your currency to the dollar.
Weak currency with no backing.
This is a historic age.
Gasoline and its derivatives are priced in dollars, even European production in the North Sea, Russia, and Norway.
He says that America in the mid-seventies
I abolished the gold standard that used to back the American dollar.
Not correct (Or, more idiomatically: That's not right)
Okay, tell me what's right.
The organization OPEC includes
Four Gulf states
Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Today, OPEC's share in the world market
It's forty percent.
Today, if we say that the world consumes 85 million barrels
The one who deals with the dollar in oil pricing.
If you set the price in the second currency, everyone will...
You won't be able to.
All oil-producing countries must agree.
You, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, are a shining star.
Those who own 66% of the world's reserves are the elites.
Bookings, but I think of them as exports.
Including Venezuela, Libya, and Iran
Cameron, Angola, and all these countries organized under OPEC
His market share does not exceed forty percent.
It was produced and exported outside of OPEC.
And this won't fit into the forty percent.
No one can do it alone unless...
Some countries tried.
Not a real attempt
It's you who's being rejected because of American ties.
From dollars to another currency.
Oil-producing countries
Only one well was imported before.
If they bring it, it's a loss.
And his work rose significantly.
Sell its oil for dollars.
At the entrance or reception device, he received it, then requested his money in dollars and converted it to his local currency.
Its currency is not linked to the dollar.
Clearly, but he
But that's not your problem either; you're investing in dollars, but if your currency isn't tied to the dollar, then you don't have a problem.
My main question now is
What are the concerns and implications of pegging your currency to the dollar, given the dollar's depreciation?
She had been engaged for years.
Especially in the 1970s when the dollar was very strong and had great authority.
This is not an easy separation at all.
Divorce is easy.
There isn't any here.
Divorce has its costs.
This is also doing good for those people; it's not against them.
In the profit and loss statement
Deutsche Welle announced yesterday that there are 4 countries, including Qatar.
But there is also a report on Gulf financing saying that there are four Gulf countries, of course, because the Sultanate of Oman withdrew from the unified Gulf currency.
I read a statement on Dow Jones, and I don't think it's a genuine statement.
The central director of the Qatari Central Bank was fired.
He said yes and that there would be studies, but also that all Gulf countries must be involved.
Profit and loss must be examined with great care, free from emotions.
Leave it for review and until they come.
See, I can bring you together with some other economists who can conduct another study.
This contradicts the study's findings.
The global company said something very simple and organized, and issued a report on March 8th.
Just four days ago.
Global House ID: The divine solution and veils over a decision that is not mine to make.
The political decision can be boiled down to two things.
Longing, the first thing is not three.
He intends or the five countries with Kuwait, regarding his intention in two thousand and ten to issue the currency or study the issuance of a unified Gulf currency.
The second point is to issue a decision to delink from the dollar.
Firstly, regarding the unified currency.
From my personal point of view
To see the unified Gulf currency
This currency will be strong.
Will be
It could be one of the strong currencies in the world, as I said.
And what will come out of the reserves and the great profit?
Therefore, this is what the Prime Minister focused on when he said:
Gulf countries because no single country can do it alone.
Unless there is strong economic content
And today's economic growth, until we see it in euros.
Certainly, don't let yourself forget that the central bank plays a significant role.
In assessment
And the profit and loss account
From all this news
Tense situation
Two and eight thousand observer visits they said, the house of a scholar said this inflation will continue.
I've been in the Gulf countries for a long time, but the solution is in the hands of the governments.
Some countries have raised salaries by seventy percent, such as the UAE.
To stop the inflationary process that
And the question now is, when will you raise the salaries of those who need it?
I'll hear your response after a short ad.
Today's episode: Oil reserves and current production of Gulf Cooperation Council member states
She has reserves worth two hundred and sixty-four billion.
And two out of ten barrels.
And nine out of ten leave daily.
One million sixty-one thousand and a few hundred, and production of one billion and production of two and seven tenths of a million.
Qatar is fifteen and twelve billion and produces 850 thousand, Oman is five and six out of ten billion and produces 707 thousand.
Bahrain produced one hundred and twenty million, five hundred and forty-three thousand, two hundred and thirty products.
The total revenue was 38 billion in one year.
From 2003 to 2007
Europe one hundred billion
Sixty billion in the Middle East and forty billion.
In Asia and other countries
While the gross domestic product of the Gulf states reached seven hundred and seventeen billion dollars in 2006.
The net in two thousand seven is seven hundred and ninety-nine billion, seven hundred and seven from two hundred and seven billion, seven from ten billion expected.
In the year two thousand and eight hundred and ninety-two and twelve of every ten billion.
While inflation continues to devour the salaries of employees and people working in this field.
But it will rise to eight out of ten in 2008.
Kuwait 14% but in 2008 it is expected that eight and nine out of 10 will be from the United Arab Emirates.
She was sixteen while Saudi Arabia was six and a half and will reach six.
And eight out of ten
Salaries are eaten up.
Okay, what are the expenses and ratios you will give to the poor here?
So, if we want to solve the problem
Real solution
Always the salaries, always increasing salaries.
His solution is not correct.
I'm not against raising salaries.
Not true, me, not true
Always
Of course, there is a belief.
The increasing situation, and the rise without controlling inflation, will make inflation eat up all these increases.
To tackle inflation, an important matter involving a committee of experts and all specialists
And now this committee is developing
Due to the increase in salaries worldwide
And of course, the golden rule of economics says:
It's not going to end.
And whatever
There are too many increases in the prices and you can't keep up with them, no matter how much they increase.
Inflation will increase.
The solution is necessary and essential.
With a scientific study here at Bayt.com, a specialized employment institute, a study was conducted with the assistance of the British company YouGov.
They examined 15,000 employees working in Gulf countries in 20 key sectors.
Especially experts and those who have jobs there, there is no job satisfaction.
Because inflation here has started to eat away.
Especially those with experience.
Are you thinking of moving from these countries where inflation is constantly eating away at them?
Now you will lose.
This is the simple concept, and you're putting the simple concept and trying to apply it.
The solution to inflation is to increase salaries.
The balance is available.
This exists.
We are concerned, the state is concerned, and we are doing what we can.
To solve this problem with a real solution.
Temporary solutions never solve the problem but rather exacerbate it.
Adorn it.
We hope to be able to get more time for this to be put in place by the committees.
All requests
This is boredom, Your Excellency.
The feeling of boredom always is
But the state tried and raised salaries by 40 percent.
This is an important point in the subject of increases.
As for raises, as long as you want raises, you only want the nationalists, as if the non-nationalists work for Burkina Faso and Zimbabwe.
You take Colombians, but you don't eat non-Colombians.
While the highest percentage is found in it.
You are Ahmed, you live in Qatar, not in Germany.
And everyone is talking about it and feeling sorry.
Much higher salaries than in the public sector.
And conversely, we saw
In the public sector
And on the contrary, the government becomes.
Because the best units and skills have started.
I also read a report, as you know, we are in the oil field.
Or work.
We are like our experts.
Engineers and workers coming from outside Qatar
Because we also interact with the global market.
For all these reasons, what is the rate of increase in wages?
"Please, only God is great, but we say"
The government has a plan.
And I say, to control the loss, it's the most important thing.
Temporary solution
"And we'll see, and I'm sure."
That there is
Positive results
It will be on the edge of fifteen percent.
Okay, the second good report says that 22 billion barrels of oil will come your way, and 43 billion cubic meters of gas.
Okay, what's the process of spraying it?
Action and of course we
But talk of economic growth must also reflect on the people.
And that reflects any economic growth today, Qatar has the highest economic growth in the world.
And the reverse is true.
The "cargoes" in the country are also part of
Even if there weren't these "helper" countries and such large projects.
In this country, it is not part of the inflation.
Caused some inflation
And he also gave a lot of money to the market.
First, regarding the link between the dollar and oil.
Sold oil for protection.
I am from the United States of America, thus stability in power.
Thank you
Saad al-Ghamdi from Saudi Arabia, your question Saad.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
It's really a good episode and a nice title.
The thing I really want to talk about is that the region is now coming under American policies.
American policy in its war now, in addition to the cultural war it is trying to make against Islam, there is also a global economic war.
Now in China
And American inability also reached sixty billion dollars with Japan.
And Japan has already invested in 2000.
With America to the equivalent of nine.
Billion while he now invests with the European Union with more than twenty-seven billion dollars
Don't interfere with American politics and let the dollar be the inevitable currency of the whole world.
My brother, I say buy it now.
And the Gulf region will become
As a place
Thank you, brother Saad.
Mohamed El-Awa from Egypt
Hello, Your Excellency, the agent with you.
Middle Eastern Arab leaders, Your Excellency, remind me of...
When it is
When there are calls for price adjustments.
Adjust salaries in return for prices as you mentioned, O Happiness.
In Qatar, we thought of you as a prototype.
And he remains at the top of his head what is not counted as a promotion. This is a style of Arabic.
We want, we consider Qatar as a brother.
He has the right to say what he wants to say. Do you have a question? Of course he has the right, he is responsible for this policy.
The question first.
His supervisor must take into account
This is a second time that the public opinion should be responded to.
With the weak, as you said, because they are from the countries that need special care.
Arab leaders don't care about the poor.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
Good evening to you and to His Highness.
I also want a raise.
Salaries are excellent and good, that's great.
Okay, thank you for the topic we need and suffer from.
I am with the poor and will always be, God willing, and we know that there are no poor people in Qatar and we are certain.
And what he said is true, the money goes to the ruling family and the governor.
And that's the important question now.
Let's answer the sisters first.
I can't afford it.
What's happening with the budget?
Now there are almost new cities like Pearl and Lusail and other places, meaning even Qatar is investing.
This is not correct, the situation.
Suitable urban plan
In short, because we still have two minutes, tell us what the State of Qatar will strive to achieve?
Qatar now, there is a post-oil and gas Qatar.
The policy is clear for the state.
Because she
Non-renewable origin
Because it is a non-renewable resource.
For today, the trend in the State of Qatar
Cairo is the capital of the Middle East in education.
Today we're visiting the Education City.
Today, this educational city includes the best universities in the world.
Building medical cities, media cities, and financial cities
Because today oil and gas
Okay, of course we're not releasing a version.
Other satellite channels
Not only the Libyan Channel, they will build a hundred Giziras, and we will not stand in front of Gizira, of course.
Because my brother, these are our countries in the Gulf now.
In the 1970s, change; now everyone is nostalgic for the 1970s' change.
Now when we see what Qatar has in terms of growth.
And this calls for a special episode about Qatar after oil.
With our vision on oil, its future, and its resources in the region, especially in Qatar. In conclusion, my greetings to the program team.
I am Ahmed Mansour, greeting you from outside the borders, peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Hello, this is a live broadcast from Doha, the capital of Qatar, this week.
And I welcome you to a new episode of our program "Without Borders."
At the same time, the State of Qatar hosts the largest U.S. military base outside the United States, Al Udeid Air Base.
With the United States' enemies in the region
Like Iran and Syria
These doors are open to returnees.
In fact, Hamas leaders enjoy special relations with the Qatari leadership.
Also, Tamim of Qatar was the only Arab leader.
Who visited the southern suburbs of Beirut destroyed by Israel in the summer of the 2006 Lebanon War?
And there is still unlimited support for the restoration of what Israel destroyed in Lebanon.
And at the time when Qatar was formed
With her older sister, in Saudi Arabia, about two years ago.
At the same time, clashes with the regime in Egypt.
Like the Lebanese file, which succeeded when others failed.
A gathering of Lebanese leaders in Doha signed an agreement that led them to safety.
To the final elections
Difficult files as well.
Who served and cared to be the engine, not a train.
The smallest Arab country
And in today's episode
We are trying to understand the foundation and principles upon which Qatari foreign policy was built.
And who benefited?
Qatar, the smallest in terms of population and geographical area, plays these significant roles.
And what qualifications enable her to do that?
That will be in a direct dialogue with the Qatari Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs.
And for our dear visitors who want to participate, they can call us on the program numbers that will appear on the screen now.
The visit made by the Emir of Qatar.
The uproar by Al Jazeera is aimed at improving relations with Saudi Arabia.
From the past, like Saudi Arabia's attempt to seize the Qatari government with the help of the Al Murrah tribe.
In an edition published on June 20th last.
What is the nature of the secret deal?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
A lot of things aren't
My estimate is correct.
I've been in many interviews here on this program, I've always said that the truth is that
That is because we consider him the porridge.
I am from the Gulf countries.
There was a misunderstanding.
Moreover,
And different viewpoints.
Actually, the issue of borders is now resolved, and it was a major obstacle.
The historical relations between Saudi Arabia and Qatar were unique.
These links, if we notice them.
Between the two states and two families.
Devastated by independence
No escape and not from their side.
Because between brothers, there are no conditions between them.
The matter is settled, and now the relations are in a state that I can confidently assert is excellent.
In the interest of the cooperative council
But how were things improving between the island and Saudi Arabia while the island was the obstacle and the reason that led to it in 2002?
There's an important point.
And I repeat, if you go back to all the shows, I always said
Not just the large ones, but I was saying that our reliance in the Cooperation Council
That Saudi Arabia is an important country in the region.
And we value our relationship with her.
There was intense media coverage, a heated media exchange, and it was clear to both parties.
These countries find themselves
What succeeded when the brothers agreed.
Especially a Saudi-Qatari house.
They found themselves in conflict.
"Here is what is in the sentence."
And I don't see that as a strategy of anyone involved in this dispute.
But excuse me, Sheikh, let me clarify the matters or put them in context or dot the i's and cross the t's.
Many observers find that Al Jazeera has changed significantly in the past few years.
At the time when the situations criticized on Al Jazeera's screen were still present.
What's happening inside Saudi Arabia?
Are these detainees, activists, or others still holding firm?
The island stopped dealing with these matters.
"How does the island's coverage affect the throw?"
Praise for the system and what the guardian of the holy places does in a different time.
First, you can ask the island management about this matter, don't ask me because I
What connects the two countries.
To maintain the stability of the region
This strategy continued and enhanced the stability of the region.
The area you're referring to is the Gulf region.
Gulf Region
There are many cases around the Gulf region.
Also an appeal from the guardians of Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Holy Mosques in Kuwait.
He had an impact on all listeners and the entire Arab world.
He spoke from the heart about resolving, overcoming, and burying Arab disputes.
Not just perspectives
No, this is about politics, and politics are opinions.
In the Arab world, it is considered
A kind of war
While in the developed world
Talking about the same interest.
Now, you have stayed for many years.
The current situation
Listen first.
There's a difference between this topic and the other one.
The idea of a small country challenging the big powers and making them feel weak.
Any difference or misunderstanding
She had her reasons.
And its causes have ended.
Due to the wisdom of our two leaders.
Is there any insurance for the marital future?
There are guarantees between two parties.
Based on love, brotherhood, and care, the two countries are united.
And leaders, their words are considered more than just a document.
Between Qatar and Saudi Arabia to develop this relationship.
And we greatly hope for this Saudi-Qatari relationship to develop.
The best and most rewarding fields
For this relationship as we have it with the Arab states and the other desert countries.
Qatar is an important country.
Okay, Saudi Arabia is an important country.
What is Egypt to Kuwait? It's not right that you made up with Saudi Arabia at the same time.
And three organizations, namely Hezbollah.
Al Jazeera is a channel.
"Are you against the regime in Egypt, the largest Arab state?"
First, let me start with this.
Egyptian people
We support the people of Egypt.
And his interest
With many Arab issues and the sacrifices of the people of Egypt
And this is the case.
"We're going to take this opportunity to understand the situation with our brothers in Egypt."
In light of what you say, you respect Egypt and Egyptians.
And we thought he was a good man.
Our difference with Egypt lies in two points.
Or a single point.
We were accused of planning to overthrow Gaza, and I don't believe it.
And we participate.
In cases belonging to other countries
He doesn't interfere in the affairs of any country unless there is an opportunity for change.
Does this mean that you intervened in Hamas' coup against the authority in Gaza?
It's certain that we, more than others, didn't know about this exactly, we heard about it from the media.
We have relations with Hamas and we have relations with others.
What made Egypt different or caused disagreement between you on this point?
I'll come to this.
Hezbollah's plan
Hezbollah and
But I speak on behalf of my country.
We might have dwelled on this topic a bit too much.
Work for the benefit of Qatar.
What did the moon say?
The pyramids spoke.
Attack on Egypt and its status.
Can I reply?
Take us back to the plot they mentioned.
These days are showing us that.
The beginning was not from the Gaza conference.
And I absolve the Egyptian people and President Hosni Mubarak of that.
If we suddenly went back in time to the Alma Conference
After the Madrid conference, do you remember the port that was established in Doha?
And when did this happen and when was the meeting supposed to be scheduled with us?
They said they don't want to hold the conference.
People, we know that you are cooperating with Israel.
Towards Qatar and this
Until we transform to be understood in the language of the Qatari.
We were sitting and talking, and talking is always a good thing.
There must be two parts.
What are they?
The opportunity has been found.
In political orientation
If we look at the Khaza'a conference that was held
Prince spoke with all the presidents, including his brother President Hosni Mubarak.
We were helped by four nations.
The brothers in Egypt have a perspective on the issue that should not be overlooked.
People are being killed and we're eating.
If you don't want it to be in Doha, we can have it anywhere in the Arab League.
It would be controversial to discuss this issue at the Kuwaiti conference.
In the hands of Israel and the Western world, it stands upright and sees what will be.
When we all said it was good, it became common, and it had no power or determination except by God. We, as Arabs, are unable to stop it, and not even a large country has stood with us in this fight.
Egypt requested a ceasefire announcement in Gaza, an hour before the fighting stopped.
Even us
We're not going to take this Arab Street lightly, our disagreement with the sisters is on one point.
This complies with international standards.
And it's not enough that hospitals and engineers are being arrested at the borders.
It was you who stood at the border.
There, and no one can enter.
Their brother didn't take it well.
Because Gaza is located next to Egypt and is considered part of the national territory.
When we talk about any human problem anywhere in the world, we are talking only about a human problem.
And we respect Egypt's dominance.
And we know his position, but that won't harm my position in Egypt.
And we hope for a lot from Egypt.
It is the largest Arab country.
And indeed we think that he brings forward our voice and the voice of an instrument from the world of the Arabs.
To all other parties
Even the rescue mission that followed Gaza.
The British tried to save her.
What happened in Gaza?
If a conference provides services and such, I consider it a bailout for the government.
We were not invited to attend a conference, but we were contacted to coordinate matters among the Gulf countries.
We gathered in the cooperative council.
These amounts will not be issued to any party.
But it will be released.
The affected parties in Gaza
Directly and this
Because entry is permitted and there are no restrictions from any side.
I am happy for Egypt, and all the people of Qatar are happy for Egypt because Egypt...
Egypt's victory in political issues is very important to us.
But you expect
"You are welcome, friend."
The minister boasted about what had been denied and said...
And as for him who harms Egypt, we will cut off his leg and break his arm.
Frankly, I think this official is harassing his country.
Frankly, they didn't fail, and their talk is not but about themselves.
What's keeping them stuck in this, and I told our sisters in Saudi Arabia, and the Saudis intervened because the king has wisdom in this matter.
For the Exploitation of Affairs in the Arab World
We agreed.
The king is the one who will decide if this is in the best interest of the country.
We discussed and supported King Abdullah's decision because we respect and trust him.
But for someone to say that we woke them up is in itself an insult to those who were woken.
As if they were school students.
I think this
The limit has been exceeded.
He believes he must impose his strength.
I'm sorry, I'm very sorry about this.
Please, if you think a small state has no rights, its rights are being violated from within.
And you come in with a bang and make your noise in Darfur.
This is an Arab decision at the Arab League.
An African decision and a United Nations decision
I think the main problem is
Hezbollah is a conspiracy along with Qatar.
Betrayal, I don't know what's in it in Qatar.
If that happens, perhaps after the swine flu, and it appears somewhere, Qatar will be the cause of the spread of this epidemic.
Qatar is a strong and calm state, aware of its size and capabilities.
But Qatar has a point of view.
Qatar has a quietly followed policy.
If Qatar can solve any Arab problem, we will consider it an honor.
Because any Arab conflict
We believe that any Arab dispute can weaken our position vis-à-vis our main issues, namely Palestine and all the other challenges we face.
The Arab world has become a future.
Even our analyses have become like theirs.
Western analysis
But there's one thing we know, we know what happened in Pakistan.
In a way, I want someone to welcome and delight me as if there were a welcoming party in Washington.
Is anyone accusing Qatar?
Did Qatar harm any Arab country?
I tried to contribute money.
These contributions are controversial.
I can pass by and say "peace be upon you," and you say: "You're saying hello to provoke my anger."
This is another matter, it means you have a problem or a shortage.
This is not my job, it's yours.
But if you have weather problems
I will always be I will always be
Especially after the speech to His Majesty King Abdullah
In Kuwait and I know this man is honest.
A man speaks his mind.
It's my heart, I always say that.
These are my words forever.
Frankly, I always say that even in the midst of our dispute with Saudi Arabia, I used to say
And you can go back to all the papers you have on the island.
The situation is different, no, no.
I'm a part of that, let's say no, we completely stop here in this case.
And we tried as much as we could.
I'll handle this matter.
Let them see their own affairs and where their mistakes are.
And we notice our mistakes, which means not everything we have is right.
Are you addressing this to the agent?
To the existence of internal problems in Egypt.
And Baby and Eve wanted to get out of this place.
Do you deny that the State of Qatar contributes in any way to a conspiracy against Egypt from abroad and tries to break its relations with Turkey and any other country?
It seems we've gained superpowers.
"And it's seventy million if we can do it, not eighty million."
They are relying on a discussion related to it that builds towards its solution.
You played a role in the Shalit soldier case despite knowing that this file is important to the Egyptian government.
And you leveled in French.
We received a call from a friendly nation.
"Wisdom is that there is a state that we must help. Said a brother, this ability depends on closure."
We want to see this issue as a request.
From Israel and another state, we want another part to see this.
When they saw us like this, I told them, "If the same conditions requested by the brothers are met, then we can talk to the brothers in Egypt."
And we have declared this, that is, is there an official who can say that we have, in this sense, deceived the Arab League?
This means he is a poor man.
How did you let her pass us?
Allow President Muhammad Abbas to stay.
And we support this.
Does he speak to his people? Does he speak to us? Does he speak to the Arab world?
The problem is from you.
I think this is healthy.
Why should I own Al Jazeera channel as you claim?
And the island needs to engage in media competitions, just as there are many media outlets in the West.
There are many media companies, and in their competition, they often hate each other.
But after a period of time, they will reach maturity.
It could be or it couldn't be.
First, our situation with Saudi Arabia is different.
And even if we were to assume that for Saudi Arabia, we accept that we are in Qatar.
Important relationships
And Egypt is an important country, but there is a special relationship with Saudi Arabia.
There's also a specific relationship between Egypt and any other Arab country; Egypt is the largest Arab country.
That's true, but we have a history with Saudi Arabia and the relationship is different.
This is a personal dispute between a few officials here and there.
We respect the Egyptian president.
I hope this is just a disagreement in policies and opinions, no more than that.
I told you, I got upset when I saw the victim in Gaza.
The second problem is that they have issues with us, and we still don't know what Qatar did to cause this.
Why don't you try to arrange a meeting between the Egyptian president and the prince now?
Saudi Arabia is involved in this matter.
And since it was leaked to the newspaper, they first said it was a secret meeting, but then we found out it was the next morning.
If there was a meeting between me and Omar Suleiman
In Saudi Arabia
A parting that does not stop.
And I can't let you know that we agree on everything.
Let's say without anyone explaining it, aren't you comparing yourselves?
But dignity is dignity, whether with the young or the old.
The minister said that if Egypt received the appropriate satisfaction.
Reda among the children
I don't see it that way. Egypt is bigger than that, I don't understand. I think he couldn't say the right thing.
Do you have a plan to resolve the issues with Egypt, or are you, like the Egyptian people, waiting for divine intervention?
Please, I don't want to talk about divine intervention or anything else, because only God knows who will live and who will die.
And I submit.
They convinced him that it would be beneficial.
And our pride in Egypt.
It seems there must be a specific way.
Either he's with me or against me.
And any pain felt by the Arab citizen
In the Arab world, we bear it together, and this is the policy of His Highness the Amir.
The state derives its strength from sources of power.
The United States has the sources of China's power and the sources of France's power and the source of power of a small country like Qatar.
Our trust is in God.
What's clear is
You're trying.
But we are a small country, and I keep that in mind.
And here I repeat it a hundred times.
So that no one can say we have any sensitivities.
No one is going to take anything from us.
To Israel, you have laughed now.
"I'll do it before I go to Israel."
How can you solve the problem with Egypt?
What's the problem now?
And every day they lodge a complaint with America, and if you allow me, the big countries you were talking about.
They deal with us in their own interest, as if we were...
All complaints and all
To sabotage the relationship.
I think any large country doing that would affect its image.
This will also affect our pride in the Arabic language if we keep complaining to each other all the time.
Everything is permitted, and we eat everything.
Our solution is based on Arab interests.
We're here for them if they need anything.
Are there any steps to rebuild the relationships again?
But I know there are good relations between the President and His Highness the Sheikh/Sheikhess.
If anyone is making grilled meat.
Against the unity of the two countries and the two leaderships, he will find himself losing.
Okay, it could be tomorrow or ten years from now, to be honest, I don't know, but from our side, if anyone invites us to a conference, we'll be there.
Anyone who invites us to a conference, we will attend, and if we have an opinion, we will express it at the conference.
It won't work.
Because Egypt is our elder sister, but we have viewpoints and discuss with each other.
This is what is required every time, and when the time comes we will be very happy.
This was closed due to the policy.
And as I said, we respect the people of Egypt.
Surely you're asking about the number of cancelled contracts, ask about the number of Egyptians who came to Qatar at the same time.
But as a state policy, as I told you, the Egyptian people in Qatar are very close to our hearts.
Now, last June 4th, you threw the feelings of the Arab nation into turmoil when you closed your Israeli office, and that was published in Arts Magazine on June 4th.
Why are you saying that? We were going to do it a long time ago, we gave it up 12 years ago.
Why did everyone launch campaigns before the reconciliation with Israel and the secret meetings between Arab states and Israel?
And after most of the Arabs were pacified
With Israel, secretly or openly, or talk to it in any way.
If we wanted to instill emotions, we would have done so in previous Islamic conferences.
At the United Nations, Nasser's ally celebrated a dinner in honor of the Israeli ambassador Gabriela Shalev.
Among the many guests who attended this dinner, I don't know what prompted the ambassador to organize it.
Because in the United Nations we sit next to Israel, and no one can deny that.
Or we find a glimmer of hope to spread the sorrow of our Palestinian brothers.
Now the management has changed, and I had a small space for the topic related to Egypt, but unfortunately.
Okay, I didn't mean me, I meant you.
My question concerns the United States and the new administration and its impact on your (Qataris') relationship with the United States, given the presence of the largest military base in Qatar.
There are differences of opinion.
I am serious about resolving many issues in the region.
And if they are worthy, we will help them as much as we can.
We expect a special relationship or a resolution to the issues that were between you and the Bausch management.
Many times this situation has been written about.
The Qatari emir spoke yesterday in Paris about what is happening in Iran.
And he has special relations with Bahrain even if his relations with the United States are bad.
Firstly, we must put it in the context of internal affairs because we must respect each country and its internal issues.
Lebanon after the elections
Before the elections, Saad Hariri said on this program that the Doha Agreement ends with the establishment of elections.
Is this also your vision, or do you think the agreement is still valid, or will you have to come up with a new agreement?
The Doha agreement was for a lion that would make them hold peaceful elections.
A year and a half has passed since the Doha Agreement.
We were monitoring them day by day, minute by minute, until they reached the elections according to the Doha agreement.
That we recently intervened in one of the constituencies to correct some misunderstandings that had occurred.
But you still have something important to do regarding the arrangements in Lebanon.
We're always close to Lebanon, you know how the tarans love Lebanon and enjoy going there.
The first country I visited after a Western country was Lebanon.
A quick Q&A about what's happening in Yemen
You've been drawn into this matter, and there are some accusations that you've sided with their camp.
Or does it put you face to face with the state, and now there is a greater danger, the danger of the South.
And we suffered a lot, and that's what makes us stand here, not somewhere else in Qatar.
We did face tremendous pressures, but this was our vision and this was the position of His Highness the Amir.
The subject related to borders.
And its stability affects us positively, and its instability affects us negatively.
We intervened in an honest mediation between two parties.
And we signed an agreement.
But I understand if this was meant to be used for other reasons.
And we are with them, and we always stand by them in all circumstances.
And moving on the truth
She advised me that there was nothing we needed to do.
We sell them.
I say this with regret, because I know there is a large Arab audience that might disagree with me.
Dear viewers, thank you also for listening, and we hope we have shed some light on Qatari foreign policy.
In conclusion, greetings from the program team, and this is Ahmed Mansour's greeting to you from the Foundation Without Borders.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Dear friends, peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God. Welcome to this special gathering.
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State of Qatar.
Sure, why do I say a special and brilliant interview? Because
Qatar, and this man in particular, was the main sponsor.
Sir, just one simple and direct question.
I believe it happened due to Arab consensus from the beginning.
And we tried that when we went to the United Nations.
Arab consensus was important, and managing Lebanon from both sides was crucial.
To validate some results.
It is very important that external intervention
Many opinions and recommendations from the outside.
If you want to say, Lebanese Arab and international.
It went through stages, but that doesn't mean anything.
As long as there's something, it means these stages existed.
Does this mean that the problems in Lebanon
Since the time of facts
So when you've gathered and entered directly into the Lebanese line and the Lebanese file now.
Did you find out that the Lebanese writer is famous?
A regional Arab Lebanese international needs a major decoding.
Is it simple or complex, or is it huge due to external interference?
We must know Lebanon as a beacon of glory, a beacon of culture, a beacon of tourism, and a beacon of many things.
Lebanese people don't forget.
Affects security and peace in Lebanon.
Problem number one
Are there external reactions in Lebanon?
Suddenly, after twenty-four hours, she decided to take everyone on one plane.
From the knocker directly to the force to meet the Qatari Amir.
We're not used to it, we didn't even expect it, they couldn't even calm down for a single minute unless someone was kind enough to let them.
The secret is not to let them rest and think too much.
And make a lot of calls.
We propose bringing them to Doha because we need the atmosphere.
Or you will gather them with great difficulty.
And in many cases
We have saved them from these hardships only to enable them to find a solution to greater hardships.
If we want to succeed, we need to get them out of this mindset.
And quickly.
God Almighty guides us through the inter-revelation or the Beirutian revelation.
We were delighted because they agreed to go to Doha.
The parties decided to go to Doha.
Some thought that Qatar leaned more towards one side than the other.
And I'm from Beirut, though.
Politics for his eminence is that if we are mediators
In this process
Absolutely frankly
Did you consult seriously?
with the parties concerned at least as to what is happening here in the Kingdom of Lebanon, Syria, and Saudi Arabia
Especially the brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, I spoke with Prince Saud.
And he showed his support for the idea.
We benefited from Prince Saud that we...
Everyone needed a solution.
Her reasons are weak.
If we rely on logic
Her reasons are weak.
They had to remove it because there is tension in Palestine.
There is the case of the Iranian nuclear program.
The Arab League must have a mechanism to resolve issues.
Is the African Union better than us at solving issues?
And try to bring the parties together.
And they held conferences to find solutions, so why can't the Arabs, who have an ancient connection, do it?
Gather the Arabs or gather the parties if present, or intervene to support the oppressed.
It must be studied.
So if we want to demand a warning from the Arab League, not from the Arab world.
The Arab League is just a tool for implementation.
One of the officials was here, he is President Nabih Berri.
S-S requires
Now it seems that the Lebanese have agreed.
Oh sir, listen, let's go.
And above them is Qatar.
He never reached a conclusion in a single day.
For the nobility of the Arabs
This will be a strength for the good ones.
We tried.
At the United Nations, when you came to us about the Doha Agreement
And the agendas that were created for the solution, not for other reasons.
Okay (Note: "ماشي الحا
And the most important role in the entire Arab world.
embraces
Stop this according to our agreement.
So that others may come and help us
Because this is a serious matter.
Why have we reached the stage where everyone is playing in our garden?
In our square.
This is a very important thing we need to focus on for the benefit of our people, who are our top priority.
Now, we need an Arab university after this agreement to see what we will do with our Palestinian brothers.
What are we going to do for Somalia?
What are we going to do for Somalia? Isn't it a member of the Arab League?
Sudan is not in the Arab League! Iraq is not in the Arab League! Why don't we try?
We are part of the Arab world and very small.
I wish this wasn't a suggestion, it's an idea.
Qatar has good relations with Syria and Saudi Arabia.
I think that first, if we're not asked to do something, we'll do what we can.
But I am certain that His Majesty King Abdullah
King of Saudi Arabia
And the elder brother, President Bashar, was pleased.
Historically, Saudi Arabia and Syria had an agreement.
It might just be a passing phase.
And We will help you with divine power.
Still, but I keep asking if this is approved, could you take a role in this part?
Even if you're not doing anything right now, you seem to have confidence.
Any understanding among Arab states that we strive for.
And that was his policy from the start, but this issue...
What happened in Lebanon, does this suggest that the region is on the verge of major changes?
Or what happened in Lebanon is local and Lebanese matters, and they remain regional issues.
Not related to this case.
I wish the opposite, I wish this.
The beginning of a new phase in the Arab world.
We can create
Hailah in another place.
In another sense, Your Excellency, are you afraid of the escalation that has been happening lately?
From now until the end of George Bush's presidency, at least.
I still have concerns about Palestine and the current situation in Gaza.
I want to ask
We don't need anything else.
Ask me to take care of the humanitarian aspect in Palestine.
Okay, we can't deliver the medicine to them.
And I didn't eat.
Electricity for the patient in the hospital.
Who will die when the electricity goes out.
I wish
The Arab League agrees on the amount for this issue, food and medicine. We call it food and medicine.
Wearing the red cross makes him nervous.
Let the Red Cross handle it.
But sorry, the Arab side is committed to this Israeli siege.
I'm not going to get into the details, but I just want to say that as Arabs, we need to help deliver medicine and food, even if we disagree with Hamas.
Saudi Arabia has made enormous efforts and pledged at the Holy Kaaba.
Because this disagreement will only benefit the other party.
They only said not to deal with this group because we will find you a proper solution.
And I
So far, I still don't see any signs of a solution.
Are you afraid of an American-Iranian meeting in the coming period, or do you not expect it to happen?
Of course, this is possible.
At least I'm talking about Qatar.
The Islamic Republic of Iran is an important neighbor of ours.
We might not agree with all of their policies, and they might not agree with our policies in Qatar.
For example, they tell us that we don't want you to have relations or connections with Israel.
Some may consider you an integral part of it due to the American rules present there.
We know how to deal with this.
Some said after the Emir of Qatar's visit to Saudi Arabia,
He might have spoken to, consulted, or contacted the Saudi guest.
In Istanbul, negotiations between Syria and Israel.
And I could say it was a coincidence.
The second subject that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was a spectator trying to find a solution for, and I was talking to Prince Saud.
What happened in the past few hours?
Changing tactics is changing negotiation tactics.
From your side or from other sides
We are responsible.
And from all sides, we locked ourselves in the room.
...and then we found ourselves...and after His Highness's intervention, it was very important.
And from that interventionist action, results are borne.
Nothing remains.
And his message was clear when he said, "We know our size, our place, and our role."
I wish to take a role without involving any other party.
Whether it is Arab, national, or regional.
But still
It became obligatory.
Did you want this or not?
We ourselves are the rulers, we are we, we are we, we are we, we are we, we are we.
that these countries
Can or
I believe this will be a profitable partnership.
The final questions are about your relationship with Washington: Is it long-term? Is it official or personal?
I can say that our relationship with Washington is good.
It doesn't mean we don't have different opinions in cases.
But this is our right. If they're talking about democracy, this is democracy.
How is she beautiful? How can you interpret it in reality?
If we talk about the economy, it's excellent. If we talk about education, it's excellent.
Also health, but if we're talking about politics, I can say it's good.
In your opinion, explain that in the next phase.
In my opinion, we are sidestepping the confrontation with Israel.
And if we want to stop playing in the Arabic court
And repair the enmity between the Palestinians.
We agreed on one opinion to be a respected force.
We thought we had
Becomes effective
Thank you, dear viewers, for watching. We'll meet again, God willing. Best regards.
Welcome to our viewers in this dialogue with the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani.
In this dialogue
We ourselves account for the enlightenment in the political field for the Arabs and the Arab effort.
Welcome, Sheikh.
To examine what is happening in Gaza.
And I hope through this dialogue that we can
Clarify some of your questions.
The Israeli incursion into Gaza in a brutal manner.
And our goal was to be the place of one united Arab.
Dealing with friendly nations
And my friends from other countries
And how can a clear and firm Arab stance be found by Arab countries?
And then, we find areas for reconciliation.
From our perspective, we know that more than one Arab country has been betrayed.
In an offensive manner
And no soul has spoken with a "qisas" without someone being punished.
We are punished for everything, whether intended or not.
We are the specialized people.
In the world and the lone ones who are always targeted
Always committed in a way.
I think
As much as possible, if we can't
Gathers at the leadership level
Stop the discipline campaign.
It's up to us to make a change in the Arab world.
And there were five other verbal agreements.
By two-thirds of the votes
But the purpose of the meeting is not
They want him to be right and our perspective to be wrong because the goal
The goal is to solve the problem, not to hold a summit.
But will it be solved at the expense of Palestinian blood?
What we are asking for now is that the ministry not reject Qatar's request.
And that is what His Highness confirmed.
In the speech he delivered, we did not state that it will be in Qatar if that causes any hindrance, we did not state that the summit will be held in Qatar, it could be anywhere.
An Arab stance that is respected by others.
Yes, and the Ministry.
We want to tell them that the Security Council resolution was drafted.
and Israel
Not involved in the decision, he continues to kill and bomb in Gaza and is still doing it.
And I need to ask the Iraqi what we're going to do about this?
What are we going to do?
Is it when Israel ends?
To implement the remaining part of the Security Council resolution
Or there will be a stop, since Israel did not stop.
Correction, we do not force our brothers.
to a decision that is considered exceeded
A few days ago
We will discuss the ministers' meeting.
You support her in the end.
Of course, we support holding an Arab summit, and this was our proposal, and some other countries, Syria and Yemen, also requested the summit.
I'm already an excellent Arabic speaker there.
Or we were arranged to the mediation camp.
And the non-mediation camp
And what does their talk about immoderation mean?
This was arranged by the West.
Modified and unmodified voices of Arabs
You won't be able to find a defending nation or a non-defending nation.
And we want to know what is moderation and what is exaggeration, what is the meaning of moderation and is it following Israeli plans?
And he concludes the matter in an insulting manner.
Or we simply need to keep the case open.
Frankly, this is an important question.
Are the countries
They are following Israel's plans and want to solve problems in their ways.
I don't want to say that he follows Israeli plans, and I don't want to accuse anyone.
But I say
If we call a camp to confirm
What is moderation from the Western perspective?
Do we agree to slaughter a certain category of Palestinians?
Of course, the elections took place.
I am neither a supporter nor an opponent of Hamas, but I am speaking from an existential perspective.
The current situation is that there are
Idea
What some call an extreme movement
But we must ask ourselves, what does this extremist current demand?
Is he asking for something other than his rights, or is he asking about his rights?
Or will we arrange them?
And create other clusters as well.
Against, because, we
My inner self is Arab and my intellect is Arab.
And it started happening.
That's why we don't want to fight wars on behalf of others.
Yes, Your Highness, briefly.
Who prevented the Arab summit's peak?
I can't say there were efforts to prevent it, the topic is almost famous.
The topic of prevention
But as I said, it might have been possible.
Take a vote and get two-thirds of the number.
But that wasn't the goal because it's not so much a challenge as it is an urgent need, that's what we believe.
While others thought it was not an urgent need.
We moved to the Security Council.
Or there is a solution in the Security Council.
But the decision rests with the Security Council; Israel has stated that it will end it and then discuss the matter.
All I want to focus on again.
We're not going to make any effort to enforce the decision on the weaker party.
What will make it different from the first meeting?
Changes sometimes cause disagreements.
However much
Will we be ready to declare a clear Arab position?
Humanitarian aid
Support our brothers greatly.
Also to speak to the Israeli side and tell them
I don't think everyone is ready for this, we should conduct research on this topic.
Why are we snowing it?
Forty-eight and we were committed to the truce. Forty-eight and the Israelis were not committed.
It's normal to have disagreements in meetings, but in reality, these disagreements...
Explaining the situations and what's within them
One of the disputes that was reported.
If anyone describes Hamas' actions as diversionary.
Not even a little
This situation occurred, we responded to it, and there I was with a brother of one of the ministers.
And I remember this is what the West says.
These are extremist, divisive, and other such actions.
And we don't want to be other people's men.
And thus always means, and I mean no one.
Which foreigner did they find?
"Whether a Western country or Western countries, you will find..."
Among the Arabs
Okay, now, Your Excellency Sheikh.
An Invitation to a Second Ministerial Meeting
Her program must be one thing.
Where are all these Arabs from, and what is the position of the nation that has money and a hundred other things?
One million Israelis declared
That was issued after Resolution 108.
The issued decision.
Israel hasn't implemented it; it will implement it after the mission is completed.
And what could be denied that the Arabic evidence has been Saudized in its efforts.
He should be grateful for this decision.
In order to demand Chapter VII, because Israel is above the law, Israel.
If they were asked, they would say, "We understand."
The problem of the Arabs is not in their fault.
If that's the case, Israel won't be questioned.
And this is above international law.
This is true.
Why did I go to the Security Council and what did I link it to the Arab summit? What will come out of the Security Council?
At the summit, the Security Council will try to help us.
A decisive decision is necessary.
Decide that
Could cause an official to lose their position.
We're afraid of the West.
And we'll work hard after their decision is made.
I'm not going to dwell on the subject.
Those who carried out the attack and rebuilt Iraq at their expense are the ones who destroyed it.
We won't ask the Iraqi government, and we won't ask the dead.
There are no compensations.
The exact same thing in Sudan when they started talking about prosecuting Bashir.
Happiness
Happiness Sheikh
A Major Arab Diplomatic Victory at the Security Council
Listen, they had some difficulties in the Security Council because the first speech was about a presidential statement.
Results
Israel did not comply with it.
He will commit to it in two days, after a week, and after he finishes his task.
So I didn't meet up with him.
Sorry, but people have to collect.
Because Israel agreed after it had finished the mission.
Do you have an alternative to the decision now?
All we did
Some brothers, unfortunately, with some effort.
They participated in the siege of Gaza.
I am pro-West and I don't mind any relationship we have with the West, and I am not
Against the West, not against America.
But these people know the language of interests.
Your friends if you were strong.
If you have a point of view, or if you have a perspective.
And in the end, they'll take one percent from our perspective, and we'll say we won.
What is victory?
"By what he entered"
I won't be able to say anything now about precautions because the decisions weren't made.
And the council is master of itself.
You participated in shaping
Yes, we participated in the formation to some extent.
But you weren't invited to the meeting with the Arab ministers and the American ambassador.
But I believe the brothers who went are enough.
You mentioned Arab parties for a certain interest.
In this regard, Your Excellency Sheikh
Two years so far.
Listen, I don't want to talk about the accusations.
I can't act like we know everything.
If they were humans.
There was Israeli rejection and international rejection, and we contributed to that rejection as well.
And from there began the caliphate and the siege.
And at the end of last month, Israel killed twenty-eight Palestinians during the ceasefire.
And we let them starve until they collapse because we don't want them in positions of power.
Those two parties, Your Excellency, the Sheikh.
It must be clarified that the Palestinian conflict
"Means if in"
Who created the Palestinian conflict? There might be a Palestinian conflict.
You're 100% right.
I won't say that Hamas is 100% right about everything.
What I say is like that, and I don't say it.
But, the mediator is usually in the middle, equidistant from everyone.
And not only the intermediate stage, but as Arabs, we are also equidistant from everyone.
But not wanting it to exist, therefore it must be ended by any means necessary.
After training the soldiers right and left.
And once by surrounding them, not by giving them money or wages.
And once we establish a positive model in the West Bank
The veterans in Gaza must see how people live.
Luxurious life
While the opposite is true in Gaza.
Supported for a second consultative council session, a council of Arab advisors, but at this time.
What is this issue he is still talking about between Hamas, mediated by Turkey?
This meeting that I invited you to attend seems like you want to escape from it.
This would be overstepping if we started another initiative.
We don't have any initiatives.
In this issue
Because Egypt is an important Arab country.
Please take a role, and we support any Egyptian effort made to achieve understanding.
But this is important.
"What are
Tomorrow with a party looks like it has triumphed over another party.
No path to peace.
Balanced Egyptian initiative
Between international demands, Arab demands, and humanitarian demands.
And the requirements related to Egypt's role, which is an important role.
It is a leading Arab country that we all respect and appreciate.
According to you, is this required from Egypt?
Suggestions now, the current initiative now, these conditions are not enough for your position.
I want to have a vision for the initiative.
We heard some information from here and there.
I can't talk about something I don't know.
With all due respect to the Palestinian Authority government or the presidency that should exist, we all recognize the Palestinian Authority presidency.
But there are also people
Who are the injured from the other side? We also need to get their opinions.
To accomplish this temporary task
Early, so you can see the view.
The political situation regarding Hamas was clear that this decision did not take our perspective into account, so how could it be issued?
A decision in which Arabs participate without communication or consulting the main concerned party on the issue.
We only want, of course, we deal with the State of Palestine as a state.
And we deal with authority as if it were a single party.
But now there are also disagreements within the party and another party elsewhere.
This does not mean that if we deal with the people of Gaza, we must stop dealing with those who are either in the bank or in the Palestinian presidency.
We deal with the Palestinians as one people and one government.
They hired someone from Gaza to live with them.
And now we start to coordinate things with each other.
What was just said?
First, regarding the solution, he did not specify a mechanism, welcomed the Egyptian initiative and any other initiative.
And this is what he thought of as a mechanism.
This is an explanation, but from my reading of this memo, it appears that he welcomes the Egyptian initiative.
We hope that the Egyptian initiative will be successful in achieving
This will stop the fighting.
I have no doubt about our brothers in Egypt.
Because Israel did not agree to the Security Council resolution.
And you think these decisions no longer exist because Israel rejected them.
If this is accepted later, things will have changed in reality.
Yes, sir, in reference to Egyptian efforts.
In cooperation with Turkish efforts at the same time and he
Or an Arab excuse.
Or regional disputes that do not reach solutions, and thus came to fill a void.
It was supposed to be filled by the Arab parties.
I welcome Turkey's position.
A platform that should be appreciated by Arabs and Muslims.
Turkey is an Islamic country.
So this is a natural role.
And that people follow him.
There's no Arabic conscience to solve the issue.
One says, "Let them finish the mission."
There must be a clear Arab stance, and a decisive cutting off of all this invasion, which is ongoing and being postponed.
There is an opposite Arabic expression.
Israel could postpone the decision, I'm not talking about a war between Israelis and Arabs, and we are the people who always talk about peace.
And we are a country that loves to live in peace.
But I do not call for an Arab war, I call for
A clear Arab stance
In the context of initiatives and offers, of course, you monitor what's happening.
And the proposals and conditions set by Hamas
Do you believe?
Now as an on-the-ground observer
And the policies that emerged from the military operation now allow Ahmed Hamas to set his conditions.
Does it always have to be right?
Yes, we agree on this point and disagree on this point.
The second thing
I don't know about this negotiation, as I told you, they are not present. Now you are negotiating?
The second thing
Perfect in the required positions for declension.
This is the Arab reality.
"We saw after the start of this operation."
It seems that the Arab street is taking a very advanced stance.
As governments
Surely I feel the anguish that people describe as the gift of the people.
This time, they're telling me it's this problem again.
Representing the views of the people.
The presidents now.
"That is, if you want to"
At least they'll see what.
The request, of course, has a high ceiling and has a reasonable ceiling.
To cease unification and diplomatic relations with Israel
Qatar to
The Israeli representative office in Doha was closed.
Qatar, which takes this stance.
Please consider that the Arab side should be radical and take radical positions.
Whatever the Arabs agree upon will be a collective agreement.
That's fine if there's an Arab agreement.
A contract is one thing, and relationships are another.
We are ready.
To agree with our Arab brothers.
If there was clear Arab resolve and credibility.
And they deal with other countries, not just those with which they have relations.
But also countries that have none.
This is very important.
Don't be a stranger to others.
He says: Why shouldn't Qatar be a model in this field?
If this is the only model, we are ready to be a part of it.
But we also want
The Arab model State of Qatar is committed as part of its Arab commitment.
Like
And no one sells to anyone but him.
The problem is that trust between Arab countries is lacking.
Unfortunately, I don't want to reveal our secret, and I don't want to mention the intermediaries.
That's why it's very important.
For formal respects anywhere because we need to move past this.
Some countries recalled their ambassadors, some lodged complaints, and some expelled the ambassador, like Chavez did.
And this is part of the dispute.
But some demanded the ambassador, and those who summoned the permanent member states, all these are films about our people.
We talked about the modest ceiling of people's requests.
Given the high expectations, some are calling for Syria to open its fronts with Israel.
Listen, I told you that we call for peace and that we do not call for fighting with Israel.
And we don't want to mess with Israel.
Don't start a fight with Israel.
And how will they agree?
This is also a problem.
"Allah has made us speak to one another, and destiny will conclude our religion."
What you said, Professor, your words, Sir Sheikh, caught my attention.
If countries didn't sell to each other because of a need.
What are you talking about?
Means now.
The street won't spare us.
Happiness Sheikh
The current situation is the completion of a project that started in Lebanon in 1906.
Or there is a disagreement.
Okay, I remember there were disagreements on the goals.
Lebanon was a free land.
Still, there is a need for some things; this should have been a push for the United Nations.
Or something like that.
Lebanon means, we treated el-kasé Lebanese in a big way.
Israel certainly needs weak states around it.
So that he may dominate and be the owner of the upper hand.
Of course, there are countries that support them, including foreign countries.
Therefore, it wants to remain the only power in the region.
And now we want
To change this example regarding Gaza
In Lebanon, how many sects do you speak with?
And how many angles are there?
While in Palestine, there's only one side.
But I can assure you once again that the problem in Palestine is that they listened too much to many Arabs and foreigners.
And from here the difference began, and everyone understands that she will rule the second part.
In your opinion, as a contemporary observer
As planned, it will end in broken bones.
We Arabs, do we accept this because it might happen to those who disobey?
Express his opinion or speak up.
Whether they are Israelis or others in the future
And we amuse ourselves with the best work.
In obedience and assistance in breaking bones
We have a moral example that says, "Me and my brother against my uncle, and me, my brother, and my uncle against the outsider."
Now we are accused in any dispute with Hamas, and I'm not saying that Hamas or any other party is perfect in doing anything wrong.
Everyone makes mistakes.
Now we must set this matter aside.
Came with something that led to her weakening or subjugation.
Because here, failure will not be a failure of the group.
The Qatari sheikh, usually, that is, just a short while ago, was trying to suggest to them.
Initiatives to find solutions took place in Lebanon.
What happened in Darfur happened. We'll talk about it a little, even if you're in a hurry.
That we
I have no confidence in our brothers, for the places where they compensate for each other, I face more.
This one country is taking all these measures, we won't say anything as long as there's a solution.
Our goal now is not to make Qatar a headline.
Okay, it was among the high objectives of His Highness the Amir.
One of his goals was how to stop the bleeding.
And stop controlling.
What happened was beyond imagination.
Singing in Qatar
Do you know something I don't know? I don't remember.
But most importantly, you should have good intentions.
To reach a dignified solution.
Talking about initiatives, it is useful to know what the initiative has reached regarding the decision on Darfur and the Justice and Equality Movement.
And the government of Sudan in Khartoum.
And the main focus will be on resolving the Darfur issue, as the Darfur problem initially started.
The shepherd helped.
But we don't heat up an issue we've internationalized.
Based on the revenge of the system, and now we want to solve the problem but we don't know how.
We always strive, as mentioned earlier, to implement the decisions. We are the best people to implement the decisions.
Removing the status from the competition, and is there also a competition in the Darfur case?
I'll figure out how to get past this.
Before we summarize our discussion, Your Excellency, there is an economic summit.
Will this meeting happen? Will you go to attend it?
Okay, let's go look for the meeting.
I wish it had happened in a different atmosphere, but the program determined that.
It would have been contempt.
All Arab leaders attended this assembly.
When Palestinian blood was shed in Gaza, they gathered for financial and economic reasons.
Help with heating
But it doesn't look like anyone is afraid of this street.
You don't know what happened, of course I hope nothing happens to us, but safety first.
And to be safe
But no one takes you in their little pocket.
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, thank you very much.
Dear viewers, may God accept our deeds, where are you, madam?
Okay, what is the possibility of holding this celebration, and what is the truthfulness of the statements made by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights?
People with disabilities are the most neglected in the world.
Well, as for our Arab regions, to what extent are they concerned about this issue?
These and other questions will be asked of our guests for this episode.
Former UN Ambassador on Disability
He holds a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology and Social Work from Qatar University.
A Master's degree in Social Planning and Social Policy from Helwan University in Egypt.
And held several positions in the field of disability.
Who was a founding member and executive director of the National Commission for Disabled People.
In the year one thousand nine hundred and eighty-nine
And he has been the Vice President of the National Committee for Disabled People since 1999.
Until 2003
He also contributed to the establishment of the Center for People with Disabilities, Al-Shifaa.
For people with special needs in Qatar
Our guests have overseen the launch of numerous programs, projects, and media campaigns.
Activities related to people with disabilities in the Arab world
Also contributed to giving lectures, participating in meetings, conferences, and forums
Welcome, Ms. Soup, to this episode.
People with disabilities
Initially, we called them disabled people, perhaps in the 1980s or earlier.
A more educational concept when
Among those who provide them with such education
An important document at the United Nations appeared in the nineties.
On the term and before we move on to the details
From other regions, although there are regions that are not like that or are classified as developing countries or are classified as poor countries.
And Latin America, in particular, Latin America indeed, this phenomenon is stronger there than in any other region.
But the statistics proved the opposite.
The trend towards legal rights is present in the Arab world and has been found in many countries.
Resources can be available, as well as political will.
Okay, let me tell you about some statistics you might already know.
Eighty percent of countries are poor.
UNESCO says that about ninety percent of disabled children from poor countries do not go to school.
Madam Hsia, how can you not comment on these statistics?
This is true for most of its borders.
I have seen in Darfur, in Gaza, and in areas exposed to events like these, which are wars and conflicts.
There, I can't distinguish between a disabled person and a normal person because they are present in large numbers.
In fact, the children suffering from female illiteracy, for example, are almost thirty-five or thirty-five.
And in other countries
There are many difficulties that prevent children from attending school, even if they do not have a disability.
In fact, the city doesn't have any infrastructure, even if this child found a school.
He's about to arrive.
For children and other residents
The plans and projects are good, but we don't hear about them much.
Unless we're talking about the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, which was celebrated worldwide just a few days ago, what is the point of this celebration?
The situation in the world
Better than disabled people.
There are organizations that arrived and participated in launching numerous projects.
A very important health strategy is applied.
Through this strategy
There is no overlap between humanitarian affairs and working with marginalized groups such as people with disabilities.
Now there is a degree of awareness in the Arab world and it is getting better.
Upon reaching the point of awareness, we pause to take calls and finish our conversation.
Thank you
I want to ask her two questions because she has been to the United Nations before.
The second point
United Nations laws calling for the fight against systems that hinder society, such as the Syrian intelligence system, for the sake of children now.
Is there a law that allows for requesting a trial of the regime, given the sufficient number of cases in Syria?
Yes, Suleiman, your question is clear. Suleiman Krou is from Syria. Thank you very much. With us is Nayef Saeed from Kuwait. Welcome, Nayef.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Peace be upon you and God's mercy.
Good evening
Good evening, welcome.
Please, I am one of those with mental and intellectual disabilities.
Arabs say that a free man understands by indications.
And there is a verse in the Quran that says, "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most High. Allah has bestowed speech upon us, and praise be to Him who has given speech to all things."
I sat for thirty years without speaking a word or two a day.
Praise be to God, for He taught me speech.
I meant the Quran and found.
People ridicule me because I rely on the Quran as a reference, and they see me as a liar.
They sold me out, I didn't know they were at the bottom of hell.
I only got slandered.
And I'm not promising.
If your house is made of glass, don't throw stones at others.
And of course, psychological disabilities.
Regarding Brother Suleiman's inquiry, this also falls under the same definition.
United Nations programs or their reactions regarding the causes of disability, such as political goals or otherwise.
Go to various offices and institutions.
Let's discuss with them, convince them, and find out how far they are willing to go.
Disability-related tasks and conflicts in their agenda.
UNESCO, the International Labour Organization, UNICEF, and the fact that these organizations have already placed disability
This is one program that tries not to lose sight of children with disabilities.
Many opportunities and schools
From various environmental aspects
Uniform violin
But there is a shortage that we must acknowledge, there is also a shortage in the United Nations.
Which of the defects and inefficiencies mentioned are the most significant?
On behalf of the United Nations
The topic of routine and bureaucracy
I was in my country, in the State of Qatar.
But there was routine and bureaucracy that held things up.
My work, especially sometimes during restrictions or shortages, too.
Attempts or struggles with disabled people to gain recognition.
Until he reached a little satisfaction, but it was not placed in a separate article as he wanted by the Global Disability Movement.
But it was a job that was somewhat suitable.
Unfortunately, there is no coordination among them.
This is one of his main flaws.
Survey, which was implemented by the Special Rapporteur and applied to States
Among the employees or people working on those programs
Unfortunately, we received responses from only three organizations and agencies out of forty, and they provided us with answers from only three responses.
Don't put it down.
The issue of disability has been a persistent and long-standing one, even though it is fundamentally a human rights matter.
In the past period, praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds, for the past two to three years.
The topic of disability is now being discussed at least through events like lectures and others.
Peace be upon you
Dear madam, why are there no binding laws or resolutions for Arab countries, and who is responsible for implementing these international systems?
Regarding Arab countries and salary distribution, for example, the salary distribution for people with disabilities.
Are there dedicated donations from the United Nations?
Will these funds go to governments or UN offices, and will this aid actually reach people with disabilities?
If there are no binding decisions for Arab states, then the final remark is...
Many thanks, Ahmed Al-Hilali from Greece.
With us is Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia, welcome Ibrahim.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, upon you also.
She must adopt this proposal.
It must be done by writing directly to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
It is converted into this box.
An efficient production plant
Allocating only one percent of the annual net profit
I'm back with the guest to answer callers' questions.
And he said that doctors advised him to undergo surgery.
It was very expensive and he couldn't afford to buy it, so how could he ask for help?
He is from Algeria.
I believe it's important to meet Brother Naji's needs.
Like any other rights, the rights of persons with disabilities
All these rights and duties must be obtained by the citizen.
To join the International Conference of Persons with Disabilities, this agreement is legally binding.
And it overflows onto the rights and needs of people within a national scope.
Or even at the non-governmental level
Compliance with all states and must be limited to ensure the implementation of these laws.
At least at the level of officials primarily, there must be awareness.
This must be the case at least if we interpret these treaties in this way.
Even if there's no commitment, it takes a lot.
Is there a response to the monitoring reports you conduct, and was there any interest?
But don't forget customs, it is a morally binding document, realistically and not legally.
Commit and register.
And he understood that these cases would be resolved or discussed or would be within the context of a community suffering from many problems.
Naji Zakarna, Manager, Expert in Qatari Sign Language at the Qatar Center for the Deaf
First, Mr. Ali would like to extend his sincere thanks to Al Jazeera.
Now they have aired this episode.
Now Ali is speaking and saying that he is very proud.
And she was a servant to all the special needs people in the place where she was and still is.
We will always support and stand in solidarity with her forever.
And I also say that many people have special needs.
Some of them don't know about this agreement because there were no training courses.
Regarding them, especially in schools, hospitals, or in public and private institutions.
It is necessary to publish this agreement.
As a law dealing with people with special needs in all countries of the world
And I was emphasizing and pressing on those points.
I agree to these terms and conditions and sign below.
Like the State of Qatar, some countries have signed this document aimed at serving people with special needs and serving us.
Thank you very much, my friend Nagi, I speak on behalf of Ali.
Many thanks
Your opinion can make a decision.
The former United Nations spokesperson on disability, we can start with a proposal submitted by caller Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
Creating a fund to support
A donation box that accepts contributions from any country.
This means that the fund is supposed to be spent on activities undertaken by the Special Rapporteur when he or she is involved in.
Even the Arab countries have not released donations except for one: Syria.
Meeting those commitments is a problem within the United Nations, therefore
The box
Lack of commitment by member states, unfortunately, and lack of interest.
Unfortunately, many people say with confidence that we are not interested in the current situation.
Production is indeed a matter of obligations.
On human rights.
Broadly and generally
The marginalized, especially
But because of this, there are some conventions.
Let these lands keep their promise, but it is indeed a great deed offered by the brother.
In addition, it follows that it is binding that it should not be financially separate, separate in form, but rather the sites that have been found in the impoverishment in the dispute.
Who are the ones who have it in their budgets?
Special projects were provided for people with disabilities in Gaza.
Assistance for people with disabilities
The problem always goes back to political reasons.
A state or government that greatly wished for its support.
Reducing the number is regrettable.
With symbolic numbers
The father is disabled.
Sure, citizenship was revoked.
They took her daughter.
Sometimes from
Teaching problems
When we travel or go out, we get lost.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
And peace be upon you too.
And it's possible.
They build themselves as they teach.
Oh Lord, may the Arab countries allocate a portion of their budget.
Many thanks, Bahjat Crowon from Kuwait
Aisha Mohammed from Qatar, welcome.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you and God's mercy.
Good evening, Sir and Madam, and good evening to you, daughter of Sheikh Khalifa.
I just want to send her a message of thanks and appreciation.
In recent years
From us with a thousand invitations and best wishes, parents of children with special needs.
For the ugliness of their constant support.
My name is Sharif from Tunisia, welcome.
There is another level, which is genetic.
I believe there is a genetic interest that reduces the percentage of disabled people.
In our Arab customs, a brother or sister marries off their daughter to an uncle or aunt, and so on.
In this way, at this level, a level of disability, thank you.
Can you comment on what the viewers said?
Actually, as you said, on a national level.
I know there are programs for guidance and support.
Includes among health services
Those who also come under the umbrella of Hamad Hospital
I believe within the psychiatric hospital and programs also in the Supreme Council of Education
The Ministry of Special Education, frankly, I don't know if it still exists.
But it is certainly within healthcare services. Yes, there is support and there are medical services.
Rehabilitation was provided for these cases.
Prevention is better than cure, it relates to genetic factors and consanguineous marriage, are there any campaigns?
For example, to raise awareness.
In this area
Certainly, this is a very important and realistic topic.
And it's one of the things that I and many others have talked about and shared a lot of thoughts on.
Yes, there are awareness campaigns, not just targeted ones.
Implemented by the World Health Organization
And also for the United Nations UNICEF
Now in many Arab countries, including Qatar
We will definitely visit Tunisia.
There is now a binding decision for early examination.
And what was implemented in many states.
This is all about the preventive aspect.
And so, how do they respond to such campaigns with any positive reaction?
Especially when it comes to challenging customs and traditions.
Of course, its difficulty lies when it clashes with societal culture.
There must be a decision, there must be a strategy, and there must be insistence to deal with it and commit.
The topic of early examination, that is, because it is a very important topic before marriage.
I'm asking for statistics about people with disabilities.
Especially those with disabilities from the Middle East.
Arab World
Especially
Given the recent events that have occurred in the region
In regions, sites, clashes, and wars, especially wars and conflicts and the like.
Everyone dies, leaving three disabled people behind.
And what happened in Lebanon, Darfur, and many other places?
Okay, that's not enough. The first thing is the topic.
Under the principles of human rights
There must be something for special needs, their programs, and plans.
Agendas within existing institutions in government ministries and non-governmental organizations
In cases such as war or unrest
Only for your words, United Nations Special Envoy, Navel Blay.
In the world, the strange thing is what the International Monitoring Committee for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities said, that a census
To this extent, persons with disabilities are not included in statistics, which are conducted for resident individuals.
They always announce.
For example, in the State of Qatar when the census was conducted, I think that was more than five years ago.
But frankly
In collaboration with the Planning Council and with
It has already been prepared by the Council, with our participation, like the Special Rapporteur's office.
Adding more categories for disabilities.
Expected needs
The types of these needs, all these important details that should lead you to a conclusion.
Is there a person with special needs or not?
But at least
The figures are still in progress in this regard.
Peace be upon you
Madam, thank you very much for this program, and thank you to Her Highness Sheikh Huda.
But I am grateful to God that I am Qatari and receiving all this care from my country.
And my daughter is now a student in private schools and receives a good education, praise be to God.
And I want to thank Mrs. Huda.
Her motivational role and her role in making us not fear or distress our children.
Praise be to Allah and thanks to Him for it and for those who depend on this kind.
Thank you very much, Faydha Al-Dossari from Qatar, you are still with Qatar with Latifa.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you and God's mercy.
My good sister, our relations and expectations, and we are only waiting for the solution to our children's problem.
What is the role of the sheikha in educating our Qatari children?
I hope you can answer this question.
Peace be upon you
I bear witness to what the State of Qatar has provided as a special service for hearing impairment.
We had a program for early detection of hearing loss.
There is a higher advisory council for people with disabilities.
For people with disabilities, regardless of the type of disability.
Even the assembly of civil society, or non-governmental civil society organizations, or other communities.
Since reality and what we hope for, when compared to what it will be like in five years.
The disparity between what the victims were compensated with and the distortions five years ago and what they are being offered now.
Thank you very much, Karim Nasser from Jordan. Now we return to our guest.
Sure.
The community as a whole, along with its individuals, and especially with their families, who
Children with disabilities have great ambitions and expectations.
Whether at the planning level or the operational level
But as for one point you mentioned, which is a very important point.
Children without papers or anything else, whether in Qatar or anywhere else.
The international meeting, as many international documents.
And we are committed to translating it into plans and strategies.
To automatically provide those services
Based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, irrespective of religion, race, color, gender, and sexual orientation,
Okay, Sheikh Huda, you were previously a special coordinator, and at the United Nations, you were in charge of turning points after six years of work.
Would you like to?
Maybe the time wasn't enough or the financial aid wasn't sufficient.
There are many achievements we have accomplished, and I am proud of them.
Through my participation, or through existing organizations, and through government institutions in many countries.
Especially in the Middle East
That there are more research and larger studies.
We started with a global survey and had more than one report.
Raising awareness is an ongoing process that must be worked on continuously and radically.
Coordination among Arab countries
And among the people themselves with disabilities and their organizations because they
But they have a duty they must fulfill.
They must fight for
Many thanks
Thank you
Dear viewers, at the end of this program, I would like to thank everyone who shared their opinions and comments with us.
Tomorrow, God willing, we will meet a new guest.
Join us with your messages and calls in a new episode of "Live" (Live Broadcast). Goodbye.
Good morning
I'm very happy you're with us.
First, before we start asking different questions and talking today
Thank you, Shaimaa. It's possible that what I celebrated before was a duty.
The entire Middle East deserves this international achievement.
Qatar has already marked its spot on the global football map.
Thank you, Qatar.
Come on, Ali! Come on! Ali!
First, I'd like to say good morning to the viewers.
And I congratulate him and all Qatari citizens on the hosting.
And God willing, as Sheikh Mohammed said,
It was a dream, and if God wills, it will become a reality, and the work will start today or during the announcement period.
Did you expect Qatar to host the World Cup in 2022?
Despite having powerful countries like the United States, Japan, and Australia, weren't you afraid in this area and on this specific topic?
No, look, to be honest with you, I said there's a 70% chance Qatar will get it.
Very strong
She has global and competitive plans.
It's as if we were competing.
Why should we be afraid?
But praise be to God, the Qatari file was very strong and deserved it.
The current situation in 2022, the World Cup and its hosting in Qatar, is correct.
Okay, what do you think the racers are feeling?
They are in the field, of course they feel very happy, God willing.
I'd like to, we were just talking randomly, but we want to hear this on air.
The moment of announcement.
Where were you sitting? How did you hear the news? Were you surprised? Tell us, and tell the audience.
On the radio
Then everyone joined us.
They heard about the announcement.
How did you come across the international media?
On the level of sports channels, everyone was supportive, especially the Arab channels. Praise be to God, everyone supported us.
As soon as they announced Qatar's win and hosting,
All Arab countries have announced their full support for Qatar, through media, human resources, and volunteers, in the future.
Arab countries known for their generosity.
Even at the level of international media, Shaima
I went then to enjoy the Souq Waqif.
Even the AFP was filming there.
We had interviews too.
Everyone cooperated, Qatar now, is remembered daily.
A thousand times a day, considering that it is the smallest dot on the face of the Earth.
I expect everyone to know Qatar even online.
Hosting the 2022 World Cup
I mean, any footballer dreams of serving his country, being in the national team.
Of course, any player, whether in the Qatari league, wishes to represent the team.
Okay, it's a positive thing to work very, very hard on something.
He is tall, and even though he is tall, he dedicates all his efforts.
Whether in training or matches, because he carries the league's motto on his shirt, he must dedicate his energy.
Look, the people in charge have made a great effort to take care of the youth, teaching them professionalism from a young age.
Food, sleep
Tell me about your experience playing at different ages. How was your experience, and what age was the most important for you?
Was, of course.
I progressed step by step through the ranks, from the youth team to the first team.
Do you know how to migrate with the club and the league?
Each stage has a distinctive mark.
Yes, Lana, God willing, you were moving between
Now we're getting used to you, sporty Lana.
We always see you as a sportswoman. We wanted to see you and get sports news from you. So, how's sports going for you?
Frankly, I don't see anything different about it. In TV shows, we used to meet famous stars in their fields, and in sports, we would also meet stars.
Just like me and others in their fields of sports.
On the contrary, the sports field is active.
In particular, we are the capital of sports.
And now Qatar has become the capital of the world for sports and football.
Instead of offering diverse dialogues, social, economic, and cultural programs
In various fields, volleyball, basketball, different champions.
But it's still a sport.
Excellent, superb
Frankly, I was hoping
I wish I were ten years old right now, not twenty-five.
Well, I think the young players got a great opportunity.
I hope you seize this opportunity.
That's good, Ali. What do you want to say to the players?
God guides them, these young people who will shape their future in the coming days, God willing.
Sure, I told you it's an opportunity, they need to take advantage of it.
And this is a golden opportunity.
That gives them a significant advantage in this matter.
We've told you, what are you doing? What new programs are you going to present? I know we asked you to come during your vacation.
Okay, tell us about your news, God willing.
By following the events closely, we are preparing for the Asian Cup which will kick off in January.
A few days ago, we finished the Gulf Cup, and frankly, we want to say congratulations to the Kuwaiti league.
The news program is also available to cover events.
My first appearance in the media was through Qatari TV, of course, my roots are from Qatar TV.
Thank you for their understanding.
Deliver the media message across various channels.
Special, sports, or other weather
Okay, thank you Qatar TV.
We wish you all the best, we're still on the same subject.
First, I would like to thank the management of Al-Khor Club.
And their fans, I was at Al-Wakra Club
My childhood
The sheikh was with us yesterday, Sheikh Nasser was with us.
Lula is still inside the club.
I'm still the son of the canal.
But, as I told you before the start of the program, professionalism.
That concerns every individual in Qatar.
We know that young people love and fear sports.
How do we make sports a social issue?
Media awareness primarily, the media plays an important role in promoting sports in various aspects of life.
I said that the youth are addicted to it, and school places have become aware of the importance of sport in school.
For example, they celebrate any sporting event.
In Qatar as well, you see street signs, which reflect awareness of sports.
Allocating seats for women in stadiums and anywhere.
This also indicates the awareness and participation of women in the sports field.
And now we have the Qatari Women's League, for Qatari players.
I think sports are evolving.
I also think that this period
To produce massive projects and raise awareness of sports, I believe this timeframe is sufficient.
If you think about it and do it patiently.
It is enough and at the same time needs to be adopted wisely, as I said.
Also, there's one point, this is the way the new generation exploits the league.
Everything is available, including capabilities, experiences, and equipment.
There's one more important thing. Alhamdulillah, we're in Qatar, like all Arab and Gulf societies, which are known for their great love of sports.
How can we grab this audience's attention to keep up with sports news and football matches in Qatar?
And to make sure we catch the games at the same time
Most Qataris love sports and football, but the problem is that they don't attend.
When you browse internet forums, you'll find a great deal of interest, especially in most club forums.
Interest in football competitions is huge.
As a Qatari citizen, what are the best solutions you think would attract you to attend, aside from being an athlete or player?
What are some ways I can attract an audience, like your friends, for example?
The matter depends on this person himself, there is no volunteer.
Some people like to watch it on TV at a family gathering.
Example: Japan, Japan has made a wonderful plan to attract the public greatly.
When you come to play, you collect points or something, understand? They are looking for solutions, understand? God willing.
And the Arabs
The most important point is that every player will be here in Qatar specifically in the year two thousand and two, Lana, what do you think we need?
Aside from financial support, what do you think we really need?
Providing the means to make them ready as a national league and participate in a massive World Cup.
Time flew by with such lovely people. When the producer told me our time was up, I honestly said, "God willing."
Always achieve the impossible, for he achieves the dream we thought was impossible. Praise be to God that we live it in reality.
Based on what Sheikh Mohammed said, they were moments of celebration, but the hard work began.
And God willing, 2022 will be an event worthy of the name of Qatar.
I congratulate all the residents of Qatar, and frankly, Qatar has become a global landmark.
Hosting the year two thousand and two
Thank you, Lana, the creative presenter. I wish you all the best, and I will always follow your shows to keep up with sports news.
Thank you, certainly happiness.
Talented Qatari Youth
And they're singing a new type that's popular now.
But with music and a fast rhythm.
And also a rap group, if God is willing.
Stay with us, we're starting now. Good morning.
We try to see it up close.
We can define rap briefly as a fast-paced song.
Repeating, but not fast rhythmic singing of the song lyrics.
This contains many rhymes, indicating many different topics and affairs.
Can sometimes be personal
Social, emotional, or political.
Sometimes it's controversial.
And he is free to a large extent.
The excellent performance, the audience doesn't sing the song lyrics.
But he keeps doing it.
He appreciates his voice, which he considers a secondary element.
Generally, sound isn't important in rap songs.
For this reason, they don't call him a singer, but a rapper or an MC.
Rappers address what they find in these other songs:
An example of flow, the flow of sounds, synchronization, and delivery.
They have followers, fans, and an audience.
They have a unique style of rapping.
And I think they'll give you a better idea than me personally.
Good morning, welcome.
First of all, it was a time when we wanted to do something new.
Be distinguished by something.
Alright, we said why don't we rap?
Rap music is present in every country in the world.
Okay, why isn't he here in Qatar?
Alright, we said we're inventing something new.
We gave him an idea that includes a message.
Let's discuss the pros and cons of beaches.
Okay, we're delivering a message, and secondly, it's an art.
This is one of the various arts, for the viewer's information, it addressed many serious social and psychological issues among young people.
Time changes, and this is certainly related to the change in time.
Long ago, there was a little acceptance.
We've been singing since around 2005, acceptance was slow at first.
We can say that a new beginning happened to us in the year two thousand and ten.
There is more acceptance and popularity.
People love to sing and do this rap-like style now, haven't you noticed?
Sure, a large percentage of people.
There's one more thing we want to talk about. You were the founder of three teams.
A cool band, and I think you perform concerts. Can we talk about this band?
How was it founded, and how did the idea of forming a band come about, and how many members are in this band?
Initially, we were before the formation of the band.
I've been living in Doha since 2005.
This means that anyone who loves the concept of rap and knows how to rap can sing and post it on the site.
I can download, Salman can download, anyone can download, so there was a competition.
We met people.
I mean, we started competing with each other.
Then, after a while, and after all these years, we reached the year 2010.
Before the year 2000, it was a group system, meaning each group was self-contained and would gather every three or four together.
Alright, we said why don't we come together as a group under the name Rappers Qatar,
Rapper
Alright, we agreed on that, we said one name, and we are all in this together.
We repeat this and say the same idea.
About twenty people.
Twenty-five, wow! If our Lord wills it, it will be a large gathering.
Okay, does anyone here rap or something?
Formatting and assembling.
You could say it's personal.
Excellent, how are these twenty organized by five? How is this number organized in the band?
Everyone has unique abilities that they possess.
That means everyone in the band can make a whole song.
Without the help of anyone else.
But there might be a difference in abilities, for example if Salman is better than me.
He listens to her and tells me her words, nothing else.
Each can change from the other.
We help each other a little.
Or a company that takes you, so that an official entity can take these things.
And there will be distributors, for sure.
So that the work is done in a professional manner and becomes an official reference for you.
Frankly, we were hoping to get some support, and we received support from a company that took us under their wing and is producing an album for us.
No problem at all.
Some things are a bit difficult.
Okay, why don't you think the first move is coming from you?
So that an individual can recognize the first disc.
By doing this, you can attract companies later on, what do you think?
The first thing I did in 2007 was to make a CD.
I distributed them among my friends.
How do I order?
I think.
Not bad, because in 2007 rap might not have been dominant in the Gulf.
But not like now.
You guys were speaking before like that, meaning there are very large groups like Palensia and Castro.
Should we talk about it or not?
He said firmly to us, "We'll play for you."
They handled all the costs, procedures, coordination, and work; frankly, I didn't expect this level.
Frankly, we were surprised and it was amazing work.
There was just a bit of pressure because there were no ads and nothing before the show.
No ads, no anything before the event two days prior.
We expected that Lua, with its speed, would not be slow, faster and faster, and even faster.
When we were inside, before the party started.
That was true.
That means our voice reaches families as well, not just young people.
We thought the idea would really appeal to young people.
But at this point, we discovered that many age groups were listening to us.
Is there a particular song that the audience loves?
The audience interacts with most of the songs.
Oh, most of the songs, but there were a lot of songs and we were very many.
Everyone in the group
What's the talk, how does it solve different problems?
We're talking about the current situation.
At least, even if it is...
If his words, before.
It has to be like this.
I mean, there's a rhyme.
We weigh every word and strive to enhance the most meaningful message.
Okay, how many songs do you have? Let's listen to one of them.
One of the songs you produced.
Let's hear it and see the public's opinion.
Oh God, I hope they like the talk.
Thank you, Ali. I liked this introduction because it includes the name of my program.
This is a CAD and DMRI program in Doha.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This is KG Ms. Bobo with one hot track for the body.
Don't forget, the show starts at 3:30, everyone has to see it.
Production: Hassan Naama, Presentation: Shaima Hamadi
The manager is Nasser Al-Malki, and the guests are Qatari rap singers, of course.
Look, this actually has a name = "The Program", thanks guys!
I have to jump and curse you and the people in the control room.
Let's eat together.
And who wrote the lyrics, or are they?
Everyone writes their own words.
Because if I wrote to Joseph
It's not just about writing, it's about the love of singing and passion.
I'm expecting you to write about the 2022 World Cup and the Asian Cup, I'm expecting you to do your best if you can.
Oh my goodness, frankly, personally, we're going to write a song about this topic.
But, I don't think this can be formal at the moment.
For I imagine there are more national songs.
Through Rabea Art
Oh, really, today, everyone
We are happy currently.
The cup has arrived and the streets of Doha are decorated.
Alright everyone, as we've seen, Doha is decorated for the Asian Cup celebration.
The concerned parties have completed all preparations to host.
And it will be more crowded.
I expect them to come together along the Cornish side.
I'm sure they're ready to host this important sporting event.
Who's on duty next period?
There's an offer from an official party, and they swore they'd prepare a party for us.
But, nevertheless, there are still some complexities.
There are procedures and some issues, so I'm not sure.
Okay, we'll try. If you find Youssef and see...
Some of them, I have a song topic,
If we find that it fits the song.
And the possibility of accomplishing it.
Since I'm at home
And then send it to Youssef at my email.
This part of the song is for Youssef.
There's one more thing, do you travel outside of Qatar or not?
In this field with millions of fans
Don't try to imitate, but we listen to people who have been in this field longer than us.
But we try to be competitors.
Okay, why don't we take some ideas and copy certain things?
But reverse it, take the idea and apply it differently to my song.
Who formed a band and has more than one CD?
Abdullah Al-Duwailah
He has the experience and ability to detect groundwater.
This talent is the ability to detect underground water reservoirs.
A resident of Marat City
There are many experts.
Who finds the water before digging the well?
This needs a few more wells to be drilled where there is no water.
With the help of copper bars and brushes made of orange peels
Or grapes, through which he can identify water reservoirs.
What tools do you use?
To detect underground water sources
That was a long time ago.
But now, it has been replaced by copper stakes.
Alright, let's put the two cases side by side in parallel.
And I walk slowly.
We observe, when we walk along the watercourse.
The slides are going to lock.
Now, we are passing a continuous flow.
It blooms like this.
On our way back, he stopped.
Now we are in the middle of a waterway.
And there, it will be the middle.
Okay, in this way, we can trace the path of water, or groundwater, in the earth.
And the process is repeated more than once in more than one place to find the sharpest spot.
Abu Ibrahim confirmed
That is reaching an advanced stage in this profession.
For his discoveries to be very accurate.
In Maraat, and outside Maraat, and in Shaqura, and Horaymilah, and Al-Uthaythah
More than one hundred and fifty wells have been discovered.
The percentage of errors does not exceed five percent.
He needs training, experience, and a gift from God.
Surpasses modern equipment and laboratories.
In a short time
Abdul Rahman Al-Marshed
Good Morning Program
Tawon, northwest of the Saudi capital, Riyadh
We have watched this report and promise you more reports from Arab and foreign countries.
And the Gulf countries, God willing.
And we arrived at different places but they all have the same address.
Meaningful
I suspect the presence of a large group of Gulf youth in the Gulf.
Who, for example, are the people you follow?
To walk with him in a observant manner, indicating that you are continuously following him, demonstrating that you do not deviate from the fundamental commitment.
There is a general connection between all Gulf rappers.
It's not a competition, it means if I make a song.
He's harping on about a certain topic.
We could call it moral competition.
We have connections, but no one is mine.
In Saudi Arabia, there is Qusai. May God let him walk.
He has followers and a CD.
Many companies want to adopt it.
You want to reach this stage, perhaps surpass it more and more, God willing.
We wish you all the best at this stage.
There, upon receiving the cup, let's wait for some shots of the corniche.
In addition to a group of Qatari youth
That, even if inspired by the West, is in a Gulf style.
There are also love rap songs and a unique band of twenty-five people.
It's important that we stay in touch with you to know how you're doing.
I think you have an email, website, or forum.
How can people get in touch with you?
We used to have our own website back then.
But there were some issues with the hosting company.
He would sometimes get angry without an apparent reason.
Okay, we faced a lot of problems and eventually overcame them.
No use, the site will definitely close.
Okay, what can we do? What are the alternatives to solve this problem?
United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, and even Morocco and Egypt
You need to stay in touch with them to keep up with the latest news and the hymns they release from time to time.
Okay, what's the alternative now?
We currently rely on special pages like
By what name?
"Okay, when you search our name on Google"
Qatar's rap or Qatar's rappers
Do you think you can make your own music video?
As for the program, I worked on it yesterday.
We have uploaded many videos to YouTube.
Songs with pictures
A little song and the same thing, with pictures.
I think we need to see more improvement.
You need one place where you can all be together, instead of each person having their own equipment at home.
Mix, piano, computer, and guitar
Frankly, I hope we find support.
Example of a company
CD production
They allocated a special place for us.
We worked alone.
Frankly, at the end of the day, we're still working on ourselves.
We don't want that.
It's not like what Youssef said.
Necessity video clip
And album
Videos help spread the word quickly.
Transmit ideas faster.
If there's help, everything else will come gradually.
And your beautiful voice will be everywhere.
This is a type of art that deals with various problems and issues.
Thank you, Youssef Al-Naemi and Salman Al-Abdullah, for coming.
Let's watch it and wish them all the best on behalf of our show, guys.
These projects, yes.
There is a semi-ready project, but it needs some technical development.
Expiration Date
When you go to Modar, have the total and all the details ready beforehand.
He recognizes goods, instead of reading the components of each commodity.
While I was riding a rickshaw
Attached to the cart, so he can choose the material he wants.
Most projects are a reflection of children's feelings about an issue.
He has many activities and goals.
The center offers a variety of programs and activities that focus on one central idea.
For us, we have ten objectives set by Her Highness Sheikha Moza in establishing the center.
Can also, yes
which takes him directly to the subway from his home
But his idea is that it's for clothes.
All the shops in Qatar that sell T-shirts will be able to display them.
It's okay, I can also use the car key. I just press the button.
Tracks the items I've placed and takes me to the key.
Yes, let's get back to the projects the center will work on.
Early childhood education
Developing skills and acquiring talents
Well, it varies according to the different skills of children, media, and research skills.
Personal skills, such as public speaking and persuading audiences
Skills vary, and we've developed a special program to cater to them.
We started with the media of the future, and we achieved great success in this project. We reached the end, and the project graduated.
Our accounts also touched on more than one building and two young men speaking.
And their creativity...
Do you have young presenters?
For television, it's important to show programs for children.
I'm getting them ready for TV.
Through television, Qatar channel
We prepare for them until they reach the age of eighteen.
We welcome them wherever they are.
This is also the national television.
It is necessary to identify and discover these talents and develop them.
Media, research
Intellectual dimensions
Reading and various other fields
Is there collaboration? Do you exchange ideas?
In all fields, such as promising speakers and programs funded by the Ministry of Endowments
Our exhibition, Generation Exhibition, is also...
Scientific clubs played an important role in developing projects, as well as with technical support.
The most important role was played by the Higher Education Council, through its support for schools and partners.
Oh Mr. Abdullah, moving to a building of this size like Katara,
which also includes a variety of activities and clubs
Do you see this as a step towards greater success?
In addition to moving to a separate building
No matter how vast the space is
And facilitates dealing with the public.
And this will be pioneering and excellent projects.
And in receiving the guest and introducing them to the programs available for the child
This is our core project for the next three years.
National Reading Development Project
Under the patronage of Sheikha Hessa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani
I took on this project and I'm backing it.
This is a big project, focusing on developing reading, writing stories, and enhancing children's skills.
Various cultural skills related to reading in a specific context
Sure, there are different programs.
We have recently moved.
We need to change some activities.
Design and optimize it to suit Qatar visitors
May God guide you through this center.
He eats very important ideas.
First, I would like to thank you for hosting me.
Above all, the more we deal with children, the more we discover that
Today, children's childhood is different from ours.
They need more opposition, better expectations, and more time.
Hear his interests, his imagination.
Communicate with him by head.
They... %pw, the way they treat their children is like a hotel, providing accommodation.
Just as we operate the bank, we provide financial services.
Children need someone to listen to their ideas and creativity.
In the past few days, they transported us to the year twenty-forty-three.
At this exhibition
I wish success to the winning projects.
Thank you for your presence, Mr. Abdullah Al-Jumaily, Director of the Children's Culture Center. We wish you success.
For these projects to happen and come to fruition, and not remain a dream forever.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Children's Cultural Center was launched last night at the Diplomatic Club.
The official closing of the National Exhibition of Dreams for Future Generations under the slogan "Dreams of Generations, Facts or the Nation of Tomorrow"
Organized on the occasion of the Qatari National Day, with the participation of more than seventy children from Qatar.
There were many activities and various competitions at the exhibition.
Creative projects for children
We would like to welcome Mr. Abdullah Al-Jumaili, Director of the Children's Culture Center, good morning and welcome.
Good morning, my dear sister.
First of all, I want to thank you for the long period.
Discussing this exhibition, it's really very distinctive.
Welcome to our program to cover as much of the exhibition's activities as possible.
This is a national exhibition of our generation's dreams.
In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Estimator; This exhibition.
In a contribution from the Center for Children's Culture
"To replace my nation's birth."
Who was
In an attempt to calm the children
Live on a dream
With the project
This project or dream
Children have a very vivid imagination.
Alright, we've limited it to twenty or thirty.
And other key areas in Qatar's vision.
We started training children in four stages.
Then, considering the brainstorming mechanism and tools that expand the scope of thinking.
What exactly does this phrase mean?
Facts or the nation of tomorrow?
I mean, any dream that the child dreams today.
He will grow up and the project will grow up.
In fact, this was the true explanation of the vision, that the children would live from this day forward.
With a big dream
Whether environmental, health-related, human development, or any other field
He who serves the homeland.
I think that when we know there are children somewhere
Or at a specific exhibition
All that was available of
The exhibition, and there were also guest of honor.
Children learn from them, as ancient examples.
Yesterday, or a few days ago, there was a *
There were also winners of various Gulf Cooperation Council awards.
There was a table to display their projects.
Yes, and the pictures are the best proof of what you say.
This is a collection of photos from the exhibition and various activities.
This is also the owner of the last project, the forest.
We also want to talk about the colored ball.
This is a really great idea, we can simplify it for the viewers, it's one of the children's innovations.
What exactly is this thing, the colorful ball? Let's talk about it.
Suddenly, there are four or five projects dealing with this subject, one of them is the colored ball.
And they call him the smart teacher too.
As soon as the ball goes out of bounds.
Colors differ.
I think this future will help a lot in matches.
What's next, after all these dreams?
And it is connected to things related to his field and interests.
I assume in particular when there are responsible people who take these small projects from small minds into consideration.
But what we know, maybe these things will reach us, what's the opinion of the union president?
Think about the idea of a colored ball.
Do they like it?
He turns strongly to the polytheistic struggles that cling to the fight.
He supported us and took these projects under his patronage when he saw them.
And I also rely on these two projects.
That our children did that, and people also voted on many projects.
Okay, what were the projects that existed in this place and that people voted for the most?
There is an evaluation committee that has a method for evaluating projects.
First project, second project, and third project won the awards.
The poor won the first prize.
He was very precise in the details of the projects, and the project was ready for submission.
Of course, it requires many administrative elements.
There were very detailed descriptions in the brochure that I distributed to the visitors.
Surely these are the pictures we're seeing now.
These are some of the big projects.
They might not intend to do what they see in movies and cartoons.
Sure, part of it is followed by institutions.
For example, let's name the projects, what are these projects?
Gather, use, and recycle it.

From the "Tasnif" series family, actor Abdelhamid Charsheni.
He asserts himself through numerous works such as Hearts for Rent,
And they did some serious work to establish themselves in the art scene.
Especially since the field of art doesn't know flattery.
Means
Thank you and good morning. I'd like to say good morning to the viewers.
No, I'm influenced by the actors of the show.
We'll show a very short scene from one of your works and then we'll start talking to you.
Are you laughing at me?
Take this dirty cloak and bring the original one.
Go and get it.
You have the cloak, bring it back.
What? Give me the best, bring it again! How can I get it again?
The goats have eaten it all, Zael.
I am a member of a five-member committee.
On the conference's steering committee.
Okay, I'll agree with you.
I don't mind.
This is a preview, a very short clip from the series "Tashanof" whose second part we will watch.
We would like to ask you about your participation this year in Part Two.
Can you tell us about your roles in the series "Tashneef" which tackles a different topic in each episode?
What is your contribution? Can you tell us about it?
Sure, later.
She was walking outside at that time.
Mara is very famous with the mountain.
The comet that the ancients celebrated throughout the ages.
When history is a witness and remains in the memory of cities.
And he'll show how old his history is.
Those far from it are twenty kilometers north of the capital, Riyadh.
And some believe it was named after Imroue Al-Qays Al-Tamimi.
It was distinguished by its monuments, the sweetness of its waters, and the freshness of its air.
The poets were inspired by it and were amazed by it. She was famous for it, the famous Comet Mountain.
They call it Comet Lake.
Of course, Marrat is an ancient city.
It was founded before Islam.
There were ancient things with an unknown history, like the well of Khalid ibn al-Walid.
Let's do this together.
The great companion Khalid ibn al-Walid (may Allah be pleased with him) ordered, when he fought in the Ridda Wars, to dig this well.
So far, not even once.
The deal is guaranteed, and I guarantee you Marot.
If you see a comet, you will see a mare.
Among the other remains, there is the Comet Pool.
What have the sweet Nile's waters carried over the years?
It was enough for the city for a whole year.
From the beginning of the rainy season until the beginning of the next rainy season.
The date when these antiquities were founded is unknown.
There are also the Arwos and there.
Mount Kometa is one of the landmarks of the city of Maraat.
There were many sayings, poems, and verses that relied on this mountain.
Many people from different parts of the kingdom come to see it.
One of his most prized possessions is his parents' well.
This is because he stayed in Marrat during the Wars of Apostasy and was on his way to Yamama.
He camped there and ordered the men to dig this well.
From whom do people still drink and wash?
Yaqut al-Hamawi mentioned in Mu'jam al-Bulan that Khalid passed through Merat.
This is an old house made of mud, renovated to its original state.
It consists of various sections reflecting the region's architecture, heritage, and antiquities.
The poet once said of him: "When we found water, it was free water."
We found the Comet River, not the Angola River.
Mr. Ayman, God willing, there is cooperation between the family, the guards, the centers, and also the child.
And I remember there are different ways and he can be with you at the same time.
Generally, to run the training process.
From everything that comes to us, whether it be an intern, a student, or a child,
This record contains all his complete personal information.
Even his monthly grades, for example every month, have a rating.
We were responsible for the Minds program.
In every four sessions, there is a report.
The guard through a password and username,
I gave it to him, can he access it?
Yes, he sees the level he has reached, from the time he registered at the center until now.
Yes, we have different models, let's take a look.
We have a daughter.
With Mr. Ibrahim, who will join us later,
Let's look at different models, I wish we had enough space.
But we brought a model of a girl.
We've had different tests before in the air.
We'll get math questions and varied questions from her.
We'll find out a bit and then we'll come back to you to see this smart girl, stay with us.
The actor's performance, the audience is now very intelligent.
If any show doesn't grab his attention by the first, second, or third episode, if he feels he's not interested in the show, he'll use the remote.
He doesn't worry, he has tens of thousands of series.
Sure, twenty thousand chains, that's right.
Two thousand and fifty episodes. Some people don't do that, he focuses on one job.
One thing replaces another.
You're right, that's what most people do.
He said I only watch TV occasionally.
Of course, we welcome you among us, a very dear and respected guest, Abdel Hamid Charshouni.
Are you saying something to the viewers, or to your fans who love you? Of course, I'm one of your fans.
Do you consider it saying something?
And I say to them, Lord, may you all be well every year.
We really don't go out much, we don't show up much, and we don't do many things because of the reason I mentioned before.
What's coming will be better.
God willing, we wish you every success in your endeavors this year.
God willing, we'll have another interview with you so we can talk about those plays.
Everything leads to another.
Because fashion shows are extremely popular among many people and are eagerly awaited by fashion enthusiasts.
Welcome to our program, Sabah Al-Doha. We are live with you.
Of course, today we're talking about the Skills Development Center and a group of students who registered at this center.
This center offers a variety of sciences.
Of course, they focus on developing the other capabilities.
Also, so that their minds work very well.
Mrs. Nashma and Mr. Ayman Khogali, CEO of the Career Development Center.
Hello and welcome.
Welcome to join us.
We have the moon with us, good morning Omonia.
Good morning.
Oh my love, how old are you?
I am in the seventh grade.
"Whatever God wills, may He be pleased, all good to you."
What are the things we give to our sons and daughters?
This was clarified with Mr. Ayman and Ms. Nesma, and was directed particularly in favor of our children.
The program Minds for Mental Thinking in Mathematics
Through the fingers and Apex.
To achieve specific goals, we tried to demonstrate a small part of them.
What do you feel, Engineer Ibrahim, is there really a difference in the student in the first two days?
And after that, maybe three or four months?
if he has taught in state, private or independent schools,
Basically, the program scientifically works on specific methods.
After completing the first phase of the program,
What reveals what capabilities are missing or need further development?
And when he reaches a certain level, or what happens to the child?
Okay, we're working on a scientific method and a scientific program.
Barbecues and machinery aren't done in a regular way.
But in a scientific and systematic way.
Before starting the program and after taking this course or the levels he went through.
Miss Ibrahim is with us now, as you can see, one of our students who have registered at this center.
He wanted us to do this live today, to show you, the viewers, the importance of this.
If she brings you the bisht, I don't mind.
Okay, this is a very fast and very small part of the "Tashanof" series, and you will see the second part of it.

Sovereignty Mr. Ghanim Al-Sulaiti from the State of Qatar.

We have
Faisal Rashid and Muhammad Adl.
Tara, of course
The young actors can't work without Tara.
For a while, we were walking straight, straight on the train tracks. Three of us were walking in step.
The Qatari channel also produces dramatic works, can't we say that as well?
The Qatari channel provides executive production.
The Qatari channel did its best, but it only produced one show a year, and every Qatari actor had to work on it.
And that was the reason.
I told you. It's just one series, and every actor in Qatar wants to work on it.
Well, if someone finds a scene, they should thank God.
Praise be to God for everything.
Okay, let's go back to your roots.
Of course, I really want to thank him.
I consult him on various matters.
Of course, actor Abdulaziz Jasim from films "Hukm Al Bashr" and "Ba'd Al Tashatt" to "Na'am Aw La".
In his plays, we started working with him in theater when he became the first executive producer. Abdulaziz Jassim, we worked with him for television and theater.
Well, he is one of those who educated us, taught us, and made us what we are.
After that, El-Haj Ganem recounted his life stories and made his utmost effort in the film "Feet of the Clouds" in 2000.
Because it gives us an opportunity as youth.
They work between thirty and thirty or thirty-five hours a week.

Welcome back, dear viewers, today we will talk about reflexology.
The message is between the palm, the hand's palm.
This treatment has indeed been practiced since ancient times.
We have a guest.
The method of inspection is as follows.
The degree of pain increases.
I always feel like there's something sharp or jagged in my constant description.
Loosen your grip.
My brother is suffering from nervousness.
You feel stressed and you have a bit of a headache, headache.
Left side.
Now, dear audience, we are looking at the left side of his body.
They need to know what we're doing.
Any obvious health problem, we now know about the headaches and dizziness they cause.
Is there any pain in this area?
Pain means trouble.
Problem! What does "problem" mean in this context?
In this case, the sinuses and the ear.
He's wobbly. Do you have a nose problem or any previous issues?
I had an operation, but that was a long time ago.
Is it sinusitis or something else?
He gains weight without eating.
Okay, your left shoulder.
It's because of the nerves, when I told him he had tense nerves.
Ten years ago, he was walking along the shore, stepping on the beach.
We know that when someone walks on the beach, I find it therapeutic.
Any uneven ground is not only in the sea.
Negative energy may %PW.
And he might be surprised that you discovered these things through text messages.
Of course, children are the most important.
Oh children, congratulations from God. This is for you, Mother, focus with me!
It hurts him from milk and food while he's eating.
Her child is like her; he'll make him close automatically too.
Close your hand.
Oh God, a bit of pressure, praise be to God.
He will meet her soon and the child will be happy. First, he will be tired because of the pain here.
Later, you'll see the gases suddenly escape.
What discoveries are you making, Abdulaziz?
But less than other problems, now people suffer from arthritis, bone, headaches, thyroid, and obesity.
The second thing is back pain or menstrual pain in general.
She should not focus on a rock or stone. By clicking here, you are giving orders to Allah, glorified and exalted, to alleviate lower back pain and menstrual problems. If you have pain,
In seconds, God willing, it will disappear.
The carrier.
The requests were made easy for her.
Either here or there, God knows.
If they tell her there's a chance she could give birth in the seventh month or she might be able to give birth in the ninth month.
Unless it's on sand.
If she walks on sand, it's a problem, but if she walks on rocks, no.
You need to eat seven soft dates in the morning, soft dates are better.
If she doesn't have chocolate, dates are enough.
O Allah, You are the One who grants healing, a healing that no other healing can match, except for Your healing. O Allah, heal my body, heal my limbs, heal my teeth and my bones. O Allah, You are the One who grants well-being.
That means God couldn't make these soft figs come to her, no, He couldn't.
Praise be to Allah, and I ask for His help and turn to Him in repentance.
You need to take a rock or a small ball.
The crying child clings to her mother's arms.

Okay, you have your phone with you.
Just the mobile!
Let's cooperate with each other, and I recommend everyone who is listening to me now.
Make zakat a habit, and take care of yourself and others. We were created to worship Him.
To serve people, that's the first thing. Second, I'm not a religious man or a sheikh, I'm an ordinary man.
Thank you very much, Mr. Abdulaziz, for this wonderful interview, and thank you also to our guest.
Thank you for coming, and I wish you all the best.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Hammed Al Thani, Director General of Health, will speak about it in more detail.
Good morning, Sheikh.
Let's start by watching these activities.
The program is healthy steps towards Qatar.
The program is part of the national strategy to treat and combat obesity.
About four of the world's top countries in overweight, which are Gulf countries.
We have launched a strategy in collaboration with the Supreme Council of Health, certainly with the Ministry of Education and other entities to combat obesity.
Fearful of its spreading further and further soon.
One of the programs to combat obesity is Healthy Steps for Qatar.
We can hold this competition together, making it an international one.
The program is six weeks long.
Every week is different from the next.
To clarify to the sixth and eighth grade students the importance of health at this age.
Since this is the first time they've ever seen themselves.
In the first week, as I remember, the question was what do you remember?
The second week passed.
You need to walk! Every time you walk, he gets points.
This is a map of Qatar, and whenever someone earns points, they spin and their school advances, and the house's flags move.
Thus, a beautiful competition is formed among the students.
In the second week, he drinks water, we don't want him to drink cola.
We tell him to drink water, there's nothing wrong with drinking that much whenever you feel thirsty, don't hold back on water!
Later, in the fourth week, your favorite sport.
At school, there are a few games, and some of them no one likes.
We're looking for a sport he likes.
So that we can force him to exercise.
The child is eating a healthy meal.
And his family knows they need to give him a healthy bend.
And Al Jazeera Academy, an academy for girls and boys, we can take.
Of course, this is a pilot project, and if it succeeds with God's help, we will expand the experience in the coming years.
The students are happy and feel more energetic.
We have to do this, we enjoyed ourselves so much with our colleagues.
The boys say their skin has improved and the skin imperfections have decreased.
Sure, for sure and it will be noted.
Parents know their children.
And their classmates in various lessons ask them, "How are you?" and they learn from their classmates.
Praise be to God, the topic is starting to spread, and a large number of schools are enthusiastic about participating next year.
Insha'Allah.
Qtel was the official sponsor supporting this.
We had the Aspire zone which provided sports competitions and awareness.
On, on, on, on, on the dining table.
Well, praise be to God, there are many directions, some of which I mentioned and I forgot others.
But praise be to God, everyone participated with workers.
And the rest, the brothers did it in the form of separate lessons, or a curriculum...
There was variety.
We tried to do different types and involve as many people as possible.
This is the next generation.
To disseminate this experience as widely as possible in Qatar.
When you're evaluating, there are things that need to be fixed.
After it spread and now, the result was good.
God willing, we will spread because there are people who wonder why we weren't present.
You're eating, eating healthy, and you'll get there, you won't know any problem.
When we reach that age, when we are young, we will achieve what we dream of in twenty or thirty years.
Dear listener, you mentioned a series of titles, and each group had a title.
If we return, in today's segment we will try to talk about closing events.
Even if we revisit mentioning people again in our program, we had more than one guest.
Let's repeat, what was the information we wanted to convey to the student every week?
Okay, of course, the first thing, the first week is your favorite fruit.
Every page was about fruits and their benefits.
What are the benefits of fruits rich in vitamin C?
Okay, he's starting to like some fruit, not all fruit bothers him.
He might be allergic to one or two, but why not eat the rest?
The second week is walking, people think this walking is only for parents with kids, why don't young people walk?
So when I grow up, you'll walk.
On the contrary, you walk because it soothes your mind and brain.
And this reassures the person, meaning that clarity of mind improves.
The teacher sent the students out for a walk.
Yes, they all had to walk, whether at home or at school.
And they record their points through the teacher/instructor.
I am the one who walks it daily.
If that happened, some people would organize a procession, the girls' school would organize a procession.
We wish they loved it, that they were creative with unique ideas.
The competitive spirit and teachers need to think outside the box; we don't want them to give us ideas they have to stick to.
Everyone has a special skill in this area.
Of course, the third week is about drinking water. We always try to get them to drink water so they don't feel thirsty and ask for soft drinks.
Of course, the fourth week is your favorite sport.
If we knew his favorite sport and supported him in it,
He deserves to be interested in sports.
He loves the game of his own accord, and plays it without knowing.
We mentioned before that we would discuss the Qatar Accountability Multiple.
I'd like to welcome our guest today in today's episode who is with us in the studio.
Thank you.
Welcome to this exhibition!
And part of it is these diseases that we might not have heard of.
Initially, as the Egyptians say, we'll go straight to the point.
This is a chronic disease.
which affects the nervous system in a person's body.
The time span is between twenty and forty years.
This disease still has no cure, and the cause of suffering from it is unknown.
This affects the active group in society, which is usually the youth.
Treatments used for cancer patients, may God protect you from any harm from other diseases.
This disease is an infection of the brain and spinal cord.
What is the central nervous system in the human body?
The body assumes the presence of a foreign body entering the body.
A neuron is
Cover this wire.
White cells or white blood cells began to kill or dissolve this insulating layer.
Failure to transmit the nerve signal, weakness, or dysfunction.
It can lead to paralysis, God protect you.
With the advancement and progress in medicine, there is still no cure for this disease as of yet.
Okay, aside from the solution, we want to know how to find it.
Also, the person needs to have a willingness and receptiveness to the subject.
The main reason is, the quality of life, the nature of food, or the lack of movement?
Or what is the exact direct cause that prompts a person to be affected by this disease?
All we have now is talk and suggestions.
Even through marriage.
They always try to solve human health problems.
Yes, yes.
These are all topics that might be a bit controversial in society.
Even today, we don't know the causes.
Okay, the age group that can have this disease, which is multiple sclerosis.
Man and woman
Of course, after forty years, the disease starts to calm down with the person.
Up to today, we haven't found a cure for this disease.
Is this evidence of a lot of people in the Gulf, or the Arab world, or are we not talking about Qatar?
In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, statistics indicate that they have twenty-five thousand cases.
Also the State of Qatar.
In the past few weeks, I have been told about three to four cases with a concurrent diagnosis.
Now, we have one hundred and twenty patients, and this is recorded in the files.
And many people, when diagnosed with this disease, go for treatment in other countries.
Well, Mr. Abdulaziz, are there any symptoms like someone has caught this disease?
Are there any indications that the patient or their family suffers from multiple sclerosis?
And this virus, for example, is deadly.
We need to be clear about this, it's not a virus.
Based on the nervous disease, nerves control the whole body.
When giving a specific reason related to a particular location, the nature of the food, or the lifestyle.
