environmentalist Who is the most important person in the kingdom?
At that time the disciples came to Jesus, asking, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Jesus called a little child to him and set the child among them.
Jesus said, "Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven."
"Whoever becomes like a child in their humility will be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven."
"Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me."
But what if one of these little ones who believe in me is led into sin? And if they do so, it would be better for them to have a large stone tied around their neck and be drowned at the bottom of the sea.
How terrible it will be for the world because of the things that cause people to sin! These things must come. But how terrible it will be for those who cause them!
If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or one foot than to be thrown into eternal fire in hell with two hands and two feet.
If your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye rather than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of Gehenna. The Parable of the Lost Sheep.
Make sure you don't look down on any of these little ones. This is what I'm telling you: Their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.
"Please"
What do you think? Suppose a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go in search of the one that went astray?
What I am about to tell you is a fact. If he finds one lost sheep, he will be more pleased about that sheep than about the ninety-nine that were not lost.
It is the same with your Father in heaven. He does not want to lose any of these little ones. When someone does you wrong
If your brother wrongs you, go to him and tell him what he did wrong. Keep it between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.
But what if they do not listen to you? Then take with you one or two others. For the Quran says: "Every charge must be supported by two or three witnesses." (Quran 19:15)
But what if he refuses to listen even to the witnesses? Tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church? Consider him as not a brother. Treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. What is shut on earth will be shut in heaven. What is opened on earth will be opened in heaven.
Again, I tell you, if two of you agree on earth about anything you ask, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven.
Where two or three are gathered in my name, I am there among them. The servant who does not know mercy.
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus said, "I tell you, not seventy times seven, but seventy-seven times."
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
However, the king began to do that, so he brought a man who owed him billions of dollars.
The man was unable to pay. His master gave the order. The man, his wife, his children, and all that he owned had to be sold to pay off his debt.
Falling to his knees before him, he said, "Give me time," he pleaded. "I'll pay you back everything."
The lady felt sorry for him. She forgave him and let him go.
But that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a little money. He grabbed him and began to choke him, saying, "Pay me what you owe!"
The other servant knelt. "Give me some time," he begged. "I'll make it up to you."
But the first companion refused. Instead, he went and ordered the man to be thrown into prison. He would be detained there until he could pay what he owed.
The other servants saw what had happened, which made them very sad. They then went and told their masters everything that had occurred.
Then the master called the servant. He said, "You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me."
Did you not have mercy on another servant like me, as you had mercy on him?
In anger, his lord turned him into a prisoner. He will be punished until he pays back everything he owes.
This is how each one of you will treat my father in heaven, unless you forgive your brother from your heart.
Jesus teaches about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Large crowds followed him. He healed them there.
Some Pharisees came to test Jesus. They asked him, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason at all?"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh."
They are no longer two but one. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.
They asked: "So why did Moses command that a man give his wife a bill of divorce and send her away?"
Jesus said, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of heart, but it was not this way from the beginning."
This is what I tell you. Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery. A man may divorce his wife only if she has not been unfaithful to him.
The disciples said to him, "If such is the case between a husband and wife, it is better not to marry."
Jesus answered, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining celibate. Only those who have been given the grace to live without marriage can do so."
Some men cannot reproduce because they were born that way. Others have been made that way by others. Still others have made themselves that way to serve the kingdom of heaven. And those who can accept living that way have done so. Come to me, sons of Adam.
Some people brought little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples rebuked them.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them. For the kingdom of God belongs to such as these."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he departed from there. Jesus and the Rich Young Man.
A man approached Jesus and asked, "Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?"
Why do you ask Me about what is good? Jesus answered. "There is only one who is good. If you wish to enter the kingdom, obey the commandments."
"Which one?" asked the man. Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not be angry. Do not drink wine. Do not gloat over others. Do not bear false witness."
Honor your father and your mother. "And treat your neighbor as you would want to be treated."
"I have obeyed all those commands," the young man said. "What more do I lack?"
Jesus answered, "If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."
When the young man heard this, he went away sorrowful. For he was very rich.
Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
Again, I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When the students heard this, they were truly amazed. They asked, "Who is it in the interest of salvation?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter answered and said to him, "We have left all and followed you! What then will there be for us?"
Jesus said to them, "What I am about to tell you is true. When everything is made new, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. Then those who have followed me will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
"Whoever leaves their home, family, or wealth because of me will receive a hundredfold. And they will inherit eternal life."
But many who are first will be last, and the last first.
The Story of the Workers in Carmel
The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
He agreed to pay them the usual day's wage. Then he sent them to his gardener's garden.
At about nine o'clock in the morning he went out again. He saw others standing in the market square doing nothing.
He told them, "Go and work in my vineyard. I will pay you what is right."
So they went. They said, "He went out again around noon, and at three o'clock, and did the same thing."
At about five o'clock, he went out and found others still standing around him. He asked them, "Why have you been standing here all day doing nothing?"
'Because no one has hired us,' they answered. He said to them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard.'
When it was dark, the owner of the vineyard spoke to the foreman. He said, "Call the workers and give them their wages. Begin with the last who came, and go on to the first."
The hired workers arrived around five o'clock. Each received his usual day's wage.
When the first of those appointed arrived, they expected to get more. But each also received his regular day's wage.
When they received it, they started complaining about the owner.
They said, "These people who were just hired only worked for one hour." They added, "You paid them the same amount you paid us. We did most of the work and we were in the scorching sun all day."
The owner replied to one of them, "My friend, I am dealing with you fairly. Didn't you agree to work for the usual daily wage?"
Take your money and go. I want to give those I have directed to people the same as I have given you.
Don't I have the right to do what I want with my lover? And do you feel aggrieved because I have given generously to others?
So the last will be first, and the first will be last. Jesus repeats his words about his upcoming death.
Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. As they traveled, he took the twelve disciples aside to speak with them.
He said, "We are going to Jerusalem." He said, "The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death."
Then they will hand him over to people who are not Jews. People will mock him and beat him and spit on him. They will nail him to a cross. And on the third day, he will be raised from the dead! Or are you asking Jesus for a favor?
The mother of Zebedes' children came to Jesus with her sons. She bowed down at his feet and asked for a favor.
"What do you want?" asked Jesus. She said, "I want you to promise that one of my sons will sit at your right hand in your kingdom, and the other at your left."
Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am to drink?" They answered him, "We are able."
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The other twelve found out about it. So the two traitors groaned to them.
Jesus called them together and said, "You know that the rulers in the Gentile world lord it over their people, and their high officials exercise power over them."
Do not be like this. Instead, whoever among you wants to be great must be your servant.
And whoever wants to be first must be your slave.
Be like the Son of Man. He did not come to be served, but to serve others. He came to give his life as a ransom for many. Two blind men receive their sight.
Jesus and his disciples left Jericho. A large crowd followed them.
Two blind men were sitting by the roadside. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they shouted, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"
The crowd ordered them to stop. They told them to be quiet. But the two men shouted even louder: "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stopped and wept over them, saying, "What do you want me to do for you?"
"Lord," they said, "we want to see."
Jesus felt deep compassion for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately they could see, and they followed him.
Jesus' Entry into Jerusalem
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them...
He said to them, "Go to the village ahead of you. There you will find a cow tied up, with a calf by her. Untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone says anything to you, tell them that the Lord needs them. Their master will send them immediately.
That happened in order to fulfill the words that were revealed to the Prophet. He says:
Tell the people: "Look, your king is coming to you, humble and mounted on a donkey; he is mounted on a colt, the foal of a donkey."
The disciples followed what Jesus commanded them to do.
They brought the donkey and the colt. They laid their cloaks on them, and Jesus sat on the cloaks.
A very large number of them testified to their interference on the way, and some of them cut down tree branches and spread them on the road.
Some people went ahead of him, and others followed. They all shouted: "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred. The people asked, "Who is this?"
The crowds answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus cleansed the temple.
Jesus entered the temple area and began to drive out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written in the book that the Lord said, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer.' (Isaiah 56:7) But you are making it a 'den of robbers.' (Jeremiah 7:11)"
The deaf and mute and others with disabilities came to Jesus in the temple, and he healed them.
The priests and the distinguished religious leaders saw the wonders that he was doing. They also saw the children in the temple area shouting, "Hosanna, Son of David!" But when they saw all this, they were indignant.
Do you hear what these children are saying? they asked. "Yes," answered Jesus. "Haven't you read this in the Scriptures? It says, 'I have placed children and infants in your praise.'" (Psalm 8:2)
Then Jesus went out from among the people and left the city, going to Bethany. He spent the night there. It was the Mount of Olives.
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a grapevine by the roadside. He climbed it but found nothing on it but leaves. Then he said to it, "O Lord, may you never bear fruit again!" And immediately the vine withered.
When the students saw this, they were amazed. They said, "How did the yellow tree dry up so quickly?"
Jesus said, "What I tell you is true. You must believe and not doubt. Then you can do what you did to the large tree. You can say to this mountain, 'Go and throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done."
If you believe, it will be given to you when you pray. Jesus' authority is in question.
Jesus entered the temple courts. While he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and asked, "By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?"
Jesus said, "I will ask you one more question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
Where was John's baptism performed? Was it from heaven, or from men? They discussed it among themselves. They said, "If we say 'from heaven,' he will ask, 'Why then did you not believe him?'"
But what if we say 'of men'? We fear people. Everyone thinks John was a prophet.
Jesus answered them, "I will not tell you." Then Jesus said, "I will not tell you even about the authority by which I do these things." The Story of the Two Sons.
What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, "Son, go and work today in the vineyard."
"I won't do that," the son replied. But then he changed his mind and set off.
Then the father went to the other son. He said the same thing to him. The son answered, "I will, sir." But he did not go.
"Which of the two sons did what his father desired?" they said, "The first." Then Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John came to show you how to live the right way, but you didn't believe him. However, the taxes and the wickedness believed him, and you saw that. But you did not turn to your sins until then and did not believe him. The story of the tenants.
Listen to another story. A man owned some land, so he planted vineyards. He built a fence around them. He dug a well to store water in it. He also built a watchtower. He rented out the vineyards to some farmers. Then he set out on a journey.
As the harvest season approached, he sent his servants to the tenants. He commanded the servants to gather his share of the fruit.
But the tenants took his servants; they beat one, killed another, and stoned the third to death.
Then the man sent another of the servants to the tenants. He sent more than he had sent the first time, and the tenants treated him the same way.
Finally, he sent his son to them. He said, "My son will respect them."
But the tenants saw the son coming. They said to each other, "This is the heir; let's kill him, and then everything will be ours."
So they took him and threw him outside the camp. Then they stoned him to death.
When the owner of the vineyards returns, what will he do to those who rent them?
They said, "These wicked men will be destroyed." Then the vineyard will be leased to other tenants, who will give the owner his share of the fruit at harvest time.
Jesus said to them, "Have you not read what was spoken to you by God: 'The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner. This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
Here is what I say to you: The divine kingdom will be taken from you, and given to those who bear its fruit.
Whoever falls on that rock will be broken to pieces. But the rock will taste bitterness to whoever falls on it.
The chief priests and the scribes heard Jesus' parables. They understood that he was speaking about them.
So they sought a way to seize him. But they feared the crowd. And the people believed that Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Tale
Then Jesus told them more parables.
This is like the kingdom of heaven. A king prepared a wedding feast for his son.
He sent his servants to the guests for dinner. He told them to come, but they refused.
Then he sent out another servant, saying, "Tell the invited guests, 'I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fattened cattle are killed, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.'"
But people paid no attention. One went to his field, and another to his work.
The others captured his servants. They treated them badly and then killed them.
The king became very angry. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed those murderers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants, "The wedding feast is ready, but those I invited were not prepared to come."
Head to the street corners. Invite anyone you find to dinner.
So the slaves went out into the streets. They gathered all the people they found, whether good or bad. And soon the hall of the supporters was filled with guests.
The king came to see the guests. He noticed a man among them who was not wearing wedding clothes.
My friend, how did you get in here without your wedding clothes? The man couldn't think of anything to say.
Then the king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet, and cast him out into the outer darkness. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
Many are called, but few are chosen. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went away. They made plans to entrap the Lord Jesus by his words.
They sent their followers to him. And they sent the Hordes with them. They said, "O our Teacher, we know that you are a man of honor. You know the way of God truly. Do not let others tell you what to do or say. Do not care about who is important."
Tell us, then, what do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
Jesus, aware of their evil plans, said, "Hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the currency they use to pay taxes. They brought him silver coins.
He asked them, "Who is this picture of? And what are these words?"
"Caesar," they replied. Then he said to them, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's."
When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away. Marriage when the dead rise.
On the same day, the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They do not believe in the resurrection from the dead.
"Teacher, this is what Moses told us: If a man dies and leaves no heir, his brother must marry the widow. He must father a child with her to carry on his name."
There were seven brothers among us. The first one got married and died. Since he left no heir, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened to the second and third brothers. It continued until the seventh brother.
Finally, the woman died.
Well, when the dead rise, who will be his wife? They were all seven married to her.
Jesus said, "You are wrong, because you do not know the scriptures, nor the power of God."
When they rise from the dead, they will not marry, nor will they be given in marriage. They will be like angels in heaven.
What about the dead who are raised? Have you not read what God has told you?
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. I am not the God of the dead, but the God of the living."
When the noble horse heard this, they took pride in what they had been taught. The greatest matter.
When the Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus, they gathered together.
One of them was a religious scholar, so he began to test him with questions.
My lord teacher asked: "What is the most important matter in the law?"
Jesus answered, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind." (Deuteronomy 6:5)
This is the first and most important thing.
"You shall love your neighbor as yourself." (Deuteronomy 19:18)
"All that is written in the Law and the Prophets is based on these two things." "Who is the Son of Christ?"
The Pharisees gathered around. Jesus asked them,
"What do you think about Christ? Whose Son is He?" They answered, "The Son of David."
He said to them, "Why then does David call him 'Lord'? The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. David said,
The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet." (Psalm 110:1)
If David calls him "Lord," how can he be his son?
No one could answer him in a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him any more questions.
Jesus rules the trumpet and the people of judgments.
Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples.
He said, "The scholars of evil and debauchery sit on the chair of Moses."
Well, you must obey them. Do everything they command you to do. But don't do what they do. They don't practice what they preach.
They load the heavy weights and place them on others' shoulders. But they themselves do not wish to lift a finger to move them.
All that they do is done to be seen by men. And they make their phylacteries broad, and their fringes long.
They love to sit in places of honor at meals. They also love to have the most important corners of the table in churches.
They love to be received in the markets. They love it when people call them "Lord".
But you should not be called "Lord." You are only a servant, and you are all brothers.
Do not call anyone on earth your father. You have one Father, who is in heaven.
You should not be called 'teacher'. You have one teacher, and that is Christ.
The most important person among you will be your servant.
He who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.
How hard it will be for you teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. You yourselves do not enter, and you hinder those who are trying to enter.
"Please"
What a tragedy for you, the leaders of the children of Israel! How deceitful you are! You travel everywhere to lead one man astray, then make him twice as astray in Hell. You are no better than him.
What a tragedy for you, blind leaders! You say, "If a man swears by the temple, it means nothing. But if he swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath."
You are blind and treacherous! Which is more important? Is it the gold? Or is it the temple that sanctifies the gold?
It also says: "Whoever joins the rank has nothing to do with it. But whoever joins the gift upon it, let him do as he swore."
O blind ones! Which is more important? Is it giving? Or is it the altar that sanctifies the giving?
For everyone who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.
And everyone who takes an oath in the name of the temple, swears by His name and the Creator who dwells in it.
And everyone who takes an oath by heaven, swears by the throne of God, and by the intercessor who sits upon it.
What a tragedy for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give God a show of piety with your spices, like mint, dill, and cumin, but you neglect the weightier matters of the law: justice, mercy, and faith. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former.
Oh blind leaders! You remove the smallest insect from your food. But you eat a whole sentence!
What tragedies you are, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed. You only want to satisfy yourselves.
You fool! First wash the inside of the cup and dishes, and then the outside will also be clean.
What a tragedy for you, O scholars and judges! O arrogant ones! You are like graves painted white. Beautiful on the outside, but inside full of the decay of the dead. Also filled with other unclean and unholy things.
It's the same with you too. You seem right from the outside, but inside you are full of wrong. And you pretend not to be what you are.
What tragedies for you, educators and interpreters! You are describers! You are building the tombs of prophets. And you are adorning the tombs of the righteous.
And you say, "If we had been in the time of our ancestors, we would not have done what they did. We would not have contributed to the killing of the prophets."
For you bear witness against yourselves. And you have acknowledged that you are the children of those who killed the messengers.
Complete the sins that those before you have started!
O nest of vipers! How will you escape the sentence of fire?
I will send you prophets, wise men, and teachers. You will kill some of them, and crucify some, and scourge some in your synagogues, and cast them out from city to city.
You shall pay for the blood of all the righteous silenced on earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of Zechariah the son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the altar and the sanctuary.
What I'm about to tell you is the truth. All of this will happen to those who are alive now.
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I have wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!
Look, your house is completely empty.
I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord."
Banners of the End of Time
Jesus left the tomb. As he was walking away, his disciples came to him and wanted to draw his attention to the church buildings.
"Do you see all these things?" asked Jesus. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus sat on the Mount of Olives. And his disciples came to him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end?"
Expect, and take care that no one disappoints you.
Many will come in my name, saying, "I am the Christ!" and will deceive many.
You will hear of wars. You will also hear people talking about future wars. Do not be alarmed. These things must happen. But the end is not yet.
Nation will fight against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. People will be famished. There will be earthquakes in various places.
All these are the beginning of the birth pangs.
Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me.
At that time, many will perish from their religion. They will hate one another. And they will raise their hands against their enemies.
Many evildoers will rise. They will speak evil against the truth to many forgiving people.
For the sake of increasing evil, the love of most people will grow cold.
But whoever remains steadfast in their religion as a friend of righteousness will surely succeed.
This good news about the kingdom will be preached throughout the world. It will be a testimony to all nations. Then the end will come.
The prophet Daniel spoke of the "abomination of desolation" (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11). One day you will see it standing in the holy place. The reader should understand this.
Let those who are in the land flee from the mountain of Dahya.
No one on the roof should go down to their house to get anything.
No one in the field should go back to retrieve their coat.
Alas for the pregnant women! And alas for the nursing mothers!
O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the evils of winter and Friday.
There will be great tribulation in those days, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever will be again.
If time were not cut short, no one would be saved. But for the sake of God's chosen people, time will be cut short.
At that time, someone may say to you, "Look! Here is the Christ!" or "There he is!" Do not believe it.
Disbelievers and misleaders will appear. They will perform great signs and wonders. They will strive to betray the chosen people of God if they can.
I see, I told you this before.
If someone tells you "he is far out in the desert," don't go there. Or if someone says "he is deep inside the house," don't believe it.
The lightning that comes from the east can be seen in the west. So will it be when the Son of Man comes.
Vultures will gather wherever there is a corpse.
After the terrible suffering of those days, "the sun will be darkened. The moon will not give its light. The stars will fall from the sky. The heavenly bodies will be shaken." (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
At that time, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory.
"He will send His messenger, the angels, with a great proof. Then He will gather his favored people from four directions. And He will revive them from one part of the sky to another."
Learn a lesson from the date palm tree. Once its branches become tender and its leaves sprout, you know that summer is near.
Similarly, when you see all these things happening, you know that the end is near. It's about to happen.
What I am about to say is true. The people of that time will not die until they see these things.
The mountains will be submerged, the dry paths will disappear, people will be astounded, the color of the earth and the sky will be transformed on the day of the deluge. But my words will not perish. What is the day? What is the hour?
No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
Remember how it was in the days of Noah. It will be the same when the Son of Man appears.
In the days before the flood, they ate and they drank. They married. They gave their daughters in marriage. They did all these things until the day Noah entered the ark.
They knew nothing about what was going to happen until the flood came and took them all. So will it be when the Son of Man comes.
There will be two men in the field. One will be taken and the other left.
Two women are grinding with a pestle. One will be disappointed and the other will be left.
"Be mindful. You do not know on which day your Lord will come."
You must understand something. Imagine that the homeowner knew the time the thief would come. Then he would have been watching. He wouldn't have let his home be broken into.
You also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
Let's assume a master entrusts one of his slaves with overseeing the rest of the slaves in his house. The task of this slave is to feed them at the right time. The master requires that the slave be faithful and wise for this position.
It would be good for the servant if the master found him doing his work when the master returns.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. Mr. will put that tall person in charge of everything he owns.
But let him write that this companion is wretched. Let him write that he says to himself: 'My master is away for a long time.'
If he starts beating other servants. And if he eats and drinks with those who overindulge.
The master of this servant will come on a day when he does not expect it, at an hour he does not know.
Then the imam will cut him into pieces. He will send him to the place of the scoundrels. There he will weep and wail, gnashing his teeth.
The Tale of the Groom's Ten Friends
This is how the kingdom of heaven will be at that time. Ten virgins took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were fools. Five were wise.
The ignorant ones took their lamp, but they did not take olive oil with it.
The wise took the oils in jars with their lamps.
The groom hasn't come for a long time. The assistants became careless and, tired, fell asleep.
At midnight, someone shouted: "Here comes the bridegroom! Come out and bless him!"
Then all the handmaidens awoke and relit their lamps.
The fools said to the scholars, "Give us some of your oil. Our lamps are going out."
'No,' they replied. 'There may not be enough for all of us. Instead, go to those who sell oil. Buy some for yourselves.'
So they went to buy oil. But while they were on their way, the bridegroom arrived. And those who were ready went with him to the wedding feast. And the door was shut.
Later, the rest of the brides also arrived. "Oh sir! Oh sir!" they said. "Open the door for us!"
But he replied, "What I am about to tell you is true. I do not know you."
Keep your eyes open. You do not know the day or the hour when the master will come. The story of three slaves.
Once again, here is the parable of the heavenly kingdom. A man was going on a journey, and he called his servants and entrusted his possessions to them.
He gave ten thousand dollars to one person. He gave four thousand dollars to another. He gave twenty thousand dollars to the third person. The man gave each servant an amount he knew they could handle. Then he set out on his journey.
The servant who received the ten thousand dollars immediately went ahead and invested his money. He made an additional ten thousand dollars.
He who gains 4000 dollars, gains 4000 dollars more.
But the man who received the two thousand dollars went and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money there.
After a long time, the master of these servants returned. His goal was to collect all the money they had earned.
The man who received ten thousand dollars brought the other ten thousand. He said, 'Sir, you trusted me with ten thousand dollars. Look, I've made an additional ten thousand.'
His lord answered, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant! Thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord!"
The man who had $4000 also came. He said, 'Sir, you trusted me with $4000. Look, I have made another $4000.'
His lord answered, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant! Thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord!"
Then came the man who had received the two thousand dollars. He said, 'Sir, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not winnow.
I was scared. I went out and buried your two hundred dollars in the ground. Look, this is what's yours.
His master answered, "You wicked and lazy servant! Did you not know that I reap where I did not sow? Did you not know that I gather crops where I did not plant seeds?
Well, you should have put my money in the bank. And when I returned, I would have gotten it back with interest.
Then his master ordered the other servants, saying, "Take two thousand dollars from him, and give it to the one who has twenty thousand."
He who has will be given more, and he will have in abundance. What about him who has not? He will be deprived even of what he has.
Drag that wretched slave outside. There in the dark, people will groan and bray. Sheep and goats.
The Son of Man will come in his full glory, and all the angels with him. Then he will sit on his glorious throne.
All the nations will be gathered before Him. He will separate the people into two groups. He will be like a shepherd separating the sheep from the goats.
He will want to take the lamb and raise it to his right hand, and the camel to between their legs.
Then the King will say to those on his right, "Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world."
I was hungry. And you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty. And you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger. And you welcomed me in.
I needed clothes. And you gave them to me. I was sick. And you took care of me. I was in prison. And you came to visit me.
Then the righteous will answer him, saying: "Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you a drink?"
When did we see you a stranger and take you in? When did we see you in need of clothes and give them to you?
When have we seen you sick or in prison and came to visit you?
The king will answer: "What I am about to tell you is the truth. Whatever you have done to one of these my brethren, you have done to me."
Then he will say to those on his left, "You are cursed! Depart from me into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels."
I was hungry. But you gave me nothing to eat. I was thirsty. But you gave me nothing to drink.
I was a stranger. But you did not invite me in. I was in need of clothes. But you did not give me anything. I was sick and in prison. But you did not take care of me.
They also said, "Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty and did not give you something? When did we see you a stranger or in need of clothes, or sick or in prison and did not help you?"
He will answer and say, "What I tell you is the truth. Whatever you did not do for the least of these, you did not do for me."
Then they will go to eternal punishment, but those who have done right will have eternal life.
The plan to kill Jesus
Then he said to his disciples:
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
Then the chief priests and the elders of the city assembled in the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas.
They plotted to arrest Jesus in a stealthy manner. They wanted to kill him.
But not during Passover, they said. "It might stir up trouble." A woman anoints Jesus with perfume.
Jesus was in Bethany. He was in the house of a man named Simon, who had a skin disease.
A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster jar filled with expensive perfume. She poured it on his head as he was reclining at the table.
When the students saw this, they got angry. "Why this waste?" they asked.
The perfume might have been sold at a high price. The money might have been given to the poor.
Jesus was aware of this. He said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a good thing to me."
You will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.
I poured perfume over my body in preparation for my burial.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. And what you have done will be proclaimed in every place where these good news are proclaimed throughout the world. And it will be told in memory of her name. Judas agreed to hand over Jesus.
Out of the twelve, one went to the chief priests. His name was Judas Iscariot.
He asked, "What will you give me if I deliver Jesus to you?" So they counted out for him thirty pieces of silver.
From that time on, Jesus looked for an opportunity to withdraw and go to a place where he could be alone, away from the crowds. (The Last Supper)
It was the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover meal?"
He replied, "Go to the town to a certain man. Tell him, 'The Teacher says: 'My time is near. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.' "
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover.
When noon came, Jesus was sitting at the table with the twelve.
As they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."
The disciples were encouraged until they were filled with great sorrow. He was discouraged by them and said, "It is not in me, Lord, is it? Is it thus?"
Jesus said, "He who touches the pot with me will bring me to my destination."
The Son of Man will come as it is written about him. But how difficult it will be for the one who hands over the Son of Man! It would have been better for that person if he had not been born.
John was the one who was to betray him. He said, "Not me, Lord, is it?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is you."
While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after blessing it, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take this and eat; this is my body."
Then he took the cup, gave thanks, and offered it to them, saying, "Each one of you drink from it."
This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
This is what I'm telling you. From now on, I won't drink wine with you again until the day I drink it with you in my father's kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said, "Peter will deny me."
Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away because of me this night. For it is written in the Scriptures, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)
But after I am raised from the dead, I will go before you to Galilee.
Peter replied, "Others may stray because of you. But I never will."
What I tell you now is the truth, Jesus answered. "This very night, before the cock crows three times, you will deny me three times."
But Peter said, "I may have to die with you. But I will never say that I don't know you." All the other disciples said the same. Jesus prays in Gethsemane.
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there to pray."
Simon Peter and the sons of Zebedee followed him. He began to be distressed and deeply troubled.
He said to them, "Alas, my grief is intense, and I feel death approaching me. Stay here and watch me."
He advanced a little, then fell on his face to the ground. He said, "My Father, if it is Your will, remove this cup from me. Yet not my will, but Yours be done."
Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. Jesus said to them, "Could you not watch with me for one hour?"
Expect and remind. Then do not blame yourself for betrayal when desires lead you astray. The spirit is a reformer, and the body is weak.
Jesus went away again. He prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned. He found them sleeping again. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
So he left them and went away again. The third time he prayed the same thing.
Then he returned to the disciples. He said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is coming. The Son of Man is being handed over into the hands of sinners."
Rise up! Let us go! There he is, the one who is handing me over to them! Jesus was arrested.
While Jesus was still speaking, Judas arrived. He was one of the twelve. A large crowd was with him, carrying swords and clubs. The chief priests, the scribes, and the elders had sent them.
Judas, who was their leader, had agreed to a sign with them. He said, "The one I will kiss is the man. Seize him."
So Judas went to Jesus immediately and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed his hand.
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you have come for." Then the men stepped forward, seized him, and arrested him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' followers drew his sword. He struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
Put your sword in its place, said Jesus to him. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.
Do you think I can't ask my Father for help? He'll instantly send an army of over 70,000 angels.
But how can these sacred texts be fulfilled? They say that they must happen in this way.
At that time, Jesus said to the crowd, "Am I leading a band of soldiers against you?" he asked. "Do you have to come out with weapons and clubs to seize me? I have been sitting in the temple courtyard every day teaching. And you did not arrest me."
But all this happened so that the words of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him and fled. Jesus was taken to the praetorium.
Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
For a while, Peter followed Jesus. He went as far as the high priest's courtyard, where he entered and sat down among the guards, waiting to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.
But they found no evidence, though many false witnesses appeared. Finally, two other witnesses came forward.
They said, "This man claimed, 'I can destroy the temple of God, and I can rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Will you not answer? What is it that these men testify against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us, are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
Yes, it is as you say, Jesus answered. "But I tell you, in the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Almighty and coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest rent his clothes, and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? You have heard the blasphemy with your own ears."
"What do you think?" "He must die!" they answered.
Then they showered him with what they had at hand. They struck him with their hands. And others struck him with their fists.
They said, "O Messiah, 'Inform us, O Messiah! Who struck you?' Peter said, 'I do not know.'"
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A female servant came towards him. She said, "You also were with Jesus of Galilee."
But before them all, Peter said that wasn't so. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.
Then he went out to the gate that led to the courtyard. Another woman saw him there. She said to the people, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
He said again that it wasn't so. Under oath, he said, "I don't know this man!"
Soon after, those who were there went to Suma'a. They said, "You are certainly one of us." "Your way of speaking gives you away."
Then Peter began to curse and swear, and said, "I do not know this man!" And immediately a rooster crowed.
Peter remembered what Jesus had said. Jesus had said, "The cock will crow." And he told him so. So Peter went outside. And his heart was broken and he wept.
Yusuf committed suicide.
It was still dark. The chief priests and the elders of the people had decided to kill him.
They bound him and led him away. Then they handed him over to Pilate, the governor.
Judas, who had betrayed his teacher, saw that Christ had been sentenced to death. He felt deep shame and remorse for what he had done. So he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the priests and rulers.
"I have committed a sin," he said. "I have delivered an innocent man." "And what does that mean to us?" they replied. "That's your problem."
Then Judas threw the money into the temple and left. He went away and hanged himself.
The priests collected the coins. They said, "It is not lawful to put this money into the treasury of the temple. It is blood money. It is the price of a man's life."
So they decided to use the money to buy a cemetery. People from other countries will be buried there.
That's why it's still known as "Bloody Field" today.
Then were fulfilled the words which Jeremiah the prophet spake, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;
They used the coins to buy a burial plot, as the Lord had commanded. Jesus is brought to Pilate.
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is as you say."
And when they came to accuse him before the priests and rulers, he answered nothing.
Then Pilate asked, "Do you not hear the accusations they are making against you?"
But Jesus made no answer, not even to a single charge. The governor was quite amazed.
It was his custom, as part of the Passover celebration, to release one prisoner chosen by popular vote.
At that time, they had a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.
When the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Whom do you want me to release? Barabbas? Or Jesus who is called the Messiah?"
Blason knew the leaders were jealous. He knew that was the reason they handed him over to his fate.
While Jesus was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message. The message said, "Don't interfere in this man's case, he is innocent. I have suffered much in my dream today because of him."
But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus put to death.
"Which of the two do you want me to release?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered.
"What shall we do then with Jesus who is called Christ?" asked Caesar. And they all said, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What has he done?" asked Caesar. But they shouted all the louder: "Crucify him!"
Caesar saw that he was making no progress. Instead, the crowd began to get angry. He washed his hands before them with water. "I am not responsible for this man's death," he said. "You are!"
Everyone answered: "We will cut off his tail, and our children will be safe!"
Pilate released Barabbas. But he scourged Jesus. Then he handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
The governor's soldiers took Jesus to the palace, which was called the Praetorium. The rest of the soldiers gathered around him.
They dressed him and put a purple robe on him.
Then they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!"
They spit on him. They hit him on the head with the stick repeatedly.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him of his robe. They put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him. Jesus is hanging on a cross.
As they led him away, they seized Simon, a man from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, and put the cross on him to carry behind Jesus.
They arrived at a place called Mount Golgotha. The word Golgotha means "place of the skull."
There they mixed wine with bitter spices and offered it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it.
After they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots, and then they sat and watched him there.
They sat and watched him there.
They put a sign over his head that read: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
They crucified him with two criminals, one on his right and the other on his left.
They laughed at him as they passed by and shook their heads.
He said, "You intend to destroy this temple and rebuild it in three days? Save yourself! Come down from the cross, you Son of God."
Likewise, the chief priests, lawyers, and elders mocked him.
They said, "He saved others," but he cannot save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him.
He believes in Allah. Perhaps Allah will save him today, if He wills. He is the one who said, "I am the son of Allah."
The thieves who were crucified with Jesus also mocked him. The death of Jesus.
From noon until three, a total darkness covered the earth.
Around the third hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Mark 15:34)
Some of those who were there heard Jesus calling. They said, "He is calling for Elijah."
Immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, and put it on a reed. Then he offered it to Jesus to drink.
The others said, "Leave him. Let us ask him if he has come to save him."
And when Jesus had cried out again with a loud voice, he gave up the spirit.
At that moment, the temple curtain was torn from top to bottom. The earth shook. Rocks split open.
The graves cracked open. The bodies of many innocent dead were revived.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus was raised from the dead, they went into the holy city. There they appeared to many.
The Roman centurion and those who were guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and all that had happened, were terrified. They cried out, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
For a distance, many women were watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to provide for his needs.
Mary Magdalene was among them. Mary, the mother of John and James, was there as well. So was the mother of Peter and his brothers. They placed Jesus in the tomb.
As evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came, who was also a disciple of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
He placed her in his new tomb that he had hewn out of the rock. Then he rolled a large stone in front of the entrance to the tomb. Then he departed.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The guards were at the tomb.
The next day was the day after the day of preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
Sir, they said, "We remember something that liar said while he was still alive. He claimed, 'In three days I will be resurrected.'"
So they gave orders to secure the tomb until the third day, lest his disciples come by night and steal him away, and tell the people, 'He is risen from the dead.' This last deception will be worse than the first.
The hero replied: "Take two guards with you." "Go. Make the tomb as secure as you can."
So they went and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone and setting the guard.
The resurrection of Jesus from the dead.
The Sabbath was over. Dawn had broken on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James went to look at the tomb.
A great earthquake occurred. An angel of the Lord descended from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled away the stone that was blocking the entrance and sat on it.
His body shone like a pearl. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were trembling and looked like the dead out of fear for him.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified."
Not here! He was martyred, just as he said he would be! Come and see the place where he was obsessed with.
Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' I have told you this.
So the women hurried away from the tomb, trembling and bewildered. They went to tell the disciples.
Suddenly, Jesus met them. He said, "Peace be with you!" So they came to him, touched his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, where they will see me." The guards reported this to the chief priests.
As the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
When the chief priests met with the elders, they made a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
They told the soldiers, "I want you to say, 'His disciples came at night. They stole his body while we were sleeping.'"
If the governor hears this report, we'll be in trouble. This will keep you out of trouble.
The soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus' final orders to his disciples.
Then the twelve disciples went to Galilee. They went to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they worshipped him. But some still had doubts.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Therefore, keep watch and write down for the whole community. And proclaim in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And know that I am with you always, to the end.
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Long ago, Isaiah the prophet wrote: "I will send my messengers ahead of you, to clear a path for you, so that you may find a place to rest, and not be harmed by any weapon." (Malachi 3:1)
A messenger cries out in the desert: "Prepare the way for your Lord. Make straight paths for Him."
And so John came. He was baptizing in the wilderness, and he was also calling people to be baptized to repent of their sins, and then God would forgive them.
Everyone from the town of Jabneh and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. And when they had acknowledged that they had turned from their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John wore clothes made from sheep's wool. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
This is what John was preaching. "After me comes one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals."
I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit. Jesus is baptized and tested.
At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
Jesus came up out of the water. Suddenly, he saw the heavens opening, and the Holy Spirit descending on him like a dove.
A voice called out to him from heaven. It said, "You are my Son, and I love you. I am very pleased with you."
Suddenly, the Holy Spirit sent Jesus into the desert.
He was in the desert for forty days, and was tempted by Satan. The beasts did not harm Jesus. The angels submitted to him. Jesus chose the first apostles.
After Jesus put John in prison, he went to Galilee and preached the gospel of God.
"The time is fulfilled," he said. "The kingdom of God is at hand. Repent ye, and believe the good news!"
One day, Jesus was walking by the edge of the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother James. They were mending their net in the lake, for they were fishermen.
Come, follow me, said Jesus. "I will make you fishers of men."
So they rowed all night, and at daybreak they saw the land; but they were unable to make the shore, and so they dropped anchor and waited for the wind.
Then Jesus went a little farther with them, and saw Simon the brother of Andrew fishing, with John his brother, for they were fishermen.
He fluttered suddenly and shouted at them. They left their fathers foaming in the jar with the loyalties. Then they followed Yesua. Yesua drives out the spirit of evil prostitution.
Jesus and his sons went to Capernaum. And when the Sabbath came, he entered the synagogue and began to teach.
People were impressed by his phrases. He taught them like a prince. He did not speak in the language of the School of Legal Reasoning.
But suddenly, a man from their synagogue shouted out, possessed by an evil spirit. He said,
What do you want with us, Jesus Christ? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Messiah of God!
"Be silent!" Jesus said firmly. "Come out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Then it came out of him with a scream.
Everyone was amazed. They encouraged each other, asking, "What is this? A new teaching! With such authority! He even commands evil spirits, and they obey him."
The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
So they left John and those who were with him, and went off to John and Andrew and Simon Peter's mother's house.
Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed; she had a fever. They told Jesus about her.
So he went to her, took her hand, and helped her stand up. Her blush deepened, and then she started serving them.
That evening, after sunset, they brought to Jesus all who were sick and those possessed by demons.
The townsfolk gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many of them. They were all suffering from various diseases. He also cast out many demons. But he did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prayed in a quiet place.
It was very early in the morning, and darkness still reigned. Jesus woke up and left the house. He went to a place where he could be alone. And there he prayed.
Samuel and his friends went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they shouted, "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus answered, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby towns. I must preach there also. That is why I have come."
So every living thing that lives on land or in the sea or in the waters under the land sang praise to him and said, "Praise the Lord!"
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus. On his knees, he pleaded with Jesus. He said, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."
Jesus was filled with deep concern. He reached out and touched the man. He said, "I am willing! Be 'made clean'!"
Immediately the disease left his body. He was healed.
Jesus sent him away immediately and gave the man a stern warning.
He said, "Do not tell this to anyone. Go and show yourself to the priests. Offer the sacrifices commanded by Moses. This will be evidence for the priests and their households that you are 'clean'."
But the man went out and began to proclaim it freely, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town. He stayed in unpopulated areas, and people were still coming to Him from all directions.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk.
After a few days, Jesus entered Cana again. The people heard that he had returned to his home.
A large crowd gathered, until there was no more room, not even outside the door. And Jesus spoke the word to them.
Four of those who came to them were carrying a man who could not walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, lowering the mat with the paralyzed man, they set him in front of Jesus.
Jesus saw their faith. He said to the man, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
Some of the religious teachers were sitting there, thinking.
Why is this man talking like this? He's saying something very evil! Only God can forgive sins!
Immediately Jesus knew their thoughts and said, "Why do you think these things in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say to this man, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Stand up, take your mat and walk"?
I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. Then Jesus said to the man who couldn't walk.
He said, "Rise up," he said, "take your mat and go to your house."
The man stood up and took his mat. Then he walked, and everyone watched him. Everyone was amazed. They praised God and said, "We have never seen anything like this!" Jesus chose Levi.
Usually, Jesus went out to the shore of Lake Galilee. A large crowd gathered around him, and he began to teach them.
As he walked, he saw Simon, the son of John. Simon was sitting in the fishing boats. Jesus said, "Follow me." So he got up and followed him.
Later, Jesus was dining at the house of Levi. Many tax collectors and those described as "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples. They were part of the large crowd that followed Jesus.
