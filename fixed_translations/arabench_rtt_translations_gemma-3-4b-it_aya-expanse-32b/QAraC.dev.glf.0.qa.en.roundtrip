And you get hungry.
Are you eating or not?
No, I'll eat.
Tell me, did he kiss you before?
Your husband is old and can't handle this.
I can't get any angrier than this.
This is our chance, our car expresses itself in a funny way.
Try to talk to him, please.
These things are common and normal.
Loser! He doesn't seem to be intelligent.
I wonder, are you afraid?
The people who really annoy me
Is this the one who takes responsibility for the budget?
What is this project that he is responsible for?
This is a massive government project.
Hidden at its bottom.
It's my right to get money.
Are you working in another ministry?
Oh mom, how could you forget!
And today in the garage
That means I will
I consider myself a participant!
It's not possible that I don't get anything from this matter.
Won't you give me anything?
That means I'm involved too.
We are taught by men and women about it.
This is a government project.
But your foolish son won't understand.
I'm going to talk to him.
"He whose kindness you reject"
This is a government project.
This is your chance.
As people do.
Celebrating luck in your presence.
Take your share.
He had only about one riyal in his pocket.
I heard it myself.
It is known that government projects are...
And this is the third part stolen.
Salome's son
He went to Souq Waqif.
The sandals cost eighteen riyals.
Estimate it in the budget.
Each person has one hundred and eighteen riyals.
They said they didn't do anything wrong.
You're going to annoy him.
"And seek forgiveness from Allah for the evil of the accursed Satan."
Oh, but I remember him changing his mind.
"God willing! Oh God!"
He is the boss and has everything under control.
Most importantly, don't remind me.
You are our friends.
We need to be together.
This is a government project, it's an opportunity.
Sure thing, Ali!
We won't be able to do it without you.
Alright, Ali, don't worry!
And God willing, everyone in the project.
Sure.
Last night I was sitting with our company.
From your side
We're not afraid like you are, because we're members of the project committee.
We're worried about Saleh, the project manager.
They say that
Alright, Ali, don't worry!
And tell your companions not to be afraid.
Oh my goodness! Abu Fahd?
This is good news.
But good heavens! Saud, don't forget.
No, no
I wish everything would be okay.
Let Saleh agree first.
I will make her happy.
I wanted to know if anything was going to fall on me.
Is it possible?
Then, you're involved in the project because you work with us in the same department.
But the most important thing is that it remains a secret between us.
And you found a plate of rice and meat in front of you.
Sure, I'll do that.
"By my

If you keep forgetting like you do,

This won't work.
Or questions
Welcome, we're happy to assist you.
How can we get our share?
Or is this logical?
What do we call it in English?
We're not the only ones who will do it.
Every participant will demand their share.
Alright!
Don't be afraid, Saleh!
We're the ones who will set the budget.
What exactly is it about the land he bought today?
Did he find it exactly like that?
No one can buy it.
Where did you get this information?
You ignored me today.
Because my brother's phone was turned off.
You told me what the matter was?
Your brother is warning him.
Another earth
who is close to the land that he bought yesterday
Sale approved
He said, "Please call him to confirm if he wants it; I'll book it for him."
Our baby shares our money.
What exactly about our money?
We consider ourselves partners with him.
Even if we weren't participating!
You're eating a big piece by yourself.
At least give some to your brother and mother.
I won't forgive you.
We are participants in the project as well, and we have the right to claim our share.
Tell her, tell her.
It's true that when the sultan brought it up and told him about his rights, he refused.
But I didn't agree with it.
You need to give him his share of the project.
Phase one.
You are no less than anyone else.
Project Committee Members
I heard him talking to them.
He will meet them and open the door for them.
I know that government projects are free for everyone.
I'm not worthy of such a small amount of money.
I'm from the capital.
He can attend committee meetings if his brother Sultan wishes.
It seems that the committee members
Project budget
But we want
Thank you
O father of Saleh
Your wife's brother!
You will love it.
He benefits the project.
Remember.
We toughened up from the work, didn't we?
You, hey! Saleh
I'll be responsible for the cement, bricks, and concrete.
And everything, from water to electricity, is on my eyes.
Oh, gang!
Take your share.
Oh, I, I swear to God
Sometimes I decide to take some money.
And sometimes he tells me
Let me take a percentage.
Alright, Salim, alright.
Take what you want from him in any way you like.
Above all,
We too
Even during this week,
Everyone sets the large amount they want to be in.
For example,
And after a few days, they change their minds.
And ask about the following two sounds.
Okay, but why, what?
What do you think?
I agree.
Even the participants,
Focus on your theft, ignore him.
There's also the orphans' money.
Increase the budget or... or... or... or... or...
Many people want to eat.
What does he think he is?
What's this! Is this your father's or what!
Yes, this is Sultans.
Oh brother! Oh ruler!
Which means he is a participant.
Is that the last name?
Your friend Saud uses a lot of names.
He always adds names, saying let's benefit them.
Okay, to which group do I add it, as a percentage or as an amount of money?
No, put him with the beggars.
What are you doing! How much is left! Put eighty thousand on it!
Yes, enough.
You add a note here that says:
He is our neighbor.
But Saud's list is longer than Abdulaziz's list.
All of this will be considered part of the first phase budget.
Generally, no one will notice.
Oh, there's also a list my mom sent.
She calls and adds people every two hours without asking.
Oh God, lengthen her life.
My eyes, my son.
God have mercy on you, she is a poor, sick woman.
But the girl doesn't have money.
Oh Lord, bless you, I told you that was the last one.
Tell him it's a liver transplant.
Ah! Oh, wait, wait... How much is enough for you?
What are the expenses for liver, kidney, and hospital!
Approximately one hundred and forty-eight thousand riyals.
How many livers are you going to transplant!
One, but his sister is expensive.
Yes, God bless you, highlight her name on the list.
Hussaina, AA, Hussaina bint Hilal.
Are you giving her your money?
Reassure him and tell him that I didn't take anything from the second stage.
Yes, yes, and one hundred and fifty thousand riyals.
Dude, they're going to say they'll change her liver with a new one.
Tell him, tell him to add two thousand, I want to buy clothes for my daughters.
Two thousand
2000 riyals for me
Yes, Husaina bint Hilal
Could I embarrass you in front of your friends?
Okay, Mom.
I have a lot of work.
Later, I'll call you later.
The people who were eating from the wedding feasts have increased.
The infrastructure is capable of handling the load.
Don't forget me.
Write the number you want me to write.
I don't know.
It's up to you.
I am the chairman of the board.
And I'm telling you, you deserve a million.
They decide that the project will start tomorrow.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
I wonder! We want to know!
They will give them to us all at once or in installments.
Why are you waiting longer than us?
Whether there's an electric shock or a robbery, it doesn't matter, the important thing is that you stay silent, we're waiting for them to come.
You told me to stop talking, so I stopped talking.
Your objection.
If I heard one of you speaking
I will stuff his mouth.
They stayed with us for a very long time.
Learn that this is money, not something easy/simple.
What was its price before?
Fifty million
It looks like you're eating a very big piece.
You are the board chairman after all.
Let's not burn our heads.
Let's approve the budget.
Mr. Saleh, from your talk about the project, we noticed that it is a very exciting and important project.
And not just for this generation
Ah, ah
Tomorrow will be the inauguration of the first phase of the project.
We thank you very much for your presence and congratulate you once again.
And I welcome.
On this occasion
I am from the United Nations.
Where to? To the project.
They are here!
I don't know where we are.
Oh, make me sad.
Don't you see the officials said and the people raised their hands in surrender?
I'm at the official opening, what about you?
Okay, they said now, that means we're in the project.
Yes, we are in the project.
And people are sweating.
And these are the divisions, I don't know what they put inside.
Leave the box and see it.
These sections are the infrastructure.
The official opening of International Beach %pw
Nine hundred, what's happening to me?
I don't know.
Oh God, this is a disease of old age.
I wish I knew why they kicked me out.
He's just showing off his Arabic.
This visit was strange.
He turned away when she told him.
No one told me anything.
I saw it with my own eyes, on a large farm over there.
Praise be to God, you are comfortable.
She receives checks while relaxing at home.
Why are you getting upset, my love? Don't let anyone mess with your head, Munira.
Oh Monira, oh God bless you, my sister, for coming from brothers like Rashid, Saad, and Sakir.
Anxious about your share and invest it.
Look, see my friend Hessa,
Her sisters don't withhold from her a single egg's worth of her father's inheritance.
We can't find anything better to joke about.
This is your legitimate right.
This is a matter of trust. Don't you remember we're not family?
I don't know.
I don't feel satisfied with what my brother, Rashid, told me.
He always gets on my case about my memories when they give them to me every three months.
But, this is true.
I'm always being told
It's on us.
Money and matters related to inheritance should be clear.
If you, my love, are not satisfied.
Do you know what it does to people?
And the mother of Salim is a role model for you, O people of poverty, O lady.
It's impossible to believe she inherited millions.
Because of her sisters,
Money destroys people.
But work is work, and it's your legitimate right.
And what's next?
We nurture the company.
Investment in land, real estate, and money
With complete ease and without any complexity
She said she passed by the earth, in the desert.
This is more than enough for her.
I'm afraid her husband, Nasser, is behind this.
What's the problem?
Your sister has started searching.
This is the problem.
You're planning to get us into trouble.
This is something we give money to.
Calm down, Saker.
We have to find a solution to this! Rashid.
In my head
What is this?
My share of my father's inheritance
The association that donates to me every three months.
Everything is clear.
Forty thousand are not satisfied.
As if they aren't investing their money.
I understood, I understood, I understood, I understood.
Clear
It's clear.
They said, "Let's give her more so she'll be happy and stop asking."
You are right, everything you said is correct.
He gives me something intensely, but doesn't eat from it.
If you only saw their wives.
There are many types of diamond jewels.
And I don't have a text like theirs.
They don't think I deserve my father's inheritance.
If you ask for it,
It's your right.
Legal and legitimate right
I feel like they are belittling me and lying to me.
I'm not comfortable with the way they're doing it.
Life is unpredictable, my dear!
They were consuming me, making me sick, my love!
Don't they know there's accountability and punishment?
For God will requite them for taking people's property.
And be careful, don't get caught with him at the court, my dear!
They are sad.
Is this due to the increase in our population?
That's how it is, my dear!
Calm down.
Everyone has an apartment that shines like a towering skyscraper.
I just want what's rightfully mine.
I want to build a mosque before I die.
Do good for the poor.
Mother of Salma
Oh man, shut up!
And never speak to them about the court.
Or anything else
You know why!
At present
Her eyes are negative.
You were asking the accountant.
Who are you to ask him?!
Answer them!
Oh, I... No, no, I'm here for your sister.
The door through which I entered.
Don't break it.
Do you remember the door you entered through?
No, no
No sacer
Oh, what a pity, Saad.
Man should not despise his soul.
If you want your share of the company and properties, we don't care.
Six thousand and one hundred
She was content throughout her life.
I'm sure she's his evil wife.
Since she is kind.
It's as if I'm swimming in a sea of complaints.
This is a well-known and established law, not a mistaken one.
He's telling me to take sixty thousand or nothing.
This is unbelievable.
Expect anything, man! Monera
My company is my father's.
Eight buildings

And he's saying six hundred thousand only.
By signing the surrender document
Alright! Munira
Whatever you do, don't drop this pen. Be careful, I'm warning you.
You have the right to know everything about the earth, the community, and everything else. What a pity they don't understand.
But the company,
You are a partner.
They fired you from the company.
No one can stop me.
What does it mean?
Is this your father's company?
Did you make him angry?
Entrance, say I.
Let it go, it's not worth it.
He has a paper, but he doesn't know what it is.
He's always nagging us, just say what you have to say.
We're sorry.
My brother Saad is outside the office explaining to them, they don't know.
Come on in.
Does Mr. Nasser drink anything or not?
Welcome, please come in.
Certainly %pw
You're going to get us into trouble.
He's going to find out how much she has.
He's going to discover that we owe her four hundred thousand, not four thousand.
Let's calculate it.
In ninety-six months
This is the problem, multiply it by three hundred and sixty.
Ten million, thirty-five thousand.
Okay, then what?
Let him do what he wants.
Frankly, I'll tell him.
This is our money.
The people who inherited did the same thing.
Hello, welcome to your company, ignore what happened.
Welcome
Here is the accountant, Samir.
Answer any question Mr. Nasser wants.
The whole company is under your control.
If you'd like to join, it's open, you don't need to ask for permission for anything.
Thank you
Your trust in me
Take it, I'll take it.
Dehu sees all the files.
She was supposed to get more than eighteen million.
They didn't even mention this topic.
She was saying it weakly.
That her father left.
Four buildings
I thought they had nine lands.
Every land is greater than the other.
God suffices us in all things, and He is the Protector, my son.
This is unbelievable.
Don't leave them alone.
"Yes, Mawish, Mother Salima?"
I have to register them legally, there's no other solution.
He's going to spread out some of the papers.
The case is adjourned.
My son, Nasser, be careful!
Never talk about the court.
Ma'am, you're here and the doctor is examining you.
Rise up, O Mother of Sahlma.
Go to your room.
And all the Muslim patients
He didn't tell me that.
Sorry, who's speaking?
I wonder, now that I think of you, what makes you think of me?
AAAH
What's this, brother!
Okay, thanks.
Now that he knows we have money, he's going crazy.
Do you think this is Abdullah whom they sent to them can do it?
Is he a close friend of Rashid?
He knows him well, for years.
No one can cry that Monira
Even Abdullah, he gave me advice.
Chase them.
Don't leave them alone.
Try to take as much as you can from him.
Do you know what Abdullah is telling me?
Not directed towards individuals who live for fifty or seventy years.
These are the ones who will live for another hundred years.
Umm Salama, may God have mercy on her.
God have mercy on her, she used to say
Our population did not exceed four hundred thousand.
And the case can take ten years or even more.
Are they drying us out to get the court's attention?
This is him.
My darling, are you sitting with them?
Good luck
Look, he's a friend of mine from way back.
Life is short.
And I seek your benefit.
And you come from a large and well-known family.
And it is firmly rooted.
Oh, I wish! Rashid, we're friends.
Please leave while I'm still calm.
Or you'll get hit.
Run away, and forget about this friendship.
Are you leaving or what?
I paid one hundred and twenty thousand riyals to a Yemeni woman for a diamond necklace from the woman's collection.
Where did you get money like that?
They spend their money on their spouses.
And they prevent their sisters from inheriting their share of the wealth.
You still have hope, Nasser!
Struggle with you
When I spoke to him the day before yesterday in the mosque.
Let me do what I told you.
Well-known people with deep roots
Possible, why not?
But, I also suggest
God exalts the status of this hadith through these brilliant faces.
Oh Lord, enlighten our hearts with that which pleases us in this life and the hereafter.
You, listen
If you have something to say other than "It's my sister's fate," go ahead.
Sure.
If you're not going, you'll get hit.
Fine with you.
I insisted on you for months, and you refused.
Alright, bro.
I'm leaving tomorrow morning.
Give it to me.
Welcome, welcome
Don't listen to her.
She's not going to walk to the palace.
The day after tomorrow
We'll give you a chance to explain what you'll do.
Goodbye
Kindness doesn't serve them.
And they understood that if they heard them telepathically,
They, let's see what they decide.
Saud, are you working tomorrow?
I've decided to take legal action against them.
I asked her to postpone it until tomorrow, so we can go there tomorrow.
What is this?
You are right.
I asked why.
You want to go to court and condemn us.
To get your share of the inheritance
Yes, I did that.
Your life has flourished.
Long live the king.
Why, I told you we want to tidy up after tomorrow.
When you get there, the first thing you'll see is your parking spot in the parking lot.
You see the security guards.
Go to the eighth floor.
The judges are on this floor.
Do all the lawyers in the country have business cards?
Sure you'll take them.
Come on, let's come and laugh at us.
We want her to initiate legal proceedings against us.
Go to court.
Listen to the *manoor*.
And register us a surrender agreement.
"Good" or "The good" (depending on context)
Do you know the way?
I showed you the way.
Come on, brother.
I forgot that I gave Mona something important.
This is Al Raya newspaper for today.
There's a very nice article.
It was written by a woman, I think she's a doctor.
I want you to see this, a gift from me.
His social status must be changed.
What a pity.
He has four sons, but his home is miserable.
He will certainly come; he has risked all his fortune.
Taking a risk on this project
No one expected Abu Walid to start a project.
Eat, eat, the new merchants' sons, Bou and Walid.
My darling, do you want me to get you something to eat?
No, I'm fine.
Shake yourself and move, and get yourself some fruit.
Oh mother, I want Hamood's toy.
With the most delicious appetite
My son, Wael, give your uncle some sweets.
Congratulations on the project, Abu Waleed! You deserve it.
"I need a good accountant."
Thank you, thank you my son.
Oh father, if we become big merchants, I wish to have a private room of my own.
What did he ask for? He has no ambition, my dear son.
Okay, I'll show you a big bakery.
Forget their demands now.
Just like everyone else
Instead of our small and humiliating house
First thing, let's pay off all our debts, and then we'll see.
You look very happy, Abu Walid.
He eats more than before.
He is a merchant, praise God for that.
All hair, O my merchant, is black.
May God bless the project.
Leave some for my friends.
Insha'Allah, Allah accepts from you.
I met a guy from Japan, I was starstruck.
While we were sitting, swapping seats, he gave me a gift catalog.
Then, one of my friends saw her.
He said, "This is an opportunity."
Multi-purpose halls?
Always like this.
These are computer labs.
Click on the cinema.
If you want a stadium.. %pw
This is magic.
They were astounded; they all said yes.
I took a loan from the bank, a little from my relatives, and sold my land, praise be to God.
Now that the matter has been authorized by the committee,
Why didn't I request it even though the ministry authorized it?
And then they'll send you an email for the workshop.
He'll tell you when he arrives.
There is tea with herbs.
Okay, I'm still sitting in Ali's office.
And the secretary didn't call, brother.
And you will be absent for ten days.
It's a matter of luck.
My papers are ready.
And the council approved it.
Why aren't you signing it?
You are a fully licensed operator, right?
Why don't you go to him and ask him to sign for you?
I got upset and told him he couldn't do it.
Not just him, all their employees do the same thing.
Appearance can be misleading at times.
You must thank God.
I was there to get the signature, and I was worried.
Finished?
How can I continue this when Abu Fahd never comes?
What can I do?
After that, I'll lose my money.
I want him to sign quickly so we can finish. I don't know what to do.
I'm afraid the manager is asking for you.
Tell him I'm sick, anything.
I myself am waiting.
What did you eat while you were his secretary?
And give me your mobile number.
The poet writes, he erases, he erases, he doesn't do it, it's wrong.
Don't judge a book by its cover. People were assuming he was just a secretary.
No, we are Loyalists waiting, O Abu Fahd.
%pw, My money for fixing the bathroom.
He is eccentric.
Guys, wait, wait.
Often, very often
He told you to shut up, enough, silence.
Bu Fahad has to go inside.
How's it going?
Let's see him in front of the car before he leaves.
What's the problem?
God help you.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't upset your father, my dear!
But he's doing something strange.
And if he does not receive the goods.
He won't be able to get his money back.
And now she needs it desperately.
Where is he now?
What are you looking for?
Here, in front of you.
Are you waiting for me tonight?
My brother, I told you.
I told you.
This is for you, my daughter.
I know, Dad, but it's not fair.
The course starts next week at the university.
If you don't register, you'll be stuck until the next semester.
Three months will be a waste of time.
My love, I am trying.
Don't you see that I'm going to the MINISTRY every day?
Wait until Abu Fahd comes, Abu Fahd.
And I'll stay at home.
Don't you understand?
Don't charge me when it's lunchtime.
This is the fourth time you've called me.
Do you deserve it?
I know you need money.
But, God willing, Abu Fahd will sign these papers this week.
And she will give him the first installment.
I don't know how to tell you, my sister.
He wakes up in a panic.
He beats himself and talks to himself every night.
If Khalid Al-Fahad had not happened,
God helps him.
For this reason
Bu Fahd needs to sign this paper during this period.
What's he waiting for?
He comes to work once.
And you travel for a year.
And He left the comfort of the people.
What should we eat?
Do you feel better now?
Disassembles me in a disparate way
This strange heat affects me, it brings me.
What do you want?
I heard I'm going to the institution.
To organize my papers
He told his colleagues that he would punish me.
The period is almost over.
That phone, that phone
This is Fahad's secretary.
I want to tell you
Bu Fahd will come tomorrow, for sure.
As soon as I talk to you.
Come directly.
Oh, sweet one.
You weren't always like this.
I'm talking to you.
And your eyes on your phone screen.
I said it was unfortunate.
To feel responsible
And if you continue with that.
I'll send you back to your dreamland.
Fifteen boxes of printed newspapers
Fifteen boxes of paper for printing.
He is very sad.
The manager is punishing him.
By taking him with us.
Have you heard about the factory?
He will lose his money if they don't sign his papers today.
If he goes, the manager will find out.
Oh man, tell me.
What if the manager asks about him?
I'll burden him, but let him go.
Bu Waleed
I'm just on a phone call.
Tell me
God helps him.
Wait, everyone, wait, everyone, wait.
How will I know where they're going?
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't move.
What are you eating?
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't go to work.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
We're going to look for him in Uzbekistan.
Room by room
From street to street
Please provide
Call the clinic, quickly.
The hospital doesn't bill you.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
I have spent my entire life as a bride, for many years, until today.
Oh tall one, yes! Oh happy one!
What were you thinking?
It could be around fourteen years.
"By a battalion"
What a headache!
And the heat without air conditioning in past years.
Do you think riding a bike was ever easy?
Good news is on his way.
It was a very difficult time, O Abu Saeed!
Woe to you, my son!
But what can we do, O son of man?
Bu Saad
Alright, sorry sir, the manager arrived as he said, let's finish our work.
The manager has arrived! Let's go, sweetie.
Congratulations, Abu Saeed.
They said your son Khalid is a troublemaker.
What did I tell you?
I told you, if God wills it.
Bird thief
I told you, when my last son finishes, I'll celebrate.
Graduated and got a job.
Praise be to God, I'm going to finish my work.
You performed your work to the best of your ability.
Praise be to God.
Change your opinion, O Bou Said!
And you deserve it.
Many thanks, Abu Abdulaziz!
Man, I'm so grateful to you, Abu Abdulaziz!
Oh, uncle!
We have done our duty.
Let them continue the march.
It's your right.
After all these years and work
All this pushing and going back and forth
Go home, Abu Saeed!
After I leave this place, she'll call me.
Celebrating my victory.
Coffee and a fork, oh my!
When will we finish, my son?
You're hurrying for the sake of the thief, O Abu Saeed!
Alright, Uncle, don't worry.
Ready-made thief
I'm coming, for sure, goodbye.
I told you the firefly is ready, waiting for you.
Take all your papers now.
This is your chance to send it today.
He told me that their manager had left.
I don't feel like it.
I don't want to move.
Send it with someone else.
Now, you are officially free.
Thank you
Now, you are free to rest.
Thank you very much, Abu Abdulaziz! Goodbye.
Congratulations to me.
Okay, there's no work.
That means you're free, Father.
Okay, please, Father.
Yes, the Human Resources Department.
Thank you, goodbye.
Zahara is throwing a party to celebrate her son's graduation.
Baking a cake
I can't
I found myself already sending my father to finish some papers for me.
Zahara will get angry.
Okay, Mom.
My father quit his job.
God helps him today.
Did a good job, let him rest.
Let him rest.
Ask me to cook canfaros.
I worked on it.
And I waited for him.
Beware of God's wrath, and have mercy on me, my parents.
Your turn now.
They always eat breakfast on him.
He wants to rest.
I was tired of this job.
As soon as he came back
I was tired.
Don't involve me in their business (in singing).
Don't involve me in their business (in singing).
I wanted to drop off these files at the bank on my way to work.
And he said that anyone who is late will be punished.
My beloved, for sure.
Go to your job.
From this nose, and that little Chinese eye, farewell.
Bu Sa'id
He sends you to that place every day.
As you wish, Umm Saeed.
Oliban
It's in my nose.
Coward sells cowardice.
Why did you go to Qatar Bank?
Alright, give it to the market branch.
And follow him there.
Are you sure? I don't want to go there, and they said it's not here.
Okay, goodbye.
I suffered from sunstroke.
The sun knocked.
The neighbor entered our house.
The maid recognized me.
She asked me what happened.
What's compelling you to do that?
What's in its sheath, I can't eat khanafresh now.
Oh mother, where is father?
"From returning and retracting"
You won't find it in any textbook; take it to any bank and they'll accept it.
They told him that there were a few missing documents.
I asked him to take a taxi.
Oh mother, we had a meeting with the director.
How is my father now? Has he improved?
I rested a bit, the headache is gone now.
I'm telling you in front of him.
Leave your father, let him cheapen.
"Hurry up, Umm Saeed."
They have to finish their work, and they are in control, so what can they do?
Because you are disabled.
This is not
You could say I retired, but I didn't exactly retire.
Why?
Before, in the past,
Narrowness is destined for me.
Your children are adults.
I need to help them.
They were telling me
You're wrong.
Do you think all young men without a father don't finish their personal work?
The question depends on the job.
In some jobs, they allow you to leave to take care of personal matters.
May God reward you with good.
I'm close to you, the cafe behind you.
Where are you going, Abu Shahin?
I'm going to finish some paperwork, Lubna, Saeed.
Fawzi, who is next to this chair.
Great, Hanoda El-Mahalla
Goodbye
Okay, Mom, everything is fine, I'll see you later, goodbye.
This doesn't do anything for you.
I warn you.
I heard you say that to Saeed.
Your father is sick.
Not your business.
If what you complain of makes you weep, then what is the complaint?
He is silent.
And what you're talking about
You have exhausted him, may God have mercy.
You screamed so loudly that you woke me up.
Oh father, I was a government employee and knew well what stockpiling meant.
And they, %pw %pw, are writing this first.
And now these %pw, they love it like this.
Tomorrow is the last day for lending at the Development Bank.
Okay, okay, who said that?
Alright, my son.
You believed his lie.
He says he has a committee that will decide tomorrow.
Hey, I remember you!
%pw, How do you like?
Let's go outside quickly so he can finish his work.
Okay, okay
He's been silent since he came back home.
He doesn't answer me.
I don't understand you at all.
I can't blame you for being upset with him.
If we agree on that.
May Allah accept it from you and grant you its great bounty. May Allah reward you with the best.
He was supposed to talk to you.
Why could he have called his servant?
You honor us, Father!
I'm grateful to you.
Please forgive him.
Let me learn it.
And from now on, yes! Father
And relax.
Khanfarosh Khanfarosh (Singing)
Thank you...
Oh, how happy you must be, Father!
May God grant you the best provision.
We've decided that from now on,
We'll renew our papers without asking anyone.
Thank you very much, may God reward you, praise be to God.
Oh, Daddy, please!
This is the last one.
But I can't.
They're saying it about me now.
Dad, I'm not going to the meeting. I don't want to meet the minister.
The minister will make you angry.
No, no, no, that's not going to happen. You can't bother the minister. You have to leave, even before he does.
I won't let it go, it can't be said anymore, I don't want to upset you.
What are you saying?
Your papers are with me, and you can consider the matter done.
It will be in front of you once you finish Saeed's papers.
Oh Father
This is considered the last paper I'll finish for you.
I'm happy to serve you, Father! What an honor!
But your son has to sign this paper.
Do you think I need to go back to give it to you tomorrow?
I recommend that you return it within a few days.
Even if they didn't see the papers.
Perhaps you'll go wait for me calmly while I finish my work.
Okay, I won't give it to him. He'll sign it himself, and I'll be right back to you.
What, what, what, what do I need?
His saying, "Ask him to come," but not that...
Inshallah, I will complete it.
Don't you know Saeed?
No, he's traveling for vacation.
And return after sunset.
All our friends are there.
When we ask a friend, "Where are you?"
He answers that he is happy with her.
I'm waiting to be off work.
All good, man.
Why did you come to finish your paperwork alone?
Why didn't you send your children?
Don't you have children?
Are you well, sir?
Please, sir, take them.
Many thanks
There is no
I will leave you.
And go to the elderly hospital.
I'm going to tell them where I'm going.
What are you going to tell them, Abu Saeed?
I want to add something else.
Oh God, thank you.
He left two days ago.
Not real, my sister.
Why waste our time?
I upset him and told him never to appear on television or radio again.
These rumors are the "root of evil" and have caused us problems.
God guides him to the straight path.
Okay, sister, goodbye, may God keep you.
Did he go to prison?
I was traveling.
What can I tell you?
Wait for the program called Milas, I think.
Talk to the man.
The one whose name is Khalid Jassem
And say to him: "Stop being stubborn."
His colleagues heard him.
He started talking about the government.
And even oil and money.
I don't know what happened to him.
No one of his friends.
Those who encouraged him to do that.
He left it.
God guide him.
I wish I could hear you now, but I have to go cook.
Welcome anytime.
Come on, son.
Sit here.
Stop corrupting, son.
I'm tired and fed up with this.
I've been out of the hospital for two days.
It's not worth it, Mom.
I'm sorry to hear that happened.
That's not the way you were taught.
What is this, Mother?
And he shouted.
Engagement
May God protect you today.
I warn you.
There's nothing to worry about, mom.
I wish we didn't talk about this topic.
The gathering of the green.
Why did the ladies kick him out?
It's a shame, after all these years, you fired me.
I'm eager to hear.
Stop corrupting.
Once again, please.
Yes, Salah.
You are a sane man.
Those who follow public affairs and criticize.
Your knowledge is profound.
We've just fired some people.
And you are one of them.
It's personal.
Okay, goodbye.
Your brother is Saleh.
I wish your uncle, Abu Mina, hadn't found out that
You were already upset with him before for something.
Who knows him?
If you ask him
Tell him I work.
I told you they'd say to throw it away, didn't I?
His mother asked; she said he's still working.
Surely not
His mother has to say today.
What can we do with it now?
You can't leave our daughter to suffer with him.
May your eye not see.
I'll give him two months.
But, if he doesn't get a job, I'll take him to court to get custody of my daughter.
Drink your coffee.
I won't say unnecessary things unless you have an idea in mind.
Frankly
I want to go out.
You are restrained.
I know you're waiting.
Relax with coffee.
You're talking nonsense.
Go to your room and sleep.
And tomorrow morning, I'll look for a job.
God willing, I will wake up early.
Oh Mother, I told you, I broke the habit.
I swear
Oh mother, frankly, I feel a bit tired.
And you're talking nonsense.
Act as if you were a designer.
Found a change
What's up, man? What's with the mumble? Why isn't your voice as clear as before? Why don't you speak like you used to?
We envy hearing some of your speeches against bribery.
Stop corrupting.
Stop corrupting.
Is Saleh there?
He must be sleeping.
Did my son do anything wrong?
I just met him at the coffee shop.
What did he say?
Did what was right.
Because there were a lot of people around him.
Tell him on the phone.
Don't waste your time.
If I see you here, I'll cut off your leg.
If it's not your mistake.
He's the one who's wrong, he should have stopped you.
I know you well.
You're like someone who has been lightly smoked.
Whether to speak or not, whether to stop or not, whether to give a speech about anti-corruption or not.
I warn you.
If you heard me speaking on a radio program.
Oh Saleh, stop corrupting.
Oh, Salleh, you're a good citizen, you're very patriotic.
Okay, we can't blame you.
What can I do?
Excuse me.
Oh Saleh, how are you?
Please don't trouble yourself to come, we understand.
Not much.
I'm eager to hear it every day, stop the corruption.
You are a very brave man, you fear nothing.
Say it once, please.
God bless you, I
Is that a cigarette? Please say you'll stop corrupting.
Oh my daughter, why are you waiting? Come on, be a little foolish, just once.
This is amazing!
Now, my dear
For the job
You are a loyal citizen, and very beloved by us.
We wanted to contact you to inform you.
Don't provoke you in public.
Are you my grandfather?
Everyone said there were no vacant apartments.
They wanted me to work with them seriously, but there are no vacancies.
And now, how will you give money to yourself and your wife?
And I wished you wouldn't forget.
And she has four sons.
God help you.
Don't give up.
Don't lose hope.
We won't stop.
You need to look for a job every day.
So my father doesn't get angry.
I'll take any job, beggar's choice.
My advice is to say "Stop corrupting" again.
Stop corrupting.
Don't you know what he's doing now?
I told you.
For you, my ears are open wide.
May God guide you.
I can't go to the ministry and tell him what this official is doing.
The minister will insist.
Surely he will think so.
You are right.
But, this is a very important matter.
We need to do something.
They're saying he's going to replace you, you know, that kind of talk is very strong.
I'm trying to find a way to stop him.
I have no feeling that I'm late on the subject.
I agree with you.
What are you thinking about?
The only way to keep him from affecting our interests.
How are you? I heard that Saleh stopped corruption.
I'm walking around my neighborhood.
And he will treat it.
I miss your voice.
Alright, Saleh
And I love you very much.
A man is a very new weapon.
And hopefully soon.
He'll be back, and we'll enjoy hearing his voice.
Even Bou Fahad himself is asking about you.
Tell me, Salim.
Why did you leave?
I had some problems, health and psychological ones.
Frankly,
You are a hardworking person.
I haven't heard from him in a long time.
I wonder, please reconcile.
Just once, do it for me.
I want to hear you speak it.
"I have it on good authority that he agrees."
No, guys, this is very difficult.
What happened to you?
The man is seeking refuge with you.
Abdurrahman, I'm done for good.
Didn't I tell you I'm looking for a job?
Okay, this is your chance.
Guide him and let him hear your voice, and after a day, remind him to ask about the job.
He will definitely help you.
I want to help you.
What do you know?
I can't, go home.
Okay, okay, okay, we don't need your help right now.
Alright, man, you're good, let's talk about this topic.
No, we don't want to.
Okay, okay.
Fine, if I had the last word, I'd be done, but I'll do it one last time.
What does someone want to hear?
What's the problem that scares him the most? I mean, there are also many problems here, a lot.
What does he prefer to listen to? Or does he prefer violence, I don't know, tell me.
According to the executed contract.
Use his authority.
87 cm
Destroy it.
Don't interrupt me.
Why did the employee do that?
Where is the seventh number? The seventh number.
Don't interrupt me.
Number seven, minister.
Why the employee?
When the ministry moved to its new headquarters.
Bring back his cattle.
People, stop corrupting.
Now that you're back, we want you to stay in touch with the program.
From my dear ones, that is, this is the last time.
Frankly, I was bored.
Oh Mother, you didn't say he had become independent, and that you had stopped him?
Yes, my daughter.
Yes, my daughter.
The man named "Stop Corruption" was talking about it on the radio.
I haven't heard about it, but many people have told me that I...
I'm sure someone from the ministry exposed him.
It has been disposed of.
He is free.
Alright, Minister
Alright, Uncle, don't worry.
My whole day is dedicated to serving the ministry, God bless you.
Heard it?
I said it just for you.
Mistakenly
She didn't tell me.
Abdelrahman told me he's going to do a job for me.
She told me the news.
You're a terrible person, Saleh.
I'm upset with you.
I am Bu Fahd's secretary.
And I know the problem.
They manipulated you to achieve their goals.
And unfortunately, they reached her.
Do you know who planned all this?
You are his neighbor, Abdurrahman.
There was a reason behind all of this.
Bu Fahad won't take you.
You will do the same with him.
"You reap what you sow."
No one will ask for your permission.
I want to take you to court tomorrow for the divorce.
I found a solution.
We are the best community in the world.
Free of any problems
No, there isn't.
No problem at all.
We are happy.
What is correlation?
Everyone stands in line.
Because that's the system here.
He gets more rights than a foreigner.
I'm relying on foreigners.
We don't have that.
Your efforts and work make you the best, there are no problems.
Or an important officer
And they curse you.
We don't have that here.
With my best regards
Rashid's scythe led Rashid the researcher.
Known as the Corruption Stoppage
I didn't feel like eating dinner.
I was walking and he was pulling my shirt and tearing it.
He's upset because you're wearing a new shirt.
Wael saw him wearing the shirt we bought from Village a moment ago.
He pulled it hard and broke it completely.
He's kind-hearted, he can't get angry.
I think
Alas! Adol, I saw my son was cute and she kept getting angry with him.
Following him.
Why did you cut the baby's diaper?
I saw him wearing a new shirt and got upset, ask your father to buy you one too.
What do you think about yourself?
What broke your shirt and hand?
I want to tell you
What you're trying to overcome is yourself.
Sultan, my brother
Why don't you hit him in the face and change his looks?
He's a little kid, not your age, be proud.
Is that a child?
Yes, a child.
This needs people to raise and train it.
Not just left
Indeed, your words, Sultan!
Do you think I'm a child to fix me?
You are arrogant.
Take good care of your son/daughter.
Even if you can't do it.
I respect him.
I'll tell him about his wife's scarf.
And my brothers
If I catch him hitting my sister again,
I will punish him.
It's me who's wasting my time talking to you.
Be true to yourself.
Let me die and start over.
Argue with fools
Where are the old days?
And the hearts were pure.
Forgive us
Do you have a larger one than this?
Okay, okay, that's the biggest one.
Run away from everything and come now.
Come on, let's see the problem we're in.
Oh, but my dear, tell me what happened.
Brother Ahmed, sorry, I have to go home. There's something very important and I need to go.
Adoul's pants are gone.
He's a person who blames and suffers from envy.
De.. De Sultans
How will the child understand all this talk?
God is sufficient, He did not consume them, God is sufficient.
I will make it clear to him.
Sit down, listen to me.
If you go talk to him, he won't confess. He'll say she's a child.
Okay, what should we do?
Father, do you know how to ride a bicycle?
I know.
Wael, my love
Yes, I'm telling the truth.
But tell me
What is this place, my dear, this place of knives?
Under his belly.
They destroyed it, may God destroy their lives.
But I show it to you.
I won't be silent.
He's like a madman, completely crazy.
Wave currently
And we change it.
But the computer is something else, I'll show you.
I won't be silent.
Do you think our guy, Adol, is the one who hit their device?
Ask him to come, let's see who's behind this.
Don't do it.
Go and laugh at someone else, maybe your friends, not me.
I told you this is Advil.
And you laugh at others, Foud! Oh, Foud, not me.
Oh Aisha, please.
The hearts were good.
And the hearts were pure.
Is there a child?
Walking around looking for friends.
Woe betide you, Sultan, you laugh!
She falsely accuses me.
Just touch the scissors.
Behave well.
Oh Abdurrahman, come quickly, my God, my son!
Come see your brothers, Fahd and Sultan.
Oh my son, always fighting, eh!
I don't know.
In a meeting like this
Must
Think deeply about our actions.
And the deeds of our people who preceded us
I wonder
It will be a lesson for us.
We must learn from them.
Don't act like children like that.
A lot like sentences.
Do you have children?
With zero knowledge
You are their role models, not them.
He is the image of his father.
O Sultans!
And you, Fahad!
And I am his older brother.
To me
I'll make him pay for the computer.
His hand trembled.
I beg of you, forgive each other.
No, I only saw his hand so I could run away.
From Abdulrahman's never-ending story
Ava, where are you going?
I swear I won't let him.
What did you do to this tea?
Get out, don't hide.
Open the door, if you're a man.
Didn't I tell you that Abdel Rahman made peace with you?
Alright, I swear if he doesn't relax, I'll demolish his room.
Your brother
This talk is not reasonable.
Your brother is as skilled as Maher.
I'll take a look, these are...
On his head
Silence, silence, stop! You guys, they have no honor, they're hitting each other.
You're behaving like little children, cut it out, son!
I swear to show you.
He found his trousers, he found his trousers, oh my son, what a big cat!
Blood, mother
You scared me with your screaming.
Oh God
Leave us alone.
What a pity.
Even though I brought you together.
She won't leave you.
When he brought them at night to gather them.
Keep going, my daughter!
You coward.
Inshallah
He speaks well.
But, oh! Girls
May God guide you.
Show them calmness.
Oh my daughters, do not stir up strife and controversy among them.
What happened? I hope it's good.
Oh Abdurrahman, you've disappointed me!
I wanted you to help me, not do the same thing.
You are the wise brother, O my son, may God guide you!
Two consecutive strikes.
Tighten your arm.
You've disappointed us, may God guide you.
Our happy neighbor is laughing at you.
Oh boss, we've told him many times.
Don't lie, boss.
They were throwing stones, both of them, the two together.
Insistent
Don't do it.
Trust me, I've seen them *from my window*.
Did you hear his voice?
This is too far.
My brother was right when he said it was true.
You stated that your children would not repeat that again, I apologize.
Thank you, thank you.
Welcome, my brother, welcome.
Al-Rassi, how will you make them free? I'm sure, believe me.
Listen to me.
I didn't want to say that in front of them.
Abdulrahman, the eldest brother
Is he the assistant agent?
The middle one is the head of a government agency.
Take a Panadol, lie down and rest.
Panadol! Grab it!
Do you have any Panadol tablets here?
God suffices him.
God suffices him.
God suffices him, he tired me out.
What is this? What %pw?
Oh no, he threw it so far!
This is a man's hand, it looks like his father's.
Do you believe?
He always acts as if he comes from a distinguished family, treating others with kindness and politeness.
And that's because I come from a poor family.
Alright, bro.
This follows you.
He never takes his eyes off you.
And you're yelling at me.
And you say you didn't have a chance.
When you walked by, she looked at you. What does that mean?
Oh wow, this is my destiny!
You turned your head, and she turned her head, at the same time.
No, but there's something.
I notice when you enter.
You feel she's happy, from the bottom of her heart.
My husband, my husband, my husband, my husband, my husband.
Give me your notebook.
I don't know her name, can you believe it?
Romantic, more than she should be.
Dude, we're in the 21st century.
You're adding a lot of failure.
Frankly
We haven't sat and eaten and talked like this in a long time.
No, this is good news.
From now on, I'll have more time to sit with you.
Okay, now go and rest yourself.
Especially after the outdoor photoshoot in the desert yesterday.
We were tired, my horses, I told the secretary that I didn't want any press or TV interviews, nor contracts.
I want to spend some time with my family.
God bless you.
Even if you're busy,
The first thing that came to my mind
Bend his number, I'll finish him off today.
What are you late for?
The villa has already been sold, and the sellers moved out a few days ago.
I was busy with series and filming.
Umm Abdul Aziz says they are poor and...
This is what God has decreed, you won't interfere in this.
Good morning, uncle.
What's up?
This car, my son, stops from time to time.
It seems like it's the battery.
Okay, no problem, nothing to worry about, I have a charger and I'll charge it for you.
May God grant you from His bounty.
Oh uncle, at what time?
Peace be upon you
Walid is right.
Okay, tomorrow I'll start looking for a nearby villa so I can visit you every day.
What do you want now?
Okay, that's enough.
Take it.
What's your full name?
Rashed Abdullah
The same name?
I said that to make you cry.
Your mom is right.
I was so happy to find out that Rashid Abdullah, my favorite actor, is our neighbor.
Everyone loves him.
They say he is kind and well-mannered.
The neighbor before the house.
I want to take a picture with him.
So my colleagues will believe me.
They think our house is very close to the actor Raed Abdullah's house.
Speak with him, so that he believes.
Oh life!
The one we used to see on TV.
And we hope to see him.
Our neighbor, praise be to God, praise be to God, oh God!
If they need a navigation ship, I have one.
I'm happy to help, but guys, be nice to me, I'm still not liking it very much.
I heard about this topic.
He was very kind to him, may God bless him with good.
Peace be upon you
Is it true that it has been confirmed that some employees will be transferred to the institution's new branch in Dakhla?
Did they tell you who was moving?
I didn't hear the name.
But, what I heard and I'm sure of it.
Is Abu Ali among them?
My name!
But, we don't know exactly who will move them.
I can't, I have no strength, may God have mercy on you, the smoke is too far from me, I can't.
Whether you can or you can't, it's a job, my friend.
The committee is still thinking about the matter.
But if they chose you.
Thank you for your visit, ya Abu Waleed! Take this.
Thank you, thank you, Bou Ali!
"We seek your forgiveness, the furniture is old."
I'm your neighbour today.
We're like family.
That's very kind of you, Abu Walid!
May Allah bless you with the best of blessings, Abu al-Waleed!
I've seen a lot of your kindness.
God preserves these dreams forever.
Enough, girl! My daughter!
I'm ready to walk the market for you until you find the most wonderful and expensive furniture that suits you.
When? To be honest, our furniture is very old.
We need to change it.
Inshallah
I've told you this before.
If you need anything
Consider me your sister.
"God willing, he won't be angry with you."
When will you come, my beloved?
I forgot to call her back when she called me the day before yesterday.
Not because you're looking for yourself.
Walking
You'll call me later, goodbye.
In fact, I was talking to her.
But these people are different from us.
They are rich, and we are nothing compared to them.
Mom, there's nothing to worry about.
Waiting for you a bit.
Waiting for you a bit.
And I'll put the light of the moon for you to propose to me.
I told you.
No, Mom, it's fine.
And you'll keep asking me to suggest things to you.
I found the meal in the living room.
If you want to have dinner.
Driving is what's going to take me to university now, God willing.
Didn't we agree that we're family?
Is this your car, brother?
And God willing.
I fixed it for her so I could thank her.
O people of goodness, lovers of charity
You're right, Dad!
Even our relatives didn't do that for us.
Sure! Is my name on the list?
Are you sure?
Oh dear, why do problems follow us?
I don't know, I don't know right now, after hearing this news, what can I do? I don't know.
Come on, come on, come on, go now, okay, okay, thank you, may God bless you and make you happy, may God bless you and make you happy.
What happened, Abu Ali!
The committee met today.
And a list of the names of the people who will be transferred to Dukhan.
My name is mentioned.
Talk to the manager to get your name removed.
What's the use, oh! Mother of Ali, what's the use.
I saw him, he said it's impossible.
Famous actor
Think that your name was never on the list.
May Allah accept it from you, many thanks, Abu Salem!
If you don't go now.
I want to take a picture with you to show my children.
My children will be happy.
May God compensate them with something better.
Can I take a picture with you, the actor?
Sure, may God accept from you.
Come on, let's go.
Sure, I'm happy to help.
You and everyone you love
Let me know a day or two in advance.
Oh mother, be ready.
Ready? Ready for what?
You're crazy, what happened to you?
She said: "I don't have a problem."
Let his mother come.
Go to them.
Oh, my God! My son.
They might feel we're poor people.
You have to be elegant.
I don't have any nice dresses.
You've put me in a bind.
Why are you taking out all these jewels? I've never seen you do that before.
Never
For my uncle Ali
Umm Ali is marrying off her son.
She wants modern clothes and luxurious jewelry.
She wants to show them that they are rich and powerful.
Oh God!
How lucky she is!
God help you, is this my wife? She's taller and more curvy.
"God willing, listen."
You are a queen, God willing, a queen.
You also need to be prepared.
It's just that you meet his father.
I'm sure I won't wear this outfit.
When I come with my new look
Mom, be careful with her things.
That's very kind of her, Uncle, since she brought you her thing, so use it carefully.
Ah, ah
Okay, you need to be like them.
Why didn't his mother go to suggest it to him?
It was meant for mirrors.
I have to go meet the group.
May God guide you.
"Only the cloak is left, may God have mercy on you."
Oh people of good, help me.
They were happy, and the bisht is what remains.
I want to rent it from you to complete the look.
Everyone is standing for you.
Oh, but my brother Rashid, should I empty it like that, or should I protect it?
No, look, first.
You need to hit the button.
Choked
The cloak (male garment) is loose, but
God bless you.
The left hand should be...
The right hand is licensed, likewise.
You're wearing the lower dishdasha.
Wow, wow
What a beauty!
Your steps need to slow down a bit.
Hey! Yes, password.
The blacksmith now looks like a millionaire.
We can't find you, okay, just a second.
Look, put your left hand, like this, the left one, this is the way.
Meet my friend, Aisha?
What's in it?
Do you know what she was telling me today?
She told me, "Because you're my friend, and I don't want us to lose each other."
With regret, I will ask my sisters to marry you.
Tell your friend not to ask for his brother and stop bothering himself and her as well.
Many people are leaving you now. A few days ago, you told me Saud wanted it for her aunt, and today she wants it for her work.
They want to take my girlfriend.
And I'm sitting and watching.
Don't you understand me?
No, they only know we're colleagues.
Okay, then.
From tomorrow, they need to know.
Why did Wild refuse?
I am crying.
You're back to your old ways.
The actors are more honest than you, hypocrites!
But you,
You do your job throughout your entire life.
It reflects you.
To serve people
Deceives people
Adorn yourself with fine clothing in life, before all people.
I was wearing a bisht while playing on TV.
You or me?
You wore accessories, gold and jewelry.
Played
"That they married"
What scene?
A man walking in front of his wife.
He wears his headscarf covering the sides of his face.
It doesn't move when it's dead, neither right nor left.
He masturbates to your friend, the one you were talking about, who works with you in the same office.
Is he with a girl and a boy?
Why are you walking like that?
As they said.
"God willing, He will protect him, man!"
Walking
He has no personality whatsoever.
He's laughing, he's happy!
Show us the city center, please.
What, what, what, what, you don't look good sitting like that.
You look better when you wake up, when you stand, stand, stand.
Oh Thursday, I ask your permission.
What's up? Are you going to the capital?
Come on, I want to talk to you.
"What do you say we go get a drink?"
His wife upsets him.
Do you like it this way?
Oh, Thursday!
I run it, and if the host is female
I change the channel because I'm afraid it will get me into trouble.
I swear to God I'm at work.
I'm sitting with Salem, my coworker.
Talk to her.
Hand me the phone, take it, take it.
She took away her phone, now she's giving me anxiety.
Now you're saying you allowed her to talk to you because there's a woman with us.
Now you can throw me out of the house.
We found you!
You're not the first one to get divorced.
No, no, no, I won't be able to, brother!
I don't want to bother my mother in her grave.
You trusted me.
She said, "Don't separate."
What, what, what, not possible, impossible
Are you looking for something?
No, no, no, %pw remaining, remaining
You're completely crazy.
Don't ruin me.
Tell me, I want to know what's wrong.
Oh, oh, oh, Mother, don't say that about him.
Salem is particularly one of the best men in our country.
It's your duty to get a divorce.
If he asked me for a divorce, would I be stupid to agree? That's not normal.
Thursday, I stayed officially crazy.
Leave me, leave me, please.
I was talking to him, alone.
May God guide you.
The poor man breaks my heart.
I want to give him an important message from the consultation place.
I wish you would give it to her, God guide you.
No, nothing, nothing
It's for me, I'll take it to him.
This is about the refugee situation with the women's deposit tomorrow.
A women's delegation
What happened to you! Aren't you going to sleep today?
O Salem
I am your brother, Khamis.
No, I'm talking to you seriously and consciously.
O tree
Don't call my name, so I won't come.
How can we delete your name?
The one who is able to remove your name is our minister, with his authority.
There's a meeting at the ministry.
Official meeting
Who are you talking to?
Hello Hello Hello
Speak the truth.
Who is the girl you were talking to?
Safety, safety, peace, I swear to God that he is safe.
If I were talking to Salem
Shall we talk?
This lying doesn't work.
Don't talk, Thursday!
Are you telling the truth!
You're wearing casual clothes.
I thought I was talking to a woman.
Oh, wretched life!
God bless you, please call Salam.
Please, believe me.
She asked him to call you.
"Make do, it's fine."
Don't meddle in other people's affairs, or you'll be doing something unpleasant.
And she complains about you.
I wonder? You?
How can you live with a woman who treats you like that?
Let's start the meeting now.
Hassan went to talk to Khamis.
Okay, let's talk about the real estate budget first.
Let's start
Oh God, let him find it.
His friend rested when he saw the permit.
You surprised every ministry and you're hidden here.
Come on, come on, people are waiting for you in the meeting room.
I can't sit with the ladies.
Oh Thursday, how does your wife know?
I'm afraid she's calling.
Oh God, you're making her suspect me, don't you understand?
If I don't answer her call, how will I get home?
Do you marry your phone?
Of course, since your company is large.
This project, which will be implemented by your company for our ministry
This is one of the largest projects in the history of our ministry.
Guys, what's making the table move like that?
No, old, that's not the table, that's me.
Can you answer your call?
Who is this?
Sorry, who do you want to talk to?
These are my mobile numbers, %pw
Hey, wait, wait.
He was afraid to go back to his home.
Her brother brought
He told him that his mother said: "Don't come to your house unless you tell me about your work and you are not with a woman."
That's what made him send a letter to the ministry to transfer from our department.
Exactly, the minister himself told me he approves of it. What does he want?
What's wrong with him and his wife?
This is madness.
I ask him, "Who are you talking to?"
I told you it's Zim.
What's he going to do! Your wife and kids are coming back tomorrow.
I don't know what to do.
Since you did what she wanted, why are you afraid to go home and see your children?
She wants an official rehearsal.
Okay, give her the papers.
Okay, that's what I did, I sent the paper with her brother.
Until you see the minister's signature and confirm it.
And God willing, we'll agree. If we agree, God willing, I'll be back home tonight.
Sister, this is the minister's signature.
What else do you want to know?
Work in the new department will start tomorrow.
Which means office and work, not what he used to do in the past.
Where is this section, please?
Yes, God bless you, this is the minister.
Okay, okay, that's it, on your right.
Yes, boy, may God accept from you.
Welcome, your office is ready.
Saad and Abdul Qadir, God willing, this is a big office, yes.
Goodbye
How do you ask about transportation?
The whole department is women.
I am content with my marriage.
No one can enforce another decision except the minister himself.
You have to work until the minister returns.
Oh mercy, make a deal with your colleagues.
Count them in the name of male names, so that your wife may not know.
And I added two more branches for the new employee.
The new employee is a male employee.
A few days ago, the minister's office sent someone to work with us.
Are you serious?
This is a strange sight, poor guy, a man working with five or six women, this is a strange sight.
He understands that his wife gets very jealous of any women around him.
Blind jealousy
Oh man, he needs it.
He just asked us to stay silent when his wife calls, we complied and didn't speak.
Oh Abdelkader, who's with you in the office?
What size is this? Is it suitable for you?
My son called, he said his wife is going to the office.
What are you doing?
If you're coming from the street, it's the first floor on your right.
This is in the welfare office.
With the five of us
Ten employees
And this here, I'm sure he came to work.
Those lies don't work on me.
My wife gets jealous of other girls around me.
Because I'm kind.
God guide you, Sultan!
But we want to know what stage we've reached.
Oh uncle, the ambassador and I were at the bank yesterday.
that the project
Peace be upon you
Oh brother, I have an important meeting at work today.
Get out of the kitchen quickly.
I'm dressed and getting ready to go.
In fact, your place is the kitchen.
A woman must obey her husband.
And the pomegranate tree hurts.
This is important for rain, look look
Oh, uncle!
Aisa, please contact the manager and ask him to inform the staff.
The meeting is rescheduled for tomorrow.
Please let it not be something serious.
They are constantly giving orders.
And it's necessary to apply
He must make me understand.
And he has many responsibilities and obligations.
They treat women like servants.
I've never seen anyone hate mirrors as much as these people do.
Do you think you're living in what year?
They asked me not to go to work today and instead go to the kitchen to make tea.
Where is the maid?
And the other one fled a few weeks ago.
Even the maid couldn't bear that insult.
I understand them.
God bless you.
There are few coins.
Tea
Oh man, they mean that.
In fact, a villa complex is worthless without a parking lot.
Okay, now the park.
Sister, before you go, I want to talk to you about something.
Oh my darling, Fatoum, I have to go, I'm late.
Okay, tell me, what do you have?
"I'm going" or "I'll go"
And they play it in schools.
A committee, from the Women's Union, came today.
And the school nominated me to be in the league.
Are you crazy?
And you want to go to the league?
You know if you tell your uncle and brother about this, you won't see anything good.
It's you who made the mistake.
I warned you.
Why don't you come and see me? I haven't seen you in a long time.
Today, a year, a year since I saw you.
Are you married yet?
"May God guide you."
Who would agree to marry a man who is not educated and has no job?
Okay, okay, okay, it doesn't matter if he didn't study, he's a man.
And Khamis is the son of the hawk's wolves.
A spider's bite is painful.
They also need to marry someone of the same social status.
Like this spider.
God help you.
Aisha, what are you doing?
Ever since the minister has been away, all the newspapers have been coming to me.
And inform Mustafa, the head of the Department of Knowledge, that I want to meet with him tomorrow.
But the ministry's guests arrived today.
Do you have the schedule?
And now I am free to speak with you, Oisa!
Yes, Mary.
Okay, coming now.
Oh, Aisha!
My brothers are the source of all these problems.
I don't know what happened.
Okay, my love, ice packs are necessary so your face doesn't swell.
Why don't we tell them about it?
She went to them, they beat her.
Do you think they'll believe it if I tell them this is a soccer ball?
They were the ones who have been misleading you for a long time.
Oh, you're upset, you play football!
Next time, we're going to break your neck.
Who are you talking to?
The big locust
That little one
Oh uncle, I've only won the pyramid for the sultan.
Did you hear this news?
I chose economics and politics.
I called you because you're needed right now.
Architecture!
What is your role?
You had a chance.
Eat more.
Okay, spider.
Listen, listen, listen, listen
Let her suffer.
This is with me.
Head towards future accolades.
And the mark of construction engineering.
Take your time.
To make sure
I spoke with Sultan and Saqir.
No problem if you marry Munira.
What else do you want?
Oh, our son Khamis deserves all the best.
I'll arrange a meeting with them and let you know.
Your suggestion to join the delegation.
I appreciate your personal circumstances.
Just take a moment to think about it until tomorrow.
Frankly,
They express a lot of interest in you.
And your nomination from the minister.
It's correct.
I know my brothers very well.
They never please him.
I am shocked.
Their car payment is a chunk of my salary.
I'm house-sitting.
And she wants me to accompany her too.
Aren't we going to propose to her in a few days?
What are you saying?
Stupid Thursday, he doesn't even have a school certificate.
It thins and travels with him.
Okay, let's go.
This is ugly.
They were going to kill her if she refused.
My son, I've told you many times, it's very good.
Why don't you go?
Tomorrow, with the spirit of tomorrow.
Okay, as long as he's Son of Falcon.
Appearance doesn't matter.
I won't be with Khamis.
And walk to the kitchen.
Put it in the living room.
The match between Madrid and Barcelona tonight.
Oh God, don't let Valencia come and defeat us.
My sources are reliable.
She works and prays, and does her job well.
What do you think about this?
What do you want me to do?
We have to go.
Please go to your workplaces.
Thank you, may God grant you a long life.
Longevity
Serve tea there.
Her thighs.
May God give you health and strength.
Welcome, may God grant you a long life.
Good evening, Your Excellency.
Yes, God grant you a long life.
Have you washed the coffee cups?
Drink coffee for the coach's manager, Imad.
And also
We'll buy a toy in China after tomorrow.
Oh captain, I forgot to introduce you to my sister Mary.
I'm going to the official engagement party.
Do you deserve it?
You don't understand anything about life, and you want to marry a minister.
Say hello to %pw.
Yes, ma'am.
Empty it and make a new one.
Actors demand
I wonder, did Mashal also want me a moment ago?
What can I say?
Alas, Nofi's role doesn't suit Mashal.
Nouf is a sixteen-year-old girl.
And Mary, her delivery was as if she was in her ninth month.
Okay, why doesn't Mary take the role?
Suits her more.
We provide
We need to get rid of the person who is specialized on the committee.
It's difficult, he's not going to let it go easily.
He is precise.
He will talk about art, family values, moral art, content, etc.
Who chose him in this committee?
The minister is the one who established the committee.
Our three selves, you, Hamed, and I, can influence him.
Impossible, impossible, impossible.
"What's he doing following us?"
Even if he were to ask at the Ministry of Economy,
We won't see our names.
The company is registered in the name of Hamid's wife, may God accept it from you.
Don't be afraid of that.
No problem, frankly, who is the committee's president?
The last word is mine.
Alright, alright, everything's fine, come in.
I didn't remember and agreed with him on everything.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, Rashid. Come in.
Note that this meeting is specifically to decide whether we will approve the series "Exploitation of Conscience" or not.
And it is the production of a modern touch institution.
This is a nice, strange, and brave action series.
I agree with Hamad.
The story of the series is very nice.
I agree with you.
I loved when she took the weapon and killed her neighbor.
And hiding the weapon, I put it in the car.
And I didn't know he was her son, that's intriguing, and when the police came
And her sons come home from school.
And throw the box.
What broke her and flew in her bag.
Here's the surprise.
This part of the box goes into the mother's room.
And it's good that a local company is producing at this level.
We need to support and make them happy.
Mr. Rashid, you didn't tell me your opinion.
You left me nothing to say.
With all due respect to your opinions and reflections on this series "Extracting Conscience".
Exploitation of human values
Unpleasant surprise news
Each episode features half of two people.
The rest is for the next episode.
This series is written without a protagonist.
What takes a moral message that helps society progress.
Tears flow, why should they make the viewers cry?
Professor Rashid
You gave us your opinion, and Ali gave us his, and let's hear Mr. Rashid's opinion.
It is clear from the meeting.
That there is an agreement between you
You're the organizer.
Some people understand it and it's their field, while others have nothing to do with it.
I oppose this series.
I'm afraid he's going to get us into trouble.
Don't forget it.
What he can do, he doesn't know how to do anything.
I tried to work, but I saw.
He handed me the bag and said, "This is from Mrs. Samira."
I don't know what to do.
I don't believe it! Nasser!
This is for a new series we're going to make soon.
The one who keeps raping the girl while driving the car.
For the blessings we received because of him.
The first blessing is the beautiful ring on your hand.
I want to tell you how
They introduce you as Hamid's wife who sent you the ring.
And your husband's role was to cover their backs.
He owns a five percent share of the production.
This is sweet.
You remind me of a character I've played before. Haven't you seen "Lost Dreams"?
"This is the best"
They call it "coercion system" or something like that, I don't remember exactly.
Oh, extorting dreams
Why do all the names sound the same?
The previous series were all about girls.
You notice that every series has more than eight or even ten girls.
Your role is secured.
You are very beloved.
How lucky you are!
Yes, Omar.
Okay, no problem.
Oh my darling, I'm sorry, I have to go to work. I don't know what happened there.
Eat and walk.
He said he wanted to see me for a very important matter and urgently.
I have to go.
I heard that Al-Rashed met with the minister.
He had half an hour left.
And you said to him that you would bother him.
I told you it's a complaint from us to the ministry.
The situation is that the minister's office called and they want me to meet with them.
I'm also afraid the minister will believe him.
I will meet with the minister.
The man came to clarify his viewpoint concerning the series.
This is all.
This is true, may God grant you a long life.
But first, Your Excellency, I would like to say that it is unacceptable to talk about a colleague behind their back.
Everyone knows that Rashid is
He gets angry with everyone around him.
A cunning person is only interested in material gain.
But this is his specialty.
But, God bless you, no one who is uneducated can deal with these technical matters.
Special Television Productions
Extracting the pronoun, the series we're working on.
This is a big production.
We will have a media initiative at the Gulf level.
Strong distribution
Of course, it's your specialty. You know more about this subject than I do.
I promise you an amazing series.
This will protect our reputation.
See what the journalist Abdulhadi wrote, listen listen.
Also, one of the actors said
That the sequence promotes unethical ideas.
This is constrained by morality.
This is a really bold and powerful comment.
They'll be in big trouble if journalist Abdulhadi keeps writing about them.
And those who hold them accountable know him.
But they are sharp, they know how to handle her.
They're a grunge band.
We need to create our own website.
And we place all the activities of our company on it.
What's the name of the company again?
From now on, you are the media advisor.
Conscience Series
A Quantum Leap in Arabic Drama
Because he carries ideas and moral values.
This is a series that aims to develop society.
It's the same journalist who criticized them a few days ago.
Is it possible for his opinion on the contradictory topic to change?
How could he accept this?
Journalist Abdulhadi and others like him
Alright, Mr. Hamed, don't worry.
He said: "What do you think of the series?" I told him it would be the best series in the Arab world.
Oh God!
I feel like this series is going to be really awesome.
I don't understand where he is.
One is being done, and the other is ready for download.
The start-up project is not anything.
Your stories are always unrealistic, and the events didn't actually happen.
It's clear at first glance.
Your writing is nonsense.
Delete
Your necklace is stupid, ridiculous.
What's your opinion?
This is very tragic.
Other bad movies are no excuse.
With my hands, I won't be able to produce this from the first attempt.
These are hidden lines and dimensions, and they need someone to focus to discover them.
Look, this is political drama.
What a pity he's free.
What's up?
Okay, I haven't been this nervous today.
Ali and I were at Souq Waqif yesterday.
I was at a café.
My soul is exhausted.
Nasser, what do you think about what happened? If the minister is upset, that's a big problem.
In one week, we're all going to get fired from our jobs.
I wonder if the series is a failure; everyone who watched it said it was a failure.
I heard that Al-Rashed is going to visit his friends.
And tell him that the series is a failure and there's no action in it.
This is a disaster.
Leave it to me.
Let's see what Nasser will do.
Listen up! Me!
From now on, I don't want any criticism on your page for the series.
To me, please.
A few days ago, I saw an article that not only criticized their production, but also shouted at them.
Don't make me angry.
I'm sorry.
On that day, you were going out.
I never trust them to write like that.
But honestly, I didn't receive any appreciation message.
Once again, a great success.
Goodbye
Rashid's brother
Should I believe you or the newspapers?
The Evacuation Conscience is the best television production.
May God grant you a long life, they have an agreement.
Listen to what the other newspaper wrote.
Do they also have an agreement with the viewers' page?
I almost had a heart attack.
At some point, they told me.
Praise be to God, the minister is happy.
Frankly, Nasser,
Get ready to watch the extraction of the second person's conscience.
No, no, no, no, enough! Brother,
Serial number, he said he wouldn't write it again.
He prefers to stay in his depressing job.
After all these problems, a second part.
Third and fourth violin
What happened to you? Don't you want to benefit?
He turned away from his friends to tell me secretly
Here I am
What can a magician do?
May God guide you and make you one of the truthful.
I wish you would tell us your opinion on this matter.
God grants us health for this success.
The doubters and enemies of our success
I see strange.
This series won awards and she failed.
But they are the experts.
They are given awards for it, they must see what we don't see.
Prepare the second part of the series.
Alright, may God grant you a long life.
A real magician.
You see, "extracting a conscience" is
I saw you talking to the minister at the beginning of the event.
Do TV festivals lie too!
I heard them say they're ready for the rest of the part.
It's the same thing.
They are transported to the bank to be washed and become clean.
All the weak, absurd, and immoral series you watch.
Their house is chosen for Arab and Gulf celebrations.
To clean it, to award it, so that people think of it as first-class.
Yes, that's correct.
Until when will the judges be their product?
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, praise be to God that you have arrived.
The situation is correct, we signed a contract with them, but they want to reduce the prices.
Come to my office.
We are not a small bakery or a bread shop.
We are one of the largest bread companies in the world.
We won't lower it.
Otherwise, we will cancel the contract.
We found a contract yesterday already.
With the British company.
Cup of coffee and a croissant.
So that you love
He did a fantastic job.
He is the first one in the world to do that production.
It's not just the best bakery in the world.
I want to tell you
How can bread have a zipper?
Open it with your hand or go to the kitchen and look for a knife to cut it, and you might cut your hand.
Okay, make some bread with yeast.
To sprinkle thyme and cover it again.
This is not bread, it's a pair of pants.
Okay, what do you think? It's just a bread bag.
How can we unzip this?
If that's the case, he can tell his friend: "I ate double clips."
Why didn't the Light Mountains cake from Bethospital arrive today?
I know, but why didn't you call me for a few days?
The bread that bakers make.
Once again, he used the bakers.
That's what happened, sir.
Why are you yelling at him for no reason?
You're wasting your time on football and delaying my work.
Do you know that your son loves football?
Alright, no problem if he takes a few employees from the company to have fun.
You have four hundred employees in the company.
Top ten player names
Four substitute players, two administrative assistants, that's all, just seventeen.
And the team's spokesperson
Why are you upset with him?
But it's okay for now, although the audience are the most important players on the field and they are the 12th player.
Let him play with them.
And we've already signed a contract with the people.
When he first told you he wanted to play football.
I heard you.
He didn't do anything.
What you envy is just that he had employees play soccer in front of him for his enjoyment.
I told him he couldn't take a few employees.
Even if only a few of your friends are hiring, you could give him a job.
Important bakers
My son, why are you taking the important bakers? That's not possible.
Next time, inform me before you hire any staff.
Okay, let's have Hamdy do these things with paper.
He is in the hospital.
Why, didn't they tell you?
I finished my work, and I walked to my car.
Nasser called me.
I went to him.
He said they didn't know where the goalkeeper was and they had an important match today.
He said, "Find us a goalkeeper, then we'll go to the stadium."
Goalkeeper's outfit
I don't play soccer, I've never kicked a ball in my life.
That's the situation.
This is nonsense.
And we'll find you a job instead of wasting your time on football.
Keep listening to me.
Dad, you want me to keep pushing and asking the team, right?
Yes, that's right.
Oh father, please, I beg you.
I can't pull the team out, the final is tomorrow.
Okay, okay, okay, you're right.
Do you agree?
Congratulations on the win.
Congratulations, Mr. Nasser, on winning the cup.
I wish I knew how you planned to win.
See, I've prepared the team psychologically, physically, and mentally, and the coach has done a great job.
At the hotel
Congratulations to you all, and there will be a party, as promised.
Your father looks happy.
I'm afraid he might be nice and easy to deal with.
Uncle Abu Nasser, first of all, I'd like to congratulate you on the great victory of your team, the International Bread Guardians.
For this tremendous success
God bless you, no, no, no.
No picture without a dishdasha (traditional Arab men's robe), wait, wait, lift it up.
No, no
He is wearing the bisht.
Your attention, your care, and your creative ideas played a big role in this success, for sure.
And the coach's plan.
But, they played 5-5-3-2 in the finals.
And as an athlete, you know that changing the board plan disorients players, yet Baker's team was not disoriented and they did a great job.
And the coach's plan.
Bo Nasser, as the first athlete in the international team of Al-Makhbaz, what do you suggest the players do?
To infinity
Welcome
Longevity
Is Mr./Uncle/Guest Hamoud Sultan with them?
They can come, but they must have dinner with us first.
Eat, perfect!
Thank you, Abu Abdel Aziz!
And it is considered a contribution to the private sector.
The band is still small.
Don't embarrass me.
No, who?
Bu Abdulaziz
The representative for the motors we use in the factory.
Seeing again
I've wanted to know him for a long time.
The ball is what introduced us, I told him so.
I said to him, "O Abu Abdulaziz!"
I've never been interested in football throughout my life.
What does it have to do with you?
The ball was always close to me, there was only 50 cm between us.
Has Abu Nasser not arrived yet?
No, he didn't bring it today either.
There's a conference on football injuries. He's the golden sponsor. He has to be present.
You'll find more.
Did you see the building behind the bakery that he wanted to turn into a hotel for workers?
He is obsessed with the Earth.
As usual, we tend to meet and interview a prominent figure in the field of sports.
This person inspires the bakery team with their great ideas.
What's your opinion on the International Bakery Team? We heard you're doing a complete overhaul.
In contrast to offices, all efforts.
This is a small amount, but a million dollars for all that we've done.
No man, be generous.
It's not your fault, brother of the falcon.
My mistake.
What did I do wrong?
You told me you needed players from the Gulf countries.
Prices in the Gulf are the best ever.
Which means if a player spins a value of two thousand.
For the yield, it costs three or four million dollars.
I don't understand, explain this to me.
Receive my fax from here
And read it before my eyes when you have it.
My father bought four new players for the team, in addition to a new batch of four players.
I wonder, is he an artist, can he easily beat Billy and Ronaldo?
But eight hundred thousand is written on it.
Oh, that's right, God bless you, but Turkish Club set this price.
In the UAE, they sell it for 1.1 million.
Don't look at me.
Okay, can we see the material?
Here
Thigh, leg
Okay, fine.
Okay, okay, okay, I assure you.
It's open, thank God, it's good that it's open.
This is a smooth one, good for the center.
The muscle connection
This is the most important muscle; there is no use in a player without it.
Thank you
Let the driver take them to Nobel Automatic, Automatic, Shift I said! Automatic
Why?
Hamdi, let's go.
Congratulations, congratulations
These, God bless you, are young players.
Oh, we get them from the forests of Africa.
We raise and feed them, then release them into the wild.
I'm at your service, you can take it. Do you have a place for it or should I bring it by car?
When they saw us pressing on them.
Ask the offensive player to play.
As if I were an angel of fat, no.
Ask the defender to play.
Kajmakani Lulu Lulu was supposed to play.
He is a beginner coach.
Even if it were on Mars.
Spain! Even if it's trained on Mars.
I don't like the way he plays the game.
This has to be on the north road.
There are rules to the game.
Even if it's just two days.
What's happening? Why are you screaming, man?
Oh my foolish son
Not sure the coach is an expert in football.
Hear her, she speaks like a child.
And he knows that the infiltrating player, Selulu Tekawa, is a good central player, as Ahmed Al-Otaiba said.
No one will make you sad.
Don't wait.
I know how to deal with him.
Why did the team lose the game?
The team is reluctant to change the plan.
Because the players are not playing in their positions.
And if the player is completely out of position, he should be moved back to his usual place.
Ask the coach to change...
"Use my wealth wisely."
Okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay, what's happening at the stadium?
This wasn't supposed to happen to her.
The coach shouldn't do that.
Please defer these matters until the end of the game.
People are deceiving, this happens in front of the camera.
Fourth goal for Team Success, the ball entered the goal area.
He scored the fourth goal, he is the star of the match today.
This device has no taste.
He said, "Uncle Nasser, the team doesn't need a coach more than this."
Wind, silence*
I'm controlling the game on TV, and you'll be the reserve, doing what I tell you.
Okay, don't do that, it's not good.
We need soccer players tomorrow. How can we play without a coach?
What does your father do?
Oh man! Enough! Rashid
What happened to you? You made me sad, tell me what happened to you?
"Nothing separates me from myself, O Mother, except myself."
"I divorced you! How are you?"
I don't know, Mama, I don't know.
Why did you divorce him? You were only married for two months.
Oh my God, mother, I don't know, I don't know.
He left you for reasons beyond measure!
Yes, Mother, yes.
Oh my God, mother, I don't know, suddenly he brought it up and told me, "Go back to your family's house."
I asked him, "Why did you say that?" He replied, "You're divorced."
I swear to God, I don't know what's happening?
They were only married for one month. What are people going to say about us?
I agree with you.
I don't know how to speak.
I know it's just her divorcing you now.
I'll be back in a minute.
Because of her high morals.
She cursed Barcelona.
My eyes, Abdullah.
Jaili cried.
He said she had disrespected Barcelona, and that he was very attached to this team and respected it.
She hurt him with her words and wounded his feelings.
He told me, "Mummy insulted Barcelona," and I said to him, "Divorce her, and I will find you other corners."
His saying that your daughter is divorced because she mistreated the Barcelona team.
Just because of that, you divorced her? Are you serious?
Alright, bro.
Is it easy to hurt someone's feelings?
A wife stabs her husband in the back.
I can't believe what I'm hearing!
Okay, we don't need a girl who doesn't respect international borders.
This time, she started laughing at Messi.
Problems between the couple occurred and we must...
Instead of one, there are a thousand girls.
The boys are many and they wish to marry one of them.
Listen to me.
I'm not going to listen to anything.
And please don't interfere. This is my son and I know him well.
I told you it's none of your business.
It's easy for you to say, but it will cause sadness.
Don't beat yourself up, son, and don't think about it.
Instead of one, there are a thousand girls.
Why are you upset!
But when I mention her name
Real Madrid is better than Barcelona.
My love, okay.
What happened to her!
Her name is Mona.
Was she married for one month?
If I told you her story and why she got divorced, you wouldn't be able to stop laughing.
"To involve you in it, we need your attention."
What do I care about a guy like him, divorcing his wife for a football team.
Salwandy knows them and told me the whole story. Mother, don't involve me in this, I don't want to be associated with someone like that.
That's all, you're listening to the empty talk of beauty salons.
They say I didn't kiss.
Let her say her piece and express what she wants to say.
Money is coming to her.
I told her, "Daughter, don't stop your luck."
If it were just her money, I wouldn't care at all.
But it will stop our luck and our luck with her.
This building
My past is not my right.
God is sufficient for whoever wears these shoes badly.
They always hear rumors and spread them.
Don't listen to her.
Tell her and let her understand that if she doesn't lock the door, the one that provides us with sustenance will open.
He can persuade her.
You're joking, right? Do you think he divorced his wife because of Barcelona?
Forget all this nonsense and don't mess up.
Don't miss the opportunity.
And perhaps she was the reason, or something wrong in her driving led him to leave her.
My daughter! Listen, don't let Haj Abu Burjin slip through your fingers.
What's this, Abu Borgnan?
"But when they get closer, they'll discover it's a camera."
That's why they called his father Shahin Abu Burganin.
God have mercy on you.
Oh God, no, no, no. Sweet. Thank you. Thank you.
Yes, thank you. Please.
May God grant you a long life, your children have stolen your money, you signed and the money is gone.
Happily, you were unaware, and seemed to be very busy, that was a month ago.
The first marriage was a month ago, it's a new marriage, they got divorced.
He was also married, and the marriage was annulled.
Oh, this is his third book.
And that's the story, my friend, be a little kinder.
Oh God! This generation is very difficult.
Opinion and Counter-Opinion
Congratulations, congratulations to you! Oh, my daughter.
Daughter, be careful with your fur, I put it on top of the bag.
So you can take it with you when you're on the plane.
When you arrive in Britain
Oh son, don't you want to go to London?
Mama
Okay, fine.
So she can come with us and buy things.
Malaysia, Malaysia.
Malaysia, take the fur with you.
I said goodbye to my mother.
What happened to her?
I don't know.
She's a good artist, and I don't know about you.
Oh my daughter, what's happening?
I did what was right, I started leaving her alone.
It's something.
On your honeymoon, you should support each other as much as you can.
Is it logical that she's sitting while you're pouring the water?
And the glass is beside you, you don't have to move it, and it allows you to drink.
He wasn't well brought up.
You shouldn't tell her that, because since I was born, I've only drunk water from my mother's hand.
What happened to her?
She claims to be very sad.
And who is this lady everyone is with?
Her name is Michelle.
Oh, what a pity, she applied for a leave of absence for her wedding.
Won't you believe me if I tell you her story?
God bless you, auntie, thank you.
My aunt and my cousin also ask.
Oh man, I just don't know the place my mom booked for us?
Mom, peace be upon you.
When will you perform the pilgrimage for us?
Because she wants to go there with us.
"There is no power or strength except by Allah."
Why did he do that at the airport and why did he take the kids?
What happened between them?
You ask me, I don't know what happened between them!
This is bullshit.
Okay, where's Munira?
She's in her room talking to the wall.
Now she says she has been calling him for two days, but his phone is switched off.
I found it now.
Wait and let's see what he has.
How do you know he's upset? The boy is coming from outside, tired and wanting to relax.
Every day I tell my mother to peel the apples, but she doesn't do it. Every day she upsets me.
And you know I don't like apples with their skin on.
This doesn't wash the apple.
Hello, let me tell you
You are divorced.
And one by one, if necessary.
Oh God! Light of my eyes.
Oh God! Light of my eyes.
Monira, what did he say?
Why are you still sad?
Call him three times and tell him you're divorced.
Silence, please.
Mom, I don't know who saw me at the disco in Spain, tell him.
He has nothing to say.
Okay, he doesn't have anything to say.
She will leave twice or three times.
And those who harm my daughter will die.
How do I know you?
Evak, where are you going?
Where am I going? I'm going to vent my anger on this Baghdad guy.
It has a tail like a peacock.
A folded cloth with pearls, coral, gravel, and rubies.
And the other two girls are playing with you and your son.
They don't have children, and a mother who doesn't taste the bitterness in their mouth.
The one you're laughing at.
And let them go free as you please.
I didn't hold you back to calm down, you're complaining about Barcelona, change it and lose yourself in it.
Who went to Novotel?
Without shame and without embarrassment
Assistant agent, Arab and Muslim.
This besmirches his reputation and that of his entire Lebanese community.
Stick and don't move.
A little humanity.
This was my father's.
Who would sell land like this?
Abu Sakkar hit him hard on the cheeks.
Why did he sell it?
"God guide you, if Abu Sukkar wants something, who can say no?"
Leave it to God, friend.
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.
What's up, Abu Saad? What happened to your project?
As you know.
Okay, last week you told me you were going to the library?
I told you, if you want to work on your project, you need to start investing money in it.
Abu Sakkar, he's a big millionaire.
He doesn't live? No one in this world doesn't live?
This isn't a problem, Professor. We'll let him eat, make him feel indebted, and provide him with plenty of food. The issue is how we can reach him.
And you know the master key, so all the doors open for you.
I meet him/I meet him (or I meet him) during the Umrah pilgrimage, and I greet him more than once.
You don't need to know him as long as you pay him and keep him in your job, all you need to know is the right time.
When the secretary told me that Mr. Sugar was waiting for you at dinner.
I came right away.
Abu Sakkar, may God preserve him, has a determination every day.
Oh man, anyone.
I love hanging out and socializing with friends.
It's very nice to stay at this farm all night long.
Sir, this is Abu Nasser, the owner of the car dealership behind the mall.
He wants to test your generosity.
I got my license.
It's as if my son got the license.
Thank you, may God bless you.
Congratulations on your license, Sagar.
God bless you.
Abu Sakkar
I asked you not to disappoint me, say 'yes'.
I wish you would accept, O Great One.
A gift for him.
And please don't say no.
My work is going well.
That means you met him easily and talked to him.
Alright, you idiot.
Oh man, okay, Abu Nasser.
Tell me the method, what did you do?
Circumstances were in my favor.
When we were sitting by his side.
He just got his license.
I have a secret gift.
If this is about Arabic,
This is easy.
Come on, come on, take it from me.
Yes, it happened.
I went home from the hospital.
Tonsillectomy
He will definitely succeed.
You deserve your son's happiness, lady of honor!
Oh God, heal him, oh God, heal him, and God willing, he won't see any harm, and God willing, he won't see any harm.
And we met at the Rosarito's place.
I think so.
Alas! One starts to forget as life speeds by.
And they told me that your son Shahin was in the next room and he's gone now.
Okay, I thought I should visit you.
And congratulations on the health of the falcon.
Oh sir, you must not go without dining with us.
I don't want to / I didn't want to.
Just say 'yes' first.
Because our dear son Shahin was discharged from the hospital,
In my atom tower.
Just say "yes".
Son, don't move.
Oh mother, don't try, I don't like business and I have no interest in it.
Who can start a project now without money?
In a vehicles and destroyers office, he said: "Just let him point."
Love is from God, and people love you because of your love for your father.
Until university,
The tinsmiths loved your father and held him in high regard.
Many of them are in his office every night.
Whomever God is pleased with, your father is loved by everyone, you're just pouring dirt on him.
People take out loans from banks to build a company or a project.
Am I sitting in the supermarket?
Have you opened a pickle shop?
This is something new as well.
This is sacred, the apple of my eye, he brought them to me today and said, "These are samples, try them."
He took their agency the day before yesterday.
Seeing again
He also told me that all businessmen are like me, may God make people like you.
Yes, sir.
I'm on my way to the office.
I saw a new supermarket.
They were preparing him.
Seriously, I love her.
I don't know who the owner is.
Congratulations, congratulations, oh! Oh, Uncle Sugar, congratulations!
God have mercy on you.
In the name of God, in the name of God
What makes him come as a partner and take her so easily?
You, you can now say no.
Okay, what's the problem?
What do I need to say?
Be his partner.
Don't you know who his father is?
The man is not imprisoning his father!
I told him I was my friend Qasim Abbas, and he asked me if I had experience in this job.
I said I have a bakery, praise God, I earn my livelihood from it.
No, no, I don't like the name.
I didn't walk on it.
Alright, buddy, the name isn't good.
This means the proper name for Iranian bread.
Okay, big bread.
Qasim, we'll tell him "big bread, the bakery of greatness."
Wait for me a bit.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you and the mercy and blessings of God, O Generous One/O Master/O Owner of Honor.
Excellent, excellent. Do you need anything or any assistance?
No, thank you. God bless us, everything is fine.
Yay, she's a new employee here!
Your Excellencies, she sold her car to the workshop but came to take mine because she is a brand ambassador for a marketing company and doesn't know how to do anything without a car.
You might also need your car.
No, I don't need the car today.
Okay, no problem.
This is the age of science, knowledge, and study.
I agree with Dr. Rashid, everyone needs to have sufficient knowledge in their field, regardless of what the field is.
Wow! Dr. Sami!
Yes, sir.
Study and study.
You're repeating what's in the books.
No study, no work, no economy.
He never reads a book or even a newspaper in his life. I've never seen him holding a piece of paper in his hand.
Come on, everyone knows it's my birthday today.
I didn't study this field, business and %pw only.
My uncle Abu Nasser is still alive in front of me now.
What pleases them.
But there are people who are born to work and love it by nature.
You're right, Doctor!
Oh Lord, oh Shahin, may he be as virtuous as his brother.
God is generous, O Lord.
It's still early.
This depends on upbringing.
No one can be like you (a devourer), Doctor!
Frankly.
How did Sagar, who hates commerce, manage to achieve such a great understanding of economics?
If today there are a hundred billionaires in the world, they would count him among them.
Do you know Abu Sakkar?
I chose Saker to be the Knight of the Market.
Peace be upon you.
Hi, Nasser!
Muhammad told me that Abu Nasser is in the hospital.
Do you remember when I told you I once heard that Sakr, son of Abu Sakr, wanted to take over my father's car dealership?
You won't run the agency now.
People don't reproduce that much.
His father touched him as they entered the market.
He opened his eyes to commerce.
Frankly, the doctor told me he's in critical condition.
This doesn't work.
I'm going, I do everything.
Shocked or hit, not my problem, I'm telling you, you're going to mess it up, you're going to mess it up and you're going to mess it up.
In this time, they seem like nations.
I welcome my dear viewers with one of the best and most giving men in this country.
A man who knows the way to the poor and needy.
Okay, we have the founder and owner of the Sughur Charity Association.
Of course, Sir! Let's talk about this organization.
We all know your generous goals that you are trying to convey to the world and everyone.
By God, I have no arrogance or desire for fame, may God protect us.
Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds. Recently, we were able to deliver thirty sacrifices to our brothers in Africa.
Praise be to God, we are now ready for delivery.
Seven boxes of sweets for our children in Gaza.
"Masha'Allah, ya Rab, yerhamak Allah, Allah yaj’al alladhi zaykum yufarfišo." Translation: "God willing, oh Lord, may Allah have mercy on you, may God make those like you cheerful."
We just left the house, Wafati and I.
But my wife will spend half an hour setting up her new project.
And I always wait for her.
Done.
I really love their atmosphere and I enjoy shaking hands with them. It's truly very enjoyable.
And it's also a source of income for my children.
This is my whole life.
I think you're wasting my time.
Stay away from trouble.
Okay, hot bread, hot bread.
Come on! Yeah! Hey, everyone.
In this time, they seem like nations.
In this time, they seem like nations.
If anyone wants to swim, swimming requires effort.
Needs brave men.
Fiva sok waqaf.
You deserve it, you deserve it, congratulations, congratulations.
God bless you all.
Masha'Allah, everyone loves you, Shian! Love is from God.
I want to say something, but please say "okay."
On the occasion of getting the license, how wonderful, my son Shahin has to go to the dealership and choose the best and most expensive car as a gift from me.
The wind is blowing across us from the valley's cleft.
Oh wind, my beloved, take me home.
Oh, Fadi.
How are you?
No, no, no, no, no.
You told me the dress would be ready in a week, and the day before yesterday you sent me a message saying it would be ready in three days. Wow! How stupid.
And you want your dress with crystals, which takes more time.
And God willing, you'll start talking to Alanoud and erase me from your mind?
I wonder how many lights there are.
No, no, no, no, no, let the whole world be upset, but my heart won't be upset.
"What else do you need, Fadi? They're starting to get suspicious."
Oh my God, I love the way you talk, I'm jealous of it, not of us.
Don't forget about me regarding the matter.
Are you wearing my clothes?
Here is Fadi.
Thank you, my brother Fadi.
Okay, Fadi, I'll come by next week to get my cat, bye.
How can I help you?
Just send the dress to my house.
No, I didn't like them.
Praise be to God, as He wills. Today, I went to Fadi's shop. He's doing great work, and indeed, the girls are coming and going.
Praise be to God, we were very successful in this project.
What is honesty?
Abu Nasser, my uncle.
What happened to him?
Look at the competition!
We haven't heard that he's started work, so where is this unemployed man going to get his money?
They opened their mouths, and stole!
And when he starts his work
Are you sure?
I heard some gossip.
And if God wills, you won't do anything?
It's seven in the morning.
Do you know if they'll pick you up in the morning?
No, thank you, I've already eaten breakfast.
Okay, I want to talk to you about something.
I heard that you...
You want to start a business.
Don't get too deep into this, may God guide you, my uncle.
Design, fashion design for women, etc., something like that?
Who hid the words for you?
Me, a businessman!
No, no, no, no, no, no, but I ...
You need advice, you need %pw I'm available if you need any help.
Thank you, thank you, Uncle! Thank you.
Alright, forgive me, I have to go.
Get out of here, sir!
The first time I tell you if you need a promotion.
Okay, Fadi, get this place ready. Do I see you're very busy?
The shop is closed now.
You said you would license the shop in front of you, trust in God and take the job.
Oh God!
Did they find someone to work at the store?
Is there anyone named Khalaf Sultan Al-Saifi other than your uncle Abu Nasser?
No, there isn't?
I'm from the Ministry of Economy. I saw his name on a transaction at my friend's place. His name is Esam, and he's in charge of his work papers.
Women's fashion design
Are you sure?
I saw the lease agreement and his name was written on it.
What's wrong with him? What's wrong? What's wrong with him?
What's wrong with it? What's wrong with it? What's wrong? It has a flaw.
Your sick heart didn't convince you.
When I saw that my project was successful,
You said you had to destroy it.
This is an open market for everyone.
Abu Nasser
Is he a shepherd? What's he saying?
And I was testing you, I told you I'd ruin your project?
I didn't lie to you, buddy.
Secrecy is the best policy.
I don't care about you or your requests.
But this doesn't lead you
Man, it's a blessing for all, and everyone gets their share.
You shook me.
Guys, you're sisters.
No, no, no, Abu Saleh, my grandfather, crossed continents.
You hit me in my own home!
Open to everyone!
You are brothers.
My friend Ibrahim advised me.
Bring a Lebanese designer.
I'm back, ask me.
I know our daughter loves Lebanese men.
Madam, this looks exquisite on you. No, no, no, this is unparalleled in the whole town.
Goodness, that suits you, madam, and with such sweet talk, and this piece that's worth a thousand, they're selling it for 30 or 40 thousand.
Yeah, just do as he does.
You know the wardrobe I made last year when the Lebanese engineer came.
Madam, I will design for you a wardrobe unparalleled in all of Doha.
See, if you want to be successful
What exactly is wrong with it?
What don't you know?
That means he stole the clients.
What do you think about moving, sir?
Don't say it, don't say it, Fadi!
And there you are, letting the kids play.
That means we lost, right!
We must make peace with them!
And to get our customers back, whether they like it or not.
Do you have money to pay?
Your welcome
I'm ready to do anything.
But most importantly, he won't defeat me.
This outfit you chose costs sixty thousand riyals.
Sure, without the dashes in the text.
This is a gift from the designer, from me.
And I've set it with crystal. There are only fifty pieces of this crystal in the whole world, and this is a very special piece.
Of course there are no discounts, our prices are globally known.
No, of course not, who would do that?
Madam, wait, wait, what happened? What's going on?
O Saad, they have harmed us!
Is this something they do?
They killed us, we have no more customers.
This is called war, Abu Nasser!
We won't be silent!
We need to keep calling them as they call us and get a response from them.
Tomorrow I will take a loan from the bank.
And they'll take the war with them, and you'll see what I'll do.
Abu Nasser won't stop.
Check the ad!
Make sure of the ad he posted!
We are offering free advertisements for three evening dresses with every wedding dress.
He made four evening dresses with each wedding dress.
We advertise with a quarter-page ad.
See, he's doing a half-page ad.
I don't know what he wanted to do!
Do you believe it, Umm Nasser?
Not a single customer has entered the store in six days.
It's closed today, even at noon.
And you'll feel the news that he sold his shop.
Step on it, step on it.
Even if they couldn't sit there, he was sitting outside.
Alright, drink your tea and go to hell.
Oh God, guide you. I won't be able to drink it, that's a problem.
Will anyone ever envy you?
There's someone God guides to insult him, and the smell of the place was intentional.
And these are chemicals.
Are you sure someone sprayed perfume in the store?
You are brothers, and you are adults, not kids, to kill each other like children.
Is it right that Jay comes at night and the work smells bad?
I didn't spray anything that makes you smell.
Don't go too far.
I signed an agreement at the police station.
Okay, don't frown.
This time,
I made an awesome plane for him.
He doesn't allow anyone to discover his mistake.
No, everything is fine.
That's what makes me unable to find a reply.
I swear to God, I don't understand anything. It's Wednesday, imagine, no customers and no one has entered the store.
Oh, I'm sorry, this isn't the right place. We need to go to the other shop. I feel embarrassed. God guide you.
And what did the doctor tell you?
The shop is empty and no customers are entering the store.
He's like he's been bewitched.
The lady and the girls don't come near the shop.
As if a spell had turned Saad into a beast.
Possible, everything is possible today.
Here there is magic, and it is evil.
Okay, is he asleep or awake?
Water it, my brother! Oh no, water it, I'm afraid the roof will collapse.
Alas, it's lost! Oh Sultan, it's lost.
Okay, he did it like a dog!
He treated him badly!
Oh, my dear, calm down! Are you upset about something?
I don't know what he did.
My dear, tell me what you did with him. They say his friends have started collecting money and paying off his debts.
His design
Not Lebanese
Did you tell him, or didn't you?
Don't you know where he is?
The stars are the same, and we are searching for them intensely.
Call the man again, he might have an emergency.
What happened to you, Uncle Ahmed?
What happened to you, Ahmed! You're just sitting here while the manager is yelling at me! What can I do? Where are the locations you said you'd move today?
You'd better leave me alone, I've already talked to him and he's giving me a headache, I even asked Mr. Abdullah.
First of all, don't shout, we're actors and we need to relax a bit, we need to focus on our roles. Second, the man has contacted me more than once, don't shout.
What are you saying, Professor Abdullah? What are you saying?
Professor Abdullah, what should I do? The director is going to finish the scene and shout at me.
Guys, perfect! Guys, perfect!
We want to finish, but the actress who's supposed to be in the scene hasn't arrived yet.
You wouldn't want anyone to shout at you, would you?
Do your work quietly and without shouting.
This is our position, always screaming, since morning. We need to focus.
I found a solution for you.
What do you think about managing yourself with a scene until God is pleased? I'll put you with an actor who is good at the role.
It's true that he'll do one set.
But this scene is the most important scene in the series.
Okay, sir, I'll go get divorced right now, please, sir.
But if I'm not ready today, I'll quit.
Come on, guys, let's go upstairs.
"They need something, so they weigh it, like that?"
Abu Walid doesn't know him, he'll take advantage right away. He needs someone who looks rich, he has to be rich and Qatari.
"I wonder, my friend, if he wears a cat and a mouse, no one will notice."
Are you serious, Ali? You just want the easy way out, but that's not respecting people's feelings and intellect.
On me, I gave you all the responsibilities, distributed the tasks, and you'll be off the hook.
Calm down, my love, so we can think. Reem, think with me, you might remember one of your friends.
Who is he?
Ahmad, do you remember anyone in the Salitah neighborhood named Saud Bokod?
Nafas Awad bin Badr.
Oh Saudi Arabia, oh cup!
The script said he needed a wealthy man of stature, and you're saying cans.
Dude, tonight it's gonna be lit, you're gonna hook up with a rich and respected man.
But with a little makeup, and a headscarf, and dressed in a clean thobe and a fancy car.
I hope it's suitable.
How can we reach him?
I know their house.
Peace be upon you.
Happy birthday?
Okay, who is he?
Ah, ah, ah, that's it, that's it.
Ah, that's it, thank you very much.
And now how is it going to work, Mama? There is no Gotra other than this trifle he brought from outside.
Son, you only have what you're wearing.
Son, that's inside the wardrobe under my clothes.
Oh mother, people are outside, what do I want to ride?
Oh, Lord, ease your pain, my son!
That means I'll see you on TV today.
Oh, Mama, and they said I'd be famous on TV among the rich.
Scram! You piece of shit.
Dude, what's that? A hit on you.
Smoke, smoke.
Here I am, Mom.
Oh mother, quickly, do you look better now?
God willing, my son.
Oh God, I wish I could just give them some money.
God help you.
Pray for me.
I got you a vacuum cleaner, Saud, and a laptop, Saud.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
What's this, oh God, the son of Fatima, what's this?
Welcome, welcome.
Peace be upon you, Saud?
Will he do this scene?
Oh, oh, I hope he does a good job, acts dumb and ignores you, so he can give you a complex role.
How are you, uncle/father?
She's not the same person who used to talk about pomegranates before.
Woe to you, woe to you, be quiet.
You are now wearing glasses.
You are an old man now.
You don't change, and I'll be upset that I nominated you.
The person they brought to Laura was Abu Abdulaziz's father.
He's here, they brought him, you welcome, you welcome, you welcome.
"Do good work, our manager, Professor Arif Fadil, knows everything."
The most important thing is not to be afraid of the camera.
Oh brother, I'm only afraid of God.
Don't be afraid, just keep quiet, listen to his instructions, and say "yes" to anything the director tells you.
Oh, my dear! Oh, my dear! I wish you were playing the role of a rich man, a man of influence, do you understand?
Come here, boy! Come here, boy!
This is what I was talking to you about.
He's very stingy, the role needs someone who's practical.
Anything goes for some people.
Ask me why I speak like this.
Brother, we bought this for the performance. Listen to me, I'll show you the makeup room now and I'll teach you the role.
Woe to you, woe to you, woe to you.
Come here, please.
Introduce her to you.
Stop, stop, stop here here!
Praise be to God that you're here, come in, come in.
Sir, the car you need for the scene is ready.
Saoud, he's going to fix everything, he'll repair it.
How do we repeat this again, with the assistant director present to watch you and calm the director down?
Imagine yourself as a famous trader.
Are you saying this?
Oh, oh, I'm telling you, wait, wait, don't rush, I wouldn't have expected that from you, wow! (Abu Abdul Aziz), say you're Abu Abdul Aziz.
For our rights.
Oh sweet, and you know!
Show him how to clean his teeth, brother!
"He will clean and complete the full name Abu Abdul Aziz Falah Al-Marzooq, oh Jamila."
Oh sweet, okay, okay and think.
I think it's suitable for your daughter.
Don't ruin your life over her divorce.
Your daughter is divorced, is she pretty? Is she pretty?
She's crazy, walk and think about yourself, we don't date.
Why don't I shed light on it?
Wow, you're an artist, and he memorized everything, wow.
Deho is brushing my teeth.
How? Why?
Oh my! The men are preparing a surprise for us, and the director has decided to finish the indoor scenes in the hall before shooting the outdoor scenes.
How are you doing? We don't want %PW!
Yes, we want to, we want to, but it's been postponed for later. They'll shoot another scene, and we'll catch up with them if God wills.
Should I tell them to make you tea?
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you too.
Good morning, sir/your excellency.
Hello, where are you from, mate? Hey, boy!
My name is Salem Abu Shwei Al-Ali.
Barbecue is popular.
You deserve it.
You're hiding, my nose is big, and pigs can also lurk here.
Come on, all you tall people!
I take care of myself.
If it were someone else, they wouldn't have stopped laughing.
Wait a minute.
Mama
My mother is very tired, I need to go quickly, brother!
We're going to miss you.
I don't have time, I told you Mummy is sick, she has a serious illness, they say!
Listen to me, you can do that, but when I tell you, you have to come right away.
He and I, we can't get out of this place.
Okay, okay, I'll try to find a taxi. Brother.
What's a taxi? If you search for a taxi for a whole year, you won't find one.
You know we're renting the car for the scene.
She smiled when he stood up, showing his cheek.
Come on! Brother, please, give me the key. Mom is tired, give me the key, give it to me.
In Arabic.
I need a wheelchair.
Oh sir, wait, wait, I'll wheel this wheelchair right now, right now!
Can I tell you something? Can I tell you something?
My mother is very tired in Arabic and can't manage, she needs a wheelchair, I wish.
Where is the patient? Is he inside the car?
Oh my son, my beloved, what happened?
Be silent and do not speak, but rather be still and silent.
Peace be upon you.
Okay, there's nothing, but my mother, your beloved, has asthma, quickly.
I'll tell them to order a separate bed.
Oh, cold, cold.
Don't hurt yourself.
God protect us from you, what have you done?
Oh, wow! Steadfast.
Take care of our son Rashid.
As you wish, bring me along, Mr. Rashid.
Come on, Rashid.
And I'll accompany Mr. Rashid and think about it.
That's what's expected of you.
I'll tell the nurse to bring you a drink, you little rascal.
Come on, father Rashid!
Excuse me.
What can I do there with so many people, but wait!
The problem is that no one leaves us alone.
Sir, what would you like to drink, tea, coffee, or cappuccino?
You're not the first one. Nasser, the hospital guard, married a Filipino woman.
Who told you I was rejected?
Not even one girl gives me attention.
They are remembering and taking orders.
Okay, he doesn't have a certificate. I don't want your mother. What's this? I don't want your mother again! Go see your friends.
Oh, man, there's a girl at the clinic, I like her looks.
If she's ignoring you, look at someone else.
Oh, my beloved, I can't find it! My heart is locked.
Your brother has fallen in love with her, do you believe it? When I see her?
This is for Dr. Mohamed.
What happened to you?
Let's go outside.
God bless you.
Sir, the antenna is in perfect health.
You're a professional actor, Saud! Oh, guys!
Bravo, see how people are looking at you and applauding you.
Go home, freshen up, change your clothes, and remove your makeup.
Come on, man, forget about it. Come and take a breath here first.
Yes, from now on, my name is Fah Al-Marzouk.
Forget about this topic and write something else.
Saud has passed away.
From now on, my name is Fah Al-Marzouk, Abu Al-Aziz.
God have mercy on you, my beloved.
One more time!
I did two.
Even I heard one of the bride's family members say, "Wow, they are so precise," I don't think anyone can do something like what they did in the contract.
My love, goodbye.
Come on, Mom, look at this.
To give them something on the occasion of my wedding contract signing.
What's up, Mom? What's going on?
Look at your brother, he's the one who's going to ruin our reputation!
Oh, that's embarrassing. By the way, it's cheap.
But that's based on our budget, okay.
Leave this for the servants to eat.
He's trying to fool us.
Praise be to God that I saw her.
This is the free class, it's for those from the upper class.
Above average
No, we want something unique, something not everyone can buy.
Oh dear, don't rush to blame someone who doesn't know your capabilities (Economy of language).
Silence, just silence, don't see anything.
I'm afraid my money won't be enough.
No cash, pay by credit card.
This is luxury, it's very sophisticated.
Yesterday, the groom signed the marriage contract.
Nasser's sword!
I am at your service, I am at your service.
Review me.
They booked the small hall and the food was disgusting.
Too expensive.
What she said about a happy wedding.
Sure, everyone is saying the same thing.
This is what I see!
Oh my dear sister,
He thinks he's sworn on his money.
And that's what people consider gossip.
He wants to make a joke out of us.
We just need to buy something based on our budget and needs.
Do you know that many people take loans, sell their houses and cars just to have a big wedding and stop people from talking about them?
Leave it to us, cheap chocolate is enough for us to exaggerate about.
I said the director liked the Chinese food and took it home.
Okay, if the bride's family says we'll choose the hall and the place where the show is presented, and we'll prepare everything ourselves.
And you think we'll choose something else!
No, not anything, just the store we used to go to had a really good price.
Seriously, this shop was designed by the wedding planner of Abu Snakes.
Does anyone have experience with this?
Frankly, just once.
At the wedding of His Highness Sheikh Mubarak's daughter.
No, no, no, we don't need anything used.
We need a platform that we will be the first in the world to use.
That means you want to succeed.
Show me what you've got.
This stage is being used for the first time in Qatar.
Inspired by the media revolution like Facebook and Twitter.
Very contemporary and up-to-date.
What stage is this? With all these arrangements?
Great, I'll calculate it for you now, but it's not less than one hundred and fifty thousand.
Mama, mama, by doing it this way, our money won't be enough. Everything is a luxury, the best and the most distinguished. All of this is expensive.
Everyone loves this.
I wish you would pamper me.
What's the decision?
I mean, did you like that?
This is Noah's Ark.
The Mercans are very new, but Noah's Ark is $20,000 more expensive.
No, please, may God bless your parents, I think the mouse stage is much better.
Silence, no, I need Noah's Ark.
These are wedding parties and their costs. By the way, we consider ourselves middle-class.
Do I need to pay for a half-hour and a quarter-hour, for the "Royal Ballroom" as you call it, that I booked?
Isn't it just a carton? Why is this offer so low, and everyone wants to outdo each other and everyone wants to be better than what others have done.
This is a show of pride and only wedding hall owners benefit.
Who knows that everyone wants to be special, they exploit people and lie to us.
I swear to God, one of my friends says that Uncle's brother owns the party store.
He said the theater doesn't cost more than 2000 riyals.
I'm just waiting for the moment when his father can agree.
Okay, do something.
He's just like the other men who got married and raised themselves.
Oh, ma'am, I am honored to meet you.
How are you?
I know you love perfection.
That's what makes me call you.
The first time in Qatar, designed by international artist Peter Salmond.
A collection inspired by the nine planets.
I am from the solar system.
With Noah's wood, it will look like a masterpiece.
There's no harmony like this, you'll be the first in Qatar to use the nine planets.
Alright
It was one hundred and fifty thousand, and now what?
Alright
May God compensate you with something better.
In your position
Oh my friend, there are too many expenses.
Frankly, I couldn't take all eight thousand.
All I've gathered is sixty thousand, and I took twenty thousand from my brother.
Thank you, thank you very much, my brother Fahd!
How can I solve this problem, Fahd! I wish we didn't boast at weddings, it's a problem.
Not to brag.
Of course, I'll send you the invitations you want.
Oh, this week, if God wills, we will start sending out the invitations.
Our joy at the wedding will be better than their joy at the wedding.
Oh mom, look at the invitations my son chose for the wedding.
Where does Betty live?
People now travel to countries just to design their invitations.
Unlike Amina's family, they went to Italy to design their invitation, print it, and return. Like Mina's family,
They went to France, even those without money, they go to Lebanon to get their invitations.
The system does this in the country, do you want us to disagree?
Okay, which country do you want to go to?
We saw some wonderful invitations.
Seriously, it's way too expensive.
But this is unique and no one has done it before.
Shine, I don't like it.
Gold is better, it shines.
Oh, how sad! If he can't afford the wedding expenses,
Okay, why did he get involved in this matter?
And you leave all this boasting and showing off at weddings and all these useless expenses.
It's only benefit is to hotels and wedding planners.
The decade, he ate it.
Let me hand him over. With him, the children will not find anyone to take care of them.
Dude, I'm giving you the boot.
Thank you, Abu Nasser!
Oh, my dear, the bride's family should support you.
I only tried it once, just once.
I told him that there was something essential for the "balcony" in a very famous hotel.
Why, you found our daughter in the street, and no one else is better than her.
That's the problem, everyone is looking at each other.
Who told you I got married?
At least they don't have that arrogance.
It's all about a simple party and some small expenses.
Oh sir, hurry up, you're having a party on Facebook right now!
Less cost, less price.
That means you're not going to go back to your home country to get married.
Okay, don't think, do you want me to be crazy?
You see,
If Abdullah al-Rawi or Nawal Laroussa didn't bring it, it wouldn't be for my son's bride.
Alas, she won't be better than me.
My beloved, I'd like to ask you a question.
If your son has a WhatsApp number, show it to us so we can communicate with him.
My darling, thank you very much, goodbye.
Mom, we agreed on the DJ, why did you change your mind?
And will Nors be better than me?
I forgot who she was and who we were.
The people who were below us have become better than us.
Mama, it's not like that, but look at my brother Saleh, he breaks my heart and we don't put much pressure on him.
Seriously, he broke my heart.
Alas!
In the hospital! But which hospital?
I don't know, it just fell suddenly.
I heard that and I lost it.
He has no value, and no one can blame her, after she prepared everything and people knew, he just said he didn't want a wedding.
He wants to embarrass us.
What did the doctor say?
He's going to leave the wing, he's determined.
And oh Lord, may everything be alright.
Don't break her heart.
My son, you're a man and you're acting like a child.
Come on, come on and cheer her up.
I swear to God, if you say that's Abu Youssef, his heart will stop beating.
Do you know why the minister hasn't fired Abu Youssef yet?
Look, he should have retired three or four years ago.
Okay, there's nothing wrong, he's going to help me.
Oh, my sorrow, you are crazy.
Did you understand? What do you want from him now?
And you let him hide the documents and certificates until you get your money back.
They call it quantum postponement.
He's about to speak, and I don't know why you're nervous.
Nothing matters, and in the end, I'll pay you back.
Do you know what they call me, do you know what they call me?
The righteous, the believers.
Oh my uncle, oh my uncle, I tried, but there's no other way but this.
If I give it to you and also to the people checking later,
And they are harsh in scrutinizing, they'll take from me, quickly, quickly.
Quickly, the tablet, the tablet, the tablet.
You ate, and you took the medicine.
No, no, if God wills, by seven-thirty we'll be in the hall receiving guests.
No, we'll definitely be there.
We're throwing a book party for my son, and it's going to be attended by people from all over the world in Doha.
Goodness!
Oh Fatima, coming right up, my love. You'll take me later.
I'm worried about you, they envy you. Son, if you go to them like this tomorrow with the bishit.
Mom, is the twenty-cent coin okay?
The police are here!
Oh God, let there be nothing wrong.
The police are here, but stay calm and I'll be right back.
God protect us, Salukh.
Forget your joy.
The marital home will now turn into a marital prison.
They accepted the document I provided for the loan, but now they're suddenly questioning it.
Why are you upset?
This will not be worse than what you will taste of the flames.
What the hell!
A respectful and honest employee
Who loves his job, a ministry compared him to a company to do maintenance.
The employee, being interested in his work, went and inquired about the materials.
He found out it would cost five hundred thousand riyals.
The organization will be saved six hundred thousand dollars.
The minister hit him! No, no, no, I don't believe it!
You won't believe this!
Here is happy.
Of course he has all the news.
He fired him from his job.
What happened in the world? What are the values?
He says he called his boss at the office.
And he said to him, "Let the clay do his work in obedience to him, without wages."
And who is she?
She is the daughter of the manager of the same company that offered the maintenance deal.
From which Uthman was it discovered?
No, no, no, no, that's unnatural.
You're always surprised, Saleh!
Is this a company for me?
For whom?
We've become like this!
What are you saying!
It doesn't matter what I say, this is the esteemed employee Osman, what's his mistake!
The mistake is on him because he is honest and trustworthy!
Do you think the manager is in his office?
Yes, he left a moment ago.
What's happening in this world?
We started seeing strange people.
I agree with you, Osman. He doesn't deserve it, but there's nothing we can do about it.
"It's unbelievable, Professor, he has seven children and doesn't have a passport."
He's living it exactly! And what's he going to do now and where is he going to go?
Do you know what happened?
The new employee the minister told me about,
I entered Uthman's office and started working. Dear Uthman began to gather his belongings, she stopped him and said, "Go, and I will send your belongings with the engineer."
Where is he now?
The situation has changed, ya Osman?
This is the reward!
This is God's command.
Praise be to God, O Lord.
O Lord of the worlds, O Merciful, O Generous, O! Uthman, may God not forsake you, goodbye.
What happened? Your voice is not normal!
I know, I know you're very sensitive.
Oh no! I can't work, I'm leaving now.
And this is a chance for me to see my mom and show you the things.
Just feel it that way.
Why are you shouting at me? I'm your wife.
You're rejecting my help, I'm just asking.
Hey, what gives you the right to walk around with him? Is he your husband, father, or brother?
The world has changed, where do you live?
Oh mama, I don't know!
You're crazy.
People are free, the world has become a small village, where do you live?
What on earth!
Be modern, live in the present, and don't be backward.
Take the stuff out of the car quickly! Go, don't talk to me, and close it.
What's up? Hey! Saleh, what's wrong with you?
No, I'm not feeling light today.
You shouted at the service, what's its fault?
You know I didn't mean it.
No, no, no, I'm not hungry.
So I can forget the crises I've seen.
Oh my darling, don't be sad.
The manager/boss gets a little angry.
Oh supervisor, it's an honor to me and I'm happy about it.
Thank you, thank you very much.
Work hard and persistently.
Better, wow.
Above all,
The most important thing for me in this ministry
Yes, my friend! May God bless you.
Tell me, what's the point of an employee who doesn't take bribes?
He is unemployed.
That's what makes me want each one of you.
There's no place for honest people and those with crumbling principles and values.
If one day you discover
Lost and will blame himself.
Justice is a principle, no matter the reaction!
That's what makes me want your cooperation.
If you have doubt
Just say yes.
We are thieves and sons of thieves, and no one can compare to our sisters.
If Nouray hadn't taken a bribe in her life, she would steal government tea before going home.
Excellent, excellent, praise be to God. That's what we were expecting from all of you. I don't just want it to be like this, I want all of you to be like her.
God bless you.
That's why I want you to leave the purchasing department and become the manager of my library.
Frankly, you know how to choose; you picked the right thief in the right place.
Oh my lady, enough! Umm Saud, don't cause more pain.
I won't be in prison.
But God is sufficient for all things, He bewitched me with His love and exchanged my truth for beauty.
And command me to speak the truth.
You are a father.
Why did you double down on honesty and integrity?
Your whole life was stolen and you were comfortable.
Praise be to God, they didn't come.
I'll let you talk to your father.
Never do it again.
No one should follow the straight path, but rather engage in bribery, theft, and deception to live in comfort.
Your father was imprisoned because all his money was illegal.
Stop, stop.
Is this something you wear?
Extending knowledge.
Oh, my sorrow.
Where is your stomach?
Why didn't you tell?
You stink, you are dishonorable.
I'm shy about wearing my brother's costume.
Are there any girls who are shy nowadays?
Why are you screaming?
See what we wear, your comfort!
Does anyone actually wear something like that?
And you'll walk in the street without showing any part of your body?
You're waiting for her, you're not listening to me.
Support from here has never failed me.
I bought her some transparent clothes she doesn't need.
I warn you, I'll see you one day in a place below the knee.
Since you know the situation, don't blame me for the consequences.
We are here, may God accept from you.
I hope he is stingy and evil.
He is like his father.
As you can see before you
He's a really good man, how can we find someone like him?
Don't be afraid, Uncle, I'm ugly.
You're a good man. To be honest, I love my daughter Sarah very much and I'm concerned about her future.
In the darkness, when we heard about it.
Praise be to God, she has a very bad reputation.
I arrived home at 3:30 a.m.
I arrived at his house at 5 a.m.
Welcome, welcome, oh! Welcome.
Let's go to the bar.
Start the car engine and come pick me up from the bar.
This is the first time I see a father not obeying his son.
Listen, Dad. Start the car, I'm waiting for you.
Mary, I love you.
I love you too, Shayya, Shayya, Shayya.
Frankly, frankly, Abi is here.
Where is he?
He is brave, unlike my father who doesn't enjoy himself.
Let me marry you instead of my love, Majid.
Alright, man, Abdelaziz was my first boyfriend.
Welcome, come in, it's a great opportunity.
and the Arab and Israeli satellites
I discovered that a large number of Palestinians don't trim their nails.
In accordance with the State of Palestine's commitment in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement,
In any case, the United Nations is meeting today to discuss Israel's request to send special inspection committees to examine Palestinian fingers.
Let's see if their claws are long or not.
There was a condition that nothing should be cut, scratched, or anything that draws blood.
West Bank
I call on the entire international community to visit Palestine.
From the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.
Manufactured from clay.
"Olives, yes! Oh, man."
We cure olives this way, this is how we cure olives.
We and our Arab brothers call upon the international community.
To conduct inspections of Palestinian nails.
And now, let's start the voting.
No, no, no, no, he won't reach your level, no.
In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Ever-Living.
"A sword, a sword, what is this that is within you?"
What didn't you understand?
I wished to see the world upside down.
Oh steadfast one, you must have a strong character.
Now, brother, this school that you will work at tomorrow is number?
I'm a teacher like you.
Why didn't you change schools since I've been disgusted?
Oh my friend, what's your personality?
But the problem is his weak personality.
You see, the teachers who were with him were the ones complaining about him.
Oh, my dear father, my grandfather!
That's what makes you see him as calm.
Then, he started teaching.
Okay, we weren't ketchup, we were mayonnaise with %Pw.
Oh brother, we're not talking to you to make you angry.
We're telling you this because it's your last chance.
And he told me that I accepted Rashid, even though his personality is weak.
He's shy, but he's very nice.
He, may Allah be pleased with him, is still a citizen.
What's up, brother? Why are you so calm?
Because everything you say is right.
Everything you say is right.
From tomorrow,
The New Rashid
Mr. Rashid,
You are absolutely right.
I wish you could forget him.
From tomorrow,
Oh, that's good. What's next?
I'm telling you right here.
I'm a teacher and I don't like mistakes.
What if someone jumped up and said it to you, just like someone else did at the previous school, with the inspector present?
Pick up your bag!
Slowly, slowly, the door creaked.
Okay, one learns from one's mistakes.
From the first minute,
I'm telling you right here.
I'm worried.
It's on me!
Silence!
It seems he said, "Shut up!"
Did you hear that bloke?
Tell him that Mr. Rashid fired me.
It seems he said it doesn't matter, but he'll see; I don't want to see your face here in class.
Professor, don't you know who he is?
Whose son is he?
Here comes Mr. Rashid.
Did you see it?
Professor, the problem is that if he tells his father.
Okay, where do you usually see him? = Sitting, sitting at the stop?
You might find it in the chair section, sitting.
Above the chairs.
Chairs, chairs.
Until today, he is a human.
But you're just shouting at me!
Guys, this is nonsense, are you kidding?
My father is out of town and will come back next week. If he does, I'll tell him.
No, no, no, no, Abdel Rahman, may God protect you.
Oh man, we're friends. Exactly, this raspberry ice cream is amazing, you should try it. It's a bit tart, but it's really amazing.
Okay, go get them quickly.
The thing I fear the most is him telling his father.
I said his father is out.
Oh, he's out, his father won't come? So their children stole his belongings and kicked him out!
I hope there are no dire consequences.
You brought his suitcase and gave it to him, and you gave him your phone number, and you told him, "If you need anything at all, call me, I'm your friend."
Oh, okay.
Oh, come on! What's the big deal?
You are the ones who told me.
Scream and act as if you are strong.
Bathroom, bathroom, bathroom.
O wanderer!
Sleep, you can eat, you can eat, don't look at yourself, sleep.
Professor Abu Nasser, Mr. Rashid is in the bathroom.
One juice.
Come here, come here, come here, come here, give it to me.
Come on, quickly.
Put them on the table.
People are equal.
This text doesn't translate into meaningful English as it appears to be a repeated character with no context or other recognizable language.
Do you want someone to guarantee a boy for us?
This will get us into trouble, it's him, he's the one calling.
The third branch.
I wonder, hello. Sugar, I swear he's amazing.
Faster, faster.
Peace be upon you.
Stand up for the inspector, sit down.
I am at your service, sir/madam.
Oh professor, come, come professor.
Are you done grilling?
Okay, I won't let you laugh. Come on, man, I'm just telling you, are you done?
Are you done or not? Where is the value of the teacher? By doing this, you are hiding from yourself and hiding the work of teachers.
Okay, okay, fine, fine.
And you're raising your voice too?
Yes, I'm raising my voice, first you need to know who this boy is?
Faster, faster.
Just two cars.
Twice, no, no, I want four or five cars. Spread out, spread out, we have plenty of space. Come on, come on, come on.
He thinks he owns the neighborhood!
Abu Nasser used to do that and didn't do that.
God helps him.
I am the school principal here.
Famous is Abu Nasser.
We could give the teachers extra lessons.
Except me.
Who's the boss here?
You're the manager, God guide you, what do you think?
Loosen your foot.
What you put in your head, is on the chair. Welcome, brother.
What are you talking about?
I'm being honest, I swear to God, I just want to make things easier for you.
What? What do they call it?
Okay, what can we do for you now?
Act better for yourself, and you'll take extra lessons whether you like it or not.
What happened to you? Go, go, go, get out!
Okay, I'm leaving.
Alright, I told you, man.
We need to keep him in check.
Guys, wait!
Don't eat us, Abu Salma!
Oh Abu Naies, you're the neighborhood leader, you need to stop him from trading.
I won't remain like my cousin.
I'll see what I'll do with it.
Faster, faster.
Goodbye, your generosity.
I wish, when did he buy this new car?
I told you, but you didn't believe me.
His mustache twitched and his face turned red.
He came up to you when he arrived, I didn't recognize him, but when he started speaking, I knew him by his voice.
You know they presented it a week ago?
This holds him responsible for eight schools for boys and girls.
What's this magical secret? Ask him to tell you, what's the secret that made him rise from the bottom!
I've been telling you since day one,
I don't know, I don't want to hear any sound.
Not even a breath.
Behave well.
And you, too, answer me, and you, too, argue with me. Get away from my face, go away, out, out, out.
When you appoint a minister, make sure they do a good job with you.
Okay, don't tell me to come and take my job.
I don't have a brother to give me options, different jobs to choose from and pick the most suitable job.
My brother is a minister!
I swear by my Lord, I didn't feel good after the call I received.
Everyone is thanking me.
"What will they say, oh Mother? God guide you."
This happens a lot. Every minister takes his friends, and people do this automatically.
From here, it's all on you, I'm glad to meet you %Pw.
I realized I was going to be a minister.
Okay, so they're bribing me, it's just a gift to make me happy.
A fortune will come to us, a treasure, a treasure that will open up to us.
The big earth
Come on, everyone, let's go to congratulate the new minister.
Come on, come on, come on.
Congratulations, Your Excellency.
By your vastness, [you are] blessed and sanctified.
Congratulations, Your Excellency. You deserve it.
You deserve it, sir! Your Excellency the Minister.
Oh brothers, the responsibility is great; may God help us bear it.
Bearing in mind that this has been said, you are highly qualified for this job (necessity).
I left, and then Abu Saleh's phone rang.
He was far from him.
Forget him.
I don't know how I love him now?
Abu Sultan doesn't neglect.
I opened the door for him.
Well done, you've done a lot!
We are waiting for our brother to become a minister.
I told you, Mom! But you don't believe me.
You were saying these are café stories, café stories.
After her husband died, she said she wished she had been a better wife to him.
Oh, if only, if only.
Ah, there's nothing to say, you have nothing.
Oh, mom, let's go, I'm exhausted (I can't go on).
What do you mean by "not your responsibility"?
Just chill out, dude.
I cut them off because they were making me anxious.
Yes, they are right.
But I don't want to tell her in front of my mom, you know my mom tells everyone.
She'll tell you anything she hears; people call her "the sprinkler," we don't want any stories.
Okay, what guarantees do you have that if he's not in power, he'll put you in his place?
Because I asked.
If he's out of the office, you're the first candidate.
What's the occasion for this gathering?
No, I'm very sure about this.
Okay, okay. I saw him outside the office just like I'm seeing you now in front of me.
Why are you doing magic to me?
But the plan in my head is foolproof and effective.
This is a "burn and dump" plan.
He wants to go to everything happening in the country.
Now he's burning, and when he burns, he'll step down from office. When he steps down, he'll be expelled.
Oh, my dear, come quickly! Brother, I don't know, and I don't know what to tell you!
Your visit is marked, reflecting your love for your country.
Believes?
Today you are the head of state, you must always be present.
You have to stay involved in everything, sorry boss, sorry, sorry.
Before I forget, thank you for the sheep you sent me the day before yesterday.
Come on, man, on your honor, it's just sheep, it's none of your business. What do you think, man, that you're coming with me today?
The man is waiting for you outside!
Frankly,
I'm going to sleep.
I am sick, I am tired of fame, tired of this.
You're a minister today, that's right. As he said, you're a public figure, make a name for yourself!
May God bless this kind man.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Don't take my picture.
Hadi, Hadi.
Today I went to the poetry night and the wedding, and they took a lot of pictures, more than a hundred.
I'll also tell him about something very nice to cheer him up.
Listen, I've also arranged a very nice educational activity for you.
Yes, like that. Make it shine, I want it to shine, shine, shine until it shines like light. I'm searching for that shine.
Merchant, thank you, congratulations, congratulations, blessed bicycle. %PW Picture, picture O Excellency. Take a picture, take a picture. Don't take my picture, I'm far away, take it.
This is the bicycle.
You start with a blessing and congratulations, he greets you with elevation.
Picture, picture and that's it. You are my flesh, my flesh for your sake.
Okay, God bless you.
Go to the next page.
No, they don't know that.
This is a national contribution.
What Allah wills, Allah desires.
My other friend is embarrassing me today.
Everyone praises your work, O Mother of Khalid, and everyone calls you a dynamic social activist.
Tonight I heard a word that hurts me.
Yesterday, Abu Sultan took me to a party.
Celebrating the young children's swimming victory.
Someone was talking to his creation.
They thought I hadn't heard about them.
This minister said
I want to buy a birthday present for my uncle/aunt.
Welcome, welcome.
I consult you, sir, in the newspaper every day.
True, true
You brought light when you came to Aisha's, I'll give you a discount on everything you're looking for.
Whether you want to pay or not, it's fine.
This means you won't be hanging around and watching with your minister.
I, I am Abu Saleh, the minister.
Abu Sultan didn't bring anything, I'm waiting for him.
And he sat me in the front row, then went to the car to rest.
I don't have anything against him, may God guide you.
Oh, folks! Madam, may God keep your family safe. I'll tell you later to make sure.
And you're calling yourself.
People are making fun of us.
I told you.
This job is a masterpiece.
I wish this wind would come and carry me away!
The minister annoyed me, may God avenge me.
Hello, Your Excellency the Minister.
No, I'm just a bit tired today.
Alright, if you're that enthusiastic, we're at your service.
We are at your service, but my brother Saad will pick you up and accompany you, and hopefully you'll find a party or something.
Then, a party?
No, no, nothing's working today.
No, we don't have it.
Okay, where can we find him?
Yes. Thank you, thank you.
Is anyone asking?
God bless you.
Sleep and rest.
Happy moment.
Anything even for a quiet night?
Wow, that's good.
And there might be extra time.
Take it! Put it in the booth and look for a photographer to take pictures of its face.
Okay, bye bye.
What did you find for him?
I don't know, it's a reserve league match. Let's leave him alone at the stadium!
What's this! This minister has studied us!
Beautiful, this means he reached the top.
It's near its end when it becomes the talk of the town.
Sir, he has become much more popular than you.
Sir, if you're not going anywhere, and you know Abu Saleh is with you,
Oh, sir!
My star sells.
We'll disable it and restore it to its original size.
The minister gave, gave, gave. The minister gave.
Don't take pictures! Don't take pictures! I swear to God, if any of you take my picture, I'll sue you. I won't come out.
Brock broke their cameras, I don't want pictures.
She's saying hello to you.
As they say, I missed the train.
This is Khalid, my age and my brother.
"There is no strength or power except from Allah."
Why like that?
This is the first time I've seen him.
When you see it for the first time!
I haven't seen him in years.
Oh my God.
Is this my wallet?
I haven't seen you in a long time, come back to me, my love.
What's he doing? He's very affected by it.
"Allah has no power or extension except through Himself, and you keep returning to the same issue."
Go, go and don't be sad. I came from a wedding at 3 a.m.
Let me rest, and you don't need to bother or make a big deal out of it.
Your brother is a girl.
I swear to God, I'll tell my dad. Honestly, look at yourself, you look like a girl.
It means he was playing, playing.
Oh, he's on fire! I'm telling you, he was playing with the makeup sponge.
And as for the Saudis, I know what to do with them.
Oh, Khalood, I wish all children were like him.
About these campaigns and the stupidity they create about his brother.
Come on, come on, my brothers, come and say hello.
How are you, my love?
Okay, honey, we're not going to Spain this summer.
What's wrong?
Fahd is from Kuwait.
Oh Hamid!
Listen to what I'm saying.
"There is no power or strength except by Allah."
I'll let my dear hopes choose for themselves.
But honestly, what do you think?
I say whoever has seen the sea is better.
Since I'm longing for a change, let's buy a yacht so we can sail directly from our home to the sea.
Me and my children.
I wish you would set a wedding date.
Okay, it's been ten years and a few months.
What happened with your brother? He's getting too big for his boots.
Amoula, frankly, I noticed that your brother Khalid, I don't know.
But he is completely different from your brother Saad.
My dear, whether they are different or not, everyone is free to act as they please.
And your fiancée is cultured, she doesn't know that there are perfumes that suit everyone.
Let him keep his opinion to himself!
Alright, bro.
Keep going, Khalid!
Don't mess with women's perfume like you do.
You even use their colors.
Why are you doing this, Khaled? What is this?
Seriously, you have nothing to say.
Mom, why don't you want to believe anything his father says? Don't you see what he does and gives him?
Now perfumes are gender-neutral.
Here I warn you.
Have you seen the Bluetooth?
I heard from my friend at the meeting, they say it's very common in Doha.
I've heard about it, they've been offered to us.
You need to see it, and I'll tell you later.
Look how that girl sways!
Look at the moves!
These are girls! Go to this one she's talking about, the one who sways well and does moves, do you know who she is? She's Kholoud Mohammed's friend.
This is for my aunt Khadija, you bastard.
Okay, I'll do it for him.
Saad's brother is waiting now.
Why? Let's see if he brings it, let's see if Saad is coming! I'll send it to him via Bluetooth so his family can see it.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, hello, hello.
Of course, I lost.
Why is my brother so nostalgic?
Okay, but is your Bluetooth on?
No, I'll just send you something.
No, thank you, Amira.
He ran away from his family.
Are you crazy? Oh, Saad!
And I'll walk tomorrow.
You won't notice my scarf in this place.
Where are you going by yourself?
What will people say?
They will say that their son is not with them and has traveled, you don't want to cause a scene for us!
You?
And what your son Khalid did is honor and reputation!
A bit of change in his life, to the extent that they became six, isn't that something strange?
I won't be able to face people if they say this is Ray's brother.
His saying that he's traveling for medical reasons, studies, work, or even depression.
The most important thing is that I'm not living in a place where people chase me every day.
Okay, where are you going?
It doesn't matter where I go (audio).
This is the last thing.
The second one doesn't know where he is, and this one here is packing her bag to travel.
Even we don't know where he's going?
What did you expect it to be?
What happened to you? I came to check on you, and you're saying hurtful things that break my heart.
I was telling you to take care of him.
Don't leave it to the servants.
Either you didn't know anything about his father or you were busy.
And I cry over work and leave the responsibility to you.
You are right, Mother.
Is there no hope for your sister?
This, you are right.
Khalid's behavior humiliated us in front of people.
I'm not seeing anyone.
Did you say anything to him?
That's my father's biggest mistake.
I'm in a weird and embarrassing predicament.
I didn't tell him.
"Put it on a CD and give it to him."
I'm going to the airport.
I'm very worried about him.
Our house has to be this dirty, Amal!
Okay, don't worry.
Khaled and his colleagues do not care about their family's reputation.
And the reputation of their brothers and sisters
Masha'Allah, which religious values have called them to this?
And they walk and dance and play.
In the ugly well.
Oh my goodness! Son, I don't understand.
Goodbye, Father.
My son, take care of yourself.
Yes, Dad, I have a small gift for you.
A gift for me!
Now put the CD in the laptop, I'm afraid of what will happen, come with me!
Oh, Mom.
It's unbelievable that my dad is still watching the CD, the video is only 3 minutes long.
It might be outside.
Where are you going? There's not enough time to go anywhere.
Answer me, what's wrong with you, Abu Saad?
Oh Father!
That's enough, Amal!
Even if I searched, I wouldn't find a solution.
To find someone with your morals.
But forgive me.
God bless you.
I see you're climbing onto the roof!
Yes, my love.
We live in an age of freedom.
The age of human rights, and no one owes us a duty.
If anyone has a riyal, they can get a thousand! Oh, my dear.
Sure, I can handle him. God bless America, my love.
Do you know that the prices are high now?
One thousand two hundred
God protect us from you, every time you talk to a driver, you ask him, "What is your salary?"
My salaries are very low.
When he sees me, he complains that my salary is low and there are no benefits. We agreed on a salary of 700, and you increased it by 100 when he got the license. What more does he want?
I told him, after you finish a year of work, we'll increase your salary.
He seems to be stingy and will have difficulties with him.
Shut up, shut up, just close your mouth, just be quiet, shut up, turn around and get it over with.
This is an easy word for you, easy.
It means you make him scream, I don't like going in the car with him.
Okay, just be yourself.
You told me the story now, I'm the man of the house. Walk, don't talk, you too don't talk, I'll handle this matter.
Hello, come! I need you outside, come!
Let's go.
What did I tell you?
I told them not to come to your room. Did I say that or not?
Oh sir, he's not my friend, he's my uncle.
He'll come in five minutes and then he'll leave if God wills it.
Five minutes!
And imagined!
Don't tell the lady I need a raise, I need a raise!
Everyone in the world is angry now.
And so, when did she give you eight hundred?
Oh sir, I have a lot of problems at home.
These cars in Doha are entering 1100, 1100100.
It can be one thousand one hundred forty-three.
Wait, I'm thinking.
Listen, I'm one hundred percent closed, I won't lift you.
You're not going to tell me you were born again, are you? Go get a job!
What did he say?
I'll tell you.
There's no point in 100.
There's no use in complaining.
I'm afraid for the screen.
Are you afraid?
All drivers speed.
As if they work outside for three or four thousand.
What's the problem? When you work at home, it's useless, but when you work outside, you make more money.
Oh God, I'm so scared.
See them, they're all drivers.
How much?
One thousand five hundred
But I'm afraid the police will take me and throw me in jail.
Okay, don't worry.
I guarantee it.
I was wearing my robe and praise be to God, about to go out.
I was waiting, but no one responded to me.
He opened his room and the wardrobe was empty.
The maid Mina ran away a year ago.
I will only say, God is sufficient for him.
Okay, I'm coming to you.
I went to the police.
No responsibility, no accountability.
We're doing everything we can.
And you too, if you see him around your neighborhood, you might find him and let us know.
Yes, he will benefit and when he is full, he will surrender himself.
We bring them in, we spend on them, we give them clothes, food, and driving training.
I'm following him.
The match has started now, come in, entry is better.
Yes, we were scared.
These are the Lexuses, and Lexuses aren't easily caught.
You know that if we don't score three more, it means we haven't won. We need eight or fifteen.
This is a clear insult, a clear insult. Let's be clear, this is a clear insult.
That's his level. If he doesn't score three, it's not the Liverpool team.
Woe betide you.
In us, in the players, and in the performance.
They don't have anything, they should be thankful if they caught three, they should be thankful.
What's the point of this, it's not working. Our team is still hungry, this is the horses' team, leave us alone, man.
You've scored a goal now, and you're relaxed and happy now.
Do you think there are other goals or is this the final one?
This fox is very good, it's very smart. It walks around and no one can catch it, it's amazing. This fox eats chickens.
No, I don't have a car.
You are my friend.
Did you hear what he said?
He said this fox is a big problem.
No one can take it.
Yes, sir!
Don't you understand?
He is a Foxes fan.
Sometimes "Invest in Yourself" appears on the show.
They will win today and you will lose.
I swear to God, I'll guide you. The "Al-Ghanous" team doesn't lose; they are always the winners.
Talib, what do you think of the result today?
Why are you asking me about the result?
Okay, Al-Farouq is the winner.
The birds came to take their share and flew away.
Let's reconcile a bit, don't you say Valencia won and go sky-high.
Those are foxes, my friend.
This fox takes the chicken and eats it.
I saw what he did at the stadium.
The audience never stops laughing at him.
That's clear from the professor, and thank you for listening.
The true fans who have genuine loyalty to the club.
He ate with wealthy Qataris who went to shopping malls and places like that.
I found my pot on the counter.
The world is strange, man.
The boy gave me five hundred riyals in front of me and paid the check.
What did you say about the poem you wrote about our match against Cardiff?
Thank you to all the listeners here.
You're welcome.
You won't smell that our team is leading yours by four.
Say nasty things, say nasty things about the club and the team and see what happens!
Don't say it!
When he drove a fox away from them.
The reason behind it is a crane.
A player was expelled from the Robbers team.
I changed his name from Hakim to Ghabi.
Thank you, thank you, thank you to all the listeners here.
Every month, we meet to choose the best fan.
Oh wow, and who chose you for the thank you of the month?
The president of the council is the one who will be determined.
Not brothers, and each of you is like a camel.
I manage this big club. Thaloub.
Come on, let's see the driver who escaped from us, he's on TV, come on.
Is this him?
One of them speaks well, the other doesn't say anything.
What do you think, is it a pen or a watch?
Now, I know how to reach him.
The audience is scattered.
After him.
He headed here.
The driver was speeding.
We've lost him now.
Oh, wow!
Silence, you have no right to act. I am the head of the house and I make the decisions.
We need to be sure.
Majid Abdulrahman Al-Subaiti
Yes, yes, yes, may God accept it from you.
I am from the Al-Utbah tribe.
Buy it and register it in my name. No, no, no, no, I don't want to live in it, I already have a house.
I just want to invest.
Since the investment price increased, God bless you.
How can I help you, folks! What do you need?
God have mercy on you.
Come on, guys! Coffee?
You have nothing to say, may God have mercy on you, I don't need you, may God succeed you.
You're saying I'm sure, is that good? You'll embarrass us in front of the rich!
I'm very worried.
Mama, mama, I'm mama.
Now, I don't know what your father is going to do to us.
Oh, Mom, I didn't mean it!
Oh mom, don't tell dad.
Your father is going to turn the house upside down.
He's definitely going to kill you now.
Oh mother, I swear by the Lord of the House, I didn't break it on purpose.
Oh mom, why don't we buy some glue and stick ourselves together?
What are we going to be committed to, my son?
How can we find another like this? I don't know where your brother bought it, it was a gift.
Anxious about you because of him/her.
Oh mother, I'm afraid he's going to hit me.
I'll lock the door until I find a solution to this problem.
Come on, quickly, go to your room.
Blind, blind, blind! Are you blind?
Do you have to be blind to break the rose? Do you become blind (by doing so)?
Oh mom, hasn't Wael come to you yet?
No, oh! My daughter, he didn't bring you. What happened to you?
He ran away from home; he's afraid of his father.
This is not right. Someone check on the boy!
This is not acceptable behavior, may God guide you, my daughter!
What should we do now, Mama?
I don't know what to do!
Okay, but I was worried about him with the car on the street.
God protect him, I think he went to the supermarket or went to the neighbors to play with the children.
Yes, he is sweet, kind, and lovable. My daughter.
No, my daughter, seek refuge in Allah from Satan and do not be afraid. I hope everything will be alright.
My daughter, goodbye.
Where is his father?
My father will tell me to hit him.
Oh grandmother, Father will kill me with his beating.
"I wonder, don't worry! My light of eyes."
My love, don't worry!
I won't let him hit you.
I'd rather break it than walk.
Come on, son! Hey there, come have some water and rest in my room.
You look pale.
May God guide him, may God guide him. Come with me, my son, for a moment.
Oh, Lord of mercy.
I'm afraid my father is coming close by.
My son, have faith!
He keeps interfering in the upbringing of my son.
This is my son, and I am raising him the way I want.
But the big job makes him anxious, and he slips and is terrified of doing something he didn't intend to do.
Why doesn't Misha have eyes?
I let him see!
The bag accidentally hit the rose. Believe me, he didn't wish for that.
You! You have to support him!
I wish you wouldn't speak for me. I forgive him today, his fear breaks my heart.
But where, where is he now? Why is he here at this time?
What is here.
He's here! Where?
Inside, inside!
No, no, I'll take it to my brother today.
Why didn't he bring something other than this old thing?
O champion of truth! O my brother, let's play!
And your mother says you're studying!
Your father, just this game only and we'll learn!
Won't it be possible for you to have an exam tomorrow?
Yes, Dad.
Come on, dad, go and don't spoil the game.
Come on, Daddy, come. Don't be shy. Come on, Daddy, we'll wait.
What? What are you saying! %Pw. Listen to me,
If you don't come back, I'll call your uncle Abu Walid now.
No, no, no, no. Don't tell my brother, don't tell my brother, no!
Alright, bro.
He said, "I don't know, you don't listen to me."
Come on. Everyone take their book and start studying.
Dad, put your phone in your pocket. We're going to study, Dad, but don't tell my brother.
Mom, I really don't know. I don't know what to do?
I'm afraid if he finds out, he'll cause us trouble.
He'll surely ask me, "Why are you taking him to the hospital?"
Okay, what's the problem, if you tell him?
If he knows that Waleed is peeing in his bed, he'll kill him.
Oh, Mom, it's his responsibility. It's all his fault.
Oh my daughter, this affects the soul.
The boy is not a child, he is now twenty years old.
That's enough, my daughter.
You're coming to eat with us, and I'll give him a few hints.
And I feel his breath.
Her mother went to Bahrain to buy abayas.
This is just disgusting, my daughter.
Fun and shopping.
She promises that he sleeps in his bed every night.
Oh my son, he pees in his bed every night and doesn't tell me about it.
He said it's necessary to take him to the hospital so he can recover.
Her husband is stupid.
And he doesn't understand anything.
It's true.
They need to take him to the hospital. Oh, my son, so they can find out what he's suffering from.
And he's looking for a good dry hose.
He was beaten until they heard the last man in the neighborhood scream.
Sit!
Oh my daughter, eat!
Okay, I didn't say anything.
Take this and walk quickly. Take a shower, I'll bring you some clothes. Go!
Please.
I need to whip them.
Don't harass!
Do you call this a date?
And Khalood did 49 out of 50.
Is this a pass?
But their grades are good.
He told them that if you don't get a perfect score of 50 out of 50, you'll be imprisoned.
I wish you wouldn't give them to your brother!
They need to square up.
They are my children.
Come on, please, this is the last time.
Why isn't it fifty-fifty, fifty-fifty?
He has another need.
Owe him, don't bring him to public places.
Last night we met with the hospital and they told him why he shouldn't enter. It's not allowed for him.
You are different, submissive, not dear to us.
Silence! Let me scold his brother.
Listen, uncle, I'm going to die, stop, stop, stop, stop. I'm going to die, listen, uncle.
Indulge yourself after I've hurt you.
Not yet, this isn't a hug, don't you see the deadline, if not from you I'll get fifty.
I'll keep draining the pool.
I will fill it with oil.
Is this carpet thorny? Is this carpet thorny?
This is saying that it will be corrected tomorrow.
Khaled Abdul Rahman
Yay! Khaled, that's very good.
Faisal Abdullah Rashid
Excellent! Well done, Faisal.
God have mercy on you.
You are an outstanding student and you were second in your class.
The professor is crying because he got 49 out of 50 in math.
The professor is worried about his father because his father wants him to run a 50 by 50.
Oh son! I'm talking to you!
Call, call his colleagues.
He said, "I met him near the school's playground."
Call, call your mother, she might be at your grandfather's.
No, he didn't go there.
Okay, where is he? Where is he?
There is no power or might except by Allah.
What happened to him? Welcome, brother!
Ah, of course he failed and he's afraid for his family.
No, he didn't fail, but he was a mediocre student and ranked second in his class.
But he was too scared to go back home.
Because he only got a grade of two in math.
God have mercy on him.
Walid, Walid.
Walid, Walid.
Come here, Waleed.
Forty, forty and a thousand, I lost two or three points, whatever. I won't say anything, I won't punish you or hit you. And the hand,
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
and nuclear energy
representing sixty percent of the world's oil reserves
And Saudi Arabia leads with two-thirds of the world's reserves.
Then Libya, America, and Nigeria.
With three percent each, then the rest of the world combined with fifteen percent.
And for this reason
And also production.
And this could be one of the secrets and reasons behind the attempts of major industrial countries to seize the region and its countries.
And above them is the United States of America, the largest consumer of oil in the world.
But oil prices are rising continuously.
At the same time as the decline in the price of the US dollar
Which is used as a unit for pricing oil.
Yesterday, the price of one barrel reached
This led to an increase in income in producing countries and at the same time
To heighten the inflation rate for him.
In places where inflation in some of those countries reached fifteen percent
The most important source of energy in the world
Prices of commodities and cost of living
In a direct conversation with the Deputy Prime Minister
Minister of State for Energy and Industry of Qatar
Abdullah bin Humayd Al-Atiqi
And for viewers who want to participate, they can call us on the program's phone numbers.
Professor Deputy, welcome.
I would like to start with the unprecedented oil prices that have been reached.
Where can the prices go?
Sure, the place where prices might reach is a puzzling question.
Or what we call market forces
Aren't you from OPEC?
And not the producing countries?
Neither the producing countries nor OPEC have anything to do with oil prices.
Is the only relationship of price between supply and demand?
So far, supply and demand have nothing to do with a lot.
Okay, what are the factors?
Additives are more than the requirement of the gift and the request.
What made investors
Feeling a lot of pressure, he turned to trading gold and oil, also known as commodity marketing.
Investors have lost confidence in financial markets.
And he also went.
We have seen gold increase from $1,200 to $1,790 in recent years.
And so far, as I said before, about twenty-nine dollars.
But they are all on the rise, and if they fall, it will be only a slight decline.
Stay with me so you remember that in the first quarter of this year
What is the second quarter that will see a decline in prices due to reduced demand for oil?
But we saw the market in a thrilling and strangely transformative state.
In the second quarter and the beginning of spring, it rises above $100.
But this means that the previous factors that determined the rise in prices in winter and their consumption have now changed, and other factors have emerged.
and economic growth
And at the same time, we see oil prices rising to this level.
He pointed to political factors and said that political tensions play a role in it.
On Iran. Do you think Fallon's resignation is in light of political complexities?
What was a companion and today led most activities of American newspapers and world press. It can affect oil prices.
Yes, one thousand percent, and today?
Today, we are in the era of globalization, and influence comes quickly.
Unrealistic factors may influence.
And caused some disruption in the market.
They also create some types of political rumors.
He said there was no plan, but he did not rule out other options that might apply to Iran.
And markets always respond to uncertainty.
Of course, nothing is confirmed about America going to war with Iran right now.
And I am one of the people who don't see this scenario.
And it's possible that there, we didn't see what will happen in the future.
But it's us who work in the energy sector.
We observe that these political tensions
In the world's oil supply
In return, there are very profitable supplies.
This indicates that oil is going into storage.
And there is never any shortage of oil supplies.
Perhaps preparing for the next war.
In light of this clear picture you're presenting about supply, there are no obstacles in the supply chain.
If President Bush and the United States decided to change their plan.
This is something else.
Prices will rise to record-high levels.
Oil prices may rise.
Global oil reserves
You are here, today the Gulf represents the most important thing.
In addition to Iraq, Iran, and other Gulf states
Today, they are exploiting more than 60% of this proven oil reserve.
You today
If a very small story happened.
Therefore, it indicates.
Which means that in the event of any war with Iran, there is no guarantee of what will happen to oil prices.
God knows if today he may arrive, we have arrived without him.
Wars up to one hundred and seven, one hundred and ten dollars, and it may go up to one hundred and ten, God knows.
Today's oil is under political and psychological pressure, just as I told you.
And the intruders took advantage of these tensions.
Invest only in oil.
Or, as they say, it's not really an investment, nor is it buying the future or marketing the future.
And they call it paper oil.
And it's all guesswork in the oil paper.
Her total production does not exceed three hundred thousand barrels or less.
Since people can buy more than the upgrade.
Oh, I hope April and Fluff are well.
Oh God, let it not be.
The novel says that the Chinese man is coming to the area, and this is on his main agenda.
Shiny is the owner of this project, as many politicians and media personalities have said.
Okay, I didn't know what was in that old lady's bag.
And I won't be able to predict what's in it, meaning.
Will he ignite the war?
America is in transition.
And why doesn't the builder do something else?
Let's see what happens. If it's about April, April is almost here, just a few weeks and we'll be in April.
And the world can pay.
And America is a big consumer.
In the Gulf countries
Gulf is the hard number.
Impossible to throw this number.
Their production costs are very low.
In contrast to West African countries, most of which rely on
The Gulf, there is no other country in the world capable of
See, we've heard this talk from the West and America for many years.
Use
Until the last breath, and do you remember the tale of the Caspian War?
What are these dreams, then?
When you're chatting with Westerners in a close circle
We heard you speaking in a different way.
What are they saying?
On supplies, the importance of the region, and the value of reserves.
When I asked one of the European officials, I said: "It's strange that you speak among us in closed rooms."
Not the same way you talk in front.
The media said: "Political reasons come first."
And of course, there's something called "double standards" or two languages.
The language that the Gulf Cooperation Council countries know.
I have importance today like Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
The largest producer and exporter of oil in the world
For her entrance.
Despite all this
Head of the Central Region
Start a war with Iran.
Even with an aerial war or airstrikes, as they say.
In the supplies
You're not late, you're actually very giving.
I disagree with what you're saying.
Okay, we don't deal with Westerners either.
We deal with America.
Where are the good prices?
Whatever the nationality of this market is
I meant non-renewable energy, I mean.
"For (various) gracious acceptances"
Arab Generosity
Come on, give it to me.
Observers say that the real price of oil
The reason behind the rise in oil prices
You are Gulf citizens, OPEC, and countries.
You are very generous with Americans, and you are insistent on keeping their currencies.
I said the price of oil should be seventy dollars.
I said the actual price for the dollar's depreciation is between sixty and seventy.
Okay, now the price is 100.
For one and nine, as the dollar dropped by ten percent.
And now it's over a hundred dollars.
If we take the ratio and scale
No one disputes that.
And one of the main reasons
In contrast, with the decline of the US dollar
If we take
This is a comparison.
Oil prices
Because the United States of America
Of course, it's beneficial for us right now if the dollar price decreases.
A weakness or recession in the American economy, the United States cannot "do anything"
So what happened to this weakness and this economic stagnation?
You too, likewise, become.
The United States reduces benefits on the dollar.
Why do you insist on linking oil to the dollar?
Let's talk about the reason for linking the price of oil to the dollar.
The first one, for more than 100 years.
The first person to export the first barrel of oil was from the United States of America.
And it was sold in dollars.
And it has been from the twentieth century until today.
Pricing oil in dollars
Historically, became
And since the world is changing and raising prices from before the time of Adam.
And in which country Norway is considered today the third largest oil-producing nation
And an oil-exporting country.
Russia is the second-largest exporter of oil.
And the production of the North Field in Europe.
The price is in dollars, not in...
Everything in the world is changing, there are other sources and information that indicate something different.
You, Gulf countries
Secret agreements between you and the Americans.
And oil became the real cover.
This is true and does not exist.
And these agreements
As long as oil still underpins the dollar, and the United States underpins these regimes, the situation remains as is.
This is not true, and there are no secret agreements.
Today, let's take Quebec.
You are awarded sixty-six percent honorary vice.
Among thirteen countries
Out of fifty-eight barrels, forty percent are allocated to OPEC.
There are very large countries that produce oil.
Outside OPEC
What are the problems that prevent pricing in the second currency?
Search for prices in another currency.
Isn't that how it is when the elders decide?
You, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states, are a shining star.
Today's OPEC class is like normal.
Sixty percent
Even if we assume that OPEC wanted that.
There is an agreement among all oil-producing countries.
Guidance and the will to change.
What kind of attempt?
But now these countries cannot change the currency of prices.
Unless agreed
What is the effect of
Let's talk now about Europe.
Don't crush their oil.
From the North Sea or Russia or Norway in euros or rubles
Because it is useful to them, their currency is strong and expensive.
No, on the contrary.
Here is where they lost.
They need one lira and half a barrel.
You're the one losing out because the value of your currency dipped since it's linked to the dollar.
He's also losing badly, a very big loss.
The currency peg here in the Gulf has a historical connection.
Do you remember when the dollar was the strongest currency in the world?
And now I understand, when you talk about withdrawal.
This is how we write when we get married.
And you want to get a divorce, it's not easy.
What are they?
Or that you married a Catholic for a dollar.
And costs must be examined in a way
It was professionally inspected and examined.
And thus, like Kuwait, it dismantled 25% of its dollar currency.
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar
He can adjust his currency rate.
Today about this topic, but this means you have no intention of studying or thinking about it.
The exam, of course, varies, stated the esteemed Prime Minister.
The Qatari currency is reported to be undervalued by thirty percent.
Is in this study.
There's no way that you and the others are going to handle this matter alone.
Kuwait also went its own way, why won't it be linked to its cause?
Experts say it is more profitable for countries and their people than losing.
But we
And nothing else.
that these four Gulf states declare
Everyone believes.
And I intend to support them personally.
"Hawayd supports her."
It must be included in the study.
In his state, in his condition.
Did he make one or two of them?
Until the time of the coming of the currency
So you don't lose the situation now.
Surely there are experts who will set up this studio.
And they will be the ones.
Okay, that's not something for experts, it needs a political decision.
Let's wait and not rush now, see what happens today.
People started... meaning
Sure, I collaborate and support.
Honorable Sir, the inflation rate in Qatar in 2007 reached fourteen percent and will reach fifteen percent next year.
Eating people's wages, swallowing their wages, the wages of workers here.
Salaries of Qatar's residents have eroded by 35 to 40 percent.
I'll get back to you after the break to let you know the size of the salary increases.
For employees in Qatar, at least for the coming period, so stay with us.
Welcome back to the program "Without Borders" in this episode where we host the First Deputy and Minister of Energy of Qatar.
And the industry of Abdullah bin Hamjad Al Thani on the huge increase in prices.
in oil, which brought billions of dollars to the Gulf and oil-producing countries
Regarding oil, and my question was about the upcoming increase in employees' salaries, but before this increase, I would like to give you some important information.
The United Arab Emirates has seven out of ten billion barrels of oil reserves and produces two out of six million barrels per day.
"It is only carried, and the report in the Al-Raya newspaper is an economic report, and the revenues of the Gulf are among the largest."
Saudi Arabia expected revenues of $117 billion in 2008.
And it was
For more than one hundred and seventy last year, sixty-six in the United Arab Emirates this year, and was expected to be sixty-seven.
Kuwait was sixty-six and was seventy-five.
21 billion barrels of oil plus 55 billion.
From gas, as other reports mentioned, and God forbid, there is no envy, meaning we don't argue with Professor Deputy.
Iraq has forty-seven billion.
Trillion and a half meters
Regarding expenses, the amount was one and a half trillion dollars.
Gulf countries topped with a value of one thousand billion, meaning one trillion.
Dollar, there was a diversity in imports.
American investment was three hundred billion dollars.
And nine out of ten trillion.
In Bahrain, it was three percent.
In 2007, in Amman, it was 6.5 and increasing to 7, while in Qatar, it was 13.75 but increasing to 15% in Qatar.
This means that those living in Qatar can expect a high cost of living and high goods prices.
Life is getting harder, prices are rising to very high levels, and there is also an increase in Qatar.
We understand everyone.
Then the solution must be
And the solution means that it aims to control inflation.
This means you will increase their salaries by 50 percent.
They will say you are against raising wages.
Not correct (Or, more idiomatically: That's not right)
And in the cabinet, against raising salaries.
Wisdom is that it is a problem, and dream leads to the better dream.
And there is no alternative solution.
Okay, there's a balance between the two.
And that's it, finished.
The most important thing is to solve inflation.
And here in Qatar, devouring.
It is a happiness that was issued to form.
And he places
And lays a strong foundation.
To solve the problem and control inflation
The most important thing now is to control inflation.
Inflation
If you can't control it
And Your Highness, the Deputy, now.
who specialized in market studies and was published last February, days before
Among them because of the salaries for
Now you're solving inflation and letting inflation eat away at these people's income.
Many of them now.
Revenue to other countries
Raise our wages first, then solve inflation, and lower them again.
I repeat what they say, which is to balance the subject.
But now
And not a temporary solution.
Increase it in intensity more.
Therefore, here.
To end inflation
The feeling of boredom will always remain.
Given that the increase was enormous over the past year, right?
The second point is
And those working in the private sector are not like those working in the public sector.
The private sector is very neglected.
Now, this issue of the increase must also be looked at fairly.
I don't know where I got these notes for you.
We live in Qatar, Your Excellencies, not in Germany.
I'm telling you the opposite; today, the private sector has started to pay.
That's the most important.
Some of the nationalists who were working in government offices moved to the private sector.
Due to high salaries.
He faced a problem.
Let's move to the private sector because it's more important and dynamic.
And he gives good salaries.
Attached to what is called market forces.
Market of Power
They don't come with many high-level certificates.
They don't come to Kuwait because Kuwait has low salaries or low expenses.
Or with expenses it comes.
"Tamam, with our clear understanding."
I'm not expecting anything, and I'm not telling you that there's a raise in salary.
There's no hope either.
To control inflation
Let's give him some time.
Controlling inflation
And, God willing, that's what the report said, that Qatar in 2008
By the grace of God, we say thus.
Let's see if the settings for this number will change.
Spray it on the people.
This is a professional operation.
Of course, with all professionalism and everything.
Inflation
Because spending
A lot of things on different projects.
I wish I could hear questions from the audience, and I hope everyone will ask a direct question. Abdulaziz Mohammed from Morocco, your question, brother Abdulaziz.
His business is based on ruling families in the Gulf.
Therefore, what I believe the justification for that is the difference in OPEC's organization.
Secondly, the total oil revenue should go directly to the governorates.
Then to the royal family, and the rest will be spent on development.
In the absence of accountability, the situation will remain as is.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Hello, my brother Ahmed.
I won't prolong the discussion. My brother mentioned the ruling family, the regimes, and the issue of pegging the Qatari riyal to the dollar, or linking other Gulf currencies to the dollar.
America wants to give the world a little and let it finish its madness.
American capacity has become insufficient, and trade between China and America reached forty-eight billion dollars.
In addition, the European Union with funding of sixty-six billion dollars.
This means that all trends in global politics are against the dollar.
And we, as Arab nations and Gulf oil states, are paying the price for its consequences now.
It will end in a confrontation between America.
And among the developed countries of the world such as China, Russia, and others, the problem may increase.
Pure army
China's explosions and Russia's bombs and Japan's bombs and American bombs too.
Many thanks for this explanation and this information.
Your question, Muhammad.
Hello, your question.
Can you lower the TV volume and ask your question?
Your entire question
But from what I saw, his teacher couldn't bear to answer.
The topic of decoupling from the dollar due to its depreciation.
And with God's will, he will reach the bottom.
And he is a good man.
Matisha follows the style of the Arab brothers.
Thank you, Brother Mohamed, thank you. Now we call for the final intervention from Ahmed Hassan from Qatar, your question, Ahmed.
Good evening, too.
Thank you and thank you for the great interview.
What's required is a salary increase, God willing, things will improve.
The situation is correct, we're all facing problems, it's not about salaries at all.
By God's grace, affairs.
Okay, tell me your question quickly.
I'm waiting for your reply. Do you have a question?
All this is because of the high prices. The increase has affected all goods, and they are all being exported.
I am from Europe.
In the Arab world, we have factories and laboratories.
Thank you, Ahmed, thank you for taking your time.
Now, the issue of rising prices is an important one.
The man told you, "Keep the poor in mind, Your Excellency."
Everyone has a phone, those who don't are considered poor.
Here for some brothers we are.
The opinion says that everyone understands Qatar.
For the State of Qatar, this is not true.
Today, anyone coming to Qatar can see the indicators.
What are the growth indicators in Qatar?
Highest growth indicators in the world
This wealth, where does it go? And what do you do with it?
What within the framework of a response
When the Moroccan's speech was not true or realistic.
"What the eye doesn't see"
If he comes and sees Qatar and how much great development is happening there.
Frankly, you're right, you're asking.
Everyone has the right.
And since you are a small people, where will you find people?
You really mean you're going to get these expensive things from China, for example?
Okay, we're aiming to export, God willing.
The country is based on a plan and
The ideal independence of a sum of money comes from oil and gas, and everyone knows that oil and gas will run out one day.
that Qatar will become
This is considered one of the best achievements in the Arab world.
Today as well
Focus on
And that will have a huge impact.
Beyond Oil and Gas
That's why it's not like Dubai.
Every country has its own unique characteristics.
In the State of Qatar, we focused on education.
On the components
This has a medical city, people go there to get treated.
There will be a media city that will adapt.
Of course, the world today, today we must build.
Building a vision
Beyond Oil and Gas
There were fatal errors.
And unfortunately, we did not welcome this change because it surprised us.
And we were not prepared for it, neither in terms of human resources, nor technically, nor even educationally.
Now it's been changed after two-thirds of a year.
And even better than that.
Today there is a vision.
And Vishnu
And vision
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I also thank our audience.
To get in touch with us, we hope we have provided you with
Qatar's foreign policy appears blurry to many observers.
Qatar enjoys special relations.
And at the same time, Qatar had relations with Israel and still does.
From the Islamic Resistance Movement "Hamas"
And the State of Qatar has
started
The largest Arab country
What angered the regime in Egypt
As much as some accuse him of conspiring against Egypt
Qatar's bow was not far from the important files.
Like Darfur, the Houthis in Yemen and even Israeli prisoners.
Gilad Shalit, Qatar's foreign policy hand was extended to him in a way that angered the largest states in the Arab world.
And what kind of power puts him in a position like this?
Achievements of this
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani
Write to us via our website www.Aljazeera.net
Welcome, Your Excellency
On September 22, 2007, to Saudi Arabia.
The visit marked a shift in the relationship between the two countries over the past two years.
Redrawing the borders
Wash what was present.
This is what was said.
In the Hijaz newspaper or magazine
The one who was traveling with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and with whom you arrived at the same time, the Saudi ambassador has returned.
To Doha
First, your introduction was very long and needed a lot of answers without your final question.
I think you gave it to him/her.
Especially regarding Saudi Arabia.
What's correct?
Saudi Arabia is very important to Qatar.
Between the two states.
I spoke about the island's silence.
I spoke about a revolutionary movement.
I believe these matters have been clarified by both parties.
And we agreed on the clarification.
In the State of Qatar
Disagreement with Saudi Arabia
He was always limited in scope.
From perspectives
And, by the grace of God, this was due to the wisdom of the two leaders.
King Abdullah and His Royal Highness Prince
Noticeably in the Gulf
More than a hundred years
They were bright, good, and based on trust.
I want to clarify a misunderstanding between two poets.
This matter has been addressed, and there were no conditions.
In solving any issue
But there was understanding and there was sincere intent between the parties.
To resolve this pending issue
And this is not seasonal, but a strategic relationship.
We desire that it not stagnates, but evolves.
A pleasant diplomatic conversation.
Saudi Arabia will withdraw its ambassador from Qatar.
I wasn't going to speak diplomatically, nor did I consider it a big problem.
I always say what I'm sure of.
Saudi Arabia is therefore not diplomatic but a validation.
The subject of the island is facing media problems.
Between the parties and many countries were involved in the midst.
Thinking that they can gain points at the expense of other countries.
Or at the expense of Qatar.
Or at the expense of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
Reconciles in the Gulf House
That's a half step forward compared to before.
This is part of a political agreement.
No, no, there was no contract, just an agreement of love and care.
But otherwise, you can ask the island management.
Have you established strategic relations between yourselves and Saudi Arabia to prevent what happened before?
It was based on a close strategy.
Can we say this in one, three, and four?
And there must be unity.
Some differences were resolved accordingly.
Between some Arab countries and attempts to reconcile other disputes.
Because now, if we observe the differences in the Arab world, they are all differences based on different perspectives.
When we find a point of view about a certain policy in a certain procedure in a certain issue, and another country has a different opinion.
This represents two points of view.
Some observers believe that you enjoy criticizing Saudi Arabia.
Travel on it.
I was tired and decided to walk in a different direction, and from there I went to a bigger country, Egypt.
Rest, the subject remains as is.
We don't enjoy comfort or discomfort, there's nothing to do.
Dealing with any party in this manner
In other words, the reasons for the dispute with Saudi Arabia are over.
Between them, and I know there's a lot of understanding.
And you know that we built
And there will be a kind of model.
But Saudi Arabia
I want to write this in two lines.
You started with a dispute with Egypt, Al-Ahram newspaper, 8th issue, last April.
The Official Egyptian Gazette
In a comprehensive investigation, it was reported that lengthy investigations
In Hezbollah's network, a sabotage plot was revealed.
This refers to Egypt, three participating countries, which are Iran, Syria, and Qatar.
Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood
And a well-known media echo for its role in the conspiracy.
Qatar, the smallest Arab country.
Conspiracy against Egypt
We respect.
And his suffering over the years.
I won't say this to yell at anyone or to influence anyone.
Let me finish, I'm not done yet.
We can
Egyptian President
And who is guiding us?
On Arab relations
The first point
Gaza Issue
As they say and as we admit
Qatar is
A state of smaller size
This could be part of this talk.
Because we have suffered from the interventions of other countries in the past, and we don't want to go back to that.
After the interference of some countries in Qatar's affairs
Hence, the policy of His Highness's government.
Now, when they discovered what they call a conspiracy.
The thing I want to say is that God can protect the house, and Syria and Iran can protect themselves; I won't protect them.
If Egypt stabilizes
And why would Qatar want to change or interfere in such a matter?
And the temples, they produce things out of nothing.
He said that the small state of Qatar had sought to undermine Egypt's role and its relations with Turkey and the European Union.
And you made it a shield, a balance against the darkness of the Arabs, to outpace the light.
And you're using Media Horn, this is Al Jazeera channel.
Yes, okay.
With Hezbollah
And they are traveling with Him in a state of remembrance.
But I can say that we're certain.
That
The principle is non-interference in such circumstances.
We imposed on our brothers in Egypt, and for that we blame the Egyptian officials.
Disagreements directed at some members of the Egyptian government
But some officials have problems with
With what?
Come for that.
The days are filled with the scent of bliss and tranquility, and the reason for this tranquility is us.
And it was previously stored in Egypt.
And then what?
Because Israel
We have a disagreement with her.
There is no disagreement with the management.
And now, because of the conference, from that day on.
Any Islamic conference, any Arab conference, they are sensitive.
This is an allergy.
Why aren't you sitting with them?
Let me finish.
And we always hope for the best.
We discovered that this sensitivity
Or three
Gaza Conference that took place
This Egypt doesn't want to be in Qatar.
What does that mean?
In Qatar and that there is a summit in Kuwait, we told them.
The Palestinian people were under attack.
More than two weeks
But we maintain it before any arranged conference, the Kuwait conference where we were the first to attend.
People are dying and
And with laziness
The conflict began.
No small country can
I know there are some uncles in the government, and that's an offense to Egypt, not to anyone else.
When they said afterwards
Okay, you're on the island.
And the Israelis were informed the day before of a ceasefire that would halt the clashes before any speech or anyone or anything.
What is it?
My brother allowed the doctor and the food to enter and left them in the state of beating that our sisters were subjected to.
When they said the gate was narrow
Trucks' past
When they tell us that there's an agreement from the other party and they have to come.
Now is not the time to side with Fatah or Hamas.
I don't care about Fatah or Hamas; we were concerned about the one and a half million, six hundred and fifty thousand people who were being beaten.
And whoever doesn't have a remedy.
When we started talking about this topic and discussing the Gaza conference
And the involvement of the State of Qatar in this matter affects the Egyptian regime.
Don't move or interfere.
Didn't we say how Egypt will solve the issue since it's within its jurisdiction?
An official said, "We have uncovered a major plot outside this."
We still haven't been told the story.
This is me, that is, officially.
She's telling us that Egypt is big.
Okay, we understand that Egypt is a large Arab country, and we always say that it is a big country.
That's what always makes us ask a lot from a great nation.
Because Egypt is ours.
And I was invited to a conference where there was also provocation for them.
You didn't take us to the conference.
Reconstruction of Gaza
And we cooperated and had one place.
People are suffering in Gaza.
Forbidden, I know that Turkey entered through Israel.
Believe me, I'll be happy if I see her among our friends in Egypt.
This is part of us.
Even if Egypt wins or does good political work.
Yes, we believe this is what will make a difference for us in Qatar, and also for all of Japan.
Egypt's stability is very important to us.
If he does a good job, that's important to us.
Finish your question, your introduction took a quarter of an hour.
The situation now has lost me.
Okay, I'll tell you, I'll tell you now, anger.
Who are the officials in the Egyptian system responsible for you?
We are behind the failure of the Qatar summit.
Secondly, it was they who failed at the Qatar conference.
King Abdullah enjoyed the wisdom he desired.
And how does the sinner seek forgiveness?
That's why he intervened and prevented some countries from attending.
And I said this to our youth in Saudi Arabia because
No disagreements with Saudi Arabia even on this matter.
Because, as explained, there is an internal problem.
Or the officials
Among high-ranking officials
A large country, where an official discovers that a small country is doing such things.
He meant a lot to you there.
Takes on any role
Darfur is part of the national security of Egypt and Sudan.
The five big countries decided.
Any other country besides Qatar could be doing well.
But these sensitivities will only exacerbate the situation. Why do you have to add your noise to everything around you?
We want to solve this clot, take an antihistamine, they need to tell us what this clot is.
Why are you so sensitive?
That some brothers from the government
Their hands are eager, they have an internal failure.
You want to focus on a conspiracy in Gaza Revolution.
This is what the English say, "Blame the Italians."
All that happens
Not only instructions, but also analyses.
We know what happened because
The issue must be resolved locally.
And we have no escape.
My priority is my country.
My priority is to first investigate the reasons that concern my country.
Then I'll see if I have enough time.
And to look at the reasons that worry my Arab country.
Or Qatar tried to reconcile.
And thinking about any Arab issue in which you can contribute as much as possible.
Why is this provocative? How can it not be taken as a goodwill gesture?
I won't be able to fix you.
I can explain my point of view.
Don't put it on me.
And from our perspective
What comes from the heart.
Let me finish.
When he announced an initiative for reconciliation and all the leaders gathered in Kuwait, we hoped for something good and welcomed it.
There are recordings.
Of course, the Egyptian official who clarified his heroism.
In a report, television interview, or something like that, I won't answer it.
Because I have a response to every point.
But to maintain the minimum of ties that bind us and unite Arab interests.
This is also a response to the call made by Houache, which was led by Sidi El-Haffaf for the two holy mosques.
But what I can tell him and anyone else is
And they try to correct their mistakes, either on their own or with external help.
In politics, economics, or otherwise, we have our own mistakes in politics and economics, and thus no one is infallible.
Because they are accusing Qatar of all these charges.
Do you deny there's a connection between Qatar and Al-Heed?
This is a fun topic.
To distort Egyptian relations, undermine its role, and disrupt its communications with Turkey and the European Union.
While at first we were very few.
If we could do this Russian thing.
This is not correct.
I have some personal accusations against you.
Money is being paid to Shalit's captives so that Qatar can take over Shalit and surpass Egypt's role in this matter.
She always claims we paid money, first of all we didn't pay money and didn't talk to anyone about paying money.
But this situation
We support Egypt in resolving the issue, just as we support and continue to support it in resolving the issue between the Palestinians.
It was he who allowed the Palestinian president to stay until the issue is resolved.
We were there and the first to defend the State of Qatar.
In support and assistance to Palestinian institutions to ensure their continuity until the conflict is resolved.
And we said:
"He said no, we did it because we believe that some people don't want this."
But we did it cleverly.
Is he talking to his boss?
Prime Minister
I don't know much about the problem.
From us and from them, I don't know.
They decided now in the last twelfth issue in April past exclusively with Shorouk Newspaper
That the political leadership in Egypt has decided to launch a satellite news channel to counter the "media scythe" known as Al Jazeera and...
It's a matter of days, and everything will end.
Are you afraid that Al Jazeera will become a thing of the past?
So now we're living in a stage of political maturity?
Also focused on Saudi Arabia, Tamim bin Hamad met with the Saudi king.
I don't go along with them, nor do I go along with them either.
We treated them as brothers.
A small country making concessions to the large country Egypt.
There is an important point in Qatar that we need to clarify.
The relationship between Qatar and Saudi Arabia is different.
And then we talk.
Okay, what's your opinion on the relationship between Qatar and Egypt?
We rely on him heavily.
Let's be honest with you.
Or is it a disagreement on the main policy?
I hope it's not a personal issue because we don't have any personal issues. I told you that we respect the people of Egypt.
If I asked you, you'd say there are two problems: Gaza and what else?
This situation has affected all of us very deeply.
We want to soar from this psychological perspective, however complex it may be.
Published in some newspapers
Minister of Foreign Affairs
In the presence of H.R.H. Prince Saud Al-Faisal
Tell us about everything.
But it's clear that things got complicated and didn't happen.
No, he didn't hear.
I won't be able to let you know my connection to Egypt.
They are exaggerating, and it's their right as siblings.
And we blame them for their youthful rights.
With a big country, we don't want to compare ourselves to any other big country.
Egypt is great in happiness.
The problem isn't a matter of life and death, but the solution comes from heaven.
They should satisfy anyone who is waiting.
Or wait for a way.
In Qatar
You will deal with non-relatives or siblings.
As a great nation, we indeed turn with joy to the cornerstone of isolation, for what is a great nation without it?
But if someone gives someone unreal to someone.
I know Israel is doing this to us.
Is America's policy towards me for or against me from the previous administration?
I don't trust that they want to imitate Israel or America in this matter.
Even if we take their policies, they are also under pressure from third parties.
In many cases, let me finish.
We understand and know that some orders are even for a large country.
What controls your policies?
Our machines move without a will, the only thing that moves us is one.
Qatar's internal affairs are an internal matter for us.
And whenever we can help the Arab world, we will help.
Sources of power: Island and friendship are the foundation.
Can you say that this is not strength?
Our trust is in God.
Or seeing His Highness the Prince.
Let's go hang out with someone.
Leave me alone to think, I won't let go of my own hand.
And we don't want to compete with anyone.
Don't underestimate it, great Qatar or otherwise.
But we have a point of view.
First, we evacuated the Israeli office and closed it down.
First, they said close the office, so we did, and they got angry and went to complain to the Americans. Do you believe these people?
Join the team known as the Devil's Team
They don't speak.
Americans and Britons, these are my friends, and I know how to deal with them.
The plan
It was made.
This is a flaw. We've reached a certain point, and then what?
Tell me now.
How do you plan to solve the problem with Egypt by points?
And given that Egypt plays a major role in the Arab world
We think it's important that we take a look at this.
And I am sure that President Hosni Mubarak is relying on this matter.
But some of the crew
I have to leave.
Occupation of Egyptian public opinion or government leadership or others or nonsense.
Focus on Arab and Egyptian interests.
Are there any steps in that?
We are behind them, not in front of them, because these are big things.
In the near future
Frankly, I can't imagine how this will happen.
And I know there's time for relaxation.
And there will be time from our side.
If it were from me.
Or among them
Great Arab interests united them.
One day we will find this.
Does it mean life is still going well?
That means we won't respond in the same Egyptian way you have.
If someone holds our hands, we'll hold his hand.
Now, Your Excellency, Sheikh
We were never used to running.
Unless there was a sound basis, and we were prepared to go to Egypt.
We stand with Egypt.
I have a lot to say about Egyptian workers in Qatar and how this issue affects them.
And there are contracts for Egyptians working either in universities or in high-ranking positions.
You know, it's not our usual practice to cancel work or appointments in this matter.
Because these people have nothing to do with this.
This is a market where demands change, they cancel one and bring in another.
This is a request and an amendment, and there are nationalities that increase and nationalities that decrease.
Okay, quick reply
The office was there.
We've disturbed the office, so it's best we leave now.
We would have been defeated in the days when they were opposing us. All our losses in negotiations with Israel were due to this office.
Alright, we've shut it down, let people with Netanyahu fix it.
He was a guest.
And he was among them, and we usually call all the ambassadors accredited to any foreign state.
There wasn't a formal invitation to honor Gabriela Shalev.
Okay, we didn't do anything like this before when the relationship was, as they say, good. Now it's going to be a bit difficult.
There's no reason for you to reopen the office at this time.
The office will reopen when there are no longer any reasons for it to be closed.
I did it.
Who made it like Egypt?
Egypt imposed this.
Let me clarify, our relations with America are strategic.
In some things, and this.
What's the most important thing?
There are issues in our region regarding the resolution of certain matters where there was disagreement with the previous administration.
Now we have great hope in the administration, especially with the steps taken by President Obama.
Yes, we believe there is a great deal of hope in this administration.
This is a serious matter in advancing the peace process, and serious in resolving the Palestinian issue.
This is our companion, and we won't refuse this.
What's happening in Iran? What impact could it have on the Gulf and on you?
Iranians must decide how to solve their issues.
Among them
Stick to their usual methods and I'm sure they'll get through this crisis.
Iran's stability as mentioned by the Emir of Qatar.
This is important for our regions, the Gulf region, and we share borders with Iran.
Of course, we have special relations with all our neighbors, including Iran.
We hope that our countries will strive for peace and the future of this region.
And we were drawn into it every time a party wanted to change the Doha Agreement.
And I remember Saad Hariri saying
The prohibition is now lifted and over, and what remains is strategic talk between the president
And Lebanese groups
How are you seeing?
For Saudi Arabia, you have no role or you've just taken a stance.
Listen, it's known that we supported unity when most of the Arab world was against Yemeni unity.
We are the only Arab country and the only Gulf state that stood with the unity of Yemen.
And in the southern regions, we spoke with Yemen, and His Highness the Emir sent me twice to meet the Yemeni president.
And I explained to him that our goal is the stability of Yemen because Yemen is an important country in the Arabian Peninsula.
And they did not respect this agreement, and I don't want to say what each party did.
But what really affected me was
Is it Qatar that delayed on this matter, and then was accused of paying money to Houthis and high-ranking Yemeni officials?
So we don't get involved in such matters.
And he who stands with unity, do not stand against him.
And another goal in the interest of Yemen, whether politically, economically, or otherwise.
No problem, but to be honest, I felt a big shock.
Because I went more than ten times during the battle, His Royal Highness the Servant of the Two Holy Mosques sent me to Yemen among the Yemenis.
Unfortunately, this is a strange accusation.
The time is up, but briefly tell me the problems you faced while seeking solutions. Will they change your policies regarding intervention in other Arab issues?
If His Excellency permits, I don't think there's such a thing as a thing.
And there was a great display once.
Over five billion dollars at that time, if we had invested it, it would have been fifty billion dollars better than this problem.
But I say this with faith, because perhaps the time in the Arab world is now.
What is allowed is not allowed under these circumstances.
Many thanks, Your Excellency.
It can be amazing, even exceptional, with Sheikh Hamad's situation.
For what happened with the agreement in Doha.
How did the Doha Miracle happen?
The mandate of the committee and provide it with all support.
To discuss Lebanon after the Israeli invasion.
When there was an Arab consensus
And we met in New York, and we were able to make a somewhat balanced decision.
And we discussed this in Doha that both parties were concerned.
We tried as much as possible not to hear it, or it won't happen.
Because we knew the committee.
"Understanding the reality on the ground and knowing what the problem is after sitting with the Lebanese for a long time."
And I remember this as a common success.
But there was determination.
I think Lebanon's problem is that the general atmosphere in the region reflects directly on it.
Whether it is peaceful or not
Lebanon was supposed to be here.
Under these conditions
And unfortunately
Dire external consequences
I can say that the problem between Lebanese, even if there is one, would not be the first problem by any means.
Alright, Sheikh, I know it's not the right time now, maybe it's a bit early to talk about what happened, but
What happened to you when you came here?
Stop, approximately, coordinating with the field involvement now.
It's not your time to be late, not even a single second.
I know exactly what was happening, even the Lebanese leaders were telling me what happened.
It didn't start from the beginning.
When I focused with Smouha.
I told him if we go to Lebanon.
That I will surrender the idea, and Your Highness and its supporters have permitted it.
All Lebanese leaders must be present.
Because here in Beirut, you have to go to each area separately.
While they are in the same hotel and in the same place.
And they met each other on the same plane and talked.
Well, we created this atmosphere, but from the start, our idea was...
And this was the most important decision made by both parties.
Sure.
And I felt this was from the Arab League.
Then we must be honest brokers.
And thank God, I think this proved to everyone that Qatar made an effort.
On both sides
Let's reach a respectful solution for both sides.
And this has a solution, but I can't find anyone who will be robbed.
Before you do anything
The consultation took place at the Arab League and we found support.
Who did this to us?
And I told him when we were there.
If we succeed in Lebanon, we'll take them to Doha.
And he went to recommend me.
To restrict them and deprive them of their phones.
We were able to bring them there, and the youth in Syria also supported the situation.
And I told you from the beginning that without Arab support, the committees can do anything.
Why do they want the solution?
I believe the situation in Lebanon and the escalation that occurred
And this tension
There is tension in Somalia and tension in Sudan.
A lot of things are happening in the world.
And every time we put out a fire,
It is better for the Arab world to be more in its own interest than foreign intervention.
And we work with increased effort.
Shaking forces
Even if he were a soldier.
For example, I think this is a subject.
There's one point we need to discuss.
He always said that the solution to the Lebanon issue was...
Saudi-Syrian Agreement
I'm not limiting it to scientists; I meant the Gulf countries and the Arab world.
Could what happened in Lebanon lead to serious reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Syria?
Need a self-assessment in the Arab world
Because of Arabic differences.
And any agreement between two Arab states.
And we tried this.
In thirty-seven wars
When Arabs agree on a solution to a problem.
I think it's something interesting.
Saudi Arabia and Syria play a significant role in Lebanon.
Both parties must agree.
Seize wisdom.
Arab relations are on the right track.
Because we face many great challenges here in the Arab world.
Everyone is playing in our courtyard.
And we possess no power nor resolve.
And how can we stop playing in the arena of Arab countries?
I am an Arab, at least the minimum of agreement.
Unfortunately, we complain.
As we follow
Our disagreement as Arabs and the lack of trust between us, trust is missing between Arab countries.
And Arab countries
It's not like betrayal, it's a kind of...
Jealousy, what's the word?
This is an issue that needs support from everyone, meaning I see it.
Okay, are you really going to accept this invitation and request an Arab meeting seriously?
We suffer when he suffers, and rejoice when he rejoices.
He suddenly interrupted the conversation.
Okay, could we take a role in repairing the situation between Damascus and Riyadh, even if just a little?
Ready to find solutions, and I'm sure they will with their wisdom.
They might reach an agreement.
Between them in many cases
There was harmony in politics, and I am sure, God willing, this will continue.
Relationships have improved.
Both parties must take a step.
But how can I be sure that's what's happening now?
I am sure that if Arabs focus on resolving disputes between Arab countries and the problems of some Arab countries that I mentioned earlier.
Optimism and a sense of pride for the citizen in the presence of general Arab novelties.
But I can't say what happened in Lebanon.
There is an Israeli-Palestinian escalation on the ground that can be interpreted.
There could be a potential American and Iranian escalation, perhaps other cases.
Are you still scared of that in the coming months?
We Arabs
We can't deliver food and Doc at the same time.
And electricity for the people.
We in Qatar are ready, and the Supreme is always.
Over one and a half million Palestinians are besieged.
And we do not want from them what they would hand over to them of weapons or support.
They're doing all this.
And there's no electricity.
We call her to the Red Cross program to reach Bolshevism.
And with the Palestinians, we only show them food and medicine.
And our coexistence with them can continue.
And I hope that Palestinians on both sides will put the national interest above all else.
Farewell to illusions.
The current Palestinian debate is a deep, major wound.
To find a solution
But they didn't commit
This is a serious matter, and they must adhere to the Mecca Agreement.
Perhaps you wonder until you go back to Mecca and Saudi Arabia.
And heal this wound.
They won't benefit.
And any promises from any party
I hope there's a solution.
Our position is known and stated to all concerned parties.
That's fine for them to be part of that, but we don't accept being part of any military conflict with Iran.
We have equipment whose secrets are unknown.
But we are a sovereign state and they are a sovereign state.
Everyone is looking out for their best interests, but these interests won't harm him or us.
We believe that the destiny of the Gulf should be in clear agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council.
Iran cooperates with peaceful neighbors.
But when Their Excellencies say that Qatar is not a party.
Any details or clarifications
Just a sign.
Okay, no.
Okay, I want to go back to the Lebanese file if that's okay.
Frankly, Professor, we were facing a major deadlock, but we managed to find a solution in the past few hours.
Some have arrived, what happened to those who announced?
It might contain disparate pieces of information that are unrelated to each other, but that's what happened.
How did you reach this conclusion?
What happened in Istanbul, I know if there were certain appointments before that.
You learned that there were negotiations in it.
He is constantly seeking a solution.
And without a doubt, the Kingdom's support is very important.
And change the methods of negotiation.
These negotiations were led by her.
To a positive outcome; we gathered some parties from some sides.
And we started talking.
In this paper, there is a Qatari Arab approach.
Tell me what's wrong with this book.
And we started talking about the subject one by one.
At the last moment to overcome an obstacle that lasted until the end.
But the prince met with the parties.
And we got rid of this crack.
And there was a solution.
We heard a word from the Qatari Crown Prince at the opening session in Doha.
Aren't you thinking about your role now?
The most important thing is that we stay out of the spotlight.
I have no territorial ambitions.
Or even control another country or something like that because our state
Our sizes... We are proud of ourselves, we believe we can contribute to solving problems with our fellow colleagues.
But in the Arab world, it is very important.
We have countries...
We envy them doing something, that's very important.
Give some small countries this task and pay them.
He is excellent in some things, good in others, and not so good in some.
The last question, Your Excellency.
What's the most important thing?
Is this a political priority?
Security or Reform of Hostility
or confront Israel
We stopped playing in the Arab court.
What are we going to fix in these Arab countries with our problems?
To choose an active member in Iraq
To calm things down
At the national and local levels
But if we became composers
Or he will have any hope.
Thank you, His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, for this meeting.
And international efforts to stop what is happening in the Gaza War.
We start by requesting you to hold a meeting with the Arab Council at the United Nations with ministerial support.
As if you changed your mind.
Please hold an emergency Arab summit.
In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful and Generous. First of all, I am happy, brother Hassan, to be in this program.
Despite the humanitarian circumstances
Facing our brothers in Gaza
Conditions that make us do a lot of things.
Qatar did not ignore the Arab summit.
Actually, we didn't think about the Arab Summit before.
Not only the Security Council resolution, but also through
Are you walking all over us or neglecting us?
Keep listening, I'll say it in a different way.
And we are learning.
That the street can't handle it, if we as officials in the Arab street suit it.
His past won't bear this.
When we were in Egypt
There were ten to eleven written approvals.
Some spoke at the meeting, and it was possible to attend the meeting.
We will keep it as long as there is Arab consensus.
And I wouldn't blame them if, in a meeting, they might have a point of view.
And how can you solve the problem?
So it can be solved.
This is the important subject.
Because our goal is not advertising or promotion, our goal is to find.
That's why I didn't care about the summit.
We even wonder
We're leaving to put pressure on the other side that's suffering.
The previous and subsequent decisions, security arrangements, but let's stick to the subject of the Arab Summit, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
He clearly stated that the situation may require an Arab summit with whoever attends.
We found a majority of our brothers supporting the holding of the summit.
With whoever comes.
And I don't know what their amendment means.
We are the only nation.
So, if we go to any country in Asia or in Latin America, we are only talking about the Arab nation.
Unsolved
They were classified as moderate states.
And what does mediation mean to us?
Will he take her off the list?
Not just because we don't like them.
Are we interfering in the affairs of the Palestinians in any way?
No interference, whether good or bad, is permitted for any nation.
Like Hezbollah, who knows, maybe a movement will emerge tomorrow.
Is he asking?
And can we accept them as part of the Arab body?
As if she was prepared to lead us into an internal Arab conflict.
"What if we go to the Security Council?"
There's no solution in the Security Council.
Oh God, after Israel finishes its mission.
The Second Arab Diplomatic Meeting that I Invited You to Attend
What was dominated by intense debates, severe disagreements, and violent altercations.
There's an important point.
This is what doesn't matter.
When we request a meeting
About stations
There's no peace in it.
Are the ministers ready for that?
Because someone is telling us we have to wait.
But we are in an Arab initiative.
Freezing peace talks with Israel.
You say we're at a party, you say we'll lose in this.
There's a greater loss than the one we're facing now, but we've always been respectful, polite, and committed to decisions since the ceasefire.
You say that arguments are unimportant.
There was someone who wanted them to include Hamas and things like that.
This reflects a political stance more than it does a dispute between two ministers.
Unfortunately, this happened.
But not everyone
Don't listen to what people say.
It is important for us to be men who are worthy of ourselves and our homeland.
Obey the policies of our country.
Who does this thing properly?
I think
I don't think they'll respect us in the end.
Yes, is there anyone doing things on behalf of the West?
No, and I hope no one claims, I don't want to claim anyone in this matter.
After the Security Council resolution
What are his priorities?
The situation began with the decision of Arab efforts.
And the opposition here is that if Israel were to implement the decision immediately.
We can say there's a decision.
But Israel did not implement the resolution.
Are we ready now to go and ask about Chapter Seven? I know for sure there are difficulties.
He doesn't ask the international community, even if he did ask.
It will be slowly and carefully.
The situation
See that they did something for the Jew and the Israeli.
To expedite their rights.
This is the current Arab situation.
If the Arab didn't go to the security office.
And they agree to hold a summit and make tough decisions.
And the Western countries will try for us.
Because we are in the heart of the Arab world and there are many people, and you see how people in the Arab street behave with this.
But this decision is important.
Referring to the issue of naming our presidents one after the other
In the end, they said there was nothing, it was all lies.
Even if we were like Germany now, wouldn't we still need to consider the situation?
They don't have to pay any compensation because they carried out the attack, just say your information is wrong.
And killed hundreds of thousands.
This is for you, a weak Arab group.
We left as Arabs, some of us from us.
I worked hard on how to
For his contribution
In a way that is like the power and action of God.
If the Arab nation says you will send forces to Darfur, we will send forces to Darfur.
Arabism considered, or there were those who considered the decision in the year one thousand eight hundred and sixty-six.
And our colleagues worked very hard to stop the decision.
Was issued by the Security Council
I'm going to tell him whether it was a win or not.
And what will take ...?
Let us ponder this, for victory...
What are they going to do?
The assumption is that we don't intersect with other decisions.
But I assure you that we will abide by the decision.
Unfortunately, the matter will be decided by default, even though it shouldn't be.
After the Israeli rejection, the Israelis came and agreed.
It means "so we" or "that means we" in English.
Will you have an alternative, or better yet, will you be the ones calling for a ministerial meeting?
I don't remember that Arab unity is necessary.
In the meantime, we're open to alternatives.
And I don't see the Arab nation as being ready.
In implementing the Gaza blockade
For various political reasons
For one nation to crush another in the process of submission in the braid instead of unifying between them.
We started trying to make plans.
As soon as they gathered, I don't know, some European-Arab intelligence information or something like that, without mentioning names.
And after they did that, it means we're involved.
In the app
What is required of us from the West?
But if we let
I want there to be a classification.
I'm surely not talking about the decision, I'm talking about...
These consequences for the Gaza issue were presented two years ago, not now.
That I was recounting the story of that place two years ago, but concerning the decision precisely.
Do you have any reservations about his conditions?
Neither enacted nor implemented
We weren't invited.
They might think we see the matter differently.
Everyone was required to have the same opinion.
Not everyone has to have the same opinion, but I think those who did this tried.
We remind them of that.
Regarding what happened in Gaza two years ago, and you mentioned parties.
The prevailing preference for one category over another participating in the Gaza siege
You really agree with the statements, insinuations, or accusations that have been issued from here and there.
About a real Arab conspiracy behind all that is happening now in Gaza.
We were partially informed.
Of the problem, let me tell you that we don't know all the details.
But I know.
The Palestinian conflict
He fed at the Arab and international levels.
Even if it's not being used, it won't make much difference.
And after the elections
And Hamas rose up and took power.
By a majority consensus
We should have given them a chance to see.
Are they doing something, or is it because of them that there is a state? Is it because of them that there is a state? Is it because of them that there is a state? Is it because of them that there is a state? Is it because of them?
But the day they brought
Across the Arab world, some of our brothers thought that these extremist groups should not reach power.
Some say there's a strike now.
Made by Hamas who spoiled the truce, or those Palestinians from Gaza who spoiled the truce.
Understanding
Remaining while the people of Palestine in Gaza have been starving for two years.
Okay (Note:
For reasons relating to Israel's security
It's clear we don't want them in power, but it doesn't matter to me in Qatar.
But what's wrong with others?
And then who eats the decision?
This or that, not every country has the dominance to choose.
Our government
This is the fundamental problem.
But I'm sure he could've solved it.
If we worked hard, we would have worked hard to widen the gap.
But it's clear that we were asked to allow one group over another, because this group...
We consider them terrorists or we consider them.
All that happened led to
Even the promises they made to give them a decent life.
They didn't do anything for them.
We have returned to international and Arab efforts exerted to end what is happening, as you said.
There is a Security Council resolution that has been rejected by Israel so far.
And there is this Egyptian initiative.
And Egypt is in Cairo.
Egyptian efforts
Okay, not something you're looking for.
This is what is required for a successful job.
Egypt's borders are also next to Israel and Palestine.
That we
And we don't deserve to stop this chaos right now.
In Gaza and bring people to stop the chaos in Gaza because
This is not the way to peace.
There must be.
And so we always ask them for a great argument.
What was announced.
Does this mean you can't assess the initiative now?
Either to give the possibility of success or study.
I believe in his chances of success.
If the brothers in Egypt can
Make the Palestinian perspective more similar.
It is the party harmed in Gaza that should speak about the initiative.
Because he is the one who can say yes or no.
And this is an important point.
When the year one thousand eight hundred and sixty was issued.
This is an Arab-Palestinian problem that we have.
We never hear from any side.
But I really liked this topic when the Palestinian delegation went.
And when they went to the second floor, they requested to have someone from Gaza among them.
Showing that the Israelis are our brothers and that we are with them.
This is an important topic.
We don't allow the agency.
Our goal is this, not to build our policy.
Let him remain in his position.
Sheikh now
I don't know if we can talk about the Egyptian initiative precisely because I haven't read the details of it.
According to the principle, could this be appropriate as a mechanism to implement UN Resolution 1860, as some people have claimed?
Balanced role
Now, not tomorrow or the day after, because
Every day it counts.
This will result in bloodshed among our brothers there.
Therefore, we do not want to postpone this matter, and the Israelis do not want to postpone it either. When they finish their mission, we will present this initiative.
And I'm sure the brothers in Egypt know this and have thought about it carefully.
I want to clarify everything I said.
Now we need to solve this problem.
And not in the way Israel wants it to be.
Turkey's role has been attractive since the beginning of the crisis.
Does it work?
Arab vacuum
Undoubtedly, it's a wonderful position.
And it has Arabic depth.
An Introduction to Arab Disability
We know there is an Arab disability.
Part of it was due to disagreements.
Because of his partiality in perspective, everyone thinks their perspective is the best.
And someone else thinks their opinion is better.
And how can you have no conscience and allow people to respect and know that there is an Arab solution?
Or they will throw us out one by one.
Oh, they're saying it's not a problem, we'll give them an extra two or three days to talk to them and bring the young people so they can be equal and solve the problem.
We must stand up and not accept this.
Hamas might have mistakes, but we will deal with them.
Throughout the Arab world
But currently
At least we say no.
In the context of the required stance from Qatar, such stances, we will revisit this point later.
Also in the field at the same time I heard
Yesterday, Khaled Meshaal, the head of the Political Bureau of the Hamas movement
First, there is no need for everything that Brother Khalid Mish'al said, with all due respect and appreciation for him.
Why don't you sit with Khaled Mashal and talk to him the way Arab people do?
We're going to the Arab League and telling him.
This is important talk.
I am from Hamas.
Imposing Israel's conditions also imposed conditions.
Why don't they impose conditions when they're not busy? Isn't it allowed for them to impose conditions while Israel can?
First, what do you think of an Arabic-style gift?
We never heard of goats and lambs at the same time, De Gaulle told me he hadn't heard of it either.
Bant, in any case, Djol freed his country.
With or without allies, he liberated his country from the brutal invasion.
Now, what are we talking about?
Is this an Arab gift that we should want?
Leaders must represent the views of their people.
The Arab people in all those marches we've seen.
This can be verified from these columns you are looking at and requesting.
Also, many who criticize Qatar in this situation also demand
About what's happening with the actor and the office is still open.
They don't speak the same language.
We sever relations here and deal with all Arab countries.
To break the bond, every bond, even if it is said that he has a covenant.
They just want Qatar to sacrifice alone.
That we
And this is more important than the relationship.
Not only in this action, but also in this, and in harder decisions.
By this decision
We must have a unified Arabic stance.
For others
Nothing prevents someone from selling something to another person with the aim of obtaining moral, material, or similar gains.
Yes, before we close this file on this subject, there are also countries that have taken individual steps.
The good Chávez is a different matter, he has disagreements with the United States.
Our people don't need us to remind them.
Five permanent members and arguments that these are films.
That we're done and the street knows better now.
With the high ceiling, Your Excellency.
Or calling on the Lebanese forces to confront the Israeli aggression and so on.
Are you waiting to see if they can make it work within a single Arab framework?
But we demand an Arab stance that makes people respect us.
I don't think the Arab countries are ready to fight.
"Nor that we encourage"
How will you bring Syria, Lebanon, and the rest of the countries together when there are Arab countries that don't even talk to each other?
There
A shift in Arab relations.
This is the current policy now among Arab states.
If only there was a sense, just seeing that his time is up, or something like that.
In goals
Important subject
And they know how the Lebanese order is.
Nothing guides, Lebanon.
If she returned her lands, he gave an example.
The situation in Gaza will be different, they are still
Surrounded on all sides
This siege
Unnatural
Yes, here Israel's goals mean the objectives of the operation for Israel.
One day he beats someone, another day he punishes someone, and another day he pleases someone.
An example of what happened in Lebanon for them is not a good example.
The Taif Model that took place in Lebanon
This is considered good.
The worker
Listen, the problem of Gaza or Palestine, its solution is easier than in Lebanon.
We agree with each other, should we reclaim our land today or tomorrow?
Their differences revolve around power.
On the distribution of power
And this differs because they are closer to each other intellectually.
More than a intellectual Philadelphian
Therefore, the solution is much easier.
And this is the problem.
Happiness Sheikh
It means we only have a few minutes left if we solve the problem quickly.
And a diplomat.
Do you want to know how this locks?
For Palestinians in Gaza
Keep listening to me.
Or refuse
And help.
Walking with me
This will be an Arab failure.
Regarding the strategy
But on the Palestinian side
There were some attempts, but we didn't see a full initiative.
Okay, not before, not now, why?
The problem is not so much the initiative, but rather how we feel about it.
We'll help whoever solves the problem without mentioning Qatar, because some people have issues when they hear the name Qatar.
We don't need to come because there's a summit in March that will be determined.
If we take an initiative, we'll be better than our siblings, don't you think so?
And do not put pressure on them.
If history doesn't spare us if we pressure them.
We are moving forward with this initiative that all parties have seen. There was a meeting scheduled for the fourth day, but it was postponed due to the Security Council.
O our Lord, we seek Your permission to walk swiftly with our feet, and we desire that our Arab people would contribute with whatever they can in this cause.
And we hope to make it non-competitive.
Arab competition
Due to their dispute with the Sudanese government at some point, they were raising the temperature.
And these are our problems, Pasha. We either walk together or we differ and make mistakes.
This isn't Hangeul.
In Kuwait, in the coming nineteenth month, I believe, of course, the Arab situation.
As you know, as mentioned and explained by His Excellency.
Does the entire Arab climate help? Is it the first economic summit?
His Highness, may God protect him.
And of course, we attend any summit held in a sister country.
And we don't care to review any summit.
But don't be afraid to become a political leader.
Of course, taking into account that time imposes itself.
Alright, even if it's in ten days.
You're talking about Palestinians after they've been tortured for 25 days?
Will be
Won't they say that Iraqis won't be able to meet?
We said
We said
With all due respect, this meeting is scheduled, and we are committed to it.
I mean, I think that we...
The Arab people are against us.
By our Lord, whom we have chosen.
And for this reason
And depart in peace.
And say, "This is all, this is guaranteed."
For this reason
Thank you to the audience for watching.
Coverage of the ongoing war on Gaza continues, with safety.
A few days ago, there was a celebration for the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
Hessa bint Khalifa Al-Aani
In Doha and contributed to the preparation of a draft law, especially
She was also a member of several local and Arab councils in the field of childhood.
I have also delivered over seventy-five lessons, workshops, presentations, and articles published in Arab and international journals.
First, I won't agree on the term currently used.
When naming people with disabilities, do we say "special needs" or, as you said, "disabilities"?
Good evening, my first sweet thing.
Taken from a context focusing on human rights or a culture of human rights, this is because persons with disabilities
Because he treated people with disabilities as humans first.
Human
And then he caused his disability in an attempt to adapt to society.
The medical concept was the prevailing one at that time.
Move towards the concept.
Special education and upbringing emerged.
This category became
That's why we started calling them people with special needs.
What are the standard rules that it is derived from?
The role of the Special Rapporteur in monitoring the implementation of this document.
And he strengthened the relief efforts until the treatment of the kinsmen's rights appeared, it was embellished with the law and named from the rules in this part.
And set a fundamental condition or basic rule for this term.
He treats these people as humans, as people.
As the terminology changes as you mentioned, is there a shift in the perception of this group by society?
Yes, and it is measured in a way.
It rises and falls from one area to another.
But the distinctive thing about this is...
That the Arab world has been distinguished or differed.
But legal trends include human rights and exist, for example, in Africa.
In Latin America, but the reasons are probably lack of financial resources, right?
Of course, that's what I wanted to say. Culture exists, but sometimes there may be a lack of resources or a lack of political will.
Sometimes laws, but
But unfortunately, awareness is also somewhat low, and there is no culture of human rights.
Ten percent of the world's population are people with disabilities.
Eighty to ninety percent of people with disabilities from developed countries are of working age.
He suffers from unemployment.
During my visit to Darfur
Or with mines and weapons
Men are one degree better.
Adding disabilities, they will be served in remote and far-flung areas.
Therefore, there are many paths that organizations working in this field take and try to raise.
Awareness and Realizing the Right to Education
Instead of creating many religious centers, for example
They went to build rehabilitation centers, hospitals, and schools.
And this is one of the things we don't thank God for, keeping us busy at the office.
I tried with the current authority in Qatar.
Setting the agenda
Or include the agendas of these humanitarian organizations to also cover those centers.
In light of the deterioration in the situation of persons with disabilities in the world
I might not agree with you that there's a decline.
If there is a setback in the Arab region due to the disability issue.
Placed in a social, political, and economic context, we cannot expect the circumstances of persons with disabilities to be
While they are from marginalized groups
In a state like I told you, like Gaza and Darfur.
On the contrary, I cannot categorically assert that there is no improvement in the situation.
And it has already been applied in practice, and if I wanted to give an example, I would say
The Qatari red flag
We agreed that the projects include
Disabled patients with health problems within this strategy and there are other programs.
That we tried to include that as well.
Within the operations of ground-based institutions
Kamal Kiro is with us now from Syria. Welcome!
Good evening, I am Suleiman Kiro.
Slim Keirou, sorry, go ahead Slim.
Thank you to you and Mrs. Hafsa.
First, is there a mental barrier within the laws of the United Nations?
Intellectual impairment means that a healthy person has become tragically compromised due to a stressor.
Lehi was disabled as a result of torture and imprisonment, suffering from mental illness, and has been undergoing treatment for six years now.
I know that there are around 400 children and disabled people in prison.
Is there a law in the United Nations?
Frankly, I
It's on them because they know, just as they know their own children.
And the whole meaning without corrupting it.
And there are values in the West.
Agreed upon, but people
Some of them are hypocrites or do not follow the wisdom of Islam, and they do not attain it.
Thank you very much, Naif Saeed from Kuwait.
Let's go back to our guest to comment.
Regarding the calls, Suleiman wondered if there was any mental impairment.
Yes, it's included in global rankings.
Of course, for people with disabilities, including intellectual and mental disabilities, as they are called.
Among these disabilities, there are sensory disabilities, which include visual, hearing, or motor impairments.
Of course, as mentioned, disability is...
Interaction and reaction that occur in a social context
In the Arab world or any other regions
Sure, the disability processing took a long time.
And so even at the level of the United Nations
I, for example, during my experience and work as Chairman of the Special Reports Committee, for the things I was trying to address and work on.
In another context, the right is for all.
So they can provide for them
and various rehabilitation aspects to ensure they can also attend schools as well as labor organizations.
Engaged in vocational rehabilitation, which includes people with disabilities.
There were some improvements.
Especially after the reform
Generally, there are in this international committee
Me too, in my capacity as the Special Rapporteur.
The reality of my work, and this was positive for me, if it was not directly related.
Who supported this position?
I've seen her at many meetings, like the international conference, for example.
For the rights of persons with disabilities
An obstacle of these restrictions or these flaws
Example regarding legal capacity.
This is one of the most important points in the world of disability.
The United Nations Organization delayed it somewhat during the preparation and composition.
Regarding organizations and entities
For example, and I will conclude with this.
Among the governments of the world and non-governmental organizations, the United States is a member.
We have completed another survey.
In United Nations organizations and institutions and in various regions
Why do we know about the few programs that are available for people with disabilities in their plans?
If he allocates budgets if there is involvement of people with disabilities.
Human rights
And not just development issues.
We're taking more calls now, we have with us now Michri Naji from Algeria, Ya Naji.
You as well
I want to ask my sister who exactly we should blame.
I want to ask, I am physically disabled to begin with.
Okay, I'll ask this question to "Naji Mashri" from Algeria, thank you very much, Ahmed.
Welcome, Halabi, from Greece.
Good evening, madam, good evening to your guest.
Healthcare, housing, seasonal clothing, and even taking them on seasonal tourism, this is what happens in Europe.
And is a mental patient considered disabled?
Especially those who might harm themselves or others.
All we're talking about is within the scope of a discussion that has no productivity, thank you.
My sister Huda mentioned our financial difficulties.
In poor countries, especially in Africa and Latin America, I demand.
Establishing an international fund to support people with disabilities and allocating one percent of the net profit of every organization in the world.
This should be mandatory and without exception for any institution or company.
The inability of many disabled people, military victims, and others to ...
Many thanks, Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
Naji Mashri was wondering and declared his problem that he is disabled.
At the local or national level, that is, through Algeria
Community needs must be met within this area.
Are these the same rights that should accrue to anyone else?
In another context, the right to life means first and foremost the right to housing, the right to health, and the right to education.
Therefore, I seriously appeal from here, from this platform, to governments, and Arab governments in particular.
In the public interest of the citizen and the individual
To ensure
These needs and rights are within the existing agendas.
There's nothing we can do, we don't need to buy new devices.
To meet the needs of the disabled person, or there is no need for that if it is for the state.
They can and are indeed compelled to perform.
I would first recommend that he return and refer back to the competent authorities at the government level, if possible.
Because it falls within my national scope and should be within this scope.
You mentioned the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, but many countries have signed it without being committed to it.
And here we have a question from a caller: Why are there no laws?
It is certain that we are in a human society, which means there are many mistakes and much that is correct.
Sure, many conferences and certainly numerous treaties do not contain a literal commitment in them.
Or an ideal commitment by a number of countries that have joined numerous organizations such as the Geneva Convention on Human Rights and others.
But there are breaches and violations, and we know that
But the question of adopting and regulating an agreement for that
First, we will ensure that there is at least awareness.
This awareness starts from the top floor of this tower, through the corridors with the decision-makers.
Leaders first, then they gradually grow to reach the whole society.
Also, the issue of our commitment to reporting and ensuring these reports are submitted to the United Nations.
The subject concerns knowledge, understanding, and a high level of awareness.
For the reports I worked on as a correspondent at the United Nations
Yes, from what I saw and wrote, there is interest.
The convention concerning the rights of persons with disabilities appears to enjoy a relative advantage.
Alright, I will recommend, encourage, and urge.
It's also important that people with disabilities are...
And we will hear what Ali Obeid Al-Sanari, President of the Qatar Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, will clarify.
Professor Naji Saghrna will discuss the matter. Welcome, Professor Naji and Professor Ali as well.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you and God's mercy and blessings.
With me, Mr. Ali Obeid Al-Sanaani, Chairman of the Board of Directors at the Cultural and Social Center for the Deaf in Qatar.
This is chaired by H.H. Sheikhah Huda.
The United Nations Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities has previously...
Stamp stamp stamp stamp stamp stamp
And as usual, Sheikh Huda has a long history.
The international treaty you're talking about now is, in fact,
Great benefit for all people with disabilities around the world.
And especially the Arab world.
And I wish, as a deaf person.
That these countries implement this international agreement.
This will serve men and women with special needs, this is essential.
Seriously, is there anyone who can enforce this agreement in every state?
Obaid Al Sanari, President of the Qatar Association for the Deaf and Mute
We stopped.
And we'll continue our conversation after a short break. Stay tuned.
Send and share your opinions on important issues in economics, politics, sports, and a number of other matters.
The text service is provided through Al Jazeera's live channel.
Welcome, visitors, and a warm welcome back to you all and to our distinguished guest today, Sheikh Huda Khalifa Al Thani.
Disability International Support Fund
Disability should be mandatory for all countries to provide funding. What do you think of this proposal?
The United Nations has a birth called the Birth of Disability.
Unfortunately, those contributions are very weak.
Regulatory Compliance Monitoring Mission
For six years of work, there was no moral support.
Just from China and Austria.
And this is always, meaning I thank this state for its support.
The largest supporter of the country is my country, Qatar.
The one who established the institution, through which we were able to implement many activities and projects, is Allah alone.
Yes, this lack of support indicates that...
It's like the one we raised at the beginning, and this question is always raised.
Terms of Ordinary People
Okay, how do we call the care of people with disabilities or the care of the disabled?
That means if there was a realistic, genuine, and serious commitment.
In all circumstances, in all categories
People with disabilities, refugee children, women, and those forced to displace
All of this will actually lead to a point where we might reach a stage called...
Equal opportunities, participation, and equality.
And there are voices that are always calling out, never getting tired or weary.
In the Islamic and Arab region, why isn't a part dedicated, sorry.
In the higher interest of these programs and projects
As they have offered before, and I am very grateful to him for this platform.
Islamic Development Bank
Within the budget allocated
Failure to comply with what I told you about paying off financial debts.
Funding to assist people with disabilities, does it only cover developing countries and Arab states or what?
Even developed countries do not provide.
I mean, the person who was in front of me was the Swede.
Also some countries in the European Union
And it's true that there are many countries, especially in the Arab region, where...
You taught me even about the existence of this special correspondent.
In my opinion, what happened
In Sweden and China
And the Arab region, unfortunately, had many promises, but unfortunately, it was just one of the states.
We're going to talk about the Arab region only.
We have more calls with us, Hamad Al-Marri from Qatar, welcome.
Peace be upon you
And you too
Hello Dr. Sheikh now
Almost ten.
We noticed that this girl was suffering from a psychological disability.
What's your role, man, suffering as you suffer?
With her colleagues
Sometimes, even if we persist.
What is your job for Qatari girls' children?
Thank you very much Hamad Al-Meri from Qatar, Karwan Behjat from Kuwait, welcome.
As they say, Sheikh Huda
Why don't we extract our oil from this situation?
Those with special needs can be included.
And we can help them.
We have massive financial components.
We can break down the psychological barrier between us and them.
Boosting individual morale
And spend it on this noble cause.
If we really believed.
Gratitude and appreciation to Her Excellency Sheikhah Huda for all her efforts and everything she has done during her tenure as Special Envoy.
Grateful and appreciative to her, and we thank the State of Qatar for all it has done for people with special needs.
Thank you very much, Aisha Mohammed from Qatar.
Peace be upon you, Professor of Media.
Peace be upon you and God's mercy.
And to your noble guest
Her Highness Sheikhah Huda
My question concerns prevention.
They should take precautions, prevention is better than cure.
There is another level of disability, apart from wars and traffic accidents.
The genetic aspect may result from inbreeding, which is marriage between relatives.
I think it's a large percentage.
This makes people angry and disables them.
Many thanks. Sharif from Tunisia has taken the flag. Now I return to our guest.
The first call was from Hamad Al-Ma'ari, wondering.
Where does a girl with a psychological disability come from?
For him and from anyone he should go.
In every country
Surely there are services that cater to all types of disabilities in the State of Qatar.
For these disabilities, whether they are intellectual disabilities as mentioned or any psychological disabilities
For schools
It had been done before.
Oh no, private education in the Ministry of Education, which is now the Supreme Council.
The Tunisian activist Cherif Liwai pointed to something very important.
And scientific papers and the like.
From disability organizations' programs only, but even within campaigns.
Programs for Women
All these factors attracted many campaigns and programs related to reproductive health.
I talked about this aspect.
This is a parallel strategy to healthy behaviors.
Based on awareness.
To show the danger of marrying relatives
And genetic factors
I believe it was implemented in the State of Qatar.
Habits and traditions, but they take time for sure.
Especially in tribal societies
But over time, there will be a response to it, but it is necessary that there be a legal commitment in a meaningful way.
Yes, Karwan Bejt asked and suggested allocating one percent of the budget of Arab states.
To help the disabled, let me first
Yes, there was a statistical estimate conducted by the World Health Organization globally.
There are four or nearly four million people with disabilities.
Half of them.
But these numbers double.
Like studying in South Africa where they saw and testified.
Surely the statistics that emerged from the war in Iraq and the war in Gaza.
Every person who dies brings with him three disabled people.
And since the Arab region has become an undisputed conflict zone.
Even Karwan Behjat's suggestion
One percent is not enough.
To help people with disabilities in the Middle East
The subject regarding quotas allocated for people with disabilities or other marginalized groups.
Frankly and honestly, I don't think it suits him.
Always need to discuss their problems and needs.
Confirmation that people with disabilities are the most neglected.
It is usually not counted by governments.
True, and this is linked to the culture of society and social constraints at times.
When a census is conducted in
Stakeholders
There is a reliance on her in the house.
The one question that was asked was whether there was a disabled person or not.
A section related to this topic and the concerned individuals.
We cooperated in preparing the model.
We recommend providing more details.
The first becomes the gender of the patient, whether male or female.
And did he get help or not?
In fact, even if the figures are correct, we haven't reached an accurate conclusion.
Also, attention and care need to be in progress. Fatima Al-Dosari is with us from Qatar. Welcome, Fatima.
And peace be upon you too.
I am a Qatari citizen and I have a child with a disability.
And I thank His Highness the Ruler of our country, Sheikh Hamad.
And his wife, Sheikhah Mowdi, for embracing this category.
I am very proud to receive all this care and attention.
For her crucial role
Lifta Al-Misfri, welcome!
Because they represent significant disturbances in society without education and without treatment.
Thank you very much, Lalla Mfai Latifa Almsيفيvi from Qatar for joining us now, Naseem.
Abdul Karim is from Jordan. Hello, Nasser.
Come on, Kareem, we can hear you.
Peace be upon you and God's mercy and blessings.
"May the Lord have mercy on you, I frankly have an intervention."
First of all, I'm an audio specialist, and I've worked in the State of Qatar for about four years.
We had a month-long awareness campaign for speech and hearing issues.
We hold conferences, lectures, and awareness sessions about hearing impairment.
Now I want to talk about Jordan; I lived there for almost three years.
Frankly, he offers new and nice services.
Frankly, he provides new services, whether they are material, immaterial, or moral.
Even the Jordanian Ministry of Education, resources
Educational organization in public schools
And our private institutions as well.
They're getting good support.
"Is everyone clear? Do you have any direct questions? Because we don't have much time, sorry."
Do you have a direct question?
In Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan, the services are wonderful and I think they are excellent.
Can you comment on viewers' questions?
Someone working in this field.
On the subject
I also respond to this agreement.
What is required, once obtained the ratifications, and accedes to it.
As a responsibility of the state or these institutions
Because it is based on the issue of rights for these people, regardless of
To be honest, what are you saying?
So they can work during this period for those with disabilities, why?
And he wants to go back now and stay.
Of course, Lord, I wish
I hope this is a measure in this study or survey, and leads us to higher quality research in this field.
I also understood from what happened.
Six years of experience
And coordination between Arab countries as well.
They also have a role; it's not just about rights, they're the ones who take the rights.
Sheikhah Hassounah bin Khalifa Al Thani, former UN stigma advocate, thank you.
Now we have an introduction from Al-Aweek and Al-Kass channels, Lana is on the line, good morning Lana.
I am also pleased by the presence of the shining captain in Umm Salal, Captain Ali Kasem.
Hello, Ali!
Hello %pw
Good morning
I want to open the book so that the dear ones may bless us, please.
I had a studio open for five hours and another for two hours before yesterday.
I congratulate Qatar, the land, the government and its people, they deserve this international achievement.
I may have the opportunity to thank the guest, His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.
And Sheikh Tamim the Prince
Yes, of course, Lana. You are in the field of sports and one of the experts in this area. Your knowledge is very extensive in these lines and this field.
Because even our file
And competitive, means that we deserve the six-vote difference between us and the United States, fifteen votes for Qatar and eight votes for the United States.
This was due to our file being rich, comprehensive, and supported by many embassies, with excellent support, like the professors.
Some people might be afraid, perhaps there were some %pw, like in the United States.
And there might be countries that are ready, not needing to provide stadiums, and creating special projects specifically for this event.
Because they are already prepared.
But they were concerned about this point.
Captain Ali, as athletes, I see this as a very significant achievement for you.
This will affect the economic, political, and health sectors, I think.
But, you athletes
What does this thing mean to you?
Of course, this is a great achievement, especially for us. Even you saw how the non-athletic people were so happy.
God guides him, Ali, tell me about the moment the winner was announced.
We were looking forward to the training and listening to the radio.
We waited for the announcement, my friend and I.
While I was driving and listening to the radio
In the moment they announced that Qatar and...
We, the two of us, became, and of course the skylight was open.
What, my friend, his body came out from on top of the car.
We were screaming, everyone was looking at us, we left and started our own party.
We started the celebration from the beginning.
Alhamdulillah, it was a very special day, I think, all the channels focused on it greatly.
Lana, of course you were involved in this event.
Especially sports channels
How exactly did they celebrate, and how did they react?
There were many media outlets and channels from all over the world.
He became a leading teacher, very prominent on the map, and Qatar became famous.
Of course, Ali. The presence of the player in the team is very important.
And I tend to think that it's a responsibility that should be taken seriously.
What's your opinion on this particular point?
Hello Ali, do they mention the required properties to join the league?
Now there are more upcoming sports events.
And we need to raise a strong generation.
This is a game of football with strong foundations and careful planning.
Okay, what are the rules and principles that a player must follow to be outstanding?
And I remember professionalism including everything from
Continuous, rigorous, and consistent training
All of these are basic things that help him focus all his efforts on the game or on training.
I believe each stage has a unique quality.
It had a unique feeling and taste.
TV and sports programs, what do you prefer, and where do you find yourself?
This is a nice thing.
It will tone your body and teach you how to maintain your health through exercise, which is important.
Everyone also watches soccer matches, and they will automatically be happy when they enter the stadium.
Is media work limited to one aspect only?
Won't it restrict you to something specific?
It's an open field, not just a football pitch.
This is all sports, and sports are fun.
Ali, there are also a few other important issues we need to discuss.
Didn't you notice that you want to go back thirteen years to reach 2022?
Ah, weren't you wanting to ask?
Of course, everyone is dreaming of this specific thing now, because it's the World Cup. Any player now...
Those who watch the World Cup are happy, so imagine if they were playing in it?
Oh God, grant them success and help them meet people's expectations. This is their chance.
What do you want to say as a professional player, Captain Ali? What do you want to tell them from the bottom of your heart?
We love having you with us.
As I just said, I'm currently on vacation, but
His return to the leagues after twelve years of absence from the Gulf Cup championship.
You had a nice comment from Qatar TV and sweet memories.
God guide him, Qatar's channel will become like a university that produces a large number of media professionals.
Our team is brave, and God willing, they will win many different medals.
Let's talk about an important point regarding the Sam Hilal Club.
How are you there, how are you, I hope you're doing well.
Sure, thank God, frankly.
Today's session, of course, in the studio, we summarized a lot of details.
Okay, I think some guys were watching us, thinking that you...
Necessary
This is very common in the Qatari league, players move to other teams.
I think I had a good chance in Umm Salal, *as an offer*.
Alhamdulillah, I was able to secure a spot in the Asian Cup with the team.
And my situation with the team is very good.
How can we make sports a social activity?
In addition to Qatar, how can we encourage girls, women, and youth to engage in sports?
It connects everything, and everything complements sport.
Women play a role in all fields of sport.
And with expansion, every individual, whether young or adult in this society, is aware of the importance of sport.
Letters, or twelve years, until we settle this matter, is enough.
We have a newer generation.
The generation is born and grows up, but we need to cultivate a sporting generation from an early age.
We get aspirin, the ambition is a functional building.
And it is essential for the new generation of sports.
Certainly, we must be resolute and forge ahead.
And football in particular
How can we capture the audience's attention to engage them in all the different team matches?
Frankly, the lack of audience is a problem in the Qatari league.
But the problem is attendance; the Qatari football administration still hasn't found a way to attract the public.
What method should we use to attract them to these football matches?
The issue depends on the person who lied. Some people don't like to talk about the treaty in the institute.
The knife plays a fundamental role, by the way, in the public's reluctance.
And now they will use a ticket or collected points here.
No, no, the sports union has a plan and many steps to attract the audience.
Some clubs have ways to attract the audience, like Al-Rayyan. Al-Rayyan is a popular club and doesn't need to attract the audience.
Some clubs have %pw, and some club managements organize activities and events.
To motivate the audience, I think these are the easiest ways.
Players, meaning the new generation.
They love what they do and believe in their capabilities. As I said, they don't just need financial support, but also a lot of moral support.
Thank you very much for this wonderful meeting, may God bless you.
Okay, we want to hear your final thoughts on Qatar's win to host in 2022, Lana, please.
I would like to reiterate that Qatar is always supportive, and
I wish, Captain Ali, the last word you'd like to say in this interview.
Congratulations and I wish you all the best in your journey.
Thank you, Captain and Ali Player, I wish you success in your sporting progress and life, God bless you.
And he loves sports more.
The episode will be about young talents.
The youth say these are songs that are popular now, but they have a very long and well-known history.
A group of young people are singing Arabic or English words.
Today, we'll be discussing this with a group of amateur rap enthusiasts.
We'll get to know them better through the interview that will bring us closer to them live on air.
Welcome to our program, dear viewers, wherever you are.
For years, a new style of singing has dominated the Arab and Gulf scenes.
From the West, specifically from America where there's rap.
Before we talk about rap,
There is courage in using any word without hesitation.
Anyone can rap.
To write the melody,
Most rappers write their own lyrics.
Alright, we will get to know these many necessary details through two people who are very specialized in this field.
They formed a nice band.
Yousef Al-Naemi and Salman Abdullah, good morning, Yousef.
Welcome, good morning Salem.
Good morning, welcome.
I'm very happy to be with you in this program.
Of course, through the subject of rap music.
Yusuf, how did you get into this?
By blinking, we discovered that rap doesn't exist in Qatar.
Better
For the citizen's voice.
Including joy, sadness, and political issues.
Yes, I can say that rap,
And these are words; I see that the artist painted a picture and the poet wrote a poem.
The singer can sing and the musician can play any instrument.
Are they waiting for Qatari society, Gulf society, to accept this kind of talk?
2010
Do people really like buying rap singers' CDs?
A variety of ages
Alas, there are many videos and businesses, people hear more than ever before.
There was something like a website.
How many of you are in the group so far?
This means that anyone can speak, write poetry, and rap.
As you say, the singer, the rapper,
He's the one who sometimes plays, writes the words,
Okay!
I want to hear and tell him that I recorded this song.
Okay, all these songs you produced are from Salman, Youssef, and anyone else in the same team.
It's not a fantasy to put it on a CD and make it available in stores.
Just know that if someone goes alone, it means I'll make the album and put it on the market, which is difficult, with commercial recording and procedures.
Fine, why didn't I think of that? You're seventy-three years old, and no one can clap with just one hand.
Two, God willing, you might have twenty-five hands. May God protect you, young men and women.
You create a compact disc (CD), and this CD can be marketed through multiple websites on the internet.
You have Facebook, YouTube, and also the upcoming newspaper.
I think it has nineteen songs.
Registration isn't like it is now.
Sure, he was a bit old, but he was clear.
Its quality was poor, not like now, but clear.
He made almost fifty CDs.
There is rap, I won't be able to say there wasn't because there might be young people who knew about this 10 years ago.
Not as strong as the recording and frankly, its distribution at that time, now it's different.
Especially since there are various types of music, and a wide range of techno music nowadays.
Those men and artists make a nice collection of songs.
Also, we want to talk about the parties you've attended.
See, the party we participated in Doha is one.
It was organized by the Sa'ad Club, and they were very cooperative.
We coordinated to look for the audience.
As publishers, we didn't expect this many copies.
And they weren't surprised either that more families were coming.
More than the youth
The organization was excellent.
We were a bit nervous because it was our first time in Doha.
It's not that bad.
The audience interacted wonderfully.
And it lasted a long time, so there were a lot of songs.
Okay, let's hear something, or words you've written, the audience, especially the youth, love this kind of talk.
Let's hear a few words so we can show the audience.
Can we hear it live?
Take your time.
Come on, Slim
The problem is that it's random.
Let's listen.
I don't know.
We are present in the Sabah al-Doha program.
The weather is nice for us to come to the program in the morning.
Salim Khabir, five years in the rap game.
Even if they don't like it.
We don't understand anything from this.
The words are random.
Okay, of all the songs you've written, give me some of your old lyrics.
See, not all songs are random, or what they call in English "freestyle".
Hold them to the same standards.
But when we sing, we choose our words carefully.
Thank you, let's see.
We can say, good morning my country, good morning Aldawa program.
Our news is live on television for our audience.
I wonder what one, or two, or one will present.
Together from dawn.
The beautiful song I just heard
I asked the brothers to distribute it everywhere and online.
Oh man, what can you say about this thing? When are you going to get it done?
Teamwork
Everyone works for themselves.
It's not going to be easy to do that.
Everyone writes.
Sure, I think that every artist, whether a painter or a poet, always...
He might also write it because he loves sports.
Love of the homeland
And I'm sure you participated in the National Day.
Through beautiful songs, you represent the youth of Qatar.
Waiting for dusk to spit out light to become the future of Asia's cup, and there will be celebrations on the corniche.
Let that need be praised.
I follow this scene in real life.
"Welcome to the Asian Cup, Doha"
From Doha Airport until now
Let's watch the primes together.
Reception, audience, our children, students
The Asian Championship finalists arrived at Doha airport this morning to continue.
Arrangements for hosting the massive continental event
Let's go back to our guests, Youssef and Salman, who are happy to be with us.
This is an Arab Gulf rap group, right?
Can we call it that?
Now, frankly, we
We assign a friend to an event, but don't deliver her.
Okay, you're working on a party that will be announced, if God wills, Joseph.
If God wills, but this is not certain, we are still beginners.
You are still at the beginning of your career, I wish you all the best, and be assured that our program will support you wholeheartedly.
Also, Salman, where are all of you, thirty people, gathering?
If there is a place to do it, and how do you weld all the ideas together?
Sure, there are some shared songs.
No one has to love Salman or Yusuf or any of you singing a whole song.
There must be joint cooperation among you all.
Frankly, it's difficult to gather the twenty-five in one place.
I started calling Youssef and the others and asking them to gather in one place.
The song and the lyrics are being considered.
And there's another way.
I'm recording my comb.
And it remains
He keeps recording it and returning it to me.
And see other experiences.
Collect some CDs of famous artists.
Do you benefit from their experiences and techniques?
Sure, we always do.
Artists who have been doing this for years and have experience in the field.
We always hear from them, learn techniques, and try to create our own distinct line.
If we work in the same way, with the same tone, and the same words...
We're not doing something new, we want to do something.
Well, we benefit a little from them.
Yes, there is also a large group of Gulf youth in the Gulf.
Primarily, let's go through the report together so we can benefit and enjoy it, let's see it together.
This talent that some people have is mysterious.
Using very primitive tools.
Abu Ibrahim Abdullah al-Dalil
This reaches one hundred and fifty kilometers.
I am from Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia.
I want someone who has good experience and skills.
Identifying shallow groundwater locations
Depth exceeding one hundred meters
You know very well that drilling wells is very expensive.
Finding the right place to drill wells is possible, but with an expert.
Discover, or identify.
Groundwater sites
Since ancient times
Our parents and grandparents
They were seeking expert help to identify the wells.
He spends the night.
My father Ibrahim's techniques in searching for groundwater
Modern Derivatives
Or soil analysis in laboratories
He relies on God's mercy in his work.
And they are rivers beneath the earth.
Or red orange juices.
Pomegranate branches or pumpkin branches
Now, the process of water source exploration is scientifically applied.
To close, this is the end of the stream.
Come back again.
Go back
Okay, from here, we start assembling the panel.
And there, the course ends.
He needs a lot of experience and patience.
For the person in charge of the T'ai Chi movement sequence to know what sensitivity to take from the sensors.
I've been to many places.
This means a 65% success rate.
Of course, in this way and using copper bars.
And there is no precise scientific explanation for it.
The second way
The strangest thing is the success rate among those who practice this primitive profession.
Over ninety percent
In the search for shallow aquifers
Praise be to Allah, who taught the slave the unseen; this report is from Saudi Arabia.
Who formed her own band and released more than one CD?
Whether online or by phone
Sometimes there are competitions between Gulf countries such as Qatar vs Bahrain and Qatar vs Kuwait.
They're making a stronger song about a stronger topic.
Regarding a problem, and so on, there are many things related to problems.
Show me a model.
God wants.
And at the same time, we want
Broadcasting a wide range of songs
As much as possible
Sometimes, let's reach out to you.
To keep up with the band's latest news
But let's focus on the band's name.
These are rappers.
Let's go back to our guests at the Kornish and the nice atmosphere.
Our news to you live via this live link
Wherever you are in the Konrach region, you will receive the Asia Cup.
I am proud of them and their wonderful good manners.
Deals with various social and psychological issues of youth.
But he only has two with us in the studio.
I'm sure they're expressing the rest.
Yusuf and Salman, welcome again.
Sometimes subscriptions expire.
We tried to contact the company, but no one answered.
As a team, you need to improve yourselves, people in
Facebook and YouTube
and similar sites
Band name
We are among the best research results.
Coordinate working together on this wonderful production.
You make and collect images with songs, are these personal photos?
Or you can simply download it from YouTube and video sites, and one can watch.
"We've done it before."
There are many songs.
The challenges you face, as if you don't have a company to take you in, or a website on the internet.
You really need a place where you can all say infidels.
What are you thinking about, and what do you hope to achieve?
Sponsors provide us with
And prepare an album for us.
I wish this could be official.
Because we spent five years.
"Okay, don't touch it."
Yes, we participated in some things, in some series.
"May God increase it."
And there will be someone among us who supports us and stays with us.
Ya Salim, we also want to know what you wish for.
My only wish is to produce a music video.
We wish you good luck.
We hope all your songs become famous across the Middle East.
This is a very beautiful and popular art.
And bears a message, as I just said.
Good luck, I wish you all the success.
Welcome the team, and we wish you success.
We'll conclude with the sound they produced especially for the program.
This is a CAD and DMRL Doha program.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This is KG Ms. Bobo with one hot track for the body.
We can say, good morning my country, good morning Aldawa program.
Our news is live on television for our audience.
Don't forget, the show starts at 3:30, everyone has to see it.
I wonder what one, or two, or one will present.
Together from dawn.
Production: Hassan Naama, Presentation: Shaima Hamadi
The manager is Nasser Al-Malki, and the guests are Qatari rap singers, of course.
Could you repeat that and use it at home?
Like a cart or a shopping basket
Wandering around the market
When you're buying any item, or anything you want to purchase.
A large screen will appear showing the components of this material.
That was also a very brilliant and useful idea.
Just a barcode, a scanner in the cart detects the item.
Facilitating shopping for the buyer.
Can you take all the details from the screen?
I believe it raises health awareness.
Do you have the device or is the message in it?
Ingredients
Any warnings, any side effects?
Full details
Or ambitious, for example, there are a number of projects, about four or five.
This deals with traffic problems.
This deals with traffic congestion and other issues like parking problems, and it was an innovative and brilliant idea.
God willing, the Children's Cultural Center
Mr. Abdullah, let's talk about the various activities that will take place in the coming days.
Yes, there are also surprises, but we'll discuss them quickly.
Thoughts, I don't know if you want me to recall some of the projects that were presented or
For example, with regard to underground transport, the great idea is
If there are no passengers, he has to drive on.
And they gather at one point.
I think all the viewers are enjoying the images that are appearing now.
Child labor
Okay, for example like an ATM.
For women, for example, I have a card.
I go in and say I need a T-shirt.
This is an example of some shops, or if you lose things at home, like the key.
It's lost, like the office key, for instance.
We have a primary goal set by Her Highness Sheikh Moza.
Wife of His Highness, may God protect him.
From a young age, this is very important in project design.
For three hundred invented children
We also invited speakers and researchers.
Yes, she was the one who hosted the closing ceremony.
To offer their programs, we really need to open the doors to interested children.
And then they can start.
They need to be present and support us, that's our priority.
These are programs and activities that serve this main idea.
Children's skills are different and diverse.
Self-development
Okay, do you have any collaborations with youth clubs in Qatar?
There are also science clubs in Qatar.
Of course, all our programs are based on the exchange of ideas.
This is a professional partnership.
Establish other community service institutions specialized in developing these talents.
Participation is open to all concerned institutions.
Photographers' Union
A center for creativity for girls, and the Council of Ministers also played a very important role.
Yes, they played a significant role in explaining Qatar's vision.
And training children on them.
Attracting and engaging children, as each program relies on institutional partnerships.
According to the head of projects and establishments.
And what does that change?
Being here in Katara gives us a strong boost and support.
And faster.
We are now, in collaboration with the State of Qatar, preparing projects that will be ready for launch within the next two months.
Of course, there is cooperation in many programs.
Especially with regard to reading.
The Supreme President of the Family Planning and Development Council
We're riding the wave, especially since we're in the preparation stage.
Building a promising future for all children, the next generation, and youth
What's the last piece of advice you'd give to families and children watching us now and considering joining the center?
What do we offer them now?
Sometimes our children come up with ideas that we shouldn't underestimate.
We should not dismiss their ideas, no matter what.
Because when we take it seriously, it will develop, at least we will encourage the child to think.
It remains important that we give attention and care to children.
And my spirit too, the problem with people is that most fathers
Support him.
And it motivates him, and the family encourages him as well.
More attention needs to be paid to a child's imagination, for today's generation is the foundation of the future.
We left the exhibition and saw their projects.
We missed our dream.
Dreams and thoughts were the product of a vivid imagination.
And dreams become reality, and many of them are realized and become a reality.
Praise be to God, we wish our children who were there all the best.
Our hearts are with you.
God wants.
I am of different ages and citizens.
Up to seven projects
This is considered very innovative and worthy of implementation.
Let's talk more about this national exhibition.
And the Children's Cultural Center as well.
Mr. Abdullah, let's talk simply about the exhibition.
People have done a lot of things, certainly, so what can you say about that?
Children introduced a new style of expressing pride and loyalty to their homeland.
He was under the auspices of the Minister of Education.
On a tour of the exhibition
I'll go and wait until he turns eighty, eighty, eighty.
We started training children to envision Qatar 2030 across all its three pillars.
Human development, economic development, sustainable development, environmental development
First, to know Qatar's position in 2030.
Then, to start thinking about
Creative ideas, and how to be innovative.
I suppose they already have a broad mind.
But why should we help him?
I expect their thinking to grow and develop further.
Sir, I launched the exhibition under the slogan "Dreams of a Generation: Realities or the Nation of Tomorrow"
The slogan says "Dreams of a Generation"
It will be part of Qatar's future, Qatar tomorrow.
I felt that when we were walking with the children, when the child tells the official,
I want you to open my project, and you can plant my project in about twenty or thirty.
A child thinking twenty years ahead.
Expressing their love for their countries in the field they are passionate about.
There must be some activities, events, and competitions.
One of them won the Stars for Peace Awards.
There were also the winners of the first "Soud" prize at the Arab League summit.
Sure, all the children.
On the side, there were various events on a fixed schedule.
To present the projects they have done.
There is a great existence, a very unique existence.
Star of Science
Some of the winners in the projects that participated in the exhibition.
Who won one of the grand prizes?
What is a natural theater, garden, or creative and innovative reserve?
We also want to talk about the colored ball.
The colorful ball is also one of the children's dreams and a vision for the future of Qatar.
This is an idea for 20 or 30 years.
How can a child contribute a creative idea in twenty or thirty?
The main idea is that there's a chip inside the ball.
I have a colored warning for the shepherd.
Example: Can the referee see the ball's movement?
Or the field is changed by this electronic slide.
He is good at soccer.
There are creative ideas, of course, this is the main idea, people might ask.
and projects
Build ships, and sail in them.
Skills development and broadening their horizons
Giving them an idea of how to express national belonging through these projects.
Giving them confidence in how to present the project, engage with the audience, and explain its idea.
In a field he loves, being engaged in something he enjoys is an accomplishment.
He offered help, and we thank him for it.
Which is now in the development stage.
The audience, the committee, and certain individuals also encouraged these projects.
First, no, it was the second, because this girl.
Connections, channels for underground recording operations, and the way viewers enter require arrangements.
A very large tree valley
A place where a visitor can go, pay respects, and see animals and lizards.
There's also a sensor attached to several animals to monitor their condition.
There is also the marine environment, and the way to enter is also creative.
One of the reasons she won was her broad and detailed imagination.
All this is thanks to her family.
There is also a person who talked about an underwater tourist city.
Butterfly City
A forest on Earth.
Many tourist ideas.
There's something nice.
Perhaps this is what their minds need, at this time, maybe in 2030.
And in the future, it will be achieved.
Three projects.
It was adopted by the science club, they said these are the projects we should work on.
There's a project, which is recycling excess water from air conditioners.
Let's see the rabbit's newspaper.
The article says, "Qatar University celebrates the graduation of students."
The presence of His Excellency Mr. Saad bin Ibrahim Al Mahmoud
Minister of Education and Higher Education, Secretary General of the Supreme Education Council
And Dr. Shaikha bint Abdullah Al-Missnad, as President.
A new record for the university, surely.
Qatar University and University of Calgary
There's also very good news about our students.
This is an educational achievement, and we wish them success in all fields, God willing.
Those who are called by some of the muffled, grunting actors who stride powerfully in the eastern quarter of the curtain.
Until when, also "categories" and "colored threads".
Actor Abdel Hamid Sharshani is considered one of the actors who honed their own future.
If it wasn't convincing.
He chooses to be in businesses operating in Qatar.
Now, actor Abdel Hamid Sharshani is participating in the series "The Killer Feeling" and "Tashneef Part Two".
We were happy to see him this morning.
So we can talk to him about his participation in these two works and about his overall experience.
Welcome, good morning.
We are lucky to have you on the show, Good Morning Doha. This is the first time I see you, and this is your first time on Good Morning Doha.
With people who work hard for the program
And you, Lady Lisa.
Welcome! Before we start talking, let's...
Okay, let's see.
I am a responsible man and an executive officer.
And I enforce the laws.
What I'm supposed to be able to tell you,
Give me the bisht.
Listen, why are you asking me this?
I'm going to ask them if anyone minds if you don't wear the bisht.
Of course I have other questions to start with, but since we've seen this part of the series "Tashanif" Part 1.
He pointed to Khalid ibn al-Walid.
Some historians link the famous poet Imru' al-Qais to the city of Marid.
A lot of farms and related information associated with a city in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
For more information, we will watch together this excellent report from our colleague Abdulrahman Al-Marshed.
Let's see it together.
Okay, I'm sure this is a certificate from people who understand the subject well and don't make any discrimination or preference.
And as proof of the history of this city or otherwise.
All that we see of his ancient history, and all that we hear from their stories and poets
Their humming, humming, humming, humming, humming, humming, humming, humming, humming, humming, humming, humming, humming, humming, humming, humming, humming, humming, humming, humming.
Marat City is one of the cities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Historically, it is an ancient city founded in the pre-Islamic era.
There was a disagreement among historians about how it got its name.
Some believed it was named after the famous poet Imru' al-Qais al-Kindi.
And the valley they call by his name.
The date of its foundation is unknown.
In the pre-Islamic era.
The most famous thing in the city of Marath is Mount Comet, which has been the subject of many proverbs.
Because it's in the city and close to it.
The mountains. These are historical places.
This view is considered a tourist attraction in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
The municipal council has made a great effort to make
A garden on this mountain.
And seating areas for citizens and everyone in the kingdom.
We named it after the companion of the Prophet Muhammad, Khalid ibn al-Walid (may Allah be pleased with him).
The fighting of the hypocrites and Musa bin Umar the liar.
And among its effects is the valley of the comet.
This is a place that collects water from the rain and stores it.
It was one of the most important sources of water in the past.
From his archaeological collections, as well as the Dawahi Heritage House.
Al-Marat is a city whose history dates back to pre-Islamic times.
He was famous for his poems that were influenced by them.
With its beauty, its abandoned fortresses, and its mountain known as Koymait.
Abdulrahman Al-Marshad for the Doha Morning Program.
The city that is Marat, north of Riyadh.
Welcome back to our dear guests.
I wish you could tell us and the viewers about the methods and techniques of D.
Initially, you stated that our infrastructure is very unique.
We create a page for him and he registers himself with a specific record in our system.
Email guardian.
This report covers the range of increased attention, typing speed, reading speed, and overall distraction.
The guard gets a full report.
Alright, this report will be added to the student's record.
Logs into his son's online account.
And he sees the progress of his son.
And he can see his progress and focus with the teachers.
So we can truly enjoy the intelligence of this cute girl.
In order to gather most of the children in the center and convey our best wishes to them.
Who registered at this centre with a teacher there.
To assess her intelligence and level of access, we've been monitoring her since she entered the facility.
Of course, this year.
He is focused on one job after Ramadan.
But of course this has an impact that works to the detriment of other tasks, always.
Some people only watch TV during Ramadan.
He was sitting, aiming at the television, while people were celebrating the holy months with him.
Ease up, ease up, ease up the chain, ease up, let them do one job every two years, is that better?
Sure.
Oh God, make them like me in Ramadan.
I just want to send you all my best regards.
Oh Lord
Also with plays.
From theater to fashion.
A fashion show was held in Katara Cultural Village.
Of course, we still love you and believe you as before.
Develop children's potentials and skills more.
In a manner distinct from the multiple schools in this generous country.
We're making a model and we contacted our guest whom we met before.
We now have Mr. Ibrahim Hussein Abdulsalam with us, good morning.
How are you, Omnieh?
I'm good.
Which grade are you in now?
Professor Ibrahim, to start, could you please introduce us to the course offered by the center?
And Omnia is an example of that.
We'll also try the method or approach that Nesma mentioned several times.
Does he feel there's a difference in his head?
You feel that these skills and methods,
The situation will change in terms of his mental abilities or even his educational level.
Scientific methods
Including initially testing the child with an international test called the "Toni Test" before starting anything in the program.
Starting Part 2 also of Tony's test
We can measure the level or the change in the student's level through it.
Now, a test or something like that will be held.
Omniya will be with you shortly and will answer you live immediately.
Of course, Omnia doesn't know anything about the questions.
We surprised them with this thing.
Of course, I have other questions to get started.
We would like to ask you about your participation in the second part this year.
What is your contribution? Could you tell us about it?
Of course, after we presented the "Tashanif" series, part one,
Alhamdulillah, I've been fortunate with different roles.
Mr. Ghaneem,
They distributed roles with the executive director Ashraf Shahata, in addition to Mr.
This is Tara's opportunity to produce artistic works.
For the youth.
Oh Sir Ghaniem, this year I was nominated for
Of course, every episode is different.
I play different characters in more than one episode.
On the contrary, it's a wonderful experience. In this job, I have...
From the Kuwait Towers, Mr. Saad Al-Faraj.
We have representatives from Bahrain, Abdullah Malik, Ali Al Gharair.
As there is Haji Ali Mirza, we are.
You also have a group of young actors like Abdullah Adam.
Yes, among the young actors, we have Abdullah Al-Asam.
This happened a year ago, and last year we did two projects per year.
That might be the reason I asked you before you broadcast. You've been doing this job since 1997.
But you couldn't achieve anything, nor your ambition in acting.
Praise be to God for everything.
Did you study role-playing or was it just a question?
No, I consider it a hobby.
I pursued acting as a profession. The actor Abdul Aziz Al-Jassim took me under his wing at the beginning of my career.
He is one of the actors who consider me their son.
If you need anything, call him.
We were in every show of his.
We worked hard and thanked God.
Now, without Tara, a very special thank you to Mr. Andrahmane Sellety, and a very special thank you to Mr. Abdourahmane.
If we compare our situation to Kuwait, every year in Kuwait there are 12 to 16 new actors who emerge. Why?
They were.
Of course, thank him very much for that because he gives a lot of opportunities.
Okay, let's say,
Let's talk about other series, we had an idea about Tessellations.
We need to know about the deadly feeling.
And the foot is most specifically affected by it.
We have a sample, and we have with us the processor, Professor Abdulaziz Al-Muyouf Al-Tamimi.
For this process to happen inside, it means
And we'll see how we can deal with this person. Let's be frank, good morning Mr./Sir Subhi bin Hamza, welcome.
Welcome, and peace be upon you.
Alright, let's start with you, sir, please.
Insha'Allah.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
We are happy to shake your hand.
We feel tense.
It's like a painting or a message from God Almighty, bearing witness to and exalting him, revealing all the parts of your body.
From their faces and their problems
It hurts a little sometimes.
Headache and dizziness.
Loosen your hand, loosen it. Let your nerves relax, yes.
By doing this, Mr. Abdulaziz, you will discover something specific from his hand, that he has a specialized disease.
On his left side. His ears, he has a mild infection in his middle ears.
I'm in pain! What does that mean, Professor Abdulaziz?
Ear. Do you have an ear problem?
From the time of my birth and from the time I was a small child.
Does it hurt you here, too?
This is the brain tissue around the nose!
Do you have a pain in the middle and a headache here?
I have a headache here.
He has a problem with his Eustachian tube.
It gives him a headache between his eyes.
Weight increases without eating.
It's not working properly, you feel lazy and sluggish all the time, and you feel like your body is heavy.
I sleep a lot.
You're either presumptuous or shy, you always feel like a burden.
You always have an inflamed tongue.
He is present. See the vibration, you will notice the vibration.
He's suffering from stress, and you never take the leisurely walk, maybe the last time.
Are you from Tunisia?
Yo, you mentioned some things about him.
Does this message help the boys as well?
Praise be to God, the mother's finger is about the size of the baby's palm.
Most children don't nap, why?
When you try to feed him, he doesn't like it, but people think he does. He has gas in his belly, please.
With what the mother greased her finger, she extended it.
In the baby's comfort.
Their hands are parallel, and the child is parallel to them.
Let's see it, so every mother can learn this move.
She's going to start pressing like this. Right and left, and right and left.
This is about the child, about, about, about the child, and it's sweet.
Okay, regarding discoveries, you have discoveries specific to women, particularly.
As we said, in every house, there are 90% ladies, God bless them.
First thing, first warning is from the ceramic to the ground.
When we walk on porcelain with our feet, it's usually fine, but walking on uneven or slippery surfaces can be dangerous.
Walk naked! There is evidence of this when they use porcelain in homes, increased health problems.
Because it's cold and flat.
Since it was a carpet, there were problems, they were exposed to asthma.
Increased.
Women should be keen to focus on walking barefoot on chivalry.
This is the heel and the Achilles tendon area at the back, the Achilles tendon.
From here, this ankle and now down the cursed.
This is the first discovery, and the second discovery is a way to facilitate delivery.
Focus with me a bit.
In her seventh or ninth month.
Generally, just being in the delivery month.
That means they don't come in the eighth, the eighth is dangerous, and the most dangerous thing is to walk barefoot.
A pregnant woman should be careful about walking barefoot.
If it were to happen
I seek refuge in the Most High from the accursed Satan, "And stir up in the veils of falsehood a heavy weight, so that abundant misfortunes may fall upon you."
We know that Mary, God have mercy on her, had her own blessings.
I even felt like I was talking to scholars who told me: "Why are you changing the interpretation of Ibn Kathir?"
I told them, "I have conveyed the idea that God has placed in this science, and it inspires me."
The porcupine quills are directed towards you, and when they are released, how will it be?
It's sharp like screws or thorns.
When you shake the palm tree, it strengthens the womb area, which is the region of the wombs, right in the middle.
This is blood. It gives orders to facilitate the delivery and implantation of the embryo.
The fetal head is elevated or moved so that it comes into position naturally.
Praise be to God, this is one of the results of that thing.
He extends his hand and begins with its palm.
Some follow it as a habit, and some know it as a science.
Therefore, they're afraid to tell you, and you don't believe them.
Yes, Mr. Abdulaziz, your discoveries are important.
I just want to ask you another question because time passed by so quickly.
If anyone wants to talk to you, any protocol, any electronic protocol, or you.
Okay, the mobile phone number is in the control room, and if anyone wants to speak to Haj Abdul Aziz, they can call us after the program.
Of course, through Qatar TV numbers, so he can reach us and get this number.
I was made to serve people only.
If we believe in this faith, God will forgive your deed and guide the people.
I'm just like everyone else, and I do everything you can imagine. I'm a regular guy.
But we strive for good more than that.
We always wait for the good things.
Dear audience, I hope you enjoyed this segment on reflexology and manual therapy.
Also through the foot.
We see a live model on television, how can we detect diseases that this person does not have.
And what he's going through. I wish we could benefit from you, and if anyone wants to talk to him, they can read about him online.
The exact way it will be implemented, whether in the coming days or years, or if it includes more schools.
Good morning
How do you evaluate this experience?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
The fact that obesity in Gulf countries has become a big problem.
Okay, we were afraid Qatar would become the fifth state with them.
This program frankly, it turned out to be the first lady in New York.
I visited Doha, and they have this program there.
They made it available to us, so we accepted it and said it was fine.
Our students with students from New York, Spain, and England,
Therefore, we can notice the level of our students in Qatar among the world, and this is something we want in the future.
To encourage students to eat fruit.
And he will stop playing sports.
Of course, the fifth week is your family dinner with your family.
We kill two birds with one stone.
In the sixth week, he tells us what he has learned from this experience. Praise be to God, we have reached the conclusion today.
We are students.
Just so you know, there were three independent schools, for boys, Abu Obeida,
For Rukaya, an independent woman.
And with high spirits.
The family was more aware, and their brother was enthusiastic at home and started eating this food like them.
Becoming a transitional culture between the student and transferring this culture to the home to his family.
He's going to tell them, "He sent this to me, but didn't inform me about it."
The trainers or the person who provided these students with this information,
How did you choose him? How did you communicate with the student? Who communicated?
Yes, there were many officials who helped us, may God reward them.
At our Diet Center, sisters are taught about food, of course, healthy food.
And learn from Lady A'isha al-Tamimi the etiquette of eating.
How are they sorted, and how are their priorities arranged!
To learn cooking, sports, or to teach someone about the nutritional value of healthy food.
It was in the form of separate lessons, or a curriculum, or
How did these ideas reach the students?
In various ways, some within the school.
We organized a day at the beginning of the program in the Aspire area, where we gathered all the students, male and female.
This is not something arranged by a particular person, but we are all responsible, responsible because they are our children.
How were those students treated at first?
I initially said the results were satisfactory.
Are three shifts or special shifts sufficient for those schools?
Now, when an experiment starts in the world, it doesn't start on a large scale.
It starts with a reasonable price range, and includes all the features: boy, girl, independent, and private.
Since it's not suitable for our culture, environment, and family circumstances, they accept some things for their children and don't accept others.
The assumption, they want to participate in it, and frankly, it's very important.
The student, whether male or female, to whom I sold or gave it, this is the appropriate time for them to know about their health.
This is a struggle for many people who feel like they want to be thinner, but think it's impossible.
Some of the actors we complained about in the cinema, who looked thin, said it was impossible, no!
We talked in detail, but there were many weeks we couldn't cover.
And through the morning of Doha, we can remind them of it.
And fruits that contain vitamin B can be obtained from fruits and vegetables.
Okay, people need to know the benefits of fruit, and they know that what they get from it will improve their health, so this will make them happy and relaxed.
As for fruits, they went to the supermarket and picked out their fruits.
Alright, that's a point.
This is diversity, and of course they compete. Each school was creative with its teachers' different ideas.
Spirit of competition
We provide them with guidelines, and everyone should be creative.
Did the teachers train the students, or do you have a special team?
We raised them, we raised them.
But teachers were adding, for example, some schools like Abu Obeida said they would make Saturday for student activities.
This is a day outside school hours, and they decided and adopted it; Ms. Rogaya's teacher said they would hold a procession.
They said they were going to have a healthy cooking day for the girls, but we didn't require the boys to do healthy cooking on their own, the girls were more into it.
Also, I want to thank Al-Rayan Water Company for providing free water to all schools, Al-Rayan Water Company for what you've done.
Of course, water is definitely healthier because it is essential for cleansing the body of all these toxic substances that enter it daily through water.
We said in the third week.
It means I am his body.
He might be playing soccer or basketball and not know that it's the game I love.
Correct, correct, exactly, and some might want another game, maybe they don't like team games.
Welcome to our live stream.
Welcome, Mr. Abdulaziz Al-Jaber, founder and director of the Multiple Epilepsy Association in the State of Qatar.
Of course, we try as much as possible to focus on important topics.
We would like to introduce and inform our dear viewers about what multiple sclerosis is.
Because this name might be strange to us as well.
The number of women was greater than the number of men.
All currently available treatments are preventive.
The white cells that are supposed to protect us start to
He's killing us with his neural cells strike.
Let's simplify the matter for the audience, like a wire.
Covered by a layer called myelin, meaning a nylon layer.
Of course, this usually leads to dizziness, blurriness, and double vision.
This also causes problems in the digestive and respiratory systems.
This can lead to madness at its worst, this can lead to the trio of paralysis or hemiplegia.
Of course, treatments.
The most important functions in the body will be severely damaged.
Or from this disease, which is a disease called multiple sclerosis.
Some theories say it was transmitted by a virus.
The disease is not infectious.
I won't be able to reach the kids.
Some consider it a disease depending on the region.
The African line, for example, was exempt from this disease.
Now, we have some cases of this disease on the equator.
This disease currently has no treatment because its cause is unknown.
So far, scientists are unable to find the cause of the disease, so they can find a cure for it.
Now the process is reversed.
They try to avoid the impact of the disease itself on the human body.
In other words, they start working from the back.
We might have a bit of fear about this issue, which we can call the sudden onset of the disease.
Is there a specific group, a community that you feel this illness has spread within a specific group?
Internationally, he was ranked between twenty and forty.
Now, the international community has reduced the number from twenty to fifteen.
Because it has started to affect young people up to the age of forty.
But man doesn't recover from this.
Of course, as a society, we are open to alternative medicine and Prophetic medicine.
Yes, so through the association, Multiple Sclerosis Qatar Association.
Why does this society exist?
There was a large crowd, so you thought to yourself: "Okay, let's consider forming an association for this matter."
Of course, we'll give you random numbers.
In Kuwait, they say the number of cases is sixteen thousand.
A thousand cases
The rest of the Gulf countries range between one hundred and three hundred.
When you examined me five or six years ago,
My number was sixty or forty.
Are there any symptoms that indicate the patient is already suffering from this disease?
We're not sure if this is a virus, so we don't want to jump to conclusions. That's one point.
The second point is, how do I know if I'm in it or not?
This is very difficult.
I don't know, Mr. Abdelaziz! You're asking about a specific point.
