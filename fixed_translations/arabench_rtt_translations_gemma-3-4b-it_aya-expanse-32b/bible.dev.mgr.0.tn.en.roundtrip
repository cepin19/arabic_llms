Josiah was the father of Jacob and his brothers. At that time, the people of Israel were forced to migrate to Babylon.
Then the family line continued. Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud. Abiud was the father of Eliakam. Eliakam was the father of Azur.
Azor was the father of Zadok. Zadok was the father of Akiv. Akiv was the father of Eliud.
Eliezer was the father of Machir. Machir was the father of Gilead.
Jacob was the father of Joseph. Joseph was the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Christ.
There are 14 generations from Abraham to David. There are 14 generations from David until the Jews were forced to migrate to Babylon. There are 14 generations from that time until Christ. Jesus Christ was born.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband, Youssef, was a good man. He didn't want to embarrass her in front of people. So he planned to separate from her quietly.
Now when Jesus had been born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, “Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.”
She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.
All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken through the prophet.
Mary will give birth tomorrow. She will bear a son, and they will call his name Immanuel, which means "God with us."
Joseph woke up. He did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him. He took Mary to be his wife.
But he did not sleep with her until she gave birth to a son. And he named him Jesus.
Wise Men visitors of Jesus
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This was during the reign of Herod, king of Judea. After the birth of Jesus, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem.
They were able, "O Jews, O kingdom glorified in the grip of the Jews, where are you? If we are in the north, we saw his star. Today we have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard the news, he was greatly enraged. Everyone in Jerusalem was also disturbed.
This Herod summoned the chief priests and the scribes of the people together. He inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.
In Bethlehem in Judea, they answered. "This is what the prophet wrote. He said:"
"‘And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.’"
Then Herod called the wise men secretly and learned from them the exact time the star had appeared.
Send them to Bethlehem. He said, "Go! Search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, inform me with a report. Then I too can go and worship him."
After the wise men heard about the king, they set out on their way. The star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.
The sight of the star filled them with joy.
The wise men left for the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures. They gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their homeland by another route. The family of Jesus flees to Egypt.
Loyal to the wise men's departure, Joseph dreamed a dream. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him. The angel said, "Arise! Take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you to return. Herod will search for the child. He wants to kill him."
Joseph awakens. During the night, he fled to Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.
They remained there until the death of King Herod, so that what the Lord had spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled: "Out of Egypt I called my son" (Hosea 11:1).
Herod realized that the wise men had betrayed him. Therefore, he became very angry. He gave orders concerning Bethlehem and the surrounding area. All the children two years old and under were to be killed. This corresponded to the time when the wise men had seen the star.
With that, the words spoken by the prophet Yeremiah became true. He had said:
A voice was heard in Ramah, a voice of deep weeping and mourning. Rachel was weeping for her children; she refused to be comforted, because they were no more. The family of Jesus returned to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while still in Egypt. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Go! Take the child and his mother. Journey to the land of Israel. Whoever mourns for the child's death is already dead."
Zephaniah stood up. He served the child and his mother Mary to the land of Israel.
But then he heard that Archelaus was king of Judea. Archelaus reigned in place of his father Herod. This made Joseph afraid to go there. Warned in a dream, Joseph returned instead to the land of Galilee.
There he lived in a town called Nazareth. And what the prophets had said about Jesus came true. They had said, "He will be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist is present at the entrance of the Messiah.
During that time, Jesus the builder came and taught in the Judean desert.
He said: "Repent from evil! The kingdom of righteousness is near."
John is the one the prophet Isaiah spoke about. He said, "A voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
The clothes that were for Buh were made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. His food was blind insects and wild milk.
The people came to him from Jerusalem and all Judea, and from the region along the Jordan River.
And when they had confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John heard many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing, and he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.
You cannot say to each other, "Abraham is our father." I tell you, God can raise up children for Abraham from these stones.
The sickle has already fallen on the tree trunks. Every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water, and to repent you rely on me. But after me will come one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
He has a scythe in his hand to clear the straw from his harvest field. He will gather his wheat into the place where he stores it. But he will burn the chaff with an inextinguishable flame. Jesus is completing his washing.
Esau brought a gallon of water from Galilee to the sea. He wanted to baptize John.
But John tried to prevent him. Luke said to Jesus, "I must be baptized by you, and do you come to me?"
Jesus replies, "So it must be. We have the right to do this. It fulfills God's holy plan." John agrees.
As soon as Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Jesus is tested.
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert. There, the devil tempted him.
After 40 days and 40 nights of not eating, Jesus was hungry.
This devil came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, turn these stones into bread."
A certain sage said: "A company of soldiers is gathered, 'Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the lips of the Lord.'"
Behold, the devils took Jesus to the holy city of Jerusalem. They commanded him to stand on the highest point of the temple.
"If you are the Son of God," he said, "stand up and cast yourself down. For it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you carefully. They will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'" (Psalm 91:11, 12)
Jesus answered her, "It is written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain. He showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
"If you stop bothering me and contact me," he said, "I'll give you all of this."
Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'"
Then the devil left Jesus. Angels came and took care of him. Jesus Begins to Preach.
John had been taken to prison. When Jesus heard of it, he returned to Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and went to live in the town of Capernaum, which was on the lake in the region of Zebulun and Naphthalim.
Thus what the prophet Isaiah said was fulfilled. He said:
Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where the Gentiles dwell! The region by the sea! The district beyond the Jordan!
Those who turn to Him and are not in darkness will see a great light. They were in a land of deep darkness, but the light will shine on these people.
From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, "Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." He chose the first apostles.
One day Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers, Simon son of John and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
"Come. Stand behind me," said Jesus. "I will make you fishers of men."
In a moment, they left the windows and followed him.
From there, he saw two brothers, James and John, sons of Zebedee, in their boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets. Jesus called them.
Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed Jesus. Jesus healed the sick.
Jesus walked everywhere in Galilee. There he taught in the synagogues, proclaimed the good news of the kingdom of God, and healed every disease and sickness among the people.
News about him spread throughout Syria. People brought to him all who were sick with various diseases. Some were suffering from severe pain. Others were possessed by demons. Some were violently shaking. Others could not move at all. And Jesus healed them all.
The crowd increased and followed him. People came to him from the region of Galilee, and from the Decapolis, and from Jerusalem and Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.
Jesus grants blessings.
Esau saw the people. So he went up to a mountain and prayed. His disciples came to him.
They were occupied with knowledge. He said.
Blessed are those who are spiritually needy. The kingdom of heaven rules over them.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
God bless the righteous, those we are ashamed of. Oh, He gives them the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Bless those who show mercy, and Allah will have mercy on you.
God blesses their pure hearts, for they see God.
God bless those who keep silent. They will be the children of God.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
May God bless you when people laugh at you and harm you because of me. And you are blessed when they tell you all kinds of evil lies because of me.
Be joyful and peaceful. Your reward in Paradise is great. Indeed, they harm the prophets who lived for a short while. Salt and light.
You are the salt of the earth. But if salt has lost its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
Also, people don't light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead, they place it on its stand. Then it lights up for everyone in the house.
In this way, let your light shine before others. Then they will see the good you do and will glorify your Father in heaven. Jesus gives full meaning to the law.
I don't think I came to bring out what is written on the tablets or in the vision. I didn't come to fulfill it. I came to give full meaning to what is written.
What I am telling you is the truth. Heaven and earth will disappear before even a single letter of the law disappears. Not even a dot will disappear from the law until everything is accomplished.
Do not break even the least of these commandments. And do not teach anyone to break them. If you do, you will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But if you keep them and teach others to keep them, you will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
This is what I tell you. You must be holier than the Pharisees and the teachers. And if you are not, you will surely not enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Kill.
"I have heard what was said to the people who lived long ago. It was said to them: 'You shall not kill.' (Exodus 20:13) And whoever kills will be accountable for it."
But this is what I'm telling you: Don't be angry with your brother. Anyone who is angry with his brother is liable to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, 'Raka' [fool], is liable to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You fool!' is in danger of hellfire.
If you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,
Leave your gift before the altar. First go and be reconciled with your brother; then come and offer your gift.
If someone accuses you and files a lawsuit against you, quickly settle the matter. Do that while you're still with him on the way. Otherwise, the judge might implicate him in your favor. The officer might implicate you. You might end up in jail.
What's coming for me is real. Don't you dare leave until you pay me every last penny!
I have heard it said, 'Do not deprive one another' (1 Corinthians 7:5).
But this is what she told me. Never look at a woman the wrong way. Anyone who looks at her the wrong way has already sentenced her in their heart.
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. Your eye is just one part of your body. It is better to lose it than to have your whole body thrown into hell.
If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. Your hand is only one part of your body. It is better to lose it than to have your whole body go into hell.
"The scholars testified that he said: 'As a lesson, when a man divorces his wife, he must give her the divorce settlement.'"
But this is what I'm telling you. Any man who divorces his wife causes her to commit adultery. And any man who marries a divorced woman causes adultery. A man can divorce his wife only if she has been unfaithful to him. Two oaths.
Once again, you have heard what was said to them long ago. Tell them: "Do not break your vows to God. Honor the oath you swore to Him."
But this is what got you into trouble. Never make such a promise again. Don't do it in the name of heaven. This is God's throne.
Do not create it in the name of Earth. This is the throne of God's feet. And do not create it in the name of Jerusalem. This is the land of the great King.
And do not swear by your head. You cannot make a single hair white or black.
Alright, let your 'yes' mean 'yes' and your 'no' mean 'no'. Anything more than this comes from the devil. Be kind to others.
I have heard it said, "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth." (Exodus 21:24; Deuteronomy 24:20; 2 Samuel 19:21)
But this is what I tell you: Do not resist an evil person. "If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also."
If anyone takes you to court over your shirt, let him have your coat as well.
If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles.
Give to those who ask of you. Do not turn your back on those who want to borrow from you. Love your enemies.
Words I heard spoken, "Love your neighbor" (Deuteronomy 19:18) "Hate your enemy."
But this is what will peel you off. Love your enemy. Pray for those who have hurt you.
"So you are to be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect. He makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous."
If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them.
If you are merely saying goodbye to your relatives, what more are you doing than others? Even those who are not righteous do that.
Be perfect, as your Father in heaven is perfect.
Giving to the poor
Do not do good in secret lest it be seen in you. And if you do, do not apologize, for your Father in heaven does not reward you for it.
When you give to the poor and needy, do not boast about it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, so that they may be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
If you give to the poor, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
Then your charity will be rewarded in secret. Your Lord will reward you. He sees what you do in secret. Amen.
When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, who love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
When you pray, go to your room. Close the door and pray to your unseen God. He is the one who will reward you. Your Lord sees what you do in secret.
And when you pray, do not babble like the hypocrites, for they think they will be heard because of their many words.
Don't be like them. Your father knows what he needs from you even before you ask him.
This is how you should pray: "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
May God grant you your kingdom. May God guide you to what you desire to happen on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
Unless you wish to be dwellers (in Hell). They wish they were even (justly treated).
Forgive people when they wrong you. And if you do that, your Father in heaven will also forgive you.
But if you do not forgive your parents their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive you your trespasses. Fast.
When he fasts, he doesn't rejoice like those who hate it and eat. His face is broken and sad. He scares people into thinking he's fasting. What I'm telling you is true. They found their full reward.
Rub your head with olive oil. Wash your face.
Then others will not know that you are fasting. Only He who is unseen will know, and He will reward you. Your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you. Store up your treasures in heaven.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
Instead, store up your treasures in heaven, where moths and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
Your heart is where your treasure is.
The eye is like a lamp for the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light.
But imagine if your eyes are tired. Then your whole body is filled with darkness. And if the light within us is darkness, then it is profound darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. You will hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not be afraid.
I've heard about you, you don't rely on anything. You don't rely on your life, you eat and drink. And you don't rely on your body, you wear clothes. Isn't food more essential than life? Isn't clothing more important for the body?
Look at the birds of the sky. They do not sow or gather the harvest into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?
Can you add an hour to your life by worrying?
Are you even wearing clothes? I saw a video like a wild flower. They don't make or print clothes.
But that's what I told you. Even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
If this is how God clothes the grass of the field, will he not clothe you even better? After all, the grass is here today, and tomorrow is thrown into the fire. You of little faith!
Don't be afraid. Don't say what he didn't say: "What are we going to bring?" or "What are we going to drink?" or "What are we going to wear?"
People who eat for other than Allah, they are racing towards all of this. Your Lord in the heavens, He knows that you will return to Him.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
Don't worry about the future. The future is going to be afraid of itself. Every day it lives its problems.
Be fair when judging others.
Don't wrong anyone, and no one will wrong you.
This is what you will be judged by the same standard by which you judge others. You will be measured by the same measure with which you measure others.
Look at the small piece of straw in the eye of creation. But don't use your reason for the piece of wood in your eye.
How would you tell your craft, "Let me take a splinter out of your eye," when you've got a splinter in your own eye?
This is hypocrisy! First, remove the log from your own eye. Then, you will be able to see clearly to remove the speck from your friend's eye.
Don't worship idols. Don't throw your jewels to dogs. If you do, they might walk all over them and scratch you. Then they might turn around and bite you. Ask, seek, knock.
He was asked, so he answered you. Seek, and you shall find. Knock, and the door shall be opened unto you.
He who asks is accepted. He who seeks finds. The door will open for him who remains.
Imagine your son asks for bread. Which one of you would give him a stone?
Or imagine he's asking about a fish. Who among you will give him a carp?
Although you are evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more generous will your Father in heaven be in giving good gifts to those who ask Him!
In everything, do to others what you would have them do to you; this is the law and the prophets. The great and small gates.
Enter the kingdom of God through the narrow gate. The gate is wide and the road is broad that lead to death and hell. Many walk this path.
But the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life. Only a few find it. A tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
You can tell what they're really like by what they do. "Do people pick grapes from thorns? Do they gather figs from thistles?"
Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You can distinguish every tree by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father who is in heaven.
"They will say to me on that day, 'Lord! Lord! Did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?'"
Then I will say to them plainly, "I never knew you. Depart from me, you who do evil!" The wise builder and the foolish builder.
This is true, everyone who hears my words and puts them into practice is like a wise man. He builds his house on the rock.
Water drips. Water rises. Entities intermingle and settle on this house. But they do not die. It is built on rock.
But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
Oh, the wind is dying down. The waters are calming. The bleeding has stopped and the cut is healing. It's healing strongly.
Jesus finished His speech. The crowd was amazed at His teaching.
He taught as if he had authority. He did not speak as their scribes did.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain. A large crowd followed him.
A man with a skin disease touched him, and Jesus, moved with pity, knelt down, placed his hands on the man, and said, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."
Jesus stretched out his hand and touched the man. He said, "I am willing to do this. Be clean!" Immediately, his skin disease was healed.
Then Jesus said to him, "Tell no one. Go, show yourself to the priests. Make the offering that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." A Roman officer believes.
When Jesus entered Capernaum, a Roman centurion came to him asking for help.
"Oh Lord," he said, "I have a servant who is bedridden and cannot move. He is suffering greatly."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
The chief said, "Lord, I find nothing in myself that would lead you to my house. But speak a word, and my servant will be healed."
I myself am a man under authority, and I have soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servants, Do this, and they do it.
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those who followed him, "Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with faith as great as this."
I tell you that many will come from the east and the west. They will take their places at the table in the kingdom of heaven. They will sit with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
But those who believe they belong to the kingdom will be cast out into the outer darkness. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Jesus said to the centurion, "Go! Let it be done just as you believed." And his servant was healed at that very moment. Jesus healed many people.
When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Esau touched her hand, and the fever left her. She rose and began to serve him.
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
He did it to fulfill the prophecy of Isaiah. He said, "He bore our griefs and carried our sorrows. He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his stripes we are healed." (Isaiah 53:4) The cost of following Jesus.
Jesus sent his disciples to gather witnesses around him. Then he gave his disciples orders to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
An Islamic teacher was occupied with him. He said, "My teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
My Lord Jesus answered: "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests. But the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
In another version: "Lord, first let me go and bury my father."
And Jesus said to him, "Follow me. Let the dead bury their dead." Jesus calms the wind.
Jesus entered the garden. His disciples followed him.
Suddenly, a terrible storm swept across the lake. The waves surged over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
The two boys went and shouted. They said, "Oh Lord! Save us! We are drowning!"
He said to her, "Your faith is so small! Why are you afraid?" Then Jesus got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it became completely calm.
The crowds were amazed. They asked, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and waves obey him!" Jesus healed two demon-possessed men who were very violent.
Jesus arrived at the other side of the lake, in the region of the Gadarenes. He encountered a man possessed by demons. The man came from the tombs. There were many demons, and no one could pass by that way.
"Son of God, what do you want with us?" they cried. "Have you come here to torment us before our time?"
It was a bit confusing, a large group of pigs was biting.
The demons begged him, "If you drive us out, send us to the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" And the demons came out of the men and entered the pigs. All the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned in the water.
Those who used to raise pigs fled. They went to the city and told everyone everything. They told people what happened to the Muslims who were bewitched.
All the people of the region came out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they bowed down before him and begged him to leave their district.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk.
Jesus got into a boat, crossed to the other side of the lake, and arrived at his city.
Some men brought to him a paralytic, lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said, "Do not be afraid, son; your sins are forgiven."
Some of the knowledgeable people said to each other, "He is saying very evil things!"
Jesus knew their thoughts. He said to them, "Why do you have evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Get up and walk"?
I saw you, I have a relationship with you, that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. Then he said to the man who could not walk, "Rise up." He said to him, "Take up your mat and go home."
The man stood up and went home.
When they saw this people, they were amazed, and acknowledged to God the power which he had given him. Jesus chooses Matthias.
Because of this, John saw a man named Matthew sitting in the tax collector's booth. He said to him, "Follow me." And Matthew got up and followed him.
Later, Jesus was dining at Matthew's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" came. They ate with Jesus and his disciples.
The Pharisees saw this and said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Isa heard that. He said, "The healthy don't need a doctor, and the sick do."
Come and learn what this saying means: "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners. Jesus is asked about fasting.
One day the disciples of John came and said to him, "We and the Pharisees fast often; why do your disciples not fast?"
Jesus answered and said to them, "How is it that the children of sorrow are to be comforted, and you are without comfort? When the time comes, you will follow him and be drawn to him, and then you will be comforted."
People don't sew a new piece of cloth onto old clothes. The new cloth will shrink and ruin the fit.
People don't put new wine in old wineskins. If they do, the wineskins will burst. The wine will run out, and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they put new wine in new wineskins. Then both are preserved. A dead woman and a suffering woman.
"Therefore Jesus spoke of that, and a man came to him, and worshiped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay your hand upon her, and she will live."
Jesus rose and went with him. His disciples did the same.
So a woman named Susanna came to Jesus. She had been suffering from bleeding for twelve years, and she came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak.
Hant, "All I want is to touch his clothes. Then it'll be easy."
Jesus turned and saw her. "Daughter," he said, "your faith has healed you." And the woman was healed at that very moment.
When Jesus entered the ruler's house, he saw the mourners there. And he saw the crowd wailing.
He said to them, "Go to you. The girl is not dead. She is sleeping." But they laughed at him.
The people were astonished, and Jesus came forward. He took her by the hand, and she rose.
News about what Jesus had done spread all over that region. Jesus heals two blind men.
"So great was John's joy at this that two of his disciples followed Jesus. They addressed him, saying, 'Teacher, we fear you are a prophet.'"
And Jesus went inward; and the blind men came to him. He said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They said, "Yes, Lord."
He looked at them and said, "I will treat you as you have trusted me."
Diourwa were able to walk again. Issou warned them on one condition, "It's impossible for anyone to stop this matter."
They sent him away and gave him the news. The talk about him circulated in every corner.
"By Allah, a man was brought who was possessed, and the devil had made him mute, unable to speak."
When we drove out the demon, the man spoke. The light was blinding. They said, "We have never seen anything like this in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons." There are few workers.
Jesus went through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom. And he healed every disease and every affliction.
And when he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, for they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
"Ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest."
Jesus sends the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
These are the names of the twelve apostles. The first is Simon son of John, and his brother Andrew. After them come James son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
After them, Philip and Bartholomew, also Thomas and Matthew the Evangelist. There are also James, son of Alphaeus, and Thaddeus.
The last ones were Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas was the one who was going to hand Jesus over to his enemy later.
Jesus sent out the twelve with these instructions: "Don't go among the Gentiles, and don't enter any Samaritan town."
Instead, go to the people of Israel. They are like flocks of sheep that have gone astray.
And still, they want to take this matter lightly, 'The Queen of Heaven is near.'
Heal the sick, and woe to the dead that God should give you life, and cleanse those who are afflicted with plagues, and drive out demons. You were an executor with your ease, so you are an executor with your sufficiency.
Do not take with you any gold or silver or copper in your belt.
Don't take an extra bag for the trip. Don't take extra clothes, sandals, or a walking stick. They should provide him with what he needs for the job.
If you enter a village or town, look for someone willing to receive you. Stay in this person's house until you leave.
And those who enter houses, greet those who dwell therein.
If this house welcomes you, bless it. If it does not welcome you, do not bless it.
Some may not receive you or listen to your words. If they don't, then shake the dust off your feet when you leave their house or country.
Whoever tells me this is the truth. On the Day of Judgment, it will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah than for this town.
I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and harmless as doves.
Beware! They will hand you over to the local justice system. They will whip you in their homes.
You will be brought before governors and kings because of Me. You will be witnesses to them and to the Gentiles.
But when they take you to jail, don't worry about what you'll say or how you'll say it. At that time, you'll be able to say the right words.
It is only you who do not speak. Your father's spirit will speak through you.
Brothers will hand over their brothers to be killed. Fathers will hand over their sons. Young people will rise up against their parents and kill them.
Everyone will hate you because of me. But whoever endures to the end will be saved.
When people attack you in one place, flee to another. What is in your heart is truth. The way will not end in the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
The student is not better than his teacher. The slave is not better than his master.
It is enough for the student to be like his teacher. And it is enough for the slave to be like his master. If the head of the house is called Beelzebub, what can those who live in it expect?
Don't be afraid of your enemy. Every secret will be revealed. Every hidden thing will come to light.
What I told you in the dark, proclaim in the light. What you heard in your ear, shout from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Instead, fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Are two small birds sold for just one penny? Yet not one of them falls to the ground without your Father knowing it.
Even he counts every hair on your head!
Don't be afraid. You deserve much more than a little chick.
What are you saying about the one who tells people in their face that he knows me? I too will tell my father in heaven in his face that he knows him.
But if anyone says in the face of another that he does not know me, I will say in the face of my Lord who is in heaven that he does not know him.
Don't think I've come to bring peace to the earth. I've come to bring not peace, but the sword.
"Sons against their fathers. Daughters refusing to obey their mothers. Daughters-in-law against daughters-in-law."
"The man's enemies will be from his own family."
He who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. And he who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
"And whoever does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me."
"For whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it."
Whoever welcomes you welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.
If a person welcomes a prophet like a prophet, they will receive the reward of a prophet. And if they welcome a righteous person like a righteous person, they will receive the reward of a righteous person.
If anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones who follows me, I tell you the truth, they will surely get their reward.
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus finished preaching to his twelve disciples. Then he went to teach and preach in the cities of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Jesus was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked Jesus, "Are you the one we've been expecting, or should we look for someone else?"
When Jesus had finished speaking, he said to them, "Go back to John and tell him what you have heard and seen."
The blind see, the weak walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.
God bless those who don't turn away from their religion because of me.
When John's disciples came, John began to speak to the crowd about Jesus. He said, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No. People dressed in fine clothes are in the palaces of kings.
"A little, and what did you see when you graduated? A prophet? Yes, and more than a prophet."
He is the one written about in the book. It says, "I have sent my messenger ahead of you, to prepare your way before you." (Malachi 3:1)
What I'm about to tell you is true. I tell you, among those born of women, no one is greater than John the Baptist; yet the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.
Since the days of John the Baptist, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with power. And the violent take it by force.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you're ready to accept it, John is the person who was supposed to come.
He doesn't have an ear to hear.
What do we call comparing people today? It's like children asking in the markets and saying to those who pass by:
"We found the old you. But you didn't eat. We played a funeral song. But you didn't feel it."
And when John came, he neither ate nor drank, keeping silent. People said, "He must have a demon."
When the Son of Man came, he ate and drank like you. And the people said, "This man eats and drinks too much. He is a friend of tax collectors and sinners." But whoever proves wisdom right, proves that wisdom is right. Cities that do not reject sin.
Jesus began to speak against the cities in which he had performed most of his miracles. Their inhabitants did not repent of their sins. So he said:
Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
But this is what I will tell you: On the Day of Reckoning, it will be easier for Tartush and Sidon than it will be for you.
And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to the realm of the dead. If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would still be existing today.
But I say to you, it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you. Rest for all the weary.
In this generation, Jesus said: "I praise you, Father. Lord of heaven and earth. You have hidden these things from the wise and the learned, but have revealed them to the little ones."
Yes, Father. This is what you wanted.
My father gave me everything. The father is the only one who knows the son. And the only ones who know the father are the son and those whom the son has chosen to reveal him to.
Let's gather, all you tired people who are carrying goods. We'll give you a break.
Be my servants and learn from me. I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
The service is easy, and the burden is light.
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and his disciples began to pick some heads of wheat, rub them in their hands to remove the kernels, and eat them.
The Pharisees saw this and said to Jesus, "Look! This is unlawful on the Sabbath according to the law. But your disciples are doing it anyway!"
Jesus said, "Haven't they read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?"
He entered our house, the house of God. He and his group ate the sacred bread, which is only permitted for priests to consume.
Don't you understand the laws? The laws say that every Saturday, the priest in the synagogue must do his work on the same day. But they are not considered criminals.
I told you that what's more important than the temple is here.
The Bible tells me, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) You do not understand what you are saying. If you did, you would not judge those who are innocent.
The risen Christ is the Lord of the Sabbath.
From there, Jesus went to their synagogue.
There was a man with a withered and crooked hand. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not pull it out?"
The man is richer than the sheep! Therefore, the law allows us to do good on the Sabbath.
Jesus took the man's hand and said, "Stretch out your hand." He did, and it was completely restored, just like his other hand.
But the Pharisees were compelled to go out and plot to kill Jesus. The servant of the chosen God.
Jesus knew what the Pharisees were planning. So, he left that place. Many followed him, and he healed all the sick among them.
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.
This would make what was said in the letter from Esai come true. He says,
This is my servant. I have chosen him. He is the one I love. I am very happy with him. I will put my spirit upon him. It will be proclaimed to the nations that everything will be alright.
He doesn't get angry or complain. We never hear his voice in the market.
He won't break a broken branch. He won't blow out a flickering candle. He'll make everything right.
Nations will set their hope on him. Jesus and Beelzebub.
A man possessed by demons, who was mute, was brought to Jesus. After Jesus had cast out the demons, the man spoke and could see.
Everyone was amazed. They said, "Could he be David's son?"
The scribes heard this, and said, "This man casts out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the prince of demons."
Jesus said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself cannot stand."
If the devil drives out the devil, he is fighting against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
You say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul. But by what power do your people cast them out? Therefore, they will be your judges.
But suppose I drive out demons by the Spirit of God. Then the kingdom of God has come to you.
Or think about this. Can you enter the house of a strong man and take what he has? You must first render him powerless. Then you can steal his house.
He who has no shame, has no limits. He who doesn't respect my boundaries, I don't respect his.
Here is what I tell you: Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But the evil spoken against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Whatever sins the Son of Man forgives, they are forgiven, and whatever sins he retains, they are retained. But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven them, either in this age or in the age to come."
A good tree bears good fruit, and a bad tree bears bad fruit. You can tell a tree by its fruit.
You are a nest of vipers! How can you, wicked one, say anything good? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
A good man speaks good words. This comes from the good that is stored up within him. A bad man speaks bad words. This comes from the evil that is stored up within him.
But it is about this that I am warning you. On the Day of Judgment, people will be held accountable for every idle word they have spoken.
By your word and your testimony, you will be saved or condemned. The wonderful mark of John.
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus. They said, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
He said: "The impious and false ones will bring a wonderful hour! But it will only be brought about by the veil of our prophet Jonah."
Jonah was in the belly of a giant fish for three days and three nights. Something like this will happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the grave.
The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation. And the people of Nineveh will rise up with this generation. The men of Nineveh repented at the preaching of Jonah. And behold, someone greater than Jonah is here.
The queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with the men of this generation, and will condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And behold, something greater than Solomon is here.
Who is it that gets possessed when a devil enters them? It passes through the regions of the continent seeking a place to rest, but it doesn't find one.
"I saw him say, 'I'm really going home.' And when he arrived, he found the door locked, the house clean and neatly organized."
The devil was possessed, and he spoke. He took with him seven other devils more evil than himself. They entered and dwelt in him. And that man became worse than before. So it is with the evil people of today. They are like the tears of Christ and his brothers.
It was because of the wine that he was speaking to the crowd; his mother and his brothers and sisters had come outside, wanting to speak with him.
No one gave him any medication and said to him, "Your parents and your brother are outside. They want to talk to you."
Jesus replied, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus pointed to his disciples. He said, "These are my mother! And these are my brothers!"
Whoever does what they love will be loved by my father in heaven; they are my brother or sister or mother.
The Farmer's Tale
Just as it was yesterday, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the side of the Sea of Galilee.
A large crowd gathered around him. So he got into a boat. He lay down in it. And the people stood on the shore.
They entertained them with much talk and stories. He said, "A farmer went to plant his seeds."
The sower scattered the seed on the ground. Some fell on the path. Birds came and ate them.
Some seeds fell on rocky places, where there was little soil. The plants grew quickly, because the soil was not deep.
When the sun shone, it burned the plants. They dried up because they had no roots.
Other seeds fell among the thorns. The thorns grew up and choked the seeds.
Some seeds fell on good soil, grew, and yielded a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was sown.
He doesn't have an ear to listen.
The students came to them. They asked, "Why do you use parables when you speak to people?"
He said, "You have been given the understanding of the ages of the kingdom of the holy house. This has not been given to outsiders."
"Whoever has this kind of knowledge, more will be given to him. Indeed, he will have abundance. But whoever does not have this kind of knowledge, even what little he has will be taken from him."
This is why I use stories when I talk to people. I say, "They look, but they don't really see. And they listen, but they don't really understand or take it in."
In it, the words of the prophet Isaiah are fulfilled: "You will hear, but not understand. You will see, but not comprehend what you see."
The hearts of these people have become stubborn. They barely hear with their ears. They have closed their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, and turn with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and return to the Lord, who will heal them.
But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and blessed are your ears, for they hear.
What you're about to do to me is right. Many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you've seen, but they didn't. They wanted to hear what you've heard, but they didn't.
Listen! That's the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message about the kingdom but do not understand it. Then the devils come. They steal what was sown in their hearts. These people are like seeds planted on the path.
Others received the seed that fell on rocky places. They are the ones who hear the message and immediately receive it with joy.
But they have no roots. Therefore, they remain for only a short time. They quickly withdraw from faith when problems or suffering come because of the message.
Others received the seed that fell on the rocky ground. These are the ones who hear the message, but then their worries in this life and the deceitful pleasures of wealth choke the message, making it unfruitful.
But others received the seed that fell on good soil. They are the ones who hear the message and understand it. They produce a crop that is a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what the farmer planted. The parable of the weeds.
Jesus told the crowd another parable. "This is how the kingdom of heaven is," he said. "A man sowed good seed in his field."
"When they fell completely exhausted, he brought them. The enemy planted a thorn among the wheat, and he fell too."
Wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
The servants followed the owner. They came to him and said, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Then where did the weeds come from?'
"One of them brought it, he said," "The servants asked him: 'Are you going to make us go out and weed?'"
'No,' said Mr. 'While you're weeding, you might weed out the wheat as well.'
Let them grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the workers what to do. This is what I will say to them: First, gather the weeds. Bind them in bundles to be burned. Then gather the wheat. Thresh it and bring it to my barn. "The Parable of the Weeds"
Jesus told the people another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. A man took the seed and planted it in his field."
This is the smallest of all your seeds. But when it grows, it is the largest of all the plants in the garden. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest in its branches.
Jesus told them another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast." He said, "A woman mixed it into a large amount of flour. The yeast worked its way through all the dough."
Jesus spoke these things to the multitudes in parables. He did not say anything to them without a parable.
Thus were fulfilled the words which the prophet spake. He said, "I will open my mouth and utter a parable; I will declare things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world." (Revelation 78:2) Jesus explains the story of the grasses.
Jesus was mounted on the donkey and entered the house. His disciples came to him. They said, "Tell us about the incident of the grass in the field."
He said, "The one whom we claim to be the pure love is the Son of Man."
The pasture is the world. The good seed represents the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are those who belong to the devil.
It is Satan who sows them. The harvest is at the Day of Sorting. And the workers are angels.
The buttons are melted and burned in the fire. This is how things are on the day of the conflagration.
The Son of Man will send His angels. He will deepen His kingdom everything that causes sin. He will also remove everyone who does evil.
They will throw them into the blazing furnace. There, people will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then the people of God will shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom. Let those who have ears listen. Stories of hidden treasure and pearls.
The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again. He was overjoyed. He went and sold everything he had and bought that field.
Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant in search of a fine pearl.
He found one of great value. He went and sold all he had and bought that pearl. The internet story.
Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a net that was thrown into the lake and caught all kinds of fish.
When they were done, they called out on the shore. Then they closed and gathered the fish that had been caught in the net. They just threw away the bad fish.
This is what will happen on the Day of Judgment. The angels will descend. They will separate those who did wrong from those who did good.
They are the shakers of heavenly morals in the hot lighthouse. There, evil morals weep and gnash their teeth.
"Do you understand all these things?" asked Jesus. "Yes," they answered.
He said to them, "Every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure both new things and old." A Prophet Without Honor
Esau finished telling these stories. Then he moved away.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth. There he began teaching the people in their synagogue. They were amazed. "Where did this man get this wisdom? And where did he get the power to do miracles?" they asked.
Isn't he the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary? Aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
Did all his sisters come with us? And then where did this man get all this from?
"A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home."
He only did a few miracles there because they lacked faith.
John the Baptist's head is cut off.
At that time, Herod, the tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, heard reports about Jesus.
He said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles."
Herod imprisoned John. He bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias. She was the wife of Philip, Herod's brother.
John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have her."
Herod allowed him to behead John. But he feared the people, for they regarded John as a prophet.
On Herod's birthday, Herodias' daughter danced before Herod and his lords. Herod was exceedingly pleased with her.
He swore an oath to give her anything she asked for.
Mom told her what to say. So the girl told Khalid, "Bring me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very angry. However, he thought about his promise and the dinner guests. So he told one of his men to give her what she asked for.
Herod ordered John's head to be cut off in prison.
His head was severed and placed on a large platter, which was given to the girl. She then carried it to her mother.
The disciples came to take his body and bury it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus feeds the five thousand.
Jesus heard what had happened to Ahmed. He wanted to be alone. So he went in a boat to a quiet place. People heard about it, so they followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus came to the shore, he saw a large crowd. He felt deep compassion for them. He healed the sick among them.
Loyal, as noon was setting, the sects came to him. They said, "There is nothing here." They said, "Time has left its abode." They sent locusts. They can go buy food in the villages.
Jesus answered, "They need not depart; you give them to eat."
"We have five lambs and two fish," they answered.
"Bring them here to me," he said.
Jesus urged the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and two fish. He looked up to heaven and gave thanks. Then he broke the loaves into pieces. He gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
Everyone ate and was satisfied. The disciples gathered twelve baskets of leftovers.
The number of men who ate was about 5000. The women and children ate too. Jesus Walks on the Water
Soon Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side of Lake Galilee. Then he sent the crowd away.
After sending them a message, he went up a mountain alone to pray. As the evening came, he was alone there.
The ship was too far from the shore. Waves were crashing against it due to the wind blowing against it.
Early in the morning, Jesus came to the disciples. He walked on the water.
And they saw him walking on the lake and were afraid. "It's a ghost!" they said. And they cried out in fear.
Urgent, drowsy, drowsy, drowsy, drowsy, drowsy, drowsy, drowsy, drowsy, drowsy, drowsy, drowsy, drowsy, drowsy, drowsy, drowsy.
"Lord, if it is you," Peter asked, "command me to come to you on the water."
"Come," said Jesus. Then Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
He turned away when he saw the wind, and was afraid. He began to sink, and cried out, "Lord, save me!"
Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?"
Walaa's friends returned when the water calmed down.
And those in the lightning believed in me, saying, "You have brought us out of the Book with mercy, and we were not to be punished."
They disbelieved above the valley and gathered in Jassaret.
The men who had been with Jesus sent messengers throughout the region, and the people brought all their sick to him.
He said, "Let me touch him, that I may recover my sight." So Jesus reached out his hand and touched him. "Go," he said, "your faith has healed you."
Why do people "act strange"?
Some Pharisees and some teachers of the Law came from Jerusalem to see Jesus. They asked,
Do your students even understand what obedience means? Your students don't even wash their hands before eating!
"And how can you not listen to him? Instead of following his instructions, you followed your own!"
God said: "Defend your father" (Genesis 12:12; Leviticus 5:16). He also said: "And if anyone curses his father or his mother, he shall surely die" (Genesis 21:17; Leviticus 20:9).
But you allow people to say to their families, 'Any help you have received from us is a separate gift to God.'
This is why they have no need to honor their parents with their gifts. You make the word of God of no effect by your tradition.
And these cooks! Isaiah was right when he said:
These people admire me for what I say, but their hearts are far from me.
Their worship means nothing to me. They only teach human rules.
Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand."
What goes into your mouth doesn't make you "unclean". It's what comes out of your mouth that makes you "unclean".
When his disciples came to him, they asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus replied, "There are plants that my Father did not sow in heaven. They will be uprooted."
Leave them. The Pharisees are blind leaders. And if one blind person leads another blind person, they will both fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Don't you even understand this?" Jesus asked them.
Did you walk? Everything that goes into the mouth goes into the stomach. And then it exits the body.
But the things that come out of the swine come from the heart. That's what makes you "unclean."
Evil thoughts come from the heart. So do murder and adultery, and other sexual sins. So do theft, bearing false witness, and lying to people.
These are the things that make you "unclean." But eating without washing your hands does not make you "unclean." "The faith of a Canaanite woman"
Jesus departed from Galilee and went to the land of Tyre and Sidon.
A Canaanite woman who lived near Tyre and Sidon came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is tormented by a demon. She suffers greatly."
Jesus said not a word. His disciples came to him. They pleaded, "Send her away. She keeps shouting at us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. They are like a damaged table."
I saw, the woman fell to her knees in front of him. "Oh God! Help me!" she said.
They said: "It's not right for you to take your children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
"Yes, Lord," she said. "Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
Then Jesus answered and said, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour.
Jesus left there. He walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up a hill and sat down.
People brought him too much. They brought him night and those who couldn't walk. They also brought spinsters and those who couldn't speak, and many others. They placed them in front of him, and he saw them.
People were amazed. Those who could not speak were speaking. The sick were healed. Those who could not walk were walking. Those who were blind were seeing. So the people praised the name of God for Israel.
John was anxious about his guests, as they had been with him for three days and had nothing to eat. He did not want to send them away hungry, fearing they would become rebellious on their way home.
His disciples answered him, "There is nothing here," they said, "but five loaves and two fish." "Where shall we get enough bread to feed so large a crowd?"
"Do you have any bread?" asked Jesus. "Seven, and a few small fish."
Jesus told the crowd to sit down on the ground.
The wind blew, and there were seven loaves and fish and thanks. Then he divided them and gave them to the leaders. And the leaders distributed them to the people.
Everyone ate and was satisfied. Then the disciples gathered up the seven basketfuls of leftover fragments.
The number of men who ate was 4000. The women and children ate as well.
Jesus dismissed the crowds and went on board the boat. He came to the region of Magadan.
Jesus is asked for a sign.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
He worried, saying: "At night you look at the sky. You say, 'It will be a good bird. The sky is barren.'"
One evening, you say: "This day will be stormy. The sky is red and cloudy." You understand what you see in the sky. But you don't comprehend the implications of what's happening now.
The people are unfaithful devils, seeking a sign of wonder. But no sign will be given to them except the sign of Jonah. Then Jesus left them and departed. The bread of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
The students crossed the sea. They forgot to take a drink.
"Be careful," Jesus told them. "Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The students talked among themselves about this. They said, "He must say this because we didn't bring any bread."
Jesus knew what they were saying. He said to them, "Your faith is very small! Why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread?"
Don't you even understand? Don't you remember the five tunes for the five thousand? Don't you remember the number of vessels you collected from the pieces?
Don't you remember the satiety of the five thousand? Don't you remember the quantity of pieces you collected?
Is this your photo? Don't take other people's things. Don't take things that aren't yours. Don't take what doesn't belong to you. Call out to the one whose photo it is.
I saw that after the disciples, Jesus was not telling them to watch the leaven used in the bread. He was warning them about what the Pharisees and Sadducees were teaching. Peter says that Jesus is the Christ.
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples: "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They said, "Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others say Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
But you? he asked. "Who told you?"
Simon Peter answered: "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
This is what I tell you. You are Peter. On this rock I will build my church. The gates of hell will not prevail against it.
I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Therefore Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. Jesus speaks about his upcoming death.
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem. There he will suffer at the hands of many great and harsh people and teachers. He must be killed, and on the third day be raised to life.
Peter took Jesus aside and began to tell him, "No, Lord!" he said. "This shall not happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Jesus sharpened his words to his disciples, saying: "Whoever wants to follow me, let him deny himself. And let him take up his cross and follow me."
If he wishes to save his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for my sake, he will find it.
"What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?"
The Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father. And His angels will come with Him. And each one will be given his reward according to his works.
He who is going to tell me this is the truth. Some of those standing here will be of no use until they see the son of the females coming in his kingdom.
Jesus' appearance changed.
After six days, Jesus took Peter, James, and John, the brother of James, with him. He led them up a high mountain, where they were alone.
There before them, his appearance had changed. His face shone like the sun. His clothes became white as light.
Thus, Moses and Elijah appeared to them. Moses and Elijah were speaking with John.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
Wise beyond measure, welcome!
The students turned away in fear. They prostrated themselves with their faces on the ground.
Then Jesus turned around and saw them. "Go, show yourselves to the priests," he said. "Don't be afraid."
When they looked up, they saw no one but Jesus.
They went down from the mountain. On the way, Jesus told them not to tell anyone what they had seen, until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
The students asked him: "Why do the teachers say that Elisha has to come first?"
Jesus replied, "This is true. Elisha must come and make all things new again."
But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also will the Son of Man suffer at their hands.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus heals a boy who was suffering from a demon.
As they approached the crowd, a man ran up to Jesus, fell on his knees before him,
"Oh Lord," he said, "have mercy on my son. He shivers violently and endures great suffering. He often falls into the fire or into the water."
You brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.
"You faithless and evil generation!" Jesus replied. "How long must I stay with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy to me."
Jesus commanded the demons to come out of the boy, and they did. He was healed instantly.
His disciples were discussing Jesus among themselves, and asked, "Why can't we drive out demons?"
They said, "Because your faith is very small. I will not say to you, 'It is done.' If you have faith the size of a mustard seed, that is enough. You can tell this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing is impossible for you."
"Please"
They came together in Galilee. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men."
They are going to kill him. On the third day he will rise from the dead. Then a deep sorrow came upon the disciples. Jesus pays the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. There, the collectors of the temple tax came to them. They asked Peter, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
"Who do you say that I am?" he replied. When Peter entered the house, Jesus was the first to speak. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "Who do the tax collectors and the scribes say that I am? The sons of men or someone else?"
"From the people," Peter replied. "Then the children don't need to pay," Jesus told him.
But we don't want to cheat them. So, go to the sea and cast your fishing lines. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. There, you'll find the other coin they need. Take it and give it to them as the tax for you and me.
