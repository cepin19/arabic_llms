environmentalist Who is the most important person in the kingdom?
At that time the disciples came to Jesus, asking, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Jesus called a little child to him and had the child stand among them.
Jesus said, "What I am about to tell you is the truth. You must change and become like little children. If you do not, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
"Whoever becomes humble like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven."
Whoever shelters a small child like this in my name, shelters me.
But what if someone were to lead one of these little ones who believe in me into sin? And if he does, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea.
How terrible it will be for the world because of the things that lead people astray! Such things must come. But how terrible it will be for those who cause them!
If your hand or your foot should err, cut it off. It is better for you that you should enter life lame or maimed than that you should have two hands or two feet and be thrown into the eternal fire. And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. It is better for you that you should enter the kingdom of God with one eye than that you should have two eyes and be thrown into hell.
If your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. The Parable of the Lost Sheep
Don't you dare mess with one of these kids. Remember what I told you. Their angels in heaven can go anytime to see my father in heaven.
"Please"
What are you doing? I imagine someone has 100 sheep and one of them escapes. Won't he leave the remaining 99 on the mountains and go look for the one that ran away?
"What I am telling you is the truth. And if this sheep is found, he is more pleased about this sheep than about the ninety-nine that did not go astray."
He is with your father in heaven. He doesn't want any of these little ones to be lost. When someone sins against you
If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over.
But what if he does not listen to you? Then take with you one or two others. The Quran says: "Every charge must be supported by two or three witnesses." (At-Tawbah 19:15)
But what if he refuses to listen even to the witnesses? Tell it to the church. And what if he refuses to listen even to the church? Treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
What I am about to tell you is true. What you seal on earth will be sealed in heaven. What you open on earth will be opened in heaven.
Again, this is what I tell you: Imagine that two of you on earth agree on anything you ask. My Father in heaven will do it for you.
Where two or three are gathered in my name, I am there with them. The servant who does not know mercy.
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"
John's response was: "Shall I tell you seventy-seven times, not seven?"
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
To begin with the king, a man who had millions of dollars was brought to his side.
The man was unable to pay. So an order came from his master. The man, his wife, his children, and all that he owned had to be sold to pay off his debt.
"Get down on your knees in front of him," the man ordered. "Let me give it to you," he pleaded. "I'll eat it all."
His master was sorry for him. He forgave him and sent him away.
But then these two servants went out and found one of the other servants who owed them a few dollars. They seized him and began to choke him, saying, "Pay us what you owe!"
"Give me more time," he begged. "I'll pay you back."
But the first companion refused. Instead, he went and ordered the man to be imprisoned. He will be held there until he can pay what he owes.
The service of the one who came last saw what he wanted. This is very important. They did nothing and said the reason for the entire service as he wanted.
Then the master called the first servant. He said, "You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me."
Shouldn't you have forgiven the other servant, just as you were forgiven?
When his master is angry, he turns him into a prisoner. He will be punished until he pays off all his debts.
This is how my Father in heaven will treat each of you, unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.
Jesus teaches about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Many people followed him. He healed among them there.
Some Pharisees came to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason at all?"
My Father answered: "Have you not read, O My people, that the Creator made them male and female?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh."
What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
They asked, "Then why did Moses command a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away?"
Jesus said, "Moses commanded you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of heart, but it was not this way from the beginning."
This is what I tell you. Any man who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery. A man may divorce his wife only if she has been unfaithful to him.
The followers said to him: "If this is how it is between a couple, it is better not to get married."
Jesus said, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining celibate. Only those who have helped them live without marriage can accept it."
Some men cannot have children because they were born that way. Some were made that way by others. Others have made themselves that way for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever can accept living this way should do so. Little children, come to Jesus.
Why do some people bring small children who don't know how to read? They want him to see for himself and listen to them. But the students do it for them and ask people.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them. For the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
Jesus blessed them with his hands. Then he went from there. Jesus and a rich man.
A man approached Jesus and asked, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to have eternal life?"
"Why do you ask Me about what is good?" said Jesus. "There is only one who is good. If you wish to enter the kingdom, keep the commandments."
"Why?" asked the man. Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not be angry. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness."
Honor your father and your mother. Love your neighbor as yourself.
"I've carried out all these orders," the young man said, "and you want me to die for it?"
Jesus answered and said, "If you would be perfect, go, sell what you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. And come, follow me."
When the young man heard this, he was very sad. He was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When the disciples heard this, they were truly amazed. They asked, "Who can forgive sins?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter said to them: "We've given up everything to follow you! What then will we have?"
"But the one who is coming after me is mightier than I, and I am not fit to remove his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire."
Everyone who has left their home, family, or fields because of me will receive a hundred times more. They will have eternal life.
But many who are first will be last, and the last first.
The Tale of the Workers in the Vineyards
The kingdom of heaven is like a man who was the owner of a vineyard. He went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
He agreed to give them the usual daily wage. Then he sent them to his vineyard.
At about nine o'clock in the morning he went out again. He saw others standing in the market square doing nothing.
"Go and work in my vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right."
They said, "He went out again around noon and at 3 o'clock and did the same thing."
There were five of them, and when he went out, he found others standing around him. He asked them, "How long have you been standing here all day without work?"
"Tell me who said it to us, answer. They said: 'You just go work in my vineyard.'"
When it was dark, the owner of the vineyard spoke to the man in charge of the workers. He said, "Call the workers and give them their pay. Start with the last ones hired, and then go to the others."
The hired workers came around five o'clock. Each one of them received their usual day's wage.
They were expecting to get more, of course, when the first of the hired hands showed up. But each one of them also got his regular day's pay.
When they reached them, they began to complain about the owner.
"Those who were paid for the display only worked for one hour, they said. 'You paid them the same amount you paid us. We worked a lot and the whole day in the sun.'"
The owner replied to one of them, saying, "My friend, I am dealing with you fairly. Didn't you agree to work for the usual daily wage?"
Take your money and leave. I want to give the ones I hired in your place the same salary I gave you.
Don't I have the right to do as I wish with my own will? Do you feel aggrieved because I have given generously to others?
Those who are last will become first, and those who are first will become last. Jesus speaks again of his coming death.
Jesus was going to Jerusalem. On the way, he took the twelve disciples aside to speak to them.
He said, "We are going to Jerusalem," he said. "The Son of Man will be handed over to the Roman priests and religious leaders. They will separate them at death."
Then they will hand him over to men who are not Jews. They will mock him, beat him, and spit on him. They will nail him to a cross. On the third day, he will rise from the dead! Or do you seek something more from Jesus?
Zebedee's wife came to Jesus with her sons. She knelt down and asked him for a favor.
"What do you want?" asked Jesus. She said, "Grant me that one of my two sons may sit on your right hand, and the other on your left, in your kingdom."
"We understand how long you've been waiting," he told them. "Can you drink the cup of suffering that I'm about to drink?" "We can," they answered.
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right or left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
Teach the remaining ten disciples this matter. They were angry with the brothers.
Jesus called them together and said, "You know that the rulers in the Gentile world lord it over their people, and their high officials exercise power over them."
That's the way it is. Instead of "man," anyone who wants to be important among you has to be a slave.
And whoever wants to be the first must be your servant.
Be like the Son of Man. He did not come to be served, but to serve others. He came to give his life as a ransom for many. Two blind men receive their sight.
Jesus and the righteous ones were leaving Jericho. Large crowds followed him.
There were two blind men sitting by the roadside. They heard that Jesus was passing by. So they cried out, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The crowd ordered them to stop. They told them to be quiet. But the two men shouted even louder, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
"Do you want me to ask him about this?" she insisted.
"Lord," they answered, "we want to see."
Jesus felt deep concern for them. He touched their eyes. Suddenly, they could see. And they followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,
He said to them, "Go to the village ahead of you. There you will find a cow tied up, with a calf by her. Untie the cow and bring her to me."
If anyone says anything to you, say that God needs them. Their companion will send them right away.
This happened so that the words spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled, he says.
Say to the city of Zion, "See, your king comes to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey."
The disciples went and did what Jesus had told them.
They brought the ass and the colt. They placed their cloaks on them. Then Jesus sat on the cloaks.
A very large crowd spread their coats on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
Some people preceded him, and some followed him. They all shouted: "Hosanna, Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest heavens!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was moved. The people asked, "Who is this?"
The crowd answered, "This is Jesus. He is the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus drove the beggars out of the temple.
Jesus entered the temple area and began to drive out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and also the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be a house of prayer' (Isaiah 56:7), but you have made it 'a den of robbers' (Jeremiah 7:11)."
The sick and the possessed came to Jesus at the temple. He healed them.
The priests and the leaders saw the wonders that he was doing. They also saw children in the temple area shouting, "Hosanna, Son of David!" But when they saw all this, they were indignant.
"What are these children called?" he asked them. "Ah," Jesus replied, "haven't you read this in the Holy Scriptures? It says, 'You have given the children and infants praise to you.'" (Genesis 8:2)
Then Jesus went out from among the people and left the city to go to Bethany. He spent the night there. The salt tree withers.
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a peach tree by the side of the road. He went to it, but found nothing but leaves. Then he said to it, "Please, don't bear anything else!" So that it wouldn't bear anything, the tree withered.
When they saw this, they were amazed. "How could they sell so much fruit so quickly?" they asked.
Jesus said, "What I tell you now is the truth. You must believe and not doubt. Then you can do what you did with the fig tree. And you can say to this mountain, 'Go and throw yourself into the sea.' And it will be done."
If you believe, you will receive what you ask for when you pray. Jesus' authority is in question.
Jesus entered the synagogue. While he was teaching there, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and said, "By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?"
Jesus said, "I will ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
Where did the baptism of John come from? Was it from heaven, or from men? They reasoned together among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'"
But what if we say 'of men'? We are afraid of people. Everyone thought John was a prophet.
They answered Jesus, "We do not know." Jesus said, "Then I will not tell you by what authority I do these things." The story of the two sons.
What are you doing with this? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, "Son, go and work today in the vineyard."
"Okay," the son replied. "But then he changed his mind and left."
Then the father went to the other son. He said the same thing to himself. The son answered, "I will, sir." But he did not go.
Which of the two brothers did what his father wanted? "The first," they said. Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John has shown you the right way to live. And you don't believe it. But we believe in the taxes and the virgins. I saw that. But even after your diatribe, you still don't repent for your sins. The story of the tenants.
Listen to another story. A man owned some land. He planted vineyards. He put a fence around them. He dug a cistern for the winepress. He also built a watchtower. He leased the vineyards to a group of peasants. Then he went on a journey.
As the harvest season approached, he sent his servants to the tenants. He commanded the servants to gather his share of the fruit.
But the tenants took his slaves. They beat one of them. They killed the last one. They stoned the third to death.
Then the man sent another of his servants to the tenants. He sent more than he had sent the first time, and the tenants treated him the same way.
Finally, he sent his son to them. He said, "My son will respect them."
But the tenants saw the boy coming. They said to each other, "This is the one who will one day inherit the owner's entire estate. Come, let's get rid of him, and then everything will be ours."
So they accepted him, and took him out of the field. Then they killed him.
And what will the great owner do if he returns to the readers with the henwa?
They said, "Later, we'll give the beggars these two." Then they'll give the rest to other servants. They'll give him his share of the crop at harvest time.
Jesus said to them, "Have you not read what was spoken to you by the prophets? 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes.'" (Psalm 118:22-23)
So, this is what I say to you: The kingdom of heaven is taken from you and given to those who produce its fruit.
He who falls on these stones will be broken to pieces, but the stones, they crush whoever falls on them.
The priests and the scribes heard Jesus' stories. They knew he was talking about them.
They were looking for a way to stop him. But they were afraid of the crowd. The people believed that Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Tale
Jesus told them more stories. He said,
This is like the kingdom of heaven. A king prepared a wedding banquet for his son.
His servants sent to the guests who were invited to dinner. And the servants told them to come. But they refused.
Then he sent another servant. He said, "Tell the invited guests, 'I have prepared my dinner. I have killed my fattened cattle and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.'"
But people paid no attention. One went to his farm. Another left for work.
The rest seized his servants. They treated them harshly and then killed them.
The king was furious. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed those murderers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants, "The wedding feast is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come."
Go to the street corners. Invite anyone you can find to dinner.
And the servants went out into the streets. They gathered all the people they knew, whether good or bad. Soon, the banquet hall was filled with guests.
The king entered to see the guests. He noticed a man who was not wearing wedding clothes.
"Oh, my friend, how did you come here without your wedding dress?" The man couldn't say anything.
Then the king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet. Cast him out into the outer darkness. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
Many are called, but few are chosen. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went out. They planned to entrap Jesus in his words.
They sent their followers to him. They sent the Horidians with them. They said, "Teacher, we know that you are a man of honor. You know the way of God truly. Do not let others tell you what to do or say. Pay no attention to those who are important."
We've told you, what's your opinion? Do you think it's right to pay tax for healthcare or not?
Jesus, aware of their evil plans, said, "Hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the currency that people use to pay taxes. They brought him silver coins.
He asked them, "Whose picture is this? And whose words are these?"
"Caesar's," they answered. And he said to them, "Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
When they heard this, they were amazed. They left, going away. The marriage when the dead rise.
On the same day, the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They do not believe that people are raised from the dead.
"Teacher," they said, "this is what Moses told us. If a man dies and leaves no children, his brother must marry his widow, so that he can father children for his brother."
There were seven brothers among us. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened to the second, third, and all the way to the seventh brother.
Finally, the woman died.
They wondered how long they had been absent, when they would get married? Seven years they waited to get married.
Jesus said, "You are wrong, because you do not know the scriptures, nor the power of God."
When the dead rise, they won't go to weddings. Parents won't give them money to go to weddings. They'll be like angels in heaven.
What do you think about the dead who give birth? Didn't you hear the saying that God said?
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." (Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes.
The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees had not been able to answer Jesus. So the Pharisees gathered together.
One of them, an expert in the law, tested Jesus with a question.
"Which is the most important commandment in the law?"
"My Lord loves all of your heart, all of your soul, and all of your mind."
This is the first and most important thing.
And the second is like it. "Love your neighbor as yourself."
"All that is written in the Law and the Prophets is based on these two things." "Who is the Son of Christ?"
The Jews were gathered together. Jesus asked them,
What do you think about Christ? Whose son is he? "His son David," they said.
He said to them, "Why then does David call him 'my Lord'? The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. David said."
"The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet'."
If David calls him "Lord," how can he be David's son?
No one could argue with him in a single word. From this response, no one dared to ask him another question.
Jesus rebukes the Pharisees and teachers of the law.
Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his followers.
"The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat," he said.
You must obey them. Do everything they command you to do. But do not do what they do. They do not practice what they preach.
They carry heavy burdens and place them on the shoulders of others. But they find no trouble in claiming them as their own.
Everything they do is done to be seen by men. On their heads and arms they wear little boxes containing verses from the Bible. They make the boxes very broad. And they make the fringes on their garments very long.
They loved to sit in places of honor at meals. They also loved to get the most important seats in the Jewish synagogues.
They love it when they are greeted in the markets. They adore being called "my lord."
But you should not be called "Master." You are only one brother among your brothers.
Do not worry then about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Don't eat "teachers". He has only one teacher, and that is Christ.
The most important person among you will be your servant.
He who exalts himself is abased, and he who is abased is exalted.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You lock the gates of the kingdom of heaven in people's faces; you yourselves do not enter, nor do you let those who are entering go in.
"Please"
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and then you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are.
Alas for you, blind leaders! You say, "If anyone swears by the temple, it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath."
You are my uncle and slow of understanding! Which is more important? Is it the gold? Or is it the temple that makes the gold sacred?
You also say, 'If anyone swears by the altar, it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift that is on it, he is bound by his oath.'
O blind ones! What is more important? Is it the gift? Or is it the rank that makes the gift sacred?
But whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.
And whoever takes an oath in the name of the temple shall swear by the name of the one who dwells in it.
And whoever mentions the sky, mentions the throne of Allah and the mighty Allah who is upon it.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! Hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin—but you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former.
O leaders of the blind! You remove the smallest insect from your food. And you eat a whole sentence!
Woe to you, religious scholars and hypocrites! You pretenders! You who only wash the outside of cups and dishes, but inside you are full of greed. You only want to satisfy yourselves.
O ignorant bigot! First wash what's inside the cup and plate, then they'll be clean by themselves.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead people's bones and everything unclean.
This thing is like you. From the outside, you seem to be doing the right thing. But inside, you're full of mistakes. You're hiding that you're not yourself.
Woe to you, professors of religious law and hypocrites! You pretenders! You who build the tombs of the prophets. You who adorn the graves of the righteous.
"If we were in the time of those who came before us, we would not have done what they did. We would not have aided in the killing of the prophets."
You are witnesses against yourselves. And you acknowledge that you are the children of those who killed the messengers.
Finish the sins that those who came before you have started!
You're a den of venomous snakes! How will you escape being sentenced to prison and going to hell?
I am sending you prophets, wise men, and teachers. You will kill some of them, and you will crucify some, and in your churches you will scourge others, and from city to city you will drive them away.
So the price will be paid for the blood of all the prophets that was shed on the earth. I mean, from the blood of the prophet Abraham to the blood of Zechariah, son of Berechiah. Zechariah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
I never told you this was right. All this is just the yoga they're practicing today.
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I have wanted to gather your children as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!
Your house is empty now.
I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord."
End flags
Jesus came down from the mount. As he was walking away, his disciples came to him and wanted to draw his attention to the buildings of the mount.
"Did this help you?" asked Jesus. "Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice. Not one stone will be left upon another. All will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. Then the disciples came to him privately and asked, "Tell us, when will this happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end of the age?"
Jesus answered, "Watch out! Let no one deceive you."
Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ!' and they will deceive many.
"You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. You will also hear people talking about future wars. Do not be afraid. These things must happen, but the end is still to come."
Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in many places.
All this is the beginning of the pains of childbirth.
Then they will deliver you to tribulation and put you to death, and all nations will hate you because of Me.
At that time, many will forsake their religion. They will hate one another. And they will betray one another to their enemies.
Many evildoers will appear. They will seduce many people with their immorality.
For evil will grow, and the love of most people will grow cold.
But he who stands in the end will survive.
This good news for the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the world. It will be a witness to all nations. Then the end will come.
The prophet Daniel spoke of "the abomination that desolates" (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11). One day you will see it standing in the holy place. The reader must understand this.
Then those in Jericho must flee to the mountains.
No one on the roof should go down to their house to get anything.
No one is good at not revisiting old habits.
Woe to them on those research days! Woe to them on the mothers of the states!
Seek forgiveness from Allah lest you be compelled to flee in winter or on Friday.
There will be great tribulation in those days, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever will be again.
If time did not pass, no one would live. But because of God's chosen people, it will be shortened.
When they say to you, "Look, here is the Christ!" or "There he is!" do not believe it.
False servants and false prophets will appear. They will perform great signs and wonders. They could lead God's chosen people astray if they wanted to.
I saw, he told you that before you came.
If you hear someone say they are "too far out in the desert," don't go there. Or if someone tells you they are "deep inside the house," don't believe them.
The lightning that comes from the east can be seen in the west. So will it be when the Son of Man comes.
Eagles will gather wherever there is death.
After the terrible suffering of those days, 'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light. The stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will be shaken.' (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
At that time, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory.
His messenger will send the angels with a great proof. He will gather His scattered people from the four corners. He will drive them from one end of heaven to the other.
Learn a lesson from the fig tree. As soon as its branches become tender and it puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near.
Similarly, when he sees all this coming, he knows that the end is near. She approaches the door.
I didn't say this was right. Many people living at that time wouldn't even believe all this would happen.
"Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father."
And no one knows that day or that hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
Remember the days of Noah. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking. They were marrying. They were giving their daughters in marriage. They were doing all these things until Noah entered the ark.
They didn't know what they were getting into until the cliff almost took them all. That's how the worker will feel when the son of the boss arrives.
There will be two men in the field. One will be excessive and the other will be left.
Two women will turn a hand mill. One will be lifted and the other will be left.
"Be watchful, be sober. You do not know the day or hour when your Lord will come."
You'd think twice about it. Imagine one of your neighbors knew at any time of the night for a burglary. He was watching. He wouldn't let them put their den in his house.
You also must be ready. The Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
Imagine a master who appoints one of his slaves in charge of the rest of the slaves in his house. The slave's task is to feed them at the right time. The master wants a loyal and wise slave for this position.
This will be good for the servant if he finds his master doing his work when the master returns.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. The master entrusts this slave with all that he owns.
But imagine that this servant is mischievous. Imagine him saying to himself: 'My master will be away for a long time.'
If he starts beating other servants. And if he eats and drinks with those who drink greedily.
The master of this servant will return one day unawares. He will return at an hour unknown to him.
Then the imam will cut him into pieces. He will send him to the place where deceivers go. There people will weep and pull out their teeth.
The Tenth Tale of Woe
This is how the kingdom of heaven will be at that time. Ten virgins took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were fools. Five were wise.
The illness
The scientists took the oil in jars with their lamps.
The bride hasn't come yet. So all the veiled women got tired and fell asleep.
At midnight, someone shouted: "Here comes the bridegroom! Come out and bless him!"
Then all the virgins awoke and gathered together to trim their lamps.
The ignorant ones said to the scholars, "Give us some of your oil. Our lamps are growing dim."
"Us," they answered. "There may not be enough for all of us. Instead, go to those who sell oil. Buy some for yourselves."
And so they went to buy oil. But as they were on their way, the bridegroom arrived. The prepared virgins went with him to the wedding banquet. Then the door was shut.
Later, the rest of the brides also arrived. "Oh sir! Oh sir!" they said. "Open the door for us!"
But he said, "What I am about to tell you is true. I do not know you."
Get well soon. Don't take your eyes off me. It's a matter of three services.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man who was a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
He gave ten thousand dollars to one person. He gave four thousand dollars to another. And he gave two thousand dollars to the third. The man gave each servant the amount of money he knew they could handle. Then he set out on his journey.
The servant who found the $10,000 immediately started investing it in business. He made an additional $10,000.
He who earned $4000 earned an additional $4000.
But the man who received $2000 went and dug a hole in the ground. He hid his master's money there.
After a long absence, the master of these servants returned. He wanted to collect all the money they had earned.
The man who borrowed $10,000 brought the other $10,000. He said, 'Sir, you trusted me with $10,000. Look, I've made another $10,000.'
The master answered him, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Come, share your master's joy!"
The man who had $4000 brought it with him. He said, "Sir, I trusted you with $4000. Look, I've made an additional $4000."
The master answered him, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Come, share your master's joy!"
Then came the man who had received the $2000. He said, 'Sir, I knew you were a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not scatter seed.
I was scared. I went out and hid your $2000 in the ground. Look, this is what's left for you.
His master answered: "You wicked, slothful one! Didn't you know that I reap where I haven't sown? Didn't you know that I gather crops where I haven't watered?"
Someone, you should have deposited my money in the bank. When I returned, he was going to give it back with interest.
Then the master commanded the other servants, "Take the 2000 dollars from him and give it to the one who has 20000 dollars."
He who has will be given more; he will have in abundance. But he who does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.
Throw this wretched slave out. There, in the darkness, people will groan and gnash their teeth. Sheep and goats.
The Son of Man will come in his full glory, and all the angels with him. Then he will sit on his glorious throne.
All nations will be gathered before Him. He will separate people into two groups. It will be like a shepherd separating the sheep from the goats.
He will place the sheep on his right and the goat on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right, "My Father has blessed you. Come, take your inheritance. The kingdom has been prepared for you since the creation of the world."
I was hungry. And you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty. And you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger. And you invited me in.
I was in need of clothing, and you gave to me. I was sick, and you served me. I was in prison, and you came to visit me.
Then the companions of the righteous will answer them. They will ask their Lord: "When we come to You and are like mice, or have You sent us light in which we can see each other?"
When did we see you a stranger and welcome you into our home? When did we see you in need of clothes and give them to you?
Did we make you sick or put you in prison and then go to meet you?
The king will reply: "What I am about to tell you is the truth. Anything I have done for one of my less important cousins, I have done for you."
Then he will say to those on his left, "You are cursed! Depart from me into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels."
I was hungry, but you gave me nothing to eat. I was thirsty, but you gave me nothing to drink.
I was a stranger. But you did not invite me. I needed clothes. But you gave me nothing. I was sick in prison. But you did not take care of me.
They also will answer and say, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? Or when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?'
He will say, "What I am saying now is the truth. Anything you have not done for the least of these, you have not done for me."
Then they will go on to be punished forever. But those who did right will get eternal life.
The plan to kill Jesus
Jesus finished speaking about all these things. Then he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is coming up, in two days. They are going to crucify the little girl of Christ to prove it.
Then the chief priests and the elders of the city assembled in the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas.
They were plotting to arrest Jesus in a clever way. They wanted to kill him.
But not during Eid al-Fitr, they said. "They have to cause trouble." A woman anoints Jesus with perfume.
Jesus was in Bethany. He was in the house of a man named Simon, who had a skin disease.
A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster jar filled with expensive perfume. She poured the perfume on his head as he was reclining at the table.
When they saw this, they were angry. "What is this mess?" they asked.
The oil could have been sold at a higher price, and the money could have been distributed to the poor.
Jesus was aware of this. So he said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a good thing for me."
You will always have the poor with you. But you will not always be you.
She sprayed the perfume on me to teach me that I am worthless.
What I am about to tell you is true. What you have done will be told everywhere this good news is proclaimed throughout the world. It will be told in memory of her name.
One of the disciples went to the chief priests. His name was Judas Iscariot.
He asked, "What will you give me if I deliver Jesus to you?" So they counted out for him thirty pieces of silver.
From that time on, Judas watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. The Last Supper
It was the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal for you?"
He replied, "Go into the city to a certain man, and tell him, 'The Teacher says, 'My time is near. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.' "
And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover.
When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve.
While they were talking, he said, "The one who..."
The pupils became very sad. One by one, they began to say to him, "Not me, Lord, is it?"
Jesus answered, "He who has dipped his hand in the dish with me will betray me."
The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.
Judas was the one who was going to betray him. He said, "Not me, Lord, am I?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is you."
While they were eating, Jesus took bread. Then he gave thanks and broke it (distributed it). And he gave it to his disciples and said, "Take this and eat of it. This is my body."
Then he took the cup, gave thanks, and offered it to them. He said, "Drink all of you from this."
This is my blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.
This is what I'm telling you. From now on, I won't drink wine with you again until the day I drink it with you in my father's kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said, "Mark will be disappointed."
Jesus said to them, "This night you will all fall away from me. For it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'" (Zechariah 13:7)
But after I am raised from the dead, I will go before you to Galilee.
Peter replied: "Not everyone can stay away from you. But I can't."
"What you are about to say is true. Jesus replied. It will happen this very night, before the cock crows, you will deny me three times."
But Peter said, "I may have to die with you. But I will never say I don't know you." All the other disciples said the same thing. Jesus prays in Gethsemane
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there to pray."
Peter took along the sons of Zebedee, and he began to be grieved and agitated.
Who told them: "My spirit is very sad. I know I will die soon. Stay here. Work with me."
He went a little further. Then he fell on his face to the ground. He cried, "My Father, if it is possible, take this cup of suffering away from me. Yet not what I want, but what you want."
Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Could you not watch with me for one hour?" asked Simon.
"Be still and pray. Then do not exert power over the self in what it has power over. The spirit is reforming. And the body is weak."
John knew and sent out another disciple. Then he remembered the Lord, saying, "My father, is it blessed that this cup be removed from me? Nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will."
Then he returned. Again, he found them sleeping. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
So he left them and went away again. The third time he prayed the same thing.
Then he returned to the disciples. He said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is coming. The Son of Man is being handed over into the hands of sinners."
Alas! Let us go! There he is who betrays me to them! Jesus is arrested.
While Jesus was still speaking, Judas arrived. He was one of the twelve. A large crowd was with him, carrying swords and clubs. The chief priests, the scribes, and the elders had sent them.
Judas, who was one of the twelve, went to the chief priests and agreed to hand Jesus over to them. He said, "What are you
So John went to Jesus immediately and said, "Teacher, bless you!" and kissed his hand.
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you have come to do." Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and touched him, and he was arrested.
At that moment, one of Jesus' followers reached for his sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
"Put your sword back in its place," Jesus said to him. "All who take the sword will perish by the sword."
You think I can't ask my father for help? He'll immediately send an army of over 70,000 angels.
But how will the scriptures be fulfilled? They say it must happen in this way.
At that time, Jesus spoke to the crowd. "He said, 'Why do you seek the living among the dead?' 'Cannot you remember the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you? It is written, that the Christ should suffer and rise from the
But all this happened so that the words of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him and fled. Jesus is led to the judgment hall.
Those who had seized Jesus brought him to Caiaphas, the high priest. And all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes assembled there.
For a short distance, Peter followed Jesus. He went straight to the high priest's courtyard. He entered and sat down with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the Sanhedrin were looking for a reason to use against Jesus. They wanted to kill him.
But they found no evidence, although many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two other witnesses appeared.
They said, "This man claimed, 'I can destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up and asked Jesus, "Will you not answer? What is it that these men are accusing you of?"
And Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us, are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
Yes, that is true as you say, Jesus answered. "But this is what is written: In the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need more witnesses? You have heard him say this evil thing."
"What do you understand?" "He must die!" they answered.
Then they spat their saliva in his face. They struck him with their hands. Others struck him with their fists.
They said, "Tell us, Christ, who struck you?" Peter said, "I do not know."
Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. One of the servants came to him. "You are the one who was with Jesus of Galilee," she said.
But before them all, Peter said that he wasn't. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.
Then he went out to the gate leading to the courtyard. Another woman there saw him and said to the people, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
Once again he said it wasn't him. And walking towards his mother, he said: "I don't know this man!"
A little later, those who were there approached Peter. They said, "You are surely one of them." "Your way of speaking gives you away."
Then Peter began to curse and swear. He even swore an oath, saying, "I do not know this man!" Suddenly, a rooster crowed.
I saw him remember why we knew what Jesus said. "The chicks will come," Jesus told him. "Before they come, you'll still be straying and not knowing me." I saw him go outside. And he wanted to be angry and cry.
Yusuf folded himself.
It was still dark. The chief priests and the elders of the people had made a plan to put Jesus to death.
They were gentle with him and took him captive. Then they brought him to Bilat, who was the ruler.
Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned to death. He felt deep shame and remorse for what he had done. So he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
"I fought," he said. "I surrendered a innocent man." "And what does that matter to us?" they replied. "That's your problem."
So Judas threw his money in the temple and left. Then he went and hanged himself.
The priests collected the coins. They said, "It is not lawful to put this money into the treasury of the temple. It is blood money. It is the price of a man's life."
They have decided to use the money to buy a cemetery. People from other countries will be buried there.
That's why it's still called "Field of Blood" to this day.
Then what he said was fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah. He said, "They took the thirty pieces of silver, and they gave them for the price of him whom they valued, as the Lord commanded me."
They used the coins to buy a potter's field, as the Lord commanded me. (Zechariah 11:12, 13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) Jesus was brought to Pilate.
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "Yes, as you say."
But when the priests and the scribes brought charges against him, he made no answer.
Then Pilate asked, "Do you not hear the charges they are bringing against you?"
And Jesus gave no answer, not even to a single charge. The governor was amazed.
It was the custom of the governor at Easter to release one prisoner whom the people chose.
At that time they had a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.
Now when the chief priest had consulted with the elders and the scribes, he asked the people, "Whom do you want me to release for you? Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Pilate realized that the leaders were jealous. He knew that was why they handed Jesus over to him.
While Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message. The message said, "Don't interfere with this man. He is innocent. I have suffered much in a dream today because of him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the people to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus put to death.
"Did anyone here allow me to die?" asked the governor. "No one," they replied.
"What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" asked Caesar. And they all answered, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What shall I do?" asked Pilate. But they cried out all the more, "Crucify him!"
Belatte realized he wasn't getting anywhere. Instead of Man, the poor man started to get angrier. So he took some water and washed his hands in front of them. He said, "I didn't have anything to do with this man's death." He said, "You are responsible for this!"
Everyone answered: "We and our children will bear the guilt of his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas. But he flogged Jesus. Then they handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
The soldiers and officers who were with the governor took Jesus to the palace, which they called "the Praetorium." And all the rest of the soldiers gathered around him.
They accepted his clothes and put a purple robe on him.
Then they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!"
Tell him it's hot. Hit him on the head with the pan once or twice.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him of his robe. They put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to be crucified. Jesus is crucified on a cross.
On their way out of the city, they met a man from Cyrene named Simon. They forced him to carry the cross.
They came to a place called Golgotha, which means "place of the skull."
There they mixed wine with bitter spices and offered it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it.
When they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots.
Lock him up and keep an eye on him there.
Above his head they placed the written charge against him: "THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
There were two female thieves who were being chased. One was on his right and the other on his left.
They tied him up, beat him up, and played with him. And they denied it.
And he said, "So, you will destroy this temple and rebuild it in three days? Save yourselves! Come down from the cross, you sons of God!"
Indeed, the chief priests, the teachers, and the elders mocked him.
They said, "He saved others," but he cannot save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him.
God trusts him. May God deliver him now if He wills. He is the one who said, 'I am the Son of God.'
In the same way, the robbers who were crucified with Jesus also reviled him. Jesus dies.
From noon until then, the whole country was a forest.
October, doze, why, ale, dee-alal, shahal, say, all, qaail, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" Meaning, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of those standing there heard Jesus call out. They said, "He's calling for Elisha."
Then one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
Say the rest, "Leave it clear. If we see the Nile, it means he'll come to rescue him."
After Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, he died.
At that moment, the temple's curtains ripped from top to bottom. The earth shook. Rocks split open.
The graves opened. The bodies of many innocent people who had died came back to life.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus was raised from the dead, they went into the holy city. There they appeared to many people.
The Roman commander and those guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and all that had happened, were terrified. They cried out, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
Way too close, and faces are twitching. They won't shut up about their stuff, like Galileo.
Mary Magdalene was among them. Mary, the mother of John and her sister-in-law Joseph, was there as well. So was the mother of Peter's son, Zebedee. Jesus was crucified.
By evening, a rich man from Jericho came. His name was Joseph. He had become a follower of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Yusuf took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
They found it in my new tomb that they had made for me from stone. And they placed a large stone in front of the tomb's entrance. And then he left.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there facing the tomb. The guards at the tomb.
The day they did it, was the day they did it from the day of reckoning. Chief priests and the elders followed Pilate.
Sir, they said, "We remember something that liar said while he was still alive. He claimed, 'In three days I will be resurrected.'"
Give orders for the tomb to be made secure until the third day, otherwise his disciples may come and steal the body, and tell the people that Jesus has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first.
"Take two guards with you," replied Bilat. "Go. Make the tomb as secure as you can."
They went away and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone and setting a guard.
Jesus is the resurrection and the life.
The Sabbath was over. Dawn was breaking on the first day of the week when Mary Magdalene and the other women went to the tomb.
There was a powerful earthquake. The angel of the Lord came down from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled away the stone and stood opposite it.
His body shone like lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The soldiers were so scared of him that they froze and became as still as statues.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified."
Come here! It's done, just as he said it would be! Come and see the spot he had in mind.
Hurry! Tell his followers: He has risen from the dead. He is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him. I have told you this.
And the women departed quickly from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell the disciples.
Suddenly Jesus met them. He said, "Peace be with you!" So they came to him, touched his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, where they will see me." The guards reported this to the chief priests.
As the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
When the judges met with the elders, they devised a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
Tell the soldiers: "Do they want you to say: 'The soldiers played all night. They brought back his body while they were sleeping.'?"
If the governor hears this report, we'll be paid. That'll keep you out of trouble.
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus' final orders to his disciples.
Then the twelve disciples went to Galilee. They went to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they turned their faces away from him. But some of them secretly believed in him.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
You, O Muslim, must go and teach disciples to all nations. Baptize them in the name of the Lord, the Father, and His Son, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit.
Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And be sure that I am always with you, to the end.
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
From ancient times, the prophet Elijah wrote: "I will send my messenger before you to prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
A messenger cries out in the desert: "Prepare yourselves for your Lord. Make straight paths for Him."
And John preached, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." And people were coming out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region ar
All the people from the countryside of Judea came to him, and all the people from Jerusalem also came. When they confessed that they were angry, John washed them in the Jordan River.
John wore a cloak made of camel's wool. He had a leather belt around his waist. He saw a cloud and a mountain.
This is what John was preaching. "After me comes a man who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals."
I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit. Jesus is baptized and tested.
At that time I came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
Jesus was coming up out of the water. Suddenly, he saw the heavens opening, and he saw the Holy Spirit descending on him like a dove.
A voice called out to him from heaven. It said, "You are my son, and I love you. I am very pleased with you."
At that same moment, the Holy Spirit sent Jesus into the desert.
He was in the desert for forty days. There, demons tempted him. Jesus did not harm the wild animals. Angels submitted to him. Jesus chose his first disciples.
After John loved him, they admitted him to their group, and he went around preaching in Galilee. He proclaimed the good news of God's kingdom.
"The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God is near. Repent of your sins and believe in the good news!"
One day Jesus was walking along the shore of Lake Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting their nets into the lake, for they were fishermen.
"Come on, follow me," he said, his voice full of enthusiasm. "Over there, we'll make you into a hunter for us."
At that very moment, they left their nets and followed him.
Then Jesus walked a little further. As he walked, he saw Simon, the son of John, and his brother John, in a boat, mending their nets.
"They were permitted, and they turned to their father, Zebedee. The people touched the hired workers, and they followed John. John drives out the spirit of evil."
Jesus and his sons went to Capernaum. And when the Sabbath came, he entered the synagogue and began to teach.
People were amazed by his teaching. He taught them as if he were a ruler. He did not speak like the religious scholars.
But at that moment, a man cried out in their temple. He was possessed by an evil spirit. He said,
What do you want from us, Jesus Christ? Have you come to destroy us? I know you. You are the Holy Revelation of God!
"Be silent!" Jesus said firmly. "Come out of him!"
The demonic spirit shook the man violently. Then it exited him with a scream.
Everyone was amazed. They asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching with great power! Even the evil spirits obey him."
News about Jesus spread rapidly everywhere in Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and his sons left the synagogue. They immediately went with Justus and John to the house of Simon and Anna.
Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed with a fever. They told Jesus about her.

That evening, after sunset, they brought to Jesus all who were sick and those possessed by demons.
Everyone gathered at the door.
Jesus healed many of them. They were drinking all the wine of the jars. He also drove out many demons. But he did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus lived in a quiet place.
It was still very early in the morning, and the night was dark. Jesus got up and left the house. He went to a place where he could be alone and prayed.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
When they turned against him, they said, "We all saw you!"
"Answering John, she said, 'But we keep them in another place. I want to bring the presence down to the nearby plain. I must proclaim the good news there too. That is why I have come.'"
So he traveled through all of Galilee. He was preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons. Jesus heals a man who had leprosy.
A sick man was brought to Jesus, lying on a mat. Kneeling, he said to Jesus, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."
Jesus was filled with deep concern. He reached out and touched the man. He said, "I am willing to do it!" "Be 'clean'!"
Immediately, he got rid of the disease. He was cured.
Jesus was truly thirsty. And he gave him a strong warning.
"You shall say this to those who have no one to mourn for them," he said. "Give them a burial with the priest, along with the offerings that Moses commanded. This will be a mark of respect for the priest and a reminder to the people of your 'purity'."
But the man went out and began to proclaim it freely, spreading the news to everyone. So Jesus could no longer enter a town openly. He remained in secluded places, but people still came to him from everywhere.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk.
After a few days, Jesus entered Capernaum again. The people heard that he had returned to his home.
The people gathered in great numbers, to the extent that there was no remaining space. Even outside the door, there was no room. And Jesus was speaking to them in parables.
Four of those who came were carrying a man who couldn't walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, letting down their mat, they lowered the man.
Jesus saw their faith. And he said to the man, "Your sins are forgiven."
Some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking.
Does this man always talk like this? He says a lot of ugly things! It's too much to bear!
"They were astonished, for they did not understand what he meant. So he said to them, 'What are you discussing together?'"
Is it easier to say to this man, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Stand up, take your mat and walk"?
I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. Then Jesus spoke to the man who couldn't walk.
"Get out of here," he said, "Take your scarf and go to dinner."
The man rose and took his mat. Then he walked, and everyone watched them. Everyone was amazed. So they praised God and said, "We have never seen anything like this!" Jesus chose Levi.
Once again, Jesus went out to the lakeside, where a large crowd gathered around him. He began to teach them.
As he walked, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's booth. Jesus said to him, "Follow me." And he got up and followed him.
Later, Jesus was dining at Levi's house, and many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and listening to him. They were part of the large crowd that followed Jesus.
There were some teachers of the law who were Pharisees. They saw Jesus eating with "tax collectors" and "sinners." So they asked his disciples, "Why does Jesus eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
Jesus heard this and said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick; I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance." Jesus is asked about fasting.
The Pharisees and the disciples of John were fasting. Some people came to Jesus and said to him, "The disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast. But your disciples do not fast. Why do they not fast?"
Jesus answered and said to her, "How can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? The days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast."
But the time will come when the groom will be taken from them. On that day they will eat nothing.
People don't patch new cloth onto old clothes. If they do, the new patch will tear away from the old. That will make the tear worse.
People do not pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the new wine will burst the old wineskins. Then both the new wine and the old wineskins will be destroyed. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins. Jesus is
On the Sabbath, Jesus was walking through wheat fields with his disciples. The disciples began to pick and eat the wheat.
The Pharisees said, "It is not lawful for you to do this on the Sabbath. Why is your son doing this?"
He answered, "Don't you know what David did? He and his shepherds were hungry. They needed food."
When Abiathar was exiled, he was a chief priest. David entered the house of God and ate the sacred bread. Only the priests were allowed to eat it. David also gave some to his men.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
So the Son of Man is Lord even on the Sabbath.
Healing on Friday.
Again, Jesus went into the synagogue, and there was a man with a withered hand.
Some Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They were watching him closely. They wanted to see whether he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus said to the man who had the withered and crooked hand, "Stand up before everyone," he said.
Then Jesus asked them, "What does the law say we should do on the Sabbath? Should we do good or evil? Should we save lives or destroy them?" But no one answered.
Jesus looked around in anger and was deeply distressed at their stubbornness. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored, just as if it were new.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians against Jesus, how they might destroy Him. The multitudes followed Him.
Jesus resolved to go to Galilee, and his disciples accompanied him. A large crowd from Galilee followed them.
The people heard about all that Jesus was doing. And many came to him, from Galilee, and from Jerusalem, and from Judea, and from beyond the Jordan, and from the region around Tyre and Sidon.
To get away from the crowd, Jesus told his disciples, "Prepare a small boat for me, so that I can send the people away."
Jesus healed many people. Therefore, the sick came forward to touch him.
When the people saw the demons being driven out, they fell at his feet and cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
But he commanded them that they should tell no man who he was. Jesus appoints the twelve apostles.
Jesus went up on a mountain and called to him those whom he desired, and they came to him.
He appointed twelve of them as apostles, and they were with him. He also sent them out to preach.
They had authority to cast out demons.
Then Jesus appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles. Simon was among them, and Jesus gave him the name Peter.
There were James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. Jesus gave them the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder.
There were also Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James, the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot.
Judas the Israeli was also among them. He was the one who would later betray him to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebub.
Jesus entered a house. And again a crowd gathered. It was already late, so Jesus and his disciples were ready to eat.
His family heard about it. They judged him harshly. They said, "The boy is sick, there's something wrong with him."
Some of the scribes there, who had come from Jerusalem, said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul! By the prince of demons he casts out demons."
Then Jesus called them and began to speak to them in parables. He said, "How can Satan drive out Satan?"
If a kingdom engages in a battle with itself, it cannot stand.
If the family is divided, it cannot continue.
