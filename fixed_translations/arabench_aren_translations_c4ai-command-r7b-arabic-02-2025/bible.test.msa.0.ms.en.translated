Who is the greatest?
At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked him: “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”
Then Jesus called a child to him, and set him in the midst of them;
And he said to them, “Truly, I say to you, unless you change and become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.
Therefore whoever humbles himself as this little child will be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
“Whoever welcomes such a child in my name welcomes me.”
“Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were cast into the sea!
Woe to the world for these inevitable stumbling blocks, but woe to those who cause them!
“If your hand is an obstacle to you, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed than to have two hands and be thrown into hell.
If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it from you! It is better for you to enter life with one eye than with two eyes to be cast into hell fire. The Prodigal Son
And Jesus said to them, “Take care that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that in heaven the angels who are in the presence of the Father see his face constantly.”
For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.
“What do you think of a man who had one hundred sheep, and one of them got lost? Does he not leave the other ninety-nine in the mountains to go and find the one that is lost?”
I tell you the truth, he will be more glad at finding it than at finding the ninety-nine that never went astray.
So neither does your Father who is in heaven want one of these little ones to perish. Love your brother
“If your brother wrongs you, go to him and talk to him privately. If he listens to you, you will have gained your brother.”
But if he will not hear, take one or two with you, that every word may be established by the mouth of two or three witnesses. 16:18 Look at Deuteronomy 19: 15.
If he refuses to listen to them, tell the church. If he refuses to listen to the church, then treat him like a pagan and a tax collector.
“I say to you the truth, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
I say to you the truth, if two of you agree on earth concerning anything for which they pray, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
“For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.” Forgiveness without Limits
Then Peter came to Jesus and said to him, “Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother for being wrong to me? Up to seven times?”
Jesus said to him, "Not seven times, but seventy times seven! 22:18 That is, without limit.
“Therefore the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves.
When he started settling his accounts, a man who owed him a very large sum of money came to him. #Very large sum of money. 24:18 Literally: "ten thousand dirhams or qanatar, which is equivalent to about 300,000 kilograms of the coins used at that time."
Not having what to pay the debt, Mr. decided to sell himself, his wife, his children and all he had, and to use the price to pay the debt.
«Then the servant fell on his knees before the king and implored him, saying: ‘Wait for me, and I will pay you all the debt.’»
Mr. Sympathized with him, and canceled the debt in full and let him go.
As he was going, he found one of his fellow slaves, who owed him a small sum. He seized his throat and began to strangle him, saying, ‘Pay me what you owe me.’
The servant fell on his knees before him and implored him, saying: “Be patient with me, and I will pay what I owe.”
“But he refused, and he took him and threw him in jail until he paid all his debt.”
When the other slaves saw what had happened, they were very sad, and went to tell their master everything that had happened.
«His master called him and said to him: ‘You wicked servant! I have forgiven you all that debt because you pleaded with me.’
Could you not have spared your servant, your companion, as you spared me?›
His master was very angry and handed him over to be punished until he paid all his debt.
“In the same way your heavenly Father will treat you unless you forgive each of your brothers and sisters from your heart.”
Union in Marriage
After Jesus had finished speaking about these things, he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea, beyond the Jordan.
And a great multitude followed him and he healed them there.
Some of the Pharisees came to test Jesus with a question. They said to him, “Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for any cause?”
Jesus answered, “Have you not read what it says in the book, ‘God created man in his own image, male and female he created them’?” #creation … and female. 4:19 From the book of Genesis 1: 27, 5: 2.
Then he said: “For this reason a man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife, and the two become one flesh.” #leaves … one. 5:19 From the book of Genesis 2: 24.
And so they are not two, but one. No one should separate those whom God has joined together.
They said to him: “Why did Moses command that you give the wife a document of divorce, #document of divorce. 7:19 See the Book of Deuteronomy 24: 1. So you divorce?”
Jesus answered them, “Moses allowed this because of your hard hearts.
“Therefore I tell you, whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.”
His disciples said to him, “If it is thus between a man and his wife, it is better not to marry!”
Jesus said to them, “Not everyone can accept this teaching except those whom God has given the ability to do so.
There are men who cannot marry because they were born without the ability to marry. There are men who cannot marry because people have deprived them of the ability to marry. And there are men who have chosen not to marry for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept this teaching, let him accept it.” Jesus welcomes children
Then they brought to him little children, that he should lay his hands on them and pray; and his disciples rebuked them.
Then Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.”
Then Jesus laid his hands on them and left that place. The obstacle of wealth
A man came to Jesus and asked him: “Teacher, what good deed must I do to gain eternal life?”
Jesus answered him, “Why are you asking me about what is good? There is only one God who is good. But if you want to go to heaven, you must keep the commandments.”
The man said, “What commandments?” Jesus replied, “You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal.
Do not bear false witness against your neighbor. Honor your father and your mother.› #Do not kill ... and your mother. 19:19 From the Book of Exodus 20: 12-16, and the Book of Deuteronomy 5: 16-20. ‹Love your neighbor #your neighbor. 19:19 Referring to the Gospel of Luke 10: 25-37, we understand that the neighbor is every human being in need of help. As you love yourself.› #Love ... yourself. 19:19 From the Book of Leviticus 19: 18. »
The young man said to him, “I obey all these commandments, so what else do I need?”
Jesus said to him, “If you wish to be complete, go, sell your possessions, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”
When the young man heard that, he went away sad, because he was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples: “I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.
“I say to you again, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”
When his disciples heard this, they were astonished and said, “Who then can be saved?”
And looking at them Jesus said to them, “With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”
Then Peter said to him, “We have left everything and followed you! What will we get?”
Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, when the Son of Man is seated on his glorious throne in its glory, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
“And whoever, for my sake, leaves houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or fields, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal life.”
Many are the first who will become the last, and many are the last who will become the first.
Like the Grape Pickers
“The kingdom of heaven is like a man who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
He agreed with the workers to pay them one dinar for each day, then he sent them to work in his vineyard.
«The owner of the generosity went out at about nine o'clock, and saw some men standing in the market area doing nothing.
He said to them: “Go you also to my vineyards, and whatever is right you will receive.”
They went to work in the vineyard. “He went out again at about noon and again at about three o’clock, and found others there.”
At about five o’clock he went out again and found others standing in the marketplace. He asked them, “Why were you standing there all day without work?”
«They said to him, ‘No one has hired us.’ He said to them, ‘Go you also to the vineyard.’
«At the end of the day, the master of the house called to his servant and said, ‘Call the workers and pay them their wages, starting with the last one who came and ending with the first.’»
«Then came those who had been hired at five o'clock, and each of them received a denarius.
Then came the first hired, and they thought they would get more; but even they received a denarius each.
They took it and began to complain about the host.
And they say: ‘Those who were hired at the end of the day worked only one hour, and you paid them as much as you paid us, although we worked all day in the hot sun!’
«The generous man said to one of them, ‘I have not wronged you, my friend! Did you not agree to work for a dinar?
Take your pay and go. For I want to give the one I hired the last of the day, the same pay I gave you.
“Don’t I have the right to do what I want with what I own? Or are you jealous because I’m good to others?”
“So the first will be last, and the last will be first.” Jesus announces his death and resurrection
As he was going to Jerusalem, he took the twelve aside and said to them:
“And we are going into Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death,
And they will deliver him to the disbelievers to mock at him and to crucify him. But on the third day he will rise again. The greatest is he who serves
Then his mother-in-law came to him, with her sons. She fell at his feet and asked for something from him.
Jesus said to her, “What do you want?” She said to him, “Promise me that these two sons of mine will sit, one at your right hand and the other at your left, in your kingdom.”
Jesus said: “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the #cup. 22:20 the cup of suffering. Also in verse 23. that I will drink?” They said to him: “We are able.”
He said to them, “But my cup you shall drink, and the sitting by my right hand and by my left hand I cannot give but to the sons of my mother.”
When the remaining ten heard this request, they were very angry with the two brothers.
Then he called to him his disciples and said to them, “You know that the rulers of the nations exercise authority over them, and their great ones are over them.
But this is not what should be between you, but whoever wants to be great among you, let him be your servant.
And whoever wishes to be first among you, let him be your servant.
“Likewise, the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.” Jesus heals the blind
And as they were leaving Jericho, a great crowd followed them.
And there were two blind men sitting by the roadside. And when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”
People rebuked them and ordered them to be silent, but they raised their voices even more: “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us.”
Jesus stopped and said to them, “What do you want me to do for you?”
They said: “O Lord, open our eyes.”
Then Jesus opened their eyes, and they gained their sight again, and they followed him.
The King Lives
As they came near to the city of Jerusalem, and were come into the village of Bethfage, by the mount of Olives, Jesus sent forth two of his disciples,
And he said to them, “Go into the village that lies before you, and there you will find a small donkey tied, and its foal with it. Untie them and bring them to me.”
And if anyone should say to you, ‘They are needed by the Lord, and He will return them to you soon,’ you shall say to him, ‘The Lord needs them more, and He will return them to us, O Lord, when You will.’
This happened so that what the prophet said would come true:
«Tell the beloved city Zion: #Beloved Zion. 5:21 Literally “Daughter Zion.” Behold, your King is coming to you, humble and riding on a donkey, a foal of a working beast.”
The two disciples went and did as Jesus had said.
They brought the little donkey and its mother and laid the clothes on them, and Jesus sat down on them.
Most people spread their cloaks on the road. But others cut branches from trees and spread them on the road.
The crowds that walked in front of and behind him shouted: “Long live the king! #Long live the king. 9:21 Literally: “Hosanna.” In Hebrew, it means “Save now.” It is probably a shout of praise for God and his kingly Messiah. It is repeated in verse 15. Long live the son of David. ‹Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.› Long live the king in his greatness.
And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was shaken, and the people were saying, “Who is this man?”
And the crowds that followed were saying, “This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in the district of Galilee.” Jesus in the Temple
Then Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling doves.
And he said to them, “It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’ #My house … prayer. 13:21 from Isaiah 56:7. But you have made it a den of thieves! #Den of thieves. 13:21 from Jeremiah 7:11.”
And some blind men and some lame men came to him in the temple court, and he healed them.
The high priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonders he was doing, and the children shouting in the temple square, “Hail to the king!
Jesus answered, “Yes, but have you not read what is written in the Scripture: ‘Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you have prepared praise for yourself’?”
Then Jesus left them, and went out of the town to Bethany, where he spent the night. The power of faith
And as Jesus was going early in the morning to the city, he was hungry.
He saw a fig tree on the side of the road, went to it, but found only leaves, so he said to it, "You will not bear fruit any more." The fig tree withered at once.
When the disciples saw this, they were astonished, and asked him, “How has the fig tree put out its leaves already?”
He answered them, “I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only be able to do what I did to the fig tree. If you say to this mountain, ‘Move, and throw yourself into the sea,’ it will be done for you.
Whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.” Questioning the Authority of Jesus
And Jesus went into the temple of God, and the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him, and said to him, “By what authority are you doing these things?
Jesus answered them, “And I will ask you, in turn. Tell me, by what authority do you do these things?”
Where did John’s baptism come from, from God or from people? So they began to discuss it among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From God,’ he will ask us, ‘Why didn’t you believe him?’”
And if we say that she is of the people, we are afraid of the people, for they all count John as a prophet.
Therefore they answered Jesus and said, “We do not know.” Jesus said to them, “And I do not tell you which authority I have to do these things.” Parable of the two sons
And Jesus said: “What do you think? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work in the vineyard today.’
“The son answered, ‘I don’t want to go.’ But he changed his mind and went.”
«Then the father went to his other son and said the same thing. The son said: ‘Yes, father, I will go.’ But he did not go.
“Which of the two sons did the will of his father?” They answered, “The first.” He said to them, “Truly, I say to you, the tax collectors and the harlots will go into the kingdom of God before you.”
It is better for you that one of you should die for a man than that you all should perish.
«Listen to another example: There was a man who owned a vineyard, and he planted it, and surrounded it with a fence, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower. Then he leased it to some farmers and went away on a journey.
When the time came to harvest the grapes, he sent his slaves to the peasants to get his share of the grapes.
“But the peasants seized his slave, beat one, killed another, and stoned a third.
So the owner sent more slaves than the first time. The farmers treated them the same way.
Finally, he sent his son, and said to himself, ‘They will respect my son.’
“But when the peasants saw that this was the owner’s son, they conferred among themselves and said, ‘This is the heir, let us kill him so that we may seize his inheritance.’”
They arrested him and threw him outside the vineyard and killed him.
“What do you think the generous man will do with those farmers when he returns?”
They said to him, “He will destroy them in a terrible way because they are evil, and he will give the land to other farmers, and they will harvest it in its harvest time.”
And He said to them, “Did you not read this: ‘The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief corner stone. The Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?”
“Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation that produces the fruits of the kingdom.
“Every one that falls on this stone shall be broken; and when it falls on any one, it will grind him to powder!”
And when the chief priests and the Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he was speaking of them.
So they tried to arrest him, but they were afraid of the people who considered Jesus a prophet.
Like a wedding feast
And he spoke to them again by parables, and said:
“The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son.
The king sent his slaves to invite the guests to the wedding feast, but they did not want to come.
«So the king sent other slaves and said, “Say to those who were invited, ‘The wedding feast is ready. The oxen and the fattened calves have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.’”»
«But the invited ones did not care, and each went on his way. One went to his field to work, and another to his trade.
The rest seized the king’s slaves, beat them and killed them.
Then the king became angry and sent his army, which killed those murderers and burned their city.
«Then the king said to his servants: ‘The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy of it.
Therefore go to the corners of the streets, and invite all whom you find to the wedding feast.
They went out into the streets and gathered everyone they found, whether good or bad, until the banquet hall was full of guests.
“And when the king came to see the guests, he saw a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.
The king said to him: ‘My friend, how did you get in here without wearing a wedding dress,’ but the man remained silent.
The king said to his servants: “Bind his hands and feet, and throw him outside into the darkness, where people weep and gnash their teeth.”
“For many are called, but few are chosen.” The Pharisees try to trap Jesus
Then the Pharisees went away, and held a council, to see of what they might catch him in saying.
So they sent to him some of the Pharisees and the Herodians, to catch him in something he might say. And they came to him, saying: Teacher, we know that you are sincere, and teach the way of God in truth, without favour; for you regard not man’s person.
So tell us what you think, is it right to pay taxes to the Caesar or not?
But Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them: “You hypocrites, why are you trying to catch me?”
Show me the coin you use.’ They brought him a dinar.
He said to them: “To whom does this coin and this inscription belong?”
They said to him, “They belong to Caesar.” He said to them, “Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and to God what belongs to God.”
When they heard this, they were greatly astonished and said to him, “Are you the Son of God?” He said to them, “You say that I am.”
And on that day, some Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, came to him and asked:
«O teacher, Moses said, #Moses said. 24:22 Look at the book of Deuteronomy 25: 5, 6. If a man dies and leaves no sons, his brother shall marry his widow, and he shall father a son for his brother.
We were seven brothers, the first one got married and died. Because he had no sons, his brother married his widow.
And that happened to the brother and the second and the third and even the seventh.
And when they were all dead, the woman died too.
Which of the seven will be her husband on the Day of Resurrection? They have all married her.
Jesus answered them, “You are in error because you do not know the scriptures, nor do you know the power of God.
They understood that in the eternal life after the resurrection of the dead, people do not marry and do not marry their daughters, but they are like angels in heaven.
As for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what God said?
›I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.› #I … am Jacob. 32:22 From the Book of Exodus 3: 6. God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
When the people heard this word, they were astonished at his teaching. The greatest commandment
And when the Pharisees heard that Jesus had answered the Sadducees to the point, they met together.
A specialist in Sharia law tried to trap him and asked him:
«O teacher, what is the greatest recommendation in the sharia?»
Jesus said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.” #LoveTheLord…your mind. 37:22 from the Book of Deuteronomy 6: 5.
This is the first and greatest commandment,
The second commandment is the same as the first: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” (Leviticus 19:18)
“The whole of the Torah and the books of the prophets are concerned with these two commandments.” Christ is Lord of David
And while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them:
«What do you think of Christ? Whose son is he?» The Pharisees answered, «He is the son of David.
He said to them, “Then how did David call him ‘Lord’ when he said while under the influence of the Spirit:
›The Lord said to my master, “Sit on my right hand until I make your enemies the footstool for your feet.”‹
“If David called the Christ Lord, how can he be his son?”
No one could answer him anything, and no one dared to ask him more questions after that.
Jesus criticizes the clergy
Then Jesus spoke to the multitude and to his disciples
He said, “The teachers of the law and the Pharisees have interpreted the law.
So keep and practice whatever they say to you, but do not do their works. For they say, but do not do, what they say.
They burden people with heavy loads, but they themselves do not want to make any effort to follow them.
«All good works that they do, they do in order to be seen by people. They show their piety, and they swell their #bands. 5:23 Some of the Jews used to write certain passages from the Bible and put them in small leather bags, and then tie them with bands of cloth to the forehead or the left arm, showing their great piety. They also lengthen the fringes of their garments.
They like to sit in the best seats at feasts, and in the front seats at assemblies.
They like to be greeted with special greetings in the markets, and to be called ‘Master’.
“But you are not to be called ‘Teacher’, because one is your Teacher, and you are all brothers.”
And call no man on earth your father: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.
And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.
The greatest among you shall be your servant.
Whoever raises himself will be put down by God, and whoever humbles himself will be raised by God.
“Woe to you, Pharisees and scribes, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people’s faces. You neither enter yourselves nor let those who want to enter in.”
“Woe to you, Pharisees and you teachers of the law, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside, but
“Woe to you, Pharisees and scribes, hypocrites! For you travel over land and sea to make one disciple, and when he becomes so, you make him worthy of hell twice over.”
“Woe to you, blind guides! For you say, ‘If one swears by the temple, it is no binding oath; but if one swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound.’
Blind fools! Which is greater: the gold in the temple, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?
«And you say: ‘He has sworn by the altar, he is not bound to keep his oath. But if one swears by the offering on the altar, he is bound to keep it!’
Blind man! Which is greater, the offering on the altar, or the altar that makes the offering holy?
For if any man swear by the altar, he swears by it and by all that is on it.
And if anyone swears by the temple, he swears by it and by him who dwells in it.
And whoever swears by the heaven, he swears by the throne of God and by the one who sits on it.
Woe to you, Pharisees and scribes, hypocrites! For you pay the tithe of mint and anise and cumin, #cumin. 23:23 A plant whose seeds are used in cooking as a spice, and which has some medicinal uses. and caraway, but you have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faith. It was necessary for you to do these things, without neglecting the others.
Blind guides, you lift the gnat from your cup, but you swallow the camel!
“Woe to you, Pharisees and scribes, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full of greed and wickedness.”
You hypocrites, first wash inside the cup, so that the outside also may be clean.
“Woe to you, Pharisees and scribes, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which appear beautiful on the outside, but inside are full of dead men’s bones and all manner of filth.
So also you, outwardly you show yourselves to be righteous, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and evil.
“Woe to you, Pharisees, and you teachers of the law, hypocrites! Because you build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.
And you say: ‘If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have participated in the killing of the prophets.’
And so you confirm that you are the progeny of those who killed the prophets,
So complete what your ancestors started.
“O snakes and sons of snakes! How can you escape the judgment of hell?
Therefore I tell you, that you will be delivered up by your fathers, and they will put some of you to death, and they will persecute you in your synagogues, and they will cast some of you out of their cities, and they will persecute you, that your very hair may be counted, on the day that you will not leave one stone upon another in this place, until the coming of the Son of Man.
Therefore you will be held accountable for the blood of every innocent person that is shed on the earth, from the blood of Abel the innocent to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, #Abel … Zechariah. 35:23 The first and the last who were killed according to the time and the text of the Old Testament books. (See Genesis 4:8, and 2 Chronicles 24:20) who was killed between the sanctuary and the altar.
“I tell you the truth, the punishment for all these crimes will fall on this generation. Jesus warns the people of the City of Jerusalem
“O Jerusalem, O Jerusalem, who slayest the prophets and castest down the messengers of God unto thee! How often would I have gathered thy children together as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings! But ye would not.”
Here, your house will be left empty for you!
“For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.’” #Blessed … the Lord. 39:23 from Psalm 118: 26.
Jesus Foretells the Destruction of the Temple
And Jesus left the temple. As he was walking away, his disciples came to him and said, “Teacher, the temple buildings are magnificent.”
Jesus said to them, “Do you see all these things? I tell you the truth, not one stone will be left upon another; everything will be thrown down.”
While Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came to him in private and said, “Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?”
Jesus answered them, “Beware of the leaven, that is, the hypocrisy.”
Many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am Christ,’ and they will deceive many.
You will hear about wars and revolutions, but you should not be afraid. These things must happen, but they will not be the end of the world.
For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes, famines,
But all this will be the first pangs of labor.
They will deliver you up to be punished and will put some of you to death. All nations will hate you on account of my name.
At that time, many will leave the faith, and one will hand over another to the authorities, and some will hate one another.
False prophets will appear and deceive many.
And because of the increase of much sin, the love of many will grow cold,
But he who remains faithful to the end, he will be saved.
And the gospel of the kingdom of God will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.
«When you see the ‘unclean one who causes desolation’ #theuncleanonewhocausesdesolation. 15:24 Look at Daniel 9: 27, 12: 11, and also Matthew 11: 31. Which the prophet Daniel pointed to, standing in the holy place – let the reader understand this.

But pray that your flight is not in winter or on a Saturday.

And if God had not decided to shorten those days, no one would have remained alive. But for His chosen people, God will shorten those days.
If anyone says to you, ‘Behold, here is the Christ,’ or ‘Behold, he is there,’ do not believe it.

“At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven. And then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory.”
And He will send His angels with a great trumpet sound, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of heaven to the uttermost part of heaven.
«Learn from the fig tree. As soon as its branches become tender, and its leaves appear, you know that summer is near.
So also when you see all these things, you will know that it is #time. 33:24 Compare with Luke 21:31. It is near at hand.
I say to you the truth: this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. Only the Father knows.
“But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
“As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of Man.
In the days before the flood, people ate and drank and married and married their daughters until the day Noah entered the ark.
They did not know what it was like to be taken away, for the flood came and swept them away. So it will be with the coming of the Son of Man.
At that time, two men are working in a field, one is taken and the other is left.
Two women are grinding grain on a stone mill, one is taken and the other is left.
“Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.”
Make sure that if the owner of the house knew at what hour of the night the thief intended to come, he would wake up and would not leave him to rob his house.
Therefore be you also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh. The good man and the wicked
“Who is the faithful and wise servant, whom his master has set over his household, to feed them in due season?”
Congratulations to that servant who, when his master comes, finds him doing his duty.
I tell you the truth, he will entrust it with all his property.
The evil servant says to himself, ‘My master is late.’
He starts by beating his servants, and then he starts eating and drinking with the drunkards.
The master of that servant will come on a day you do not expect and at an hour you do not know.
He punishes him and puts him with the hypocrites, where people weep and gnash their teeth.
Like ten girls
“Then the kingdom of heaven shall be like ten virgins, which went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them are stupid, and five are smart.
The fools took their lamps, but they didn’t take any extra oil with them.
The clever ones took an extra Zita in their flasks with the lamps.
The groom was late, so all the girls dozed off and fell asleep.
«But at midnight someone shouted: ‘The groom is coming, go out to meet him.’
“Then the girls woke up and lit their lamps.”
The stupid said to the smart: “Give us some of your oil, our lamps are almost out.”
«The clever ones replied: ‘We cannot, it is not enough for us, but. Go to the vendors and buy oil by yourselves.’ »
While the bridesmaids went to buy oil, the groom arrived. The smart ones were ready, so they went in with him to the wedding feast. Then the door was closed.
“And finally the other girls came and said: ‘Sir, sir, open the door for us.’”
“But he said: ‘I tell you the truth, I do not know you!’”
Therefore be on the alert, for you do not know the day or the hour in which the Son of Man is coming. Like the unfaithful steward
“The kingdom of heaven is like a man who went on a journey, called his servants and entrusted them with his property.
So one of them gave five bags #FiveBags. 15:25 Literally “ozنات أو قناطير” and one ouncie is equal to about 27 to 36 kilograms of gold, silver or copper. Of money, and the second gave two bags, and the third gave one bag. Each gave according to his ability. Then he immediately traveled.
So the one who took the five bags started to invest them immediately in trade, and gained five more bags.
And the one who took the two bags did the same, and gained two more.
As for the one who took one bag, he went and dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master's money in it.
«Long time after, the master of these slaves returned and began to call them to account.
Then came the man who took the five bags and earned five more bags and said: ‘Sir, you gave me five bags, and here are five more bags I earned.’
His master said to him: “Well done, faithful and good servant. You have been faithful with a little, so I will put you in charge of much. Enter into the joy of your master.”
«Then came the one who took the two bags, and said: ‹Sir, you gave me two bags, and here are two more I have won.›
His master said to him: “Well done, faithful and good servant. You have been faithful with a little, so I will put you in charge of much. Enter into the joy of your master.”
«Then came one that had one sack, and said, Lord, I know that thou art a hard man: for thou reapest where thou hast not sown; and gatherest where thou hast not scattered.
I was afraid of you, so I went and hid your bag in the ground. Take your money.›
“And his lord answered him, ‘You evil and lazy slave! Since you knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not scatter,
Why didn’t you deposit my money in the bank, and when I return I take my money with interest?
«So take the bag from him, and give it to the owner of the ten bags.
For he will give more to those who have, and they will have an abundance, but from those who have nothing, he will take even what they have.
As for that useless slave, throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth. For man is God’s judge
“And when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne.
Then all nations will come before him. And he will separate some from others, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
He will place the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
«Then the king will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who my father has blessed! Take what is yours, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.
For I was hungry and you gave me food. I was thirsty and you gave me drink. I was a stranger and you took me in.
I was naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you cared for me. I was in prison and you visited me.
“The Righteous Answer: ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and give you food, or thirsty and give you something to drink?’”
When we saw you as a stranger we took you in, or naked we clothed you?
›And when we saw you as a sick man or a prisoner, we visited you.›
“Truly I say to you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.”
«Then the king says to those standing to his left: ‘Get away from me, you cursed ones, and go to the eternal fire prepared for Satan and his angels.’
Because I was hungry, you did not give me anything to eat. Because I was thirsty, you did not give me anything to drink.
I was a stranger and you did not take me in. I was naked and you did not clothe me. I was sick and in prison and you did not visit me.
“The wicked will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not help?’
“The king said to them, ‘I tell you the truth, just as you did it for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did it for me.’”
“And so the wicked go to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.”
Jewish Leaders Plan to Kill Jesus
After Jesus had said this, he said to his disciples:
«You know that the festival of Pascha is after tomorrow, and the Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of the enemies to be crucified.»
The high priests and the elders of the people had assembled in the palace of the high priest Caiaphas.
They planned to capture Jesus by deception and kill him.
And they said: “We should not do this during the feast, lest there be a tumult among the people.” A woman pours perfume on Jesus
And while Jesus was in the town of Bethsaida, in the house of Simon the leper,
A woman came to him, and she had a precious perfume in a marble bottle, and she poured it on his head while he was eating.
And when his disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, “To what end is this waste?”
This perfume could have been sold for a large sum of money given to the poor.
Jesus knew what they were talking about and said to them, “Why are you disturbing this woman? She has done a beautiful thing for me.”
The poor will always be with you, #poor... always. 11:26 Look at Deuteronomy 15:11. But I will not always be with you.
I poured perfume on my body to prepare it for burial.
“I tell you the truth, wherever this prophecy is proclaimed throughout the world, what this woman has done will also be remembered.” Judas betrays Jesus
Then went one of the twelve, and he was Judas Iscariot, to the chief priests,
And he said to them, “What will you give me if I hand over Jesus to you?” So they paid him thirty pieces of silver.
And from that moment on, Judas began to look for an appropriate opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. At the Paschal table
On the first day of the festival of unleavened bread, the disciples came to him and said, “Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal for you?”
Jesus said, “Go to so-and-so in the village and say to him, ‘The teacher says: my appointed time is near, and I will celebrate the Passover with my disciples in your house.’”
The disciples did as Jesus had instructed them, and prepared the Paschal feast.
And when evening came, Jesus was reclining at table with his twelve disciples.
While they were eating, he said to them, “Truly I say to you, one of you will betray me.”
They were sad and began to ask him one after the other: “Is it I, Lord?”
Jesus answered, “Whoever puts his hand with me in the dish is the one who shares with me.”
The Son of Man is that which is written of him. But woe to him that is a man that is a man that is
Judas, who was to betray him, asked him, “Is it I, Rabbi?” Jesus answered, “It is as you have said.” The Last Supper
And while they were eating, he took some bread, and when he had blessed, he brake it, and gave to them, and said, “This is my body.”
Then he took a cup of wine, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, “Drink all of you from this.”
For this is my blood, the blood of the covenant, shed for many for the forgiveness of their sins.
And I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of my Father.
After that they sang some hymns, and went out to Mount Olive. Jesus Foretells Peter’s Denial
Then Jesus said to them, “You all will fall away on this night. For it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’”
But after I have risen from the dead, I will go before you into Galilee.
Peter answered him, “Even if everyone else loses faith in you, I will never lose faith in you.”
Jesus said to him, "I tell you the truth, before the rooster crows on this night, you will disown me three times."
Peter said to him, “Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you!” And all the disciples said the same. Jesus prays alone
Then went Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane: and he said unto his disciples, Sit ye here, while I go thither to pray.
And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to feel sorrow and distress.
Then he said to them: “My grief is so great that it almost kills me! Stay here and keep watch with me.”
And Jesus went a little apart and fell on his face and prayed, saying, “O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.”
He came to his disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, “Could you not keep watch with me for one hour?”
Stay awake and pray that you may not enter into temptation. Your spirit is eager, but your flesh is weak.
He stepped back to pray again, and said: “Father, if it is not possible to pass this cup from me, but it is necessary that I drink it, let your will be done.”
Then he came back and found them asleep, for sleep had weighed down their eyes.
He left them and went to pray for the third time, and said the same words he had said before.
Then he came again and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man shall be delivered into the hands of sinners.
Let us go. Behold, the man that betrayed me is at hand.
While he was still speaking, one of the twelve, named Judah Iscariot, with a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, which they had sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people, appeared.
The traitor had given them a sign and said: “Whoever I embrace is the man you are looking for, so arrest him.”
Then came near unto him, and said, “Greeting, Master!” and kissed him.
Then Jesus said to him, “Friend, do whatever you came for.” At this, those who were close to him and were holding Jesus’ hand and leading him on and pressing him, seized him.
One of those who stood by Jesus put out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his ear.
Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.
Do you not realize that I can call upon the Father, and he will send me more than twelve legions of angels at once?
But if you do, how will you verify the books that announced that these things would happen so?
At that moment Jesus said to the crowd: “Did you come out with swords and clubs as if you were against a thief? I sat every day in the temple to teach, and you did not arrest me!
But this happened in order that what was written by the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him and fled! Jesus before the Jewish leaders
After that, those who had arrested him led him to the house of Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders were assembled.
But Peter followed him from afar, and went into the court of the chief priest, and sat with the servants, to see what would be done.
The chief priests and all the council were looking for false testimony against Jesus that they might kill him.
But they did not find him, although many false witnesses came forward and lied about him. Finally, two men came forward,
They said, “This is the man, #this is the man. 61:26, Jesus, for his enemies avoided speaking his name! He said, ‘I can destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.’”
The high priest stood up and said: “Are you not going to defend yourself against all the accusations these two men are making against you?”
But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest said to him, “I adjure you by the living God to tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.”
Jesus answered him, “Yes, I am, as I said. And I tell you that from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the power of God, and coming on the clouds of heaven.”
Then the high priest rent his clothes and said, “He has blasphemed God! What further witnesses do we need? Now you have heard his blasphemy.”
“So what do you say?” they asked. “He deserves death.”
Then they spat in his face, punched him and slapped him.
And they said to him, “Speak to us, Lord, who struck you?” Peter denies Jesus
Meanwhile Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A servant of the high priest came in and said to him, “You too were with Jesus the Galilean.”
But Peter denied it before them all, saying, “I do not know what you are talking about!”
Then he went out to the gate of the courtyard. And another servant said to those who were there, “This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.”
Peter denied it again, and made an oath, "I do not know this man."
Soon, those standing there came to him and said: “You are one of them, your accent reveals that you are from Gilan.”
Then he began to curse #he cursed. 74:26 He swore to himself by cursing, if he lied! He swore and said: “I do not know this man.” And immediately the cock crowed.
Then Peter remembered the word of Jesus to him, “Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times,” and he went out and wept bitterly.
Jesus before the governor Pilate
On the next morning the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled, and made plans to put Jesus to death.
They beat him, they led him away and delivered him to the governor Pilate. Judas hangs himself
When Judas Iscariot, who had betrayed Jesus, saw that they were about to condemn Jesus to death, he was filled with remorse. He returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders.
And he said to them, “I have sinned by delivering up a righteous man to be killed in his place.” They said to him, “And what has this to do with us? You see to it yourself.”
Then Judas threw the money into the temple and left. He then went and hanged himself.
So the high priests took the coins and said, “It is not lawful to put this money into the treasury of the temple, for it is the price of a human life.”
They decided to buy the potter’s field to be a cemetery for strangers.
For this reason, the field is still known as the “Field of Blood” today.
And this is what God said through the prophet Jeremiah: “They took thirty pieces of silver, the price agreed upon by the sons of Israel.
And they bought him of the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me. #They bought … the Lord. 10:27 See the Book of Zechariah 11: 12-13, and the Book of Jeremiah 32: 6-9. Jesus before Pilate
And Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” Jesus said to him, “It is as you have said.”
And when the high priests and the elders were complaining to him, he said nothing.
Then Pilate said to him, “Do you not hear all these things which they charge against you?”
But Jesus gave Pilate no answer to any of the things charged against him. And Pilate was amazed when he heard him. Pilate failed to release Jesus
On Easter, the governor used to release a prisoner chosen by the people.
And there was a notorious prisoner, named Barabbas. #Barabbas. 16:27 or "Jesus Barabbas" as in some Greek versions.
When the people had gathered, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release for you: Jesus called Christ, or Barabbas?”
Then Pilate knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered Jesus to him.
While Pontius Pilate sat in judgment, his wife sent him a message, saying, “Do not put this innocent man to death. I have had a bad premonition about him all night.”
But the high priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for the release of Barabbas, and the death of Jesus.
The governor said: “Which of the two do you want me to release for you?” They said: “باراباس.”
Then Pilate asked them, “What shall I do with Jesus, who is called the Christ?” They all answered, “Let him be crucified!”
Then Pilate said to them, “What is his crime? But they shouted all the more, “Crucify him!”
When Pilate saw that it was of no use to make any further effort, and that chaos was starting to ensue, he took some water and washed his hands in the presence of the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of this man’s blood; see to it yourselves.”
Then all the people said, “His blood be on us and on our children.”
Then Pilate released Barabbas for them. And he condemned Jesus to be beaten with the rod and to be crucified. The soldiers mock Jesus
Then the governor’s soldiers led Jesus to the governor’s palace and gathered the entire guard around him.
They stripped him and dressed him in a crimson robe. #Dressed him … in the color. 28:27 or purple, in mockery of him, for that is the color of the king’s robe.
They made a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and in his right hand a reed, and they bowed before him, mocking, saying: “Long live the king of the Jews!”
Then they spat on him, took the cane from his hand, and started beating him on the head.
When they had mocked him, they took off his clothes and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to be crucified. Jesus on the cross
When they had come out, they found a man of Cyrene by name Simon; and they compelled him to carry his cross.
And when they came to a place that was known as the “place of the skull,”
They gave him wine mixed with gall to drink. When he had tasted it, he would not drink.
When they had crucified Jesus, they divided his garments among them, casting lots for them.
Then they sat there guarding him.
They hung over his head a signboard on which was written: “This is Jesus, the King of the Jews,” as his accusation.
Two criminals were crucified with Jesus, one on his right and one on his left.
The Maronite cursed him and shook their heads
And they say: “You who will destroy the temple and build it in three days, if you are the Son of God, save yourself, and get down from the cross!”
And he also mocked the high priests, the scribes and the elders, and said to them:
“He has saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the King of the Children of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now so that we can believe in him!”
He put his trust in God, so let God save him now if He really wants to. Didn’t he say: ‘I am the son of God’?
So did the two criminals crucified with him, who were insulting him in similar words. Death of Jesus
From 12:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. darkness covered the entire earth.
At about three o'clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Eli, Eli, why hast thou forsaken me?” #Eli … hast thou forsaken me. 46:27 From Psalm 22: 1. That is, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?”
When some of those who were standing there heard it, they said, "He is calling Elijah!" #He is calling Elijah. 47:27 The word "Elijah" in Hebrew and "Eilu" in Aramaic, is similar to the name "Elijah" which is the name of a known prophet who lived around 850 BC.
Then one of those present hastened, took a sponge, dipped it in vinegar, put it on a long reed, and presented it to him to drink.
The rest said, “Let’s wait and see if Elijah will come and save him!”
Then Jesus again cried out with a loud voice, and yielded up the ghost.
The curtain of the #curtain_of_the_sanctuary split in two from top to bottom, and the earth quaked, and the rocks split.
The graves were opened, and the bodies of many holy believers who had died were raised.
And when Jesus had risen, the bodies were taken out of the tombs, and entered the holy city, and appeared to many.
As for the Roman officer, #RomanOfficer. 54:27 literally “Captain of a hundred.” The guards who were guarding the body of Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the other things that happened, were greatly afraid and said: “Truly this was the Son of God!”
And there were women standing afar off: for they had followed him from Galilee to follow and serve him.
Among them were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the twins. #The twins. 56:27 James and John. The burial of Jesus
And when evening came, a rich man named Joseph from the town of Arimathea, who was also a disciple of Jesus,
Then he went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
So Joseph took the body and wrapped it in new linen,
Then he put him in his new grave that he had dug in the rock, then he rolled a huge stone on the entrance of the grave and went away.
And Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting opposite the tomb. The guard of Jesus’ tomb
And the next day, being the day after the sabbath, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together with Pilate,
They said to him, “Master, we remember that this deceiver said before he died, ‘I will rise from the dead in three days.’”
So he commanded that the tomb be guarded until the third day, lest his disciples come and steal the body and say to the people, ‘He has been raised from the dead.’ This delusion would be worse than the first.”
Then Pilate said to them, “Take some soldiers and go, make sure you examine everything carefully.”
They went and sealed the tomb. They put a stone on the door and appointed soldiers as guardians over it.
The Resurrection of Jesus
And on the first day of the week, on the day after the Sabbath, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.
At that moment, a strong earthquake occurred, for the angel of the Lord came down from heaven, went to the tomb, rolled away the stone from the door, and sat on it.
He looked bright as lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so afraid of him that they became like dead people.
And the angel said to the two women, “Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus the crucified.”
He is not here, for he is risen from the dead, as he said would happen. Come, see the place where he lay.
Then go quickly to his disciples and say to them: “He has risen from the dead and will go before you to Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.”
Then the two women left the tomb quickly, their fear mingled with great joy, and ran to tell the disciples of Jesus what had happened.
And suddenly they met Jesus, and he said to them, “Peace be to you.” They came to him and took hold of his feet and prostrated themselves at his feet.
Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me.” False report
While the two women were on their way, some of the guards went to the city and told the High Priests everything that had happened.
The high priests met with the elders, and they consulted together, and they gave the soldiers much money,
And they said to them, “Tell the people that the disciples of Jesus came by night and stole him from the tomb while we were sleeping.”
If the news reaches the governor, we will convince him and keep you safe.
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. And this story has been told among the Jews until today. Jesus speaking to his disciples
The eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had told them to go to.
And when they saw him, they worshipped him, but some of them had doubts.
Jesus went on and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
So go, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
And teach them to obey all that I have commanded you. Remember that I will be with you always, to the end of the age.”
John the Baptist
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus the Christ, the Son of God.
As it is written in the book of the prophet Isaiah: “Behold, I will send my messenger before your face, who shall prepare your way before you.”
«A voice of one calling: ‘In the wilderness prepare the way for the Lord; make straight in the desert a highway for our God.’»
John the Baptist came to baptize in the wilderness, and he was demanding that people be baptized as a sign of their repentance for their sins.
And all the inhabitants of the villages of the region of Judaea and of Jerusalem came to him, and he was baptising them in the Jordan, confessing their sins.
His clothes were made of camel hair, and he wore a leather belt around his waist. He ate grasshoppers and wild honey.
And he would say, “A greater man than I will come after me, and I am not worthy to untie the strap of his shoe.”
I am your baptism in water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit. Jesus’ baptism
In those days, Jesus came from the town of Nazareth, in the region of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
As soon as he came out of the water, he saw the heaven opened, and the Spirit of God descending on him like a dove.
And a voice came from heaven: “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.” The Temptation of Jesus
And Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness.
He remained there for forty days, in the face of the devil’s temptations. He was with wild animals, and the angels were serving him. Jesus chooses some of his disciples
After John had been arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, and declared the good news of God.
And he says: “The time has come, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe the gospel.”
While he was walking on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of people.”
They left their nets at once and followed him.
Then he walked on a little, and saw James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John, who were in their boat mending their nets.
Jesus called them, and they left their father Zеведeus in the boat with the hired men and followed him. Jesus casts out a demon
Then they went to Capernaum. On the sabbath day Jesus went into the synagogue and taught.
They were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes of the law.
And in the congregation there was a man with an unclean spirit. And the unclean spirit cried out
«What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are, you are God’s holy one.»
Jesus rebuked him and said, “Shut up and get out of him!”
Then the unclean spirit seized the man and threw him into convulsions, and he screamed loudly and came out of him.
Everyone was astonished and began to say to one another, “What is this new teaching? It commands unclean spirits, and they obey it.”
And the news about him spread quickly throughout the whole region of Galilee. Jesus heals many
Then they left the assembly and went with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simeon’s mother-in-law lay in bed with a fever. They told Jesus about her,
He came closer to her, took her hand and sat her down. The fever left her and she started to serve them.
And in the evening, at sunset, they brought to him many that were sick and possessed with devils.
The inhabitants of the city all gathered at the gate of the house.
Jesus healed many who were sick with various diseases and cast out many demons. But Jesus did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Preparation for the Proclamation
In the early morning, before dawn, Jesus got up and went to a solitary place to pray.
So Simon and those with him went out to look for him.
And when they found him, they said to him, “Everyone is looking for you!”
Jesus answered them, “Let us go into the nearby villages, so that I may preach there also, for that is why I came.”
He went throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and casting out devils. And the leper was cleansed.
A leper came to Jesus, falling on his knees and imploring him, “If you are willing, you can make me clean.”
Jesus opened his eyes, reached out his hand and touched him, saying: “I do want it, so be clean.”
The lizard left the man, and he became clean.
Then Jesus warned him sternly, and sent him away.
And he said to him, “Do not tell anyone what has happened to you, but go and show yourself to the priest, #Go … to the priest. 44:1 The priest was the one who decided according to the law when a leper was considered clean. And present an offering for your cleansing as Moses commanded, #What Moses commanded. 44:1 See Leviticus 14: 1-32. so that the people may know that you have been healed.”
But the man went and began to spread the news of his healing throughout the whole region, so that it was no longer possible for Jesus to enter any town openly, but he had to stay in remote areas, and people came to him from everywhere.
Jesus Heals the Paralysed Man
And after several days, Jesus returned to Capernaum, and the news of him returned spread.
So many people gathered that there was no more room, not even outside the door. And Jesus was speaking the word of God.
They brought to him a cripple, carried by four.
But they could not bring him to Jesus because of the crowd. So they opened up the roof above Jesus’ location and made an opening. They then lowered the bed the paralytic was lying on.
When he saw their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven.”
And some of the teachers of the sharia were sitting there, and they were thinking to themselves:
«Why does this man speak in this way? He is insulting God with his words! Who besides God alone can forgive sins?»
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them: “Why are you thinking this in your hearts?
Which is easier to say: “Your sins are forgiven” or “Get up and carry your bed and walk”?
But I will show you something even more remarkable than that: the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.” And he said to the paralytic,
“I tell you, get up and carry your bed and go home!”
He got up at once and carried his bed away, while everyone watched. Greatly amazed they praised God and said, “We have never seen anything like this!” Matthew follows Jesus
And Jesus went again to the lake. He was teaching the crowds that had followed him there.
While he was walking, Levi saw a man sitting at the tax collection point. He said to him, “Follow me!” He got up and followed him.
While Jesus was at the house of Levi, eating dinner, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples. For many were there when Jesus called Levi, and they followed Jesus.
When the Pharisees and the teachers of the law saw him eating with the tax collectors and the sinners, they asked his disciples: “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
When he heard this, Jesus said to them, “Those who are well do not need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous to life, but the sinners.” Question about fasting
And it happened that the time of their fasting was at hand, and some came to Jesus and asked him, “Why do the disciples of John and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?”
Jesus said to them, “Can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.”
But the time will come when the bridegroom is taken from them, and then they will fast.
No one puts a new piece of cloth on an old garment, because the new piece of cloth will shrink and tear the old garment, and the hole will get worse.
“No one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the wine will burst the skins and spill, and the skins will be torn. But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.” Jesus: Lord of the Sabbath
On one of those Saturdays, as He was walking through the fields, His disciples began to pick the ears of corn.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, “See! Your disciples are doing what is not permitted to be done on the Sabbath!”
He said to them, “Did you not read in the Book what David did when he and those with him were in need and hungry?”
He entered the house of God in the time of the priest Abiathar, and ate the loaves of bread that were offered unto God; and he gave also to them that were with him. Nevertheless it was not lawful for him to eat of them, but only for the priests. #26:2 See 1 Samuel 21: 1-6.
Then Jesus said to them, “The Son of Man has come to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”
And the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.
Jesus Heals on the Sabbath
And Jesus went again into the synagogue, and there was a man whose hand was withered.
Some people watched him closely to see if he would be cured, and they found a reason to accuse him.
He said to the man with the paralyzed hand: “Get up and come!”
Then he said to them: “Is it permitted to do good or to do evil on the Sabbath? Is it permitted to save a life or to kill?” And they were silent.
And looking around at them with anger, he was sad at their hardness of heart; and he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and it was restored, like the other.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus. Many were following Jesus
Jesus went with his disciples to the Sea of Galilee, and a large crowd from Galilee and from Judaea followed him.
And from Jerusalem, Adumim, and the East of the Jordan, and the surrounding areas of Sur and Sidon, they came in great numbers. All of them had come to him because of what they had heard of his works.
Jesus asked his disciples to get a boat so that the crowds would not bother him.
Since Jesus had healed many, everyone who was sick tried to get to him and touch him.
Unclean spirits would fall at his feet and cry: “You are the Son of God!”
He warns her strongly not to reveal who he is. The choice of the twelve
Then Jesus went up on the mountain, and called to him those whom he wanted, and they went to him.
And Jesus chose twelve men and named them apostles, to be with him and to send them out to different places.
And he gives them a wand to drive out the evil spirits.
They: Simon, whom Peter called,
James and his brother John, whom Jesus called Boanerges—that is, “sons of thunder”—
Andrews, Phillips, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot. 18:3 From an Aramaic word meaning “zealous.” That is, a member of a Jewish political party that resisted Roman rule, called the Zealots.
And Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. The power of Jesus from God and Jesus returned to the house.
People gathered again around him and his disciples so much so that they found no time to eat.
And when Jesus’ family heard of it, they went to take him away, for the people said he was mad!
The teachers of the law who came from Jerusalem said, “He has Beelzebul, #Beelzebul. 22:3 One of the names of the devil. He calls on the spirits of the dead and by the power of the chief of the demons expels demons.”
So Jesus called them and spoke to them in parables: “How can the devil drive out the devil?
For if a kingdom is divided and its people fight, it will not last.
And if a house is divided against itself, it will not stand.
