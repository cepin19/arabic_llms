And Judah begat Pharez and Zarah of Tamar. Pharez begat Hezron. And Hezron begat Aram.
And Aram begat Aminadab. And Aminadab begat Nahshon. And Nahshon begat Salmon.
And Salmon fathered Boaz of Rahab. And Boaz fathered Obed of Ruth. And Obed fathered Jesse.
And the son of David the king, and the son of Solomon to whom Uri the Hittite was father.
And Solomon the son of David. And David the son of Jesse.
And Asa was the son of Uzziah. Uzziah was the son of Joram. Joram was the son of Ahab.
And Uzziah fathered Jotham. Jotham fathered Ahaz. And Ahaz fathered Hezekiah.
And Hezekiah begat Manasseh. And Manasseh begat Amon. And Amon begat Josiah.
Yushia, son of Kenia, and his brothers were taken captive to Babylon.
And after the captivity of Babylon, Sheshai was born to Zerechiah. And Zerechiah was born to Abihail.
Zerah was the son of Pharez. Pharez was the son of Hezron. Hezron was the son of Perez.
Azor son of Sadoc. Sadoc son of Akim. Akim son of Eliod.
And Eliyahu was the son of Eliezer. And Eliezer was the son of Matthan. And Matthan was the son of Jacob.
And Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
For there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, and fourteen from David to the captivity in Babylon, and fourteen from the captivity in Babylon to the Christ. The birth of Jesus Christ
The birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: when Mary, his mother, was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit.
Joseph, her husband, was a good man, but he didn’t want to make a scene, so he wanted to leave her secretly.
But while he was considering these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to yourself Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
“And she will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.”
And all this was, so that what was said by the Lord to the prophet might be fulfilled:
“Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel”, which is to say: “God with us”.
When Joseph awoke from his sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him; and he took his wife.
And he knew her until the birth of her firstborn son. And he called his name Jesus.
The Visit of the Magi
And when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of King Herod, behold, magi from the east came to Jerusalem
They say: “Where is the child, the king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east and have come to worship him.”
When King Herod heard this, he and all Jerusalem were greatly troubled.
So he gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people and asked them, “Where is the Christ born?”
They said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judah, for thus it is written by the prophet:
And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are by no means the least among the rulers of Judah, for out of you shall come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.
Then Herod privately summoned the wise men and learned from them the exact time of the star that had appeared.
Then he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, tell me that I may also go and worship him.
When they heard the king, they went away. And there was the star that they had seen in the east going before them, until it came and stood over where the young child was.
When they saw the star, they were very much delighted.
And they came to the house; and they saw the child with Mary his mother. And they fell down and worshipped him; and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold and incense and myrrh.
Then it was revealed to them in a dream not to return to Herod, and they departed to their own country. Flight to Egypt
And when they had departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, “Arise, take the young man and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be there until I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.”
He got up, took the boy and his mother at night and went to Egypt.
And there was until the death of Herod, in order to be fulfilled what was said by the Lord through the prophet who said: “From Egypt I called my son.”
Then Herod, when he saw that the wise men had mocked him, was exceedingly angry; and he sent and slew all the young children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men.
Then was done what was said by the prophet Jeremiah, who said:
«A voice was heard in the wilderness, the voice of one crying. Bereavement and mourning, wailing and sorrow. Rachel weeps for her children; she desires no comfort, for they are no more». Return to Nazareth
When Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream in Egypt
“Arise, take the boy and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the boy’s life are dead.”
He got up, took the boy and his mother and came to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus ruled over Judea instead of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And he was divinely inspired in a dream to go to the district of Galilee.
And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarenes.
John the Baptist Prepares the Way
In those days came John the Baptist and preached in the wilderness of Judea.
“Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”
This is what is said of him in the Book of Isaiah, the prophet who said: “A voice cries out in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.”
And this John wore a garment of camel’s hair, and a leather girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.
Then came to him Jerusalem with all the Jews throughout all the region that lay beyond the Jordan,
And they were confirmed in Jordan, acknowledging their sins.
When many of the Pharisees and Sadducees came to his baptism, they said to him, “Teacher, we are descending from John to you!”
Make fruits befitting for repentance.
And do not think that you can say, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you that out of these stones God is able to raise up children for Abraham.
Now the axe has been laid to the root of the tree; every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who comes after me is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to carry his shoes. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
“He who sows in the summer shall have a double harvest. He who treads in the spring shall have a good harvest; but he who sows in the autumn shall have only a poor harvest, even if he treads as in the other seasons.” The baptism of Jesus Christ
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.
But John stopped him, saying: “I need to be baptized by you, and are you coming to me?”
Jesus answered and said to him, “Allow it now, for in this manner it is right for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he allowed him.
When Jesus was baptized, he came up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming upon him.
And a voice came from heaven, saying, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”
Jesus Confronts Temptation
Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit in the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
After fasting for forty days and forty nights, he finally got hungry.
The sorcerer came to him and said: “If you are the son of God, say that these stones become bread.”
He answered and said: “It is written: ‘Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”
Then Satan took him to the holy city, and set him on the edge of the temple,
And he said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written that he commands the angels concerning you, and they will bear you up in their hands, lest you strike your foot against a stone.”
Jesus said to him: “It is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’”
Then Satan also took him to a very high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory,
And he said to him, “I will give you all this if you get down on your knees and worship me.”
Then Jesus said to him, “Get out of me, Satan! For it is written, ‘Worship the Lord your God, and serve only him.’”
Then Satan left him, and lo, angels came and ministered unto him. The beginning of his ministry in Galilee
When Jesus heard that John had been imprisoned, he withdrew to Galilee.
And he left Nazareth and came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the borders of Zabulon and Naphtali;
So that what is said by the prophet Isaiah may be fulfilled:
The land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, and the path of the sea, beyond Jordan, the land of the Gentiles.
“The people who were sitting in the darkness saw a great light, and the people who were sitting in the circle of death and its shadows a light has shone upon them.”
From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” The First Call of the Disciples
As Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers: Simon, who was called Peter, and Andrew, his brother. They were casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
He said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.”
They left the net and followed him.
Then he went on and saw two other brothers, James and John, the sons of Zebedee, in the boat with their father Zebedee mending their nets, and he called them.
They left the ship and their father, and followed him. Jesus teaches and heals the sick
And Jesus was going through all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every weakness in the people.
His fame spread throughout Syria. So they brought to him all the sick with various diseases and pains, and the mad and the convulsed and the paralyzed, and he healed them.
And great multitudes followed him from Galilee and the Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and beyond the Jordan.
The Sermon on the Mount - The Beatitudes
And when the crowds saw it, they went up on the mountain; and when he sat down, his disciples came to him.
He opened his mouth and taught them.
“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who are hungry and thirsty for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall be merciful.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are you when they revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you, lying because of me.
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you. Salt of the earth and light of the world
“You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has become tasteless, with what can it be seasoned? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trodden under foot by people.”
You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden,
They do not light a lamp and put it under a measure, but on a lampstand it gives light to all who are in the house.
Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. The Fulfilment of the Law
“Do not think that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets. I have not come to destroy but to fulfill.”
I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth pass away, not one tittle, not one stroke, will pass from the law until all is accomplished.
Whoever breaks one of these least commandments and teaches people so, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever does and teaches, that will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
I say to you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
“You have heard that it was said, ‘Do not commit murder, and whoever commits murder is subject to judgment.’
And I say to you: whoever is angry with his brother without cause shall be in danger of judgment; and whoever says to his brother: “Raca,” shall be in danger of the council; and whoever says: “You fool!” shall be in danger of hell fire.
If you present your offering at the altar, and there you remember that you have something against your brother,
Leave your offering before the altar, and go first and make peace with your brother, and then come and present your offering.
Be content with your opponent quickly as long as you are on the same road, lest the opponent hand you over to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the policeman, and you are imprisoned.
I tell you the truth: don’t leave there until you’ve paid the last penny! Adultery
“You have heard that it was said, ‘Do not commit adultery.’
But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman to lust for her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.
If the right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and cast it from you, for it is better for you that one of your members perishes and your whole body is cast into hell.
If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it from you, for it is better for you that one of your members perishes than your whole body be thrown into hell. Divorce
“And it was said: whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a letter of divorce.”
And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for unchastity, makes her an adulteress; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
“You have also heard that it was said to the people in former times: ‘Do not break your word; but keep your engagements to the Lord.’
And I say to you: Do not swear at all, not by heaven, for it is God’s throne,
And neither is he in the earth, because he walketh among his people.
And do not swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black.
But let your speech be: Yes, yes; no, no. Whatever is beyond that is of the evil one. Revenge
“You have heard that it was said: ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’
And I say to you: Do not resist evil, but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other also to him.
And whoever wants to sue you and take your coat, let him have the cloak also.
And whoever makes you laugh for one mile, go with him for two.
Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone wants to borrow from you, do not turn him away. Love your enemies
“You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’
But I say to you: Love your enemies. Bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully treat you and persecute you,
That you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.
For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do that?
And if you only greet your brothers, what good are you doing? Are not the tithers also doing this?
Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.
Charity
“Beware of making your righteousness before men, to be seen by them; otherwise you have no reward with your Father who is in heaven.”
When you make a charity, do not sound the trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the marketplaces and in the alleys, in order to be glorified by the people. I tell you the truth: they have received their reward!
And when you do charity, then you do not know what your right hand has done with your left hand.
So that your deed may be secret. Your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. The prayer
«And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by men. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward.
And when you pray, go into your closet and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.
And when you come, do not repeat empty talk like the nations, for they think that by the multitude of their words they will be heard.
Do not be like them. For your Father knows what you need before you ask him.
“This is how you should pray: ‘Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.’”
Let Your kingdom come. Let Your will be done, on earth, as it is in heaven.
Our daily bread give us this day.
And forgive us our sins as we also forgive the sinners to us.
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.
For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
If you do not forgive people their trespasses, neither will your Father in heaven forgive your trespasses. Fasting
«When you fast, do not put on a sad expression like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces so that people will see that they are fasting. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward.
And you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,
So that you may not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who is in secret. For your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. Treasures in heaven
“Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal.
But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not dig and steal.
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
The lamp of the body is the eye; if therefore the eye be in you, your whole body will be full of light.
If your eye is evil, your whole body is full of darkness; and if the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
«No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money. God takes care of us.
“Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is life not worth more than food, and the body than clothes?
Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth much more than they?
And who of you, if he is attentive, can add to his stature an arm?
And why are you worried about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin.
But I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory was dressed like one of these.
If the grass of the field which is today and is thrown tomorrow in the furnace, God clothes it like this, is it not more reasonable that He clothes you, you of little faith?
Do not worry, saying, “What shall we eat?” or “What shall we drink?” or “What shall we wear?”
For such things do nations ask of their gods. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.
The Art of Blaming Others
“Do not judge, that you yourselves may not be judged,
For by the judgment by which you judge you will be judged, and by the measure by which you measure it will be measured to you.
Why do you notice the speck in your brother’s eye, but are not mindful of the log in your own eye?
Or how would you say to your brother: Let me take the splinters out of your eye, while there is a log in your eye?
You hypocrite, first get the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly how to take the speck out of your brother’s eye!
Do not give Jerusalem to the dogs, and do not throw your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet and turn and tear you to pieces. Ask, seek, knock
“Ask and it will be given you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.”
For whoever asks receives, and whoever seeks finds, and to whoever knocks it will be opened.
Can any of you, if his son asks for bread, give him a stone?
If he is asked by a fish, will he give it alive?
If you, being evil, know how to give your children good gifts, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!
Do to others whatever you would like them to do to you, for this is the law and the prophets. The Narrow Gate
“Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter by it!
How narrow the gate and how difficult the road that leads to life! Only a few find it! The tree and its fruit
“Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves!”
By their fruits you shall know them. Do they pick grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?
So every good tree bears good fruit, and a bad tree bears bad fruit;
A good tree cannot make bad fruit, nor a bad tree make good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
So you will know them by their fruits.
“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons, and in your name perform many deeds of power?’
Then I will say to them, ‘I never knew you! Depart from me, you workers of iniquity!’ The wise builders and the foolish builders
“Whoever hears these words of mine and acts on them, he is like a sensible man, who built his house on rock.”
The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against the house; yet it did not fall, because it was founded on the rock.
And whoever hears my words and does not act on them, is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
"The rain came down, the rivers came, the winds blew, and the house fell over. And it fell with a great crash!"
When Jesus had finished these sayings, the crowds were astonished at his teaching.
For he was teaching them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
The Healing of the Leper
And when he came down from the mountain, great crowds followed him.
And if the leper came and fell on his face and said: “Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.”
And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, “I want to, be clean!” And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
Jesus said to him, “See that you say nothing to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifice that Moses commanded, a testimony to them.” The faith of the centurion
And when Jesus came into Capernaum, a centurion came to him
And he says: “O Lord, my servant is paralyzed and in great pain in the house.”
Jesus said to him, “I am coming and will heal him.”
Then the captain answered and said, “Sir, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof; but say the word, and my servant shall be healed.
“For verily I am a man under authority. I have soldiers under my command. I say to one: Go! And he goes. To another: Come! And he comes. To my servant: Do this! And he does it.”
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him and said to those who were following him, “I tell you the truth, I have not found such great faith even in Israel!”
And I say to you: many will come from the east and the west, and will take their place with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven,
“And the children of the kingdom shall be cast into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”
Then Jesus said to the centurion, “Go, let it be done for you as you believed.” And he was healed at that very hour. Healing of Peter’s mother-in-law and others
And when Jesus came to Peter’s house, he saw Peter’s mother-in-law lying in a fever,
He touched her hand and the fever left her, so she got up and served them.
And when evening came, many who were crazy were brought to him, and he cast out the spirits by a word, and cured all the sick.
In order for what is said in the prophet Isaiah to come true: “He took our sicknesses and carried our diseases.” The price of dependency
And when Jesus saw such a great multitude about him, he commanded Peter to go a little apart into the sea.
A writer came forward and said, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”
Jesus said to him, “The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.”
And one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, let me go first and bury my father.”
Jesus said to him, “Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.”
And when he entered the ship, his disciples followed him.
And a great disturbance occurred in the sea until the waves covered the ship, and he was sleeping.
His disciples came forward and woke him, saying, “Lord, save us, for we are perishing!”
He said to them, “What makes you afraid, O you of little faith?” Then he stood up, rebuked the wind and the waves, and there was a great calm.
The people wondered, saying, “Who is this man? For even the winds and the sea obey him!” The casting out of devils
And when he came to the border of the land of the Gerasenes, two demoniacs coming out of the tombs met him, so full of madness that no one could pass that way.
And when they cried out, “What have we to do with thee, Jesus the Son of God? art thou come here before the time to afflict us?”
And there was a great company of swine feeding at a distance.
The devils asked him, saying, “If you can drive us out, let us go to the pigs.”
He said to them, “Go!” So they went and came to the pigsty, and the whole herd of pigs rushed down from the bank into the sea, and they died in the water.
The shepherds fled and went to the city, and told everything, and about the two madmen.
So the whole city went out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they asked him to leave their neighborhood.
Curing Paralysis
He entered the ship and passed by and came to his city.
And if a paralytic is brought to him lying on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven.”
And if some of the scribes had said to themselves: “This one is blaspheming!”
Now Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them, “Why are you thinking this in your hearts?
It is easier to say: "Your sins are forgiven", than to say: "Get up and walk"?
But that you may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins.” And he saith to the paralytic, “Rise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.”
He got up and went to his house.
When the crowds saw it, they were amazed and glorified God, who had given such authority to men. Matthew
As he went on his way, he saw a man sitting by the collection-box, and he said to him, “Follow me.” He got up and followed him.
While he was in the house, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat with Jesus and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
When he heard this, Jesus said to them, “Those who are well do not need a doctor but the sick.”
Go and learn what it is: “I desire mercy, not sacrifice, for I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.” The question about fasting
Then his disciples came to him, saying, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but your disciples do not fast?”
Jesus said to them, “Can the friends of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? But there will come a time when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast.”
No one puts a new piece of cloth on an old garment, for the new piece will take from the old, and the old will be torn apart.
They do not put new wine into old bottles, or else the bottles would burst. The wine would spill and the bottles would break. But they put new wine into new bottles, and so both are preserved.” The healing of the daughter of Jairus and the woman with the issue of blood
And while he was saying this to them, behold, the chief came, and bowed himself to him, saying, “My daughter is dead now, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.”
Then Jesus rose, and with him Peter and his disciples.
And a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the hem of his garment.
For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be made well.
Jesus looked around and saw her, and said, “Have faith, daughter. Your faith has made you well.” And at that moment she was made well.
And when Jesus came into the chief’s house, and beheld the noise of the multitude and the tumult,
He said to them, “Get out of the way, the children are not dead but asleep.” They laughed at him.
When he had dismissed the assembly, he took her by the hand, and she stood up.
And the news of it went throughout the whole of that land. Healing of the blind
As he went on his way, Jesus heard them calling out, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”
When he came to the house, blind men came to him, and he said to them, “Do you believe that I can do this?” They said to him, “Yes, Lord!”
Then he touched their eyes and said to them, “According to your faith let it be done to you.”
Their eyes were opened. Jesus rebuked them, saying, “Look, so that no one may know!”
But they went out and spread the word about it throughout all that land. The healing of the mute
As they were going out, another mute, mad man was brought to him.
When the devil was cast out, the dumb man spoke, and the crowd was amazed, saying, “Never has anything like this been seen in Israel!”
The Pharisees said, “By the prince of the demons he drives out the demons!” But few do the deeds.
And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every infirmity.
And when the crowds saw them, they were moved with compassion for them, for they were like sheep without a shepherd.
Then he said to his disciples: “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.
“Seek from the Lord of the harvest to send a worker to his harvest.”
Dispatch the twelve
Then he called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority over unclean spirits, so that they might cast them out and cure every disease and every weakness.
And these are the names of the twelve apostles: the first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew, his brother. James, the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother.
Phillips, and Bartholomew. Thomas, and Matthew the publican. James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, who was called Thaddeus.
Simon the Cananite, and Judas Iscariot who betrayed him.
These twelve Jesus sent out, and he gave them these instructions: “Go nowhere among the Gentiles or enter any Samaritan town.
But go, I say, to the sheepfold of the stray sheep of the house of Israel.
As ye go, preach, saying, It is nigh: the kingdom of heaven.
Heal the sick. Cleanse the lepers. Raise the dead. Drive out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.
Do not buy gold, silver, or copper in your regions,
And no road provider, nor two garments, nor shoes, nor staff, because the doer is due his food.
“And whatever town or village you enter, search its worthy members, and remain there until you have left.”
When you enter the house, greet it.
If the house is due, then let your peace come to it, but if it is not due, let your peace return to you.
And whoever does not accept you, nor listen to your words, so get out from that house or from that town, and shake off the dust of your feet.
The truth is to you: the day of judgment will be more likely for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that city.
«Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.
But beware of men, for they will deliver you up to councils, and in their synagogues they will scourge you.
And you will be witnesses for Me to the governors and kings, to them and to the nations.
When they deliver you, do not worry about what you should say or what you should say it. For you will be given in that hour what you should say.
For it is not you who are speaking, but your father’s spirit which speaks through you.
A brother will deliver his brother to death, and a father his son, and sons will rise against their parents and kill them.
You will be hated by all for my sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved.
And when they have driven you out of this city, flee to the other. I tell you the truth, you will not complete the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes.
«The pupil is not better than the master, nor the servant better than his master.
It is enough for the pupil to be like his teacher, and for the slave to be like his master. If they have called the Lord of the house Belzebub, how much more so his household!
Do not fear them. For what is hidden will not remain hidden, and what is secret will not remain secret.
Whatever you say in the dark, say it in the light; and whatever you hear in the ear, proclaim it on the housetops.
Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but after that they are not able to kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who is able to destroy both the soul and the body in the Fire.
Two sparrows are sold for a penny? And one of them does not fall to the ground without your father.
And you, even the number of your hairs is counted.
Don’t be afraid! You are better than many birds!
For whoever acknowledges me before men, I will also acknowledge him before my Father who is in heaven,
But whoever denies me before men, I will also deny before my Father who is in heaven.
“Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace but a sword.”
For I have come to set a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
And the enemies of man are his household.
Whoever loves a father or a mother more than me does not deserve me, and whoever loves a son or a daughter more than me does not deserve me,
And whoever does not take his cross and follow me does not deserve me.
Whoever found his life, he would lose it, and whoever lost his life for me, he would find it.
Whoever welcomes you welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.
Whoever accepts a prophet by the name of a prophet, he will receive the reward of a prophet, and whoever accepts an ar by the name of an ar, he will receive the reward of an ar.
“Whoever gives one of these little ones even a cold cup of water in the name of a disciple, I tell you the truth, such a one will never lose their reward.”
John the Baptist and Jesus
When Jesus had given his instruction to his twelve disciples, he went away from there to teach and to preach in their towns. Jesus and John the Baptist
But John, when he heard in the prison the works of Christ, sent two of his disciples,
And he said to him, “Are you the one who is to come, or are we to wait for another?”
Jesus answered him, “Go and tell John what you hear and see:
The blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor are blessed.
And blessed is he who is not offended in it.
While they were going out, Jesus began to say to the crowds about John, “What went you out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
But what did you go out to see? A man wearing soft clothes? Behold, the ones who wear soft clothes are in the houses of kings.
But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and one who is more than a prophet.
This is who it was written about: Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who shall prepare your way before you.
The truth is to you: Among those born of women, there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist, but in the kingdom of the heavens he who is the least is greater than him.
From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven is taken by force, and those who take it by force get it.
For all the prophets and the law up to John the Baptist prophesied.
And if you want to accept, this is the foreseen Elijah.
He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
«To whom does this generation resemble? It resembles boys sitting in the markets calling out to their companions.
And they say: We called upon you, but you did not dance! We came to you, but you did not strike!
For John came eating no bread and drinking no wine, and they say, There is a demon in him.
The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man that eateth and drinketh. And there was a certain
Then he began to rebuke the cities in which his greatest forces were made, because they did not repent:
Woe to you, Korzin! Woe to you, بيت صيدا! For if you had made the forces made in you in صور and صيدا, they would have long since been in the mud and ashes.
But I say to you that it is more probable for Tyre and Sidon to have the kingdom of God than for you.
And you, Kafr-Nahm, lifted up to heaven! You will be brought down to the pit. For if the forces made in you had been made in Sodom, they would have remained to this day.
But I say to you that the land of Sodom will have more likelihood on the day of judgment than she. Comfort to the weary
At that time Jesus answered and said, “I praise you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and have revealed them to little children.
Yes, O Father, for thus it has pleased the Lord to do.
Everything that was given to me by my father, and no one knows the son except the father, and no one knows the father except the son and whoever wants the son to reveal it to him.
Come to me all you who are weary and heavy laden, and I will refresh you.
Bear my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am meek and humble of heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
“Because Nery is fine and my pregnancy is light.”
Lord of the Sabbath
At that time, Jesus went out on the sabbath day through the grain fields, and his disciples were hungry and began to pluck the heads of grain and eat.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, “Behold, your disciples are doing what is not permitted to be done on the Sabbath!”
He said to them: “Have you not read what David did when he and those with him were hungry?”
How did he enter the house of God and eat the showbread which was not to be eaten by him or by those with him, but only by the priests?
Or have you not read in the Torah that the priests in the sanctuary defile the Sabbath, and are blameless?
But I say to you that here is something greater than the temple!
If you knew what it is: I want mercy, not sacrifice, you would not condemn the innocent!
“For the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.”
Then he left from there and came to their assembly,
And if a man’s hand is withered, they ask him, “Is the healing of the spot permitted?” so that they may accuse him.
He said to them, “Suppose one of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath. Will he not grab it and lift it out?”
Man is better than a sheep! If only good would happen in the spot!
Then he said to the man: “Stretch out your hand.” So he stretched it out, and it came back whole like the other one. The chosen boy of God
When the Pharisees went out, they plotted against him, that they might destroy him.
And Jesus learned and departed thence. And great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all.
And he recommended that they should not show it,
So that what is said by the prophet Isaiah may be fulfilled:
“Behold my servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved in whom I delight; I will put my spirit upon him and he will declare judgment to the nations.
He is neither quarreling nor shouting, and nobody hears his voice in the streets.
A broken reed will not be broken, and a smoldering wick will not be extinguished, until the truth comes out in victory.
And in his name shall be the hope of the nations. Jesus and Beelzebub
Then a madman who was blind and dumb came to him and he healed him, so that the blind and dumb man spoke and saw.
Then all the people were amazed, and said, “Is this the Son of David?”
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, “This drives out demons only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons.”
Now Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and a house divided against itself falls.
If the devil expels the devil, he has divided himself. How can his kingdom be established?
And if I, by Beelzebub, cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges!
But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you!
How can anyone enter the house of the strong and rob his goods, if he does not first bind the strong, and then rob his house?
Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.
Therefore I say to you, all sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
And whoever said a word about the son of man will be forgiven, but whoever said a word about the holy spirit will not be forgiven, neither in this world nor in the next.
Make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad, for by its fruit the tree is known.
You sons of snakes! How can you speak well and be evil? For the mouth speaks from the abundance of the heart.
A good man from a good treasure in the heart brings forth good things, and an evil man from an evil treasure in the heart brings forth evil things.
But I say to you that everyone who speaks idly will have to give an account of it on the day of judgment.
“For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.”
Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered, saying, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.”
And he answered and said unto them, This generation seeketh a sign; and there shall not be given to it any sign but the sign of Jonah the prophet.
For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a great fish, so will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
The men of Nineveh shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and, behold, something greater than Jonah is here!
The queen of Sheba shall judge this generation and shall condemn it, because she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here!
If the evil spirit leaves the man, it goes through places where there is no water, it asks for rest but finds none.
Then he says: Return to my house from which you left. He comes and finds it empty, swept and decorated.
Then he goes and takes with him seven more wicked souls than himself, and they enter and settle there, so that the end of that man is more wicked than the beginning! So it will also be for this wicked generation.” Doing the will of God
And as he was talking with the crowd, his mother and his brothers stood outside, asking to speak with him.
One of them said to him, “Here is your mother and your brothers standing outside, seeking to speak with you.”
He answered and said to him who questioned him, “Who is my mother and who are my brothers?”
Then he stretched out his hand toward his disciples and said: “Behold, my mother and my brothers!
“For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven, that person is my brother and sister and mother.”
Like the farmer and his interpretation
On that day, Jesus went out from the house and sat down by the sea.
Many crowds gathered to him, so much so that he entered the boat and sat down. The whole crowd stood on the shore.
And he spoke to them much in parables, saying: “The sower went out to sow,
While he was planting, some fell on the way, and the birds ate them.
The last one fell on the bare ground, where there was not much soil, so it sprouted immediately since it did not have to grow deep into the ground.
But when the sun rose it burned, and since it had no root it dried up.
One fell on a thorn, the thorn pierced and strangled him.
And one fell on good ground and bore fruit, some a hundred, and some sixty, and some thirty.
"He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
The disciples came forward and said to him: “Why do you speak to them in parables?”
And he answered and said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven; but unto them it is not given.
He who has will be given to him and increased, and he who has not, what he has will be taken from him.
For this purpose I speak to them in parables, because they have a heart that is blind, and ears that are deaf, and they do not understand.
In them the prophecy of Isaiah has been fulfilled, which says: You hear with your ears and you see with your eyes, but you do not understand.
For the heart of this people has grown hard, and their ears have become dull to hearing. And they have closed their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn, and be healed.
But blessed are your eyes, because they see, and your ears, because they hear.
I tell you the truth: many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see and did not see it, and to hear what you hear and did not hear it.
“Listen to you all like the sower:
Whoever hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and takes away what was sown in his heart. This is what was sown on the road.
And the seed sown in the rocky places is which hears the word and at once accepts it with joy,
But it has no origin in itself, but is only temporary. If there is any difficulty or persecution for the word, he will immediately stumble.
And the seed sown among thorns is that which hears the word, and the care of the world and the deceit of riches choke the word, and it bears no fruit.
“The seed falling on good soil is the one that hears the word and understands it. This is the one who produces fruit, and yields a hundredfold, some sixtyfold, and some thirtyfold.”
He gave them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
While the people were asleep, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went away.
When the herb had shot up and borne fruit, then the thorns also came up.
Abid of the Lord of the house came and said to him: O master, is not a good crop what you have sown in your field? Where did the tares come from?
He said to them: An enemy man did this. The servants said to him: Do you want us to go and collect him?
He said: No! lest you take the wheat with the chaff while you are gathering it.
Their call is to grow together, and at the time of harvest I say to the harvesters: “First gather the weeds and tie them up in bundles to burn, but gather the wheat and bring it into my storehouse.” Like the mustard seed and like the yeast
He gave them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and planted in his field.
It is the smallest of all the seeds. But when it grows it is the largest of the peas, and it becomes a tree, so that the birds of the sky come and nest in its branches.
He said to them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a certain woman who took a pound of yeast and hid it in three measures of flour, till the whole was leavened.”
This is all what Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables, and without parables he did not speak to them,
In order to fulfill what was said by the Prophet who said: “I will open my mouth with parables, and I will speak of things kept hidden since the foundation of the world”. Interpretation of the parables of wheat and tares
Then Jesus dismissed the crowds and went to the house. His disciples came to him and said, “Explain to us the parables of the sower in the field.”
And he answered and said unto them, The farmer that tilled the ground is the Son of man.
The field is the world. The good seed are the children of the kingdom. The weeds are the children of the evil one.
The enemy that sowed it is Satan. The harvest is the passing away of the world. The harvesters are the angels.
As the chaff is gathered and burned with fire, so will it be at the destruction of this world:
The Son of man shall send his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them that commit iniquity;
And they cast them into the fire. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears, let them hear. The treasure, the pearl, the net
“The kingdom of heaven is also like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found. He hid it again, and for joy went and sold all that he had and bought that field.
Also the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain merchant man, which sought good pearls:
When he found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had and bought it.
Also the kingdom of heaven is like a net thrown into the sea, gathering fish of every kind.
When they were full, they brought them up to the shore, and sat down and gathered the horses into the vessels, and the poor they cast out.
Thus it will be at the end of the world: the angels will come out and separate the wicked from the righteous.
And they cast them into the fire. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
Jesus said to them: “Did you understand all this?” They said: “Yes, Lord.”
He said to them, “For this every learned writer in the kingdom of the heavens is like a master of a house who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.”
When Jesus had finished these parables, he went away from there. Nazareth rejects Jesus
And when he came to his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished and said, “Where did this man get this wisdom and these powers?”
Is not this the carpenter’s son? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brothers, James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
Are all his sisters with us? Where did he get all this?
They found him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and in his own house.”
And many forces were not made because they did not believe.
John the Baptist’s Beheading
At that time Herod the tetrarch heard about Jesus,
He said to his disciples: “Behold, John the Baptist has risen from the dead! For this reason the powers work in him.”
For Herod had seized and bound John and cast him into prison for the sake of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother.
For John was saying to him: “You must not have.”
And when he wanted to kill him, he feared the people, for they considered him a prophet.
Then, when the birthday of Herod was come, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst, and pleased Herod.
He then promised a section that whatever she asked, he would give it to her.
For she had learned from her mother, she said, “Give me here on a dish the head of John the Baptist.”
The king was grieved. But for the divisions and those who sat with him, he should be given.
So he sent and beheaded John in the prison.
He brought his head on a plate and gave it to the boys, and they brought it to his mother.
His disciples came, lifted up the body and buried it. Then they came and told Jesus. Feeding of the five thousand
When Jesus heard that they were taking their leave and were going into the country by ship for a place of solitude, he dismissed the crowds. The people came on foot from the towns and followed him.
When Jesus had come out, he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick.
When evening came, his disciples came to him, saying, “The place is deserted, and the hour is already late. Dismiss the crowds so that they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food.”
Jesus said to them, “They do not need to go away. Give them something to eat.”
They said to him, “We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish.”
He said: “Bring it to me here.”
He then ordered the crowds to recline on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, blessed, broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowds.
Everyone ate and was satisfied. Then they took up the rest in twelve baskets full.
The eaters were about five thousand men, excluding women and children. The miracle of walking on water
And straightaway Jesus required his disciples to get into the boat and to go before him into the other side, that he might send away the crowds.
After the crowd had dispersed, he went up the mountain alone to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.
And the ship was in the midst of the sea, tormented by the waves. For the wind was contrary.
In the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.
When they saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled and said, “It’s a ghost!” And they began to cry out in fear.
For a time they said nothing to him, for they were filled with fear. Then Jesus said to them, “Have courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.”
Peter answered him, “If you are the Christ, tell me to walk on the water.”
He said, “Come.” So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water to come to Jesus.
But when he saw the wind was too strong, he was afraid. And as he began to sink, he cried out, “Lord, save me!”
At once Jesus stretched out his hand and caught him, and said to him, “O of little faith, why did you doubt?”
And when they entered the ship, the wind ceased.
And those in the ship came and fell down before him, saying, “Truly, you are the Son of God!”
When they had crossed, they came to the land of Geshur.
The men knew that place. So they sent to all the surrounding region and brought all the sick to him.
They were only allowed to touch the hem of his garment. All who touched it were healed.
The Pure and the Impure
Then some scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem came to him.
«Why do your students exceed the شيوخ, for they do not wash their hands when they eat bread?»
And he answered and said to them, “You also, why do you break the commandment of God on account of your tradition?”
God has recommended: Honor your father and your mother, and whoever abuses a father or a mother, let him die the death.
And you say: Whosoever says to his father or his mother: ‘Surely you are the one who will benefit me from me.’ So he does not honor his father or his mother.
You have annulled the will of God because of your tradition!
Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy concerning you:
This people draw near to me with their mouth, and honor me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
And they worship Me in vain, while they teach the precepts of men.”
Then he called the assembly together and said to them: “Listen and understand.
“Not what enters the mouth defiles a man, but what comes out of the mouth defiles a man.”
Then his disciples came forward and said to him, “Do you realize that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?”
He answered and said: “Every tree that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.
Leave them. They are blind leaders of blind people. If a blind man leads a blind man, both of them will fall into a pit.
Peter answered him, “Explain to us this parable.”
And Jesus said to them, “Do you still not understand?
Don’t you understand yet that everything that goes into the mouth goes into the stomach and comes out of the anus?
And whatever comes out of the mouth comes from the heart, and that defiles a man.
For from the heart are these things: murder, adultery, fornication, theft, false witness, slander.
This is what defiles a person. But eating with unwashed hands does not defile a person.” The faith of the Canaanite woman
Then Jesus went out from there and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
And a Canaanite woman, coming from those fields, cried out to him, saying, “Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely ill.”
He did not answer her a word. His disciples came forward and asked him, “Send her away, for she is crying after us!”
He answered and said, “I have been sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”
She came and fell down before him, saying, “Lord, have mercy!”
He answered and said, “It is not right to take the bread of the children and cast it to the dogs.”
She said: “Yes, master! Even the dogs eat from the leftovers of their masters’ table!”
Then Jesus answered her, “O woman, great is your faith! Let it be done for you as you wish.” And her daughter was healed from that very hour. Feeding the four thousand
Then Jesus went on from there to the shore of the Sea of Galilee, and he went up on the mountain and sat there.
Many came to him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the mute, the paralyzed, and many others. They laid them at his feet, and he cured them.
Until the crowds were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the lame walking, the blind seeing, and the deaf hearing. And they glorified the God of Israel.
And Jesus called his disciples and said to them, “I have compassion on the crowd, for they have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away fasting, lest they faint on the way.”
His disciples said to him, “Where, in the wilderness, can we find enough bread to feed such a crowd?”
Jesus said to them, “How many loaves do you have?” They answered, “Seven, and a few small fish.”
Then he ordered the crowd to lie down on the ground,
And he took the seven loaves and the fish, and giving thanks he broke and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowds.
All ate and were satisfied. Then they took up the remainder in seven full baskets.
The eaters were four thousand men, except for women and children.
Then he turned the host around and went up on the ship and came to the borders of Magdel.
Aya request
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test him and asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
And he answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.
In the morning: today is winter because the sky is red with gloom. Hypocrites! You know how to distinguish the face of the sky, but you cannot recognize the signs of the times!
A wicked and corrupt generation asks for a sign, and yet no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.” And he left them and went away. The scribes and the Pharisees are the descendants of the devil.
And when his disciples came to the other side, they had forgotten to take any bread.
And He said to them, “Behold, be careful of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of the Sadducees.”
They thought to themselves, “We didn’t take any bread.”
Jesus knew in his heart and said to them, “O you of little faith, why are you talking among yourselves that you have no bread?”
Even now you don’t understand? And you don’t remember the five loaves and how many baskets you took?
And you took four thousand and some loaves of bread?
How do you not understand that I did not say to you to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees?
Then they understood that he had not said to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and the Sadducees. Peter’s confession of Christ
When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philip, he asked his disciples, “Who do the crowds say that I am?”
They said: “Some said: John the Baptist, and others Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”
He said to them, “And you, who do you say I am?”
Simon Peter answered him, “You are the Christ, the Son of God, the living God!”
Jesus answered him, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven.
And I say to you: You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.”
Then he recommended to his disciples that they should not tell anyone that he was Jesus the Messiah. Jesus announces his death and resurrection
From that time on, Jesus began to show to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.
Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, “Get away from me, Satan! You are a blight on me!”
He turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, for you pay attention not to what God wants, but to what people want.”
Then Jesus said to his disciples: “If anyone wishes to come after me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me.
Whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his own soul?
For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done.
“I tell you the truth, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”
The manifestation
And after six days Jesus took Peter, and James, and John his brother, and led them up into an high mountain by themselves.
His appearance changed before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light.
And if Moses and Elijah had appeared to them, talking with them.
So Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here! If you wish, we will make three shelters here: one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
And as he was speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my beloved Son, whom I am well pleased with; hear him."
When the pupils heard it, they fell on their faces and were very afraid.
And Jesus came and touched them, and said: “Get up, and do not be afraid.”
They raised their eyes and saw no one but Jesus alone.
As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, “Do not let anyone know what you have seen, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead.”
And his disciples asked him, saying, “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”
Jesus answered them, “In truth, I say to you, there is no one who is first except Elijah.
But I say to you that Elijah has come and they did not know him, but did to him all that they wished. So also the Son of Man will suffer from them.
Then the disciples understood that he had told them about John the Baptist. A demon-possessed boy
And when they came to the assembly, he went in to him on his knees.
And he said: “O my Lord! Have mercy on my son, for he is seized with convulsions and suffers severe pain, and he falls into the fire and into the water.”
And I brought him to your disciples, and they could not heal him.
Jesus answered and said, “You hypocrites, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring him here to me!”
Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out of the boy. And at that moment the boy was cured.
Then the disciples came forward one by one and said to Jesus, “Why were we unable to cast it out?”
Jesus said to them, “Because of your lack of faith. I tell you the truth, if you have faith as small as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.”
“This kind of sex is only permitted by prayer and fasting.”
While they were still going along and talking together, Jesus went on ahead.
So they kill him, and on the third day he rises again. They were very sad. The tax on the temple
And when they came to Capernaum, those who collected the two drachmas came to Peter and said, “Doesn’t your teacher pay the two drachmas?”
He said: “Yes.” When he entered the house, Jesus preceded him, saying: “What do you think, Simon? From whom do the rulers of the earth take toll or tribute? From their own children or from the foreigners?”
Peter said to him, “I am a foreigner.” Jesus said to him, “If the sons are free, then the father is also free.”
