And Judah begat Phares and Zarah of Tamar. And Phares begat Hezron. And Hezron begat Aram.
And Aram begat Enoch, and Enoch begat Irad, and Irad begat Methuselah.

And Asa begat Joram. And Joram begat Uzziah.
And he begat Uzziah: and Uzziah begat Jotham. And Jotham begat Ahaz. And Ahaz begat Hezekiah.
And Hezekiah got Manasseh. And Manasseh got Amon. And Amon got Josiah.

He was still thinking about the story, when an angel from God appeared to him in his dream and said: "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife. She is pregnant by the Holy Spirit.
And when you have a child, you will call him Jesus, so that he may save his people from their sins.

# 7:14 A girl conceives and bears a son, and names him Immanuel (which means, "God with us")
And when Utbah, يوسف (Joseph), awoke from his sleep, he did what the angel who came from God had told him, and went to his wife in his house.
But he didn’t sleep with her until she gave birth to the child, and he called him Jesus.
The Rule of the Wise
At the time of the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem in the region of Judea, during the reign of King Herod, a group of wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
And they said: “Which Jewish king was born? We saw his star appear in the east, and we have come to worship him.”
And when King Herod heard this, he and all Jerusalem were troubled.
Why were the high priests and scribes the Jews' property and why did they ask about the place where the Christ would be born?
Answer them: “In Bethlehem that is in the region of Judah, for this is what the prophet has written in the book:
# Mi ‏5‏:2 And you, Bethlehem in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah, because out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.
But Herod wept to the wise men without hearing anyone and he kept them until the time when the star appeared.
And he sent them to Bethlehem and said to them: “Go and look for the child. And when you find him, come and tell me so that I may go and worship him.”
After they heard the king’s words, they went. And when they were on the way, they saw the star that they had seen before in the East moving in front of them until it reached and stopped above the place where the child was.
And when they saw the star they were very happy,
And they entered the house and found the child with Mary his mother. And they fell down to him and worshipped him; and they opened their treasures to him and presented unto him gifts and incense and gold.
And God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod, so they took another route and went to their own country. The flight to Egypt

Let your light shine like this in the sight of men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.”
“What you think, I came here to reject the law and the prophets, I did not come here to reject them, but to complete them.

Put your offering in front of the altar and go first make peace with your brother, and then come back and present your offering.

You have to be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.
Charity
«Be careful to do good in front of people so that they can see you, for you have no reward with your Father in heaven.
When you give to one, do not call out with a trumpet as the hypocrites do in the assemblies and in the streets so that people thank them. I will tell you the truth: they have received their wages.
But you, when you believe, don’t let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.

And when you pray, don't keep repeating empty words as other nations do; they repeat much, but God only understands little.
Don’t be like that, because you know what you need before you ask for it.
Or else pray like this: Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
Let your kingdom come, let your will be, on earth as it is in heaven.
Every day we give our daily bread to those in need.
Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who wrong us.
We didn’t put them to the test, and we escaped from evil.
And if they forgive people for their mistakes, your Lord in the heavens will forgive your sins.
“But if people do not forgive your faults, neither will He who is in heaven forgive your sins.” Fasting
«And fast as you, do not show your grief on your faces like the hypocrites, who hide their faces so as to show to the people who fast what they do not see in them. I tell you the truth: they have received their reward.

«No one can serve two masters, either you hate one and love the other, or you follow one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.
Otherwise, I will tell you not to worry about your lives, what you will eat or drink, or what you will wear. My brother, is life not better than food and clothing?
See how the birds in the sky do not sow or reap or store in granaries, and how your Lord provides for them in the sky. Do you not find that you are much better than they?
Who among you thinks he can add one more hour to his life?
And why are you worried about the dress? Save the black stockings of Bougaroon how to grow: it doesn’t tire and it doesn’t spin.
But I tell you: even King Solomon in all his glory did not dress like one of them!
If God dresses cannabis like this, why today cannabis grows and tomorrow it will be thrown in the oven’s fire, then you are the ones who should be dressed by the one who has weak faith!
That's why don't you think and say: what are we going to eat? Or what are we going to drink? Or what are we going to wear?
These are all the needs that people who are not believers go through, and your Lord in the heavens knows what you need.
But you first saw the kingdom of God and its righteousness, and then these things were added to you.
That's why you shouldn't worry about tomorrow, it's tomorrow that will worry about itself. Every day is enough for its own evil.
Do not judge others (Luke 6:37-38, 41-42)

Why do you see the straw in your brother's eye, but you don't wake up to the plank in your own eye?

For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks the door will be opened. (Luke 11:9-13)

It rained, and floods came, and the wind blew on that house, and it fell, and nothing of it remained.

I have a man, I have a wife, I have an army to command. If I say to someone "Go!" he goes. If I say to someone "Come!" he comes. And to my servant I say "Do this!" and he does it.

# 6:6 Get up and learn what this verse means: “We love mercy, not sacrifice.” And I have come to call on the guilty, not the righteous.” Fasting (Mark 2:18-22; Luke 5:33-39)
Some of his disciples said to him, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but your disciples do not?”
Jesus said to them, «My friends, the guests at the wedding feast may weep, while the bridegroom is still with them. The day will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast.
There is no one who repairs an old dress with new cloth, because the cloth is going to drink and eat the money of the old dress and the piece will be bigger.
And there is not one who puts new wine into old wineskins, for the new wine would burst the old wineskins and spill the wine and the wineskins would be torn. But the new wine is put into new wineskins and both are preserved. The little girl, حياء (Hayya), and the woman who was healed of her leprosy (Mark 5:21-43; Luke 8:40-56)
As Jesus was saying these things, one of the leaders of the Jews came, knelt before him, and said, "My daughter has just died. Come and put your hand on her, and she will live."
And Jesus went about, and followed him and his disciples.
And there was a woman who had been bleeding for two years, came from behind and touched the edge of his cloak.
For her sake she said in her heart: “It was a good thing that نمسلو دبشو برك تو نتشفى.”
Jesus’ house and his disciples told her: “Have faith, my daughter, your faith has made you well.” And at that very moment the woman was made well.
And when Jesus came to the house of the chief of the Pharisees, and ate bread with them, they watched him.
He said: «Get out! The building didn’t die, it’s just sleeping.»
And when the people came out, he entered and took the woman by the hand, my brother, she stood up.
And the news of this thing is spread in that whole area. Jesus heals two blind men
As he went on his way, Jesus came to a man who was blind. His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”
When he entered the house, two blind men came to him. Jesus said to them: "Men, what do you want me to do for you?" They said to him: "Yes, Lord!"
But Jesus turned and said to them, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.”
And their eyes were opened. And Jesus warned them, “Beware that no one knows!”
But they went out and spread the news in that whole region. Jesus heals a man of Caanan
And when the two blind men came out, there was a group of people who brought one blind man, a resident of Satan.
Jesus drove out the demon, and the paralytic rose and spoke. My brothers, they were amazed, and said, “We have not seen anything like this in Israel!”
But the Pharisees said, “He casts out devils through the chief of the devils.” Jesus has compassion on the people
And Jesus went about in all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God, and healing every disease and every sickness.
When he saw that people were worried and tired, like sheep that have no shepherd.
And he said to his disciples: “The work is great, but the labor is light.”
“Otherwise, ask the master of the well to send workers to his well.”
The fourth gospel (Mark 3:13-19; Luke 6:12-16)
And he called forth the four sons and gave them authority over the spirits of the dead, so that they might bring them forth and heal the sick and all who were tormented.
And these are the names of the twelve apostles: the first, Simon, whom they call Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother.
And Philip and Bartholomew, and Thomas and Matthew the tax collector, and James the son of Alphaeus and Judas Iscariot,
And Simon the Zealot who would betray his country, and Judas Iscariot who would betray Jesus. Jesus sends out the twelve (Mark 6:7-13; Luke 9:1-6)
Jesus sent out these seventy-two and gave them this charge: "Do not go into any town of the Samaritans,
But go and look for the lost sheep of the House of Israel.
And you go and spread the word and say that the Kingdom of the heavens is near.
Heal the sick, raise the dead, heal the lepers, cast out demons. Take nothing, give nothing.
Do not carry gold, silver or copper in your belts,
No purse, no two-piece, no sandals, no stick, because the servants deserve their food.
And any city or village you enter, you should ask who deserves to have you enter his house and stay with him until you leave.
As you enter the house, greet the people inside.
If that’s what the Al-Dar family deserves, let your peace come to them, but if they don’t deserve it, your peace will come back to you.
And if anyone does not accept you or listen to you, shake the dust off your feet and leave that house or that town.
Here is the truth: on the Day of Reckoning, the state of Sodoma and Gomorra will be better than the state of this city!» The persecution that will take place (Mark 13:9-13; Luke 21:12-17)
«We send you as the sheep in the middle of the clouds, so be awake like the lark, and humble like the dove.
They will turn the people against you so that they hand you over to the Jewish council, and they will whip you in their synagogues.
You will be laughed at by the judges and kings for having to stand before them and other peoples.
When I deliver them to you, don't worry about how to speak or what to say, you will have the words you need to say at that time.
Because of you, I didn’t ask you, but you should ask your own self.
Khaw bash yisلم khaw lil-mawt, wal-bu wal-du waldo, wal-walad yaduroa 'ala wal-dayhim wa yaktولوهم,
And everyone will hate you because of my name. But the one who proves it to others is the one who will pay.
And when they persecute you in this city, flee to another. I tell you the truth, you will not be able to go through the cities of Israel before I come, the Son of Man.
A student is not greater than his teacher, and a servant is not greater than his master.
It is enough for him that his student is like his master and his servant like his lord. If the master of the house calls him Belzebub, what will he call his family? (Luke 12:2-7)
«Don’t be afraid of them. There is nothing to be uncovered, and nothing to be discovered.
And we will tell you in the dark, tell you in the light. And if someone tells you softly in your ear, call out for it from the rooftops.
And don't worry when they kill the body and they can't kill the soul, but if they are afraid when he is able to destroy both the soul and the body in hell.
Why are two sparrows being sold for a franc? And if they fall on the ground, it’s your business what is in the sky.
Even your bald patch is counted.
Don’t worry, you are better than a lot of sparrows!
Unless he admits me in front of people, we will admit him in front of the boy in the sky.
"But whoever denies me before men, I will also deny before my Father who is in heaven." Jesus and the World (Luke 12:51-53; 14:26-27)
“What you think I came here to bring peace to the earth, I didn’t come here to bring peace, but to bring a sword.”
I came to distinguish between the boy and his father, the daughter and her mother, and the daughter-in-law and her mother-in-law.
Enemies are a man's property so that they may be his hopes.
Whoever loves him or his money more than me does not deserve me. Whoever loves his son or daughter more than me does not deserve me.
And if he doesn't carry his cross and follow me, he doesn't deserve me.
“Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life on my account will find it.” (Mark 9:36-41)
«Whoever greets you, greet him with the same, and whoever greets me, greet him with the same whom I have sent.
Whoever accepts a prophet with a good heart, accepts a prophet so that he can get the reward of a prophet. And whoever accepts a barman with a good heart, accepts a barman so that he can get the reward of a barman.
And the one who gives a small amount of money to a child, even a glass of cold water, is my student, I tell you the truth, his reward will not be lost.
The disciples of John the Baptist (Luke 7:18-35)
And when Jesus had finished giving his instructions to the twelve, he went away from that place to teach and preach in the towns of that district.
And John, while he was in prison, heard of the works of Christ, and sent two of his disciples,
They said: “Are you the one who is coming or are we waiting for another one?”
Jesus answered them, “Go and tell John that you have seen and heard what you have seen and heard.”
# 35:5-6; 61:1; Luke 4:18-19 The blind will see, the lame will walk, lepers will be cleansed, the deaf will hear, the dead will rise, and the poor will be glad at the gospel.
And health to those who don’t doubt!
When his disciples had gone away, Jesus began to say to the crowds about John: “What went you out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
What else did you go out to see? To see a man wearing expensive clothes? They are the ones who wear expensive clothes in the palaces of kings!
Otherwise what did you go out to see? To see a prophet? Yes, and I tell you: greater than a prophet.
# 3:1; 1:2 This is what is written in the Holy Bible: “I will send my messenger before you, to prepare the way for you.”
You convey the truth, not one of those who were brought by women was greater than John the Baptist, but he is the smallest in the kingdom of heaven greater than him.
From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven is advancing, and forceful people are forcing their way into it.
All the prophets, up to and including John the Baptist, prophesied about the law and the testimony of Jesus.
And if you believe it, it's Elijah who is coming.
Let him who has ears to hear hear!
How do we compare to this generation? They are like children sitting in the market and crying at each other:
Zamarna l-kamm wa ma shathtosh, wanuhnalkm wa ma bekitosh.
John doesn’t eat or drink, you say: “he is possessed by a demon.”
When the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth? (Luke 10:13-15)
And he began to rebuke the cities where his mighty works were done, and they did not repent.
And he said: "Alas for you, Korzen! Alas for you, بيت صيدا! If the great miracles that are done in your midst were done in صور and صيدا, then their hopes would have turned to ashes and they would have put on sackcloth and sat on ashes.
But I will tell you: the state of Tyre and Sidon will be better than your state on the Day of Reckoning.
And you, Kafr-Nahoum! How are you going to heaven? You are going to hell. Because if the great miracles that were done to you were done in the city of Sodom, then they would still be there today.
But I say to you that it will be better for you that one of these cities should be thrown into the midst of the sea and should be buried than that one of these should fall upon your peace. Luke 10:21-22
Jesus spoke at that time and said: “We give you thanks, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and have revealed them to little children.”
Yes, yes, Papa, that was your will.
Papa gave me everything. Not one person knew the son was the boy, not one person knew the boy was the son and everyone chose the son to show him to.
I’ll do it for you, because you are tired and the load is heavy on you.
They laughed at my scales and learned from me, I am good and my heart is humble, and then you will find peace in your souls
“My side of the scale is not balanced and my burden is light.”
Saturday (Mark 2:23-28; Luke 6:1-5)
At that time, as Jesus was going through the wheat fields on the sabbath, his disciples were hungry and began to pluck the heads of grain.
When they saw the Pharisees, he said to them, “Look! They are the ones who say, ‘Do not do any work on the Sabbath day.’”
# I 21:1-6; No 24:9 Jesus said to them, “My children, have you not read that David, when he was hungry, he fed on the bread of angels?
How did he enter the house of God, and eat the bread of the communion, which he and those with him were not allowed to eat, while it was allowed for the priests to eat it?
# 28:9-10 My brother, I didn't read it in the Torah, how is it that the priests in the temple on the Sabbath break the Sabbath command and no one blames them?
But you tell me: there is one here greater than the structure.
# He is 6:6; Me 9:13 And if you knew what this verse means: "We love out of mercy, not sacrifice." Then you would not have judged me.
"The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath." The man with the withered hand is cured (Mark 3:1-6; Luke 6:6-11)
And Jesus went out of that place and came into their synagogue.
And there was a man with a paralyzed hand. People asked him: «Is it allowed to heal on Saturday?» So they could find something to accuse him with.
Jesus said to them: “Who of you, having one sheep, if it falls into a pit on the sabbath day, will not take hold of it and pull it out?”
And what value does a human have more than another! Why is it that it is allowed to do good on Saturday?
And Jesus said to the man: “Stretch out your hand!” and the man stretched it out, and it was completely healed, like the other hand.
But the Pharisees went out and made plans with the chief priests on how to kill Jesus. Jesus is the servant whom God has chosen.
And Jesus knew it and left that place. And a great number of people followed him and he healed them all.
And ordered them not to tell anyone about it,
And this is what happened so that what the prophet Isaiah said came true:
# 42:1-4 My chosen servant, whom my soul loves, whom I have put my spirit upon, to announce to the nations my justice.
Erk doesn’t work and doesn’t shout, even no one in the streets hears his voice.
A broken reed will not break, and a match that has been struck will not be extinguished. Until the truth prevails,
And the people that they may have hope in His name. Jesus and Beelzebul (Mark 3:20-30; Luke 11:14-23; 12:10)
And at that time a man blind came to him and cockroaches lived in his eyes. And Jesus' lips opened and he began to speak and see.
And the people were astonished at that and said: “Is this the son of David?”
But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, “He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of demons.”
Jesus knew what they were thinking, but he said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself will be destroyed, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand.
If the devil is expelling the devil, then it should be divided by his soul, otherwise how is his kingdom going to be established?
And if Anna goes to the beach with Beelzebub, who will your students go with? That's why they are the ones who will judge you.
But if we go out in the beaches in the spirit of God, then the kingdom of God will control you.
And how can one enter the house of a strong man and take his wife, unless the strong man's shoulder is first, and he is not going to take the things in his house?
Who is not with me is against me, and who does not unite with me is separating.
That's why I told you, all the people's sins and their disbelief are forgiven, but not the disbelief in the Holy Spirit.
And whoever says a word against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, neither in this world nor in the world to come.» The fig tree and its fruit (Luke 6:43-45)
«Either let the tree be fine and its yield fine. Or let the tree be bad and its yield bad. The tree is known by its yield.
You لفاعي's sons, how can you say nice things and you are evil? The tongue speaks what the heart conceals.
A good man brings out the good in others, and a bad man brings out the bad in others.
Translation: Every empty word people say, they will be held accountable for it on the Day of Reckoning.
You make yourself out to be innocent with your words, but your words condemn you.” The Pharisees ask for a sign (Mark 8:11-12; Luke 11:29-32)
At that time some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Jesus, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.”
But he replied to them: "A wicked and adulterous generation is asking for a sign, but no sign will be given to this generation except the sign of Jonah."
# 1:17 And as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a whale, even so will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
# 3:5 يون ‏3‏:5 And the people of Nineveh shall rise up in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because at the preaching of Jonah they repented.
# I مل ‏10‏:‏1‏-10؛ II أخ ‏9‏:‏1‏-12 and the Queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and here is one greater than Solomon!» Return of the soul of the dead (Luke ‏11‏:‏24‏-26 )
«When a man is killed and his soul is taken out, it goes beyond the places where there is no water and looks for a place to rest, but it doesn't find any.
At that time he says: "I want to go back to my house that I left." And he comes back to find it empty, swept and organized.
“As he walked along, he saw seven other spirits more evil than he, coming out of him and going into some pigs. And the whole herd of pigs was thrown down a steep place into the sea and drowned. As often as he put his fingers on them, the evil spirits went out of them with a cry. He went around all the villages and towns, doing his work in their synagogues. The people were amazed at his teaching, for his word was like the word of a god with power. But he did not do any miracles there, except he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them.” (Mark 3:31-35; Luke 8:19-21)
And while Jesus was still speaking to the people, his mother and brothers came standing outside and wanted to speak with him.
One of them said, "Your mother and siblings are standing outside and want to talk to you.
But answer the man he spoke to: “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?”
He reached out to his right and said: “Ahuma, my mother and my brothers.
“Whoever does the will of him who is in the heavens, he is my brother and sister and mother.”
Like the farmer (Mark 4:1-9; Luke 8:4-8)
And Jesus went out to a mountain by the lake on that day.
A lot of people gathered around him, even when he came out in a boat, and everyone stopped on the shore.
And they have a lot of proverbs: "The farmer went out to plant.
And when Utali is planting, a seed fell in the bend, and the birds ate it.
Another seed fell in a land where there is stone, not much soil, brother, it sprouted in time because its soil is not much.
But when the sun came out, it burnt and dried up because it didn’t have any veins.
Another seed fell in the middle of the thorns, and the thorns choked it.
Another seed fell in a fertile soil and produced a plant that produced bitter water, another produced sixty, and another produced thirty.
“He who has ears to hear, let him hear!” Why did Jesus speak in parables? (Mark 4:10-12; Luke 8:9-10)
At that time the disciples came to Jesus and said to him, “Why do you speak in parables?”
And he answered them, “You have been given the key to the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven, but they have not been given to them.”
He who has it, will have more and more. He who doesn’t have it, will have even what he has.
That's why I'm talking to them in parables, so that they may see and hear but not understand and may feel and not grasp.
# Is 6:9-10; Jer 8:18; Mt 12:39-41; Ac 28:26-27 fulfilled in the prophecy of Isaiah which says: that you may hear but not understand, and see but not perceive.
This people have hardened their hearts, closed their ears and shut their eyes, so that they do not see with their eyes, hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and return to me so that I can heal them.
But take care of your eyes because they see, and take care of your ears because they hear.
Here is the truth: many prophets and righteous men have wished to see what you see and did not see it, and to hear what you hear and did not hear it. (Mark 4:13-20; Luke 8:11-15)
«Well, listen what the farmer means by such a simile:
If anyone hears the word of the kingdom of God and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart.
And whoever sows in the land of the stone, he who hears the word and at the same time accepts it with joy:
But if he doesn’t have a vein inside him, he should wait a little and the time will come when a difficult time or oppression will come because of the word, and the time will pass.
And the one who grows in the middle of thorns is the one who hears the word, while the worries of the world and the love of wealth suffocate the word and the one who has no seed.
And the one who is sown in the good soil is the one who hears the word and understands it. He produces a hundred, sixty, and thirty fold. Like the weeds.
And he said to them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
When the people were asleep, the enemy came, sowed his seeds in the midst of the wheat and went away.
When the seedlings sprouted and the wheat grew, the ryegrass came up with it.
The servants of the master of the land came and said to him: "My Lord, didn’t you plant a good seed in your land? Where did the wheat come from then?"
He said to them: "One of my enemies did this thing." The servants said to him: "Then why don't you like us to go and gather the trash?"
But he said: "No, so that you don't harvest the wheat when you are still gathering the barley.
"Let wheat and tares grow together until the harvest; and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather the tares first and bind them in sheaves, that they may be burned; and the wheat gather ye into my barn." (Mark 4:30-32; Luke 13:18-19)
And he gave them another parable: The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and planted in his field.
It is the smallest of all the trees, but when it grows up it becomes bigger than all the green things, and it becomes a tree, to the extent that birds of the sky come and nest in it.
And another saying: “The kingdom of heaven is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, till the whole was leavened.”
This is what Jesus said to the people in parables. And he would not tell them anything without a parable.
# 78:2 This is what the Prophet said: “So my tongue speaks in parables, and we are told the secrets of things when the world was created.” Interpretation of the Zwan example
At that time, Jesus left the people and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, “Explain to us the parables of the grapevine.”
Answer them: “He who sows the precious seed is the Son of Man,
And the seed is the world, and the fair seed are the sons of the kingdom of God, and the tares are the sons of the evil one,
And the enemy they planted is Bليس, and the harvest is the last time, and the harvest are the angels.
And just as the fish gets cooked and burned by fire, in the same way it will happen at the end of time.
Anna, the son of man, so that I may send my angels, and they may gather together the evildoers, who do evil in the kingdom of my Father.
And they throw them into the middle of the fire, the coming one to be the wailing and the years of sorrow.
At that time the righteous ones, may they shine like the sun in the Kingdom of وهم (Wam). Let him who has ears, hear!» Like treasure and diamonds and the net
«The Kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid. Then he went and sold all that he had and bought that field.
The kingdom of the heavens resembles a merchant who looks for precious gems.
Having found a precious piece of gold, he walked and sold everything he had and bought it.
The kingdom of the heavens is like a net cast into the sea, and it catches all kinds of fish.
When he finished, the fishermen took him to the shore, sat down and put the good fish in the boxes, while they threw the bad ones away.
And that is how it will be at the end of time: the angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous.
And they will be thrown into the middle of the fire, and the wailing and the gnashing of teeth will be the lot of those who are condemned.
And Jesus said to his disciples: «Do you understand this all?» They answered: «Yes, we do.»
And he said to them, “That is why every writer will be a pupil in the kingdom of heaven, just as the master of the house comes out of his treasure to bring out his new and old things.”
And when Jesus had ended this parable, he departed thither.
And when he began to teach them in their congregation, behold, the people were astonished and said, "Where did this man get all this wisdom and these miracles?
Ya khi, this is not the son of the carpenter? Ya khi, is not her name Mary? And his brothers are not Jacob and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
And all your girls are here? Where did this man get all this stuff?
And so they complained about him. Jesus told them: «A prophet is esteemed nowhere but in his own country, and in his own house».
And they didn’t believe in him because he didn’t do many miracles for them.
The death of John the Baptist (Mark 6:14–29; Luke 9:7–9)
It was at this time that King Herod heard about Jesus,
He said to the servants, “This is John the Baptist rising from the dead, that is why he is performing miracles.”
And before Herod, John was taken and bound and imprisoned because of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.
Because of John they said: «You shouldn’t take it.»
They love to kill, but they were afraid of the people because they thought John was a prophet.
But when Herod’s birthday came, a girl danced at the party and pleased Herod.
That's why he promised her and swore to give her whatever she asked for.
And as a mother’s command, she said to Herod: “Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter!”
The king was sad, because he had to stop her from doing what she loved, because of the oath he had taken and the guests.
Whoever sent it, cut off John’s head in prison
They put his head on a plate and gave it to the girl, my god, she threw it at her mother.
And the disciples of John took it and buried it, and went and told Jesus. Jesus feeds five thousand men (Mark 6:30-44; Luke 9:10-17; John 6:1-14)
When Jesus heard of this, he went out of the place by the lake and entered a solitary place. When his disciples heard of it, they followed him on foot from the towns.
When Malfoufka landed, there were a lot of people, my brother, he came to them and healed the sick.
In the evening, his pupils came to him and said, “The day is still long, and this place is empty, send the people to the villages so that they can buy something to eat.”
Jesus said: “They don’t have to go. Give them something to eat.”
Qallolu: “We had five loaves of bread and two fish.”
Jesus said: “Bring them here.”
And he ordered the people to sit on the grass, and he took the five loaves and the two fish, and he raised his eyes to the sky, and he blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and ate. And they shook two full baskets full of leftovers.
The people who ate were about five thousand men, not counting women and children. Jesus walks on water (Mark 6:45-52; John 6:15-21)
And then he exactly asked his pupils to get on the boat and to precede him to the opposite side of the lake until he sends people to go.
And after the people had gone, he went up alone to the mountain to pray. And after the sun had set, he went alone.
But at that time the boat was far from the shore and the waves overwhelmed it, because the wind was against it.
And before dawn they came to Jesus, walking on the water.
But the disciples, when they saw him walking on the water, said, “It’s an apparition!” and they began to cry out in fear.
But Jesus spoke to them at once, and said to them: “Be of good cheer! It is I; do not be afraid!”
And Peter answered him, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you across the water.”
Jesus said: “Eggo.” Peter Malfuca went out and walked on the water and came to Jesus.
But the wind-finder was scared, my brother, it was going to sink, and he cried: "Lord, save me!"
At the same time, Jesus stretched out his hand and took her by the hand, saying to her, “O you of little faith, why did you doubt?”
And as they came out in the boat, the wind died down.
And he got down into the ship, and his disciples followed him. And, behold, there arose a great storm
And Jesus and his disciples came to the place called Gethsemane.
And when the time came for him to bring healing to the whole country, Jesus spread the news throughout the whole region and brought to him all those who were sick.
They asked him to let them touch even the edge of his bed. And what they did to him, everyone got sick.
The traditions of our ancestors (Mark 7:1-13)
The Pharisees and the scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, and said:
«Why don’t your students respect the traditions of the elders? And why don’t they wash their hands when they eat?»
Answer them: “And why don’t you obey God’s will and stick to your traditions?”
# Ex 20:12; Deut 5:16; Ex 21:17; Lev 20:9 God said: "Honour thy father and thy mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, shall be surely put to death."
But you say, if someone says to his father or mother: "What I was helping you with, I gave it to God, he doesn’t need to honor him."
And so you have made the word of God void with your customs.
O hypocrites! Thus spoke Isaiah the prophet, and he said to you:
# 29:13 This people honor with their mouth, but their heart is far from it.
“They worship nothing, and teach in the name of people's commandments.” What is it that defiles a man? (Mark 7:14-23)
And Jesus called out to the people and said to them: “Listen and understand
It is not the mouse that enters the mouth that defiles a person, but the one that comes out of the mouth that defiles a person.
And his disciples came and said to him, “Brother, do you know that the Pharisees are offended when they hear this saying?”
Answer them: “Every tree that my father did not plant in the sky will be uprooted.
Get them out of there! They're blind driving blind. If a blind man drives a blind man, they're both going to fall into a hole.
But Peter said, “We have explained this parable to you.”
And Jesus said to them, “Do you still not understand?
Why don’t you see that anything that goes into the mouth goes to the stomach, and it doesn’t come out of the body?
But the need to come out of the mouth, comes from the heart, and that is what makes a person unclean.
Bad thoughts come to the mind of the heart, such as killing, fornication, corruption, theft, false testimony and disbelief,
These are the things that defile a person. But eating with unwashed hands does not defile a person.” The faith of the Canaanite woman (Mark 7:24–30)
And Jesus went from there to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
And a woman from that area came and said: «Oh my God, oh son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is possessed by the devil and she is being tortured a lot.»
But he didn’t answer her a word. His pupils came and begged him and said: “Give her what she loves, let her go away from us, she will go behind us and cry!”
Jesus answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”
She came and landed on her knees in front of them and said: «Sir, help me!»
“It’s not good to give the children’s bread to the dogs.”
She said: “Yes, sir! Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the table of their master.”
Jesus answered her: “Woman, your faith is great! Let it be done for you as you wish.” And immediately her daughter was cured. Jesus healed many people
And Jesus went on from there along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, and he went up on the mountain, and the disciples came to him.
There were a lot of people and they brought with them paralyzed, mute, blind and deaf people and many others, and they put them in front of his legs and he healed them.
And the people were astonished, seeing the lepers speaking, the deaf hearing, the paralyzed walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel. Jesus feeds four thousand men (Mark 8:1-10)
Jesus called his disciples and said to them: “They are causing a stir, because they have been with me for three days without eating. I do not want to send them away hungry, so that they do not faint on the way.”
And the pupils said: “Where will we get bread in the wilderness to feed all these people?”
And Jesus said to them: “How many loaves have you?” They said: “Seven loaves and some small fish.”
And Jesus commanded the people to sit down on the earth,
And these seven loaves and the loaves of the fish, and they thanked God and divided them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate until they were full, and they shook seven big baskets full.
The Claw had four thousand men, not counting women and children.
And after the people had sent the soul, he went up in the boat and walked to the area of Majdal.
Signs of the times (Mark 8:11-13; Luke 12:54-56)
The Pharisees and the Sadducees came, to test Jesus, and asked Him to perform a miracle for them from heaven.
Jesus answered them, “When evening comes, you say, ‘The weather is fair, for the sky is red.’
In the morning you say: “There is rain today, because the sky is dark red.” You know how to interpret the state of the sky, but you don’t know how to interpret the signs of time.
A wicked generation seeks a miracle, but even a miracle will not be given to it; it will be given to Jonah." And he left them and went away. The yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees (Mark 8:14-21)
When they brought the pupils to the opposite bank, they forgot to bring the bread,
Jesus said to them: “Be awake, and be watchful against all covetousness, for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of things which are seen.”
The pupils discussed among themselves and said: “That’s because we don’t have any bread.”
But Jesus knew it and said: “You of little faith, why are you talking to each other about having no bread?”
Dude, you didn’t understand? Dude, don’t you remember the five loaves that were distributed among the five thousand and how many big baskets of meat were left over?
And the seven loaves of bread for the four thousand, how much did you fill a big basket with?
How can you not understand that I am not going to talk about bread? Be careful with the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!
At that time they understood what he had said to them: "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees." (Mark 8:27-30; Luke 9:18-21)
When Jesus came to Caesarea Philippus, he asked his disciples, “The people are saying: Who is he? Who is the Son of Man?”
Answer them: “Some say that you are John the Baptist, and others say that you are Elijah, and others say that you are Jeremiah, but none of the prophets.”
He said to them: “What are you saying about me?”
Answer, Simon Peter: “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”
And Jesus said to him, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.”
And I tell you: you are Peter, meaning a large room, and on this room I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not overcome it.
“If you have the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and you tie them on earth, they will be tied in heaven; and if you loose them on earth, they will be loosed in heaven.”
And at that time he enjoined his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Christ. Jesus speaks for the first time of his death and resurrection (Mark 8:31; 9:1; Luke 9:22-27)
And at that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer at the hands of the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.
Peter, shaking Jesus by the side, began to rebuke him, and said, “By no means, Lord! This shall by no means happen to you!”
But Jesus turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a distraction to me; you are thinking of the things people think, not of God.”
At that time Jesus said to his disciples: “If anyone wishes to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me.
Whoever wants to lose his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will gain it.
What is the point of a human if he wins all of this world and loses his life? Or what is the thing that a human would sacrifice his life for?
Rani ana ibran ish-shum'a bish nji ma'a malika yeti fi majd babai, wa-l-waqt hadaqa njazii kull ibran 'ala shay'i ya'malou.
Here is the truth: there are some who are standing here who are not going to see death before I see me, the Son of Man, coming in my kingdom.
Jesus shows his spirit to his disciples (Mark 9:2-13; Luke 9:28-36)
And six days later Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, and led them up on a high mountain by themselves.
And they changed in front of them, their faces shone like the sun and they became white like light.
And Gad appeared to them, and Elijah spoke concerning Jesus.
And Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three tents here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
And as Utali was still speaking, a pale cloud covered them, and a soft voice from the cloud said: “This is my son whom I love and whom I am very happy about, listen to what he says!”
When the pupils heard this, they fell on their faces and were very afraid.
And Jesus came and said to them, “Get up, do not be afraid.”
And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus alone.
As they were going down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, “Do not tell anyone what you have seen, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead.”
And the pupils asked him: “Why does the Jewish book say that Elijah must come first?”
Answer them: “In truth, Elijah is coming and he will put everything right.
But I will bring you to Elijah, and they will not know him, and I will do to them what I love to do to everyone. And the Son of Man will suffer greatly by their hands.
And at that time the disciples understood from the story he was telling about John the Baptist. Jesus Heals a Demon-Possessed Boy (Mark 9:14-29; Luke 9:37-43)

“O Lord, have mercy on my son, who is struggling and suffering a lot and always falls into fire and water.”
And when I brought it to your pupils, they could not heal it.
Jesus answered him, “You generation is corrupt and lacking in faith! When will I be with you? When will I endure you? Bring him to me!”
And Jesus cast out the devil, and the child was cured at that very hour.
At that time, the disciples came to Jesus by the side and said: «Why have we not been able to cast him out?»
He said to them: “Because of your weak faith! I tell you the truth, if you had faith the size of a mustard seed, you could say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it would move, and nothing would be impossible for you.”
# ‏17‏:21 There are old texts that contain this verse: As for this kind, go out by prayer and fasting. Jesus speaks again about his death and resurrection (Mark ‏9‏:‏30‏-32 ; Luke ‏9‏:‏43‏-45 )
When they were together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, “The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men,

They went to Capernaum, and when they were in the house, they began to question him. “Does your teacher pay taxes to the temple tax collector?”
Answer: “Yes indeed.” And he sent him home. Before Jesus spoke, he said: “What do you think, Simon? Whose tax and census is it that they are taking, the people’s or the outsiders’?”
Peter said, “I am from Braynia.” Jesus said, “No, the children of the country are free.
But we don't want to make a problem for them, go to the lake and cast the line, and if you catch a fish, open its mouth and you'll find enough silver to pay for you and me, lift it and pay my and your taxes.
