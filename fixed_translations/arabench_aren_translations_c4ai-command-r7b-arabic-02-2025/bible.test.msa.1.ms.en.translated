The Greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven
At that hour the disciples came to Jesus and said: “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”
Then Jesus called a child to him and put him in the middle of them.
And he said to them, “Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.
Whoever makes himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
And before I had one such son by name he embraced me.
And if one of these little believers in Me is lost, it is better for him to be suspended by a stone millstone around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.
Woe to the world for stumbling! Stumbling must come, but woe to that man through whom stumbling comes!
If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it from you. It is better for you to enter life lame or maimed than to have two hands or two feet thrown into the eternal fire.
If your eye offend you, pluck it out and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter life one-eyed than to have two eyes and be cast into hell fire. Like the wandering sheep
“See, do not despise any of these little ones, for I tell you that their angels in heaven are always looking at the face of my Father who is in heaven.”
For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost.
What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them gets lost, does he not leave the other ninety-nine in the mountains and go after the one that is lost?
And if he finds it, I tell you the truth, he will rejoice over it more than the ninety-nine who need no rejoicing.
This is not the will of your Father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish. If your brother sins against you
“And if your brother wrongs you, go to him with a peaceful mind between you and him alone. If you forgive him, you will have gained your brother.”
And if he will not hear, take one or two more with you, that every word may be confirmed by the mouth of two or three witnesses.
And if they do not hear, then say to the church. And if they do not hear from the church, then let him be to thee as an infidel and a publican.
The truth I tell you: whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
And I say to you, if two of you agree on earth concerning anything that they may ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
“For wherever two or three come together in my name, there I am in the midst of them.” Like the servant who does not forgive
Then Peter came to him and said, “Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?”
Jesus said to him: “I do not tell you that you should pray to him seven times, but to seventy times seven.”
Therefore the kingdom of the heavens is like a man king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
When he began to count, a man who owed him ten thousand shekels came to him.
And if he had not what was sufficient for his master’s order, he and his wife and his children and all that he had, he should be sold and the debt should be paid.
The servant was proud and bowed down to him, saying: My Lord, wait for me, I will repay you everything.
The master of that servant was moved with compassion, and he released him and forgave him the debt.
When that servant went out, he found one of his fellow-servants, who owed him a hundred dinars, and he seized him and grasped his neck, saying: Pay me what you owe me.
The servant’s pride made him stand on his feet and he said to him: Wait for me, I will repay you in full.
He did not respond but went and threw him in jail until he paid the debt.
When the slaves saw what had happened to their companion, they were very sad. They came and told their master everything that had happened.
Then his lord called him and said to him: O wicked servant, all that money I have given you, you have kept for yourself.
Shouldst not thou have had mercy on thy servant thy companion as I have had mercy on thee?
And his master was angry and handed him over to the tormentors until he fulfilled all that was due to him.
Thus does heavenly father deal with you, if you do not leave in your hearts all your brother's faults.
Marriage and Divorce
When Jesus had finished these words, he went away from Galilee and went to the borderlands of Judea, across the Jordan.
And a great multitude followed him and he healed them there.
The Pharisees came to test him and said to him, “Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for any cause?”
And He answered and said to them, “Have you not read that which created from the beginning created them male and female?
And he said: For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they two shall be one flesh.
“If they are not two but one flesh. What God has joined together, no man can separate.”
They said to him: “Why did Moses recommend that he be given a divorce document so that he could divorce?”
He said to them: “Because of your hard hearts Moses allowed you to divorce your wives. But at the beginning it was not like this.”
And I say to you: He who divorces his wife for a cause other than fornication and marries another, commits adultery; and he who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
His disciples said to him: “If this is how it is with a man and a woman, it is not right for a man to marry!”
He said to them, “Not everyone will accept this word, but those to whom it has been given.
For there are eunuchs, which have been so from their womb: and there are eunuchs, which have been made eunuchs of by men: and there are eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake. Whosoever can receive this, let him receive it. Jesus blesses children
Then some children came to him and asked him to lay his hands on them and to pray. The disciples rebuked them.
Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.”
He put his hands on them and went on his way. The Rich Young Ruler
And if one came forward and said to him: “Good teacher, what good works must I do to have eternal life?”
He said to him, “Why do you call me good? Only one is good, and that is God. But if you want to enter life, keep the commandments.”
He said to him: “What commandments?” He said Jesus: “You shall not kill. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not bear false witness.
“Honour your father and your mother, and love your neighbour as yourself.”
The young man said to him: “I have memorized all of this since I was young. What else do I need?”
Jesus said to him, “If you wish to be complete, go, sell your possessions, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.”
When the young man heard the word, he went away sad, because he had great possessions.
Jesus said to his disciples: “I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven!
“And I say to you that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God!”
When his disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and said, “Who then can be saved?”
And looking at them Jesus said to them, “With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”
Then Peter answered him, “We have left everything and followed you. What then will we have?”
Jesus said to them, “I tell you the truth, when the Son of Man is seated on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”
And whoever left homes or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields for my sake, will receive a hundredfold and inherit eternal life.
But many a first is a last, and many a last is a first.
Like a murderer in the vineyard
“For the kingdom of heaven is like a man who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
He agreed with the servant for a dinar a day and sent them to his vineyard.
Then he went forth about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,
He said to them: Go you also to the vineyard, and whatever is right for you, receive. So they went.
And he also went out at about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did likewise.
Then, at about eleven o’clock, he went out and found others standing idly, so he said to them: Why are you standing here all day idly?
They said to him: No one hired us. He said to them: Go you also to the vineyard and receive what is due to you.
When evening came, the master of the house told his servant: Call the laborers and give them their wages, starting with the last and going to the first.
Then came the owners of the eleventh hour and took their pay, one by one.
When the first ones came, they thought they would get more. So they took one dinar each.
And as they were taking, they grumbled against the Lord of the house.
They say: “These others have worked for one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the weight of the day and the heat!”
He answered and said to one of them: My friend, I didn’t wrong you! Did you not agree with me on a dinar?
Take which is yours and go, for I want to give this last one the same as you.
Or what is it to me if I do what I want with what I have? Or is your eye evil because I am good?
Thus the last will be first, and the first last, for many are called, but few chosen.
As he was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside and said to them:
“Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man is delivered to the chief priests and the scribes, and they condemn him to death.”
And they will deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified. And on the third day he will rise. Peter, mother of John’s wife
Then his mother of Zebedee, with her two sons, came to him, and she fell at his feet and asked him for something.
He said to her, “What do you want?” She said to him, “Say that these two sons of mine sit, one at your right and the other at your left, in your kingdom.”
Jesus answered and said to them, “You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I am to drink? Can you be baptized with the baptism that I am to be baptized with?” They said to him, “We can.”
He said to them, “You will drink from my cup, and you will be dyed with the dye with which I am dyed. And as for sitting on my right and on my left, I cannot give it to anyone but those for whom I have prepared from my father.”
When the ten heard this, they became angry at the two brothers.
And he called them and said to them, “You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them, and those who are great have power over them.
So it will not be with you. But whoever wants to be great among you, let him be your servant,
And whoever would be first among you, let him be your servant,
“For the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.” Healing of the Blind in Jericho
And as they were leaving Jericho a great crowd followed them,
And if there are two blind men sitting on the road. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, saying, “Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!”
The crowd silenced them, so they shouted even louder: “Have mercy on us, Lord, son of David!”
Jesus stood and called them, “What do you want me to do for you?”
They said to him: “O Lord, open our eyes!”
Jesus opened their eyes, and immediately they recovered their sight, and followed him.
Entrance into Jerusalem
And when they drew near to Jerusalem, and were come to Bethfage, on the mount of Olives; then Jesus sent two disciples
He said to them, “Go to the village in front of you, and at the proper time you will find a donkey tied there together with its colt. Untie them and bring them to me.”
And if anyone says to you, “Ask for something from your Lord,” say, “The Angel of the Penalty and the Angel of the Mercy are in need of them, and they will be sent at once.”
So all this was, in order to fulfill what was said by the Prophet who said:
“Say to the daughter of Zion, ‘Behold, your king is coming to you, humble, riding on an ass, and a colt of the ass.’”
The two disciples went and did as Jesus had commanded them,
And they brought two cows and a donkey, and they laid his garments on them, and he sat upon them.
The majority spread their clothes on the road. Others cut branches from trees and spread them on the road.
The multitude that went before and that followed cried out: “Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the king of Israel!”
And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was in tremor, saying, “Who is this?”
And the crowd said, “This is Jesus the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.” The purification of the Temple
And Jesus entered the temple of God and drove out all who were buying and selling in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves.
And he said to them, “It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a den of thieves!”
And his uncle and his crutch came to him and healed his gums.
When the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonders he was doing, and the children shouting in the temple, “Hosanna to the Son of David!” they became angry.
And they said to him, “Do you hear what these are saying?” And Jesus answered them, “Yes! Have you not read this: From the mouth of infants and sucklings you have prepared praise?”
Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and spent the night there. The fig tree withers
And in the morning, when he was returning to the city, he was hungry,
He looked at a fig tree on the road, and came to it but found nothing but leaves. He said to it: “You will never bear fruit again!” The fig tree withered immediately.
When the disciples saw this, they were astonished and said, “How did the fig tree suddenly get dry?”
Jesus answered them, “I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also if you say to this mountain, ‘Move and throw yourself into the sea,’ it will be done.”
And whatever you ask in prayer with faith, you will receive.” The question about the authority of Jesus
And when he came to the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him, while he was teaching, and said, “By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?”
Jesus answered them, “I also will ask you one thing; and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things:
John’s baptism: from heaven or from man?”. They began to reason with themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask us, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’
And if we say: Of the people, we fear the people, for to John is like a prophet to all.
They answered Jesus and said, “We do not know.” He also said to them, “And I do not tell you by what authority I do these things. The parable of the two sons
What do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first and said: Son, go to work in my vineyard today.
He answered, “I don’t want anything.” But he finally regretted it and went on.
He came to the second and said likewise. He answered and said: Here I am, O my Lord. And he did not tarry.
“Which of the two did the will of the father?” They answered, “The first.” Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God before you.”
It is better for you that John came to you in the way of truth, and you did not believe him, but the publicans and the sinners believed him; and you, when you saw it, did not repent afterwards to believe him.
«Listen to another example: A man, a householder, planted a vineyard, and enclosed it with a fence, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to vinediggers; and he went away.
When the time of the harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the farmers to get his harvest.
Then the accusers took their slaves and beat some of them, killed some of them and stoned some of them.
Then he also sent other slaves after the first ones, and they did the same to them.
Finally, he sent his son to them, saying: They fear my son!
And the scribes, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir! Let us kill him, and take his inheritance!
They took him and led him out of the vineyard and killed him.
When the owner of the generosity comes, what will he do with those generous ones?
They said to him: “Those lowly people will destroy them in a lowly way, and the generosity will be given to other generous people who will give them their fruits in their due time.”
Jesus said to them, “Have you not read this in the Scriptures: ‘The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone’? From the Lord it has been said, and it is wonderful in our eyes!
Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God is taken from you and given to a nation producing its fruits.
“Whoever falls on this stone will be crushed, and whoever falls on it will be ground to dust!”
And when the chief priests and the Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke of them.
And when they sought to seize him, they feared the multitude, because he was to them as a prophet.
Like the Wedding of the Prince’s Son
And Jesus spoke to them also by parables, saying:
“The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding for his son,
And he sent his slaves to invite the invitees to the wedding, but they did not want to come.
He also sent other slaves, saying: Say to the guests: Behold, I have prepared my banquet. My oxen and my fatlings have been slaughtered, and all is ready. Come to the wedding!
But they relaxed and went on, one to his field, another to his business,
The remaining ones captured his slaves, insulted them and killed them.
When the king heard of the anger, he sent his soldiers and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.
Then he said to his servants: The wedding is ready, but the guests were not worthy.
Go to the crossroads, and whoever you find, invite them to the wedding.
So those slaves went out to the roads and gathered all who they found, both bad and good. The wedding hall was full of revellers.
When the king entered to see the reclining ones, he saw there a man who was not wearing the wedding garment.
He said to him: O man, how did you enter here without a wedding dress? He remained silent.
Then the king said to the servants, Bind his hands and feet, and take him out and throw him into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
“Many are called, few are chosen.” Paying Caesar’s tribute
Then the Pharisees went away and conferred to catch him in his talk.
So they sent to him some of the Pharisees and the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are sincere, and teach the way of God in truth, and do not care for anyone, for you do not look at the person of men.”
Tell us: what do you think? Is it right to pay Caesar his tribute?
Jesus knew their thoughts and said, “Why are you testing me, you hypocrites?
“Show me the tribute of the Gentiles.” They gave him a denarius.
He said to them: “Whose is this image and inscription?”
They said to him, “Caesar.” He said to them, “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s and to God what is God’s.”
When they heard, they were astonished, and left him and went away. Question concerning the resurrection of the dead
On that day, Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him
They said: “O our teacher, Moses said: if one of the guardians dies and he has no children, his brother should marry his wife and have children for his brother.”
We had seven brothers, the first one got married and died. And since he had no offspring, he left his wife to his brother.
And the second, third, to the seventh.
And the last of the flock, the woman also died.
“At the resurrection, to whom of the seven will she be a wife? For she was every man’s!”
Jesus answered them, “You are mistaken, because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God.”
For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.
And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what God has said to you:
I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
When the crowds heard his teaching, they were greatly astonished. The Great Commandment
But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, gathered together,
One of them, Namosi, tried him by saying:
«O teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Torah?»
Jesus said to him: “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.
This is the first and greatest commandment.
And the second is like it: love your neighbor as yourself.
“The whole law and the prophets hang on these two commandments.” Christ and David
While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them
He said: “What do you think of the Christ? Who is his son?” They said to him: “The son of David.”
He said to them: “How can he call him David the Spirit God? Saying:
The Lord said to my Lord: Sit on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool.
“If David calls him Lord, how can his son be?”
No one could answer him a word. From that day no one dared to ask him anything.
A Warning Against the Scribes and Pharisees
Then Jesus addressed the crowds and his disciples
saying: “The scribes and Pharisees sat on Moses’s seat,
Whatever they tell you to keep in mind, keep it in mind and do it, but do not act according to their works, for they say and do not do.
For they pack heavy, burdensome loads onto people’s shoulders, and they do not want to move them with their finger.
And they do all this so that people may look at them: they display their bands and magnify the hem of their garments,
They love the first seat in the feasts, and the first seats in the public assemblies,
The greetings in the markets, and that people call them: Sir, Sir!
And you, do not call master over your Lord, for your Teacher and your Master is Christ, and you are all brothers.
And call no one on earth your father, for one is your Father, who is in heaven.
And call no teachers, for your teacher is Christ.
And the greatest of you shall be your servant.
He who exalts himself will be humbled; and he who humbles himself will be exalted. Woe to the scribes and the Pharisees!
“But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in the faces of men; you yourselves do not enter, and you do not allow those who are entering to come in.”
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you eat houses of widows, and for a pretense make longer your prayers. Therefore you shall receive the greater judgment.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you go out as sea-men, and walk upon the land, gaining a proselyte only to make him a son of hell more than twice as bad as yourselves.
Woe to you, blind leaders! Those who say: Whoever swears by the temple is nothing, but whoever swears by the temple’s gold is bound by it.
O you of little faith and blind! Which is greater: gold or the framework that sanctifies gold?
And whoever swears by the altar, he is nothing, but whoever swears by the offering which he offers, he is bound by it.
O you of little faith and blind! Which is greater: the sacrifice or the altar on which the sacrifice is offered?
Whoever swears by the altar, he swears by it and by everything on it!
And whoever swears by the structure, he has sworn by it and by the one who dwells in it,
And whoever swears by the heaven, he swears by the throne of God and by the one who sits on it.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and anise and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faith. It was necessary for you to do these things, and not to neglect the other.
Blind leaders! Who describe the mosquito and swallow the camel.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside they are full of greed and indecency.
You hypocrite, first dip your hand in the cup and in the dish, that you may be clean outside also.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like white-washed tombs, which on the outside appear beautiful, but on the inside are full of dead men’s bones and all uncleanness.
So also you: outwardly you appear to men as righteous, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the tombs of the righteous,
And you say: If we were in the days of our fathers, we would not have shared in the blood of the prophets.
For you bear witness to yourselves that you are the sons of the murderers of the prophets.
Fill up your parents’ scales.
O you sons of snakes! How do you escape the judgment of hell?
Therefore I am sending you prophets and wise men and scribes, and some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will stone to death,
So that every drop of blood that is shed on the earth—from the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar.
The truth is told you: all this will come upon this generation! Jesus weeps over Jerusalem
“O Jerusalem! O Jerusalem! Thou that killest the prophets, and that stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her brood under her wings, and ye would not!”
This is your house that you leave in ruins.
For I say to you: You will not see me until you say, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!’
The End-Times
Then Jesus went out and went away from the temple, and his disciples came near to him, that they might see the buildings of the temple.
Jesus said to them, “Do you not see all these things? I tell you the truth, not one stone will be left here that will not be thrown down!”
While he was sitting on Mount Olives, the disciples came to him in private and said, “Tell us when will these things happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?”
Jesus answered them, “Look out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed.
Many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and they will lead many astray.
And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled. For all these must come to pass, but it is not yet the end.
For a nation will rise up against a nation, and a kingdom against a kingdom, and there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in places.
But these are only the beginning of the pains.
Then they will hand you over to be tormented, and will kill you; and you will be hated by all nations for my name’s sake.
And then many will fall and will hand one another over and will hate one another.
Many false prophets arise and lead many astray.
Because of the multitude of their sins, the love of many grows cold.
But he who endures to the end shall be saved.
This is the message of the gospel of the kingdom that is preached throughout the inhabited world as a witness for all the nations. Then comes the end.
«When you see the abomination of desolation, which Daniel the prophet said would stand in the holy place—let the reader understand»
Then shall flee them that dwell in Judah unto the mountains,
And whoever is on the surface, let him not go down to take anything from his house,
And whoever is in the field, let him not go back to take his garments.
Woe to the pregnant and nursing mothers in those days!
They came so that your escape would not be in winter or on a sabbath,
For it will be a great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world to this day, nor will be.
And if those days were not shortened, no flesh would be saved. But for the elect those days are shortened.
Then if anyone says to you: “Here is the Christ!” or “There he is!” do not believe him.
For false Christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.
I told you so.
If they say to you: “He is in the wilderness!” do not go out. “He is in the closets!” do not believe.
For as the thunder goes out from the east and makes itself heard as far as the west, so will also the coming of the Son of Man be.
For where there is a corpse, there the vultures will gather.
And after the distress of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
And there will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven. And then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
He sends forth his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and gathers his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost parts of heaven to the uttermost parts thereof.
From the olive-tree they learned the simile: when its branch becomes tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.
So also you, when you see all these things, know that he is near, at the gates.
The truth is told you: This generation will not pass away until all these things have happened.
The sky and the earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away. Ever-readiness
“As for that day and that hour, no one knows them, not even the angels of heaven, except my Father alone.”
It will be like the days of Noah; in those days people were eating and drinking, marrying and being given in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark; and they knew nothing until the flood came and swept them all away.
for as they were in the days before the flood, they ate and drank and married and were given in marriage,
And they knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; even so also shall the coming of the Son of man be.
Then two will be in the field, one will be taken and the other will be left.
Two grind on the millstone, one is taken and the other is left.
“Therefore stay awake—for you do not know at what hour your Lord will come.”
And know this: that if the Lord of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have kept his house awake and would not have left it unguarded.
Therefore be you also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not cometh the Son of man.
Who is the faithful and wise servant whom his master has set over his property to feed them at the proper time?
Blessed is the servant whom when his lord cometh he shall find doing so!
I tell you the truth: He is assessing it on all his money.
But if the slave said in his heart: My master delays his coming.
He starts beating his slaves and drinking and eating with the drunkards.
The master of this servant will come on a day he does not expect and at an hour he does not know.
He cuts it and makes his share with the hypocrites. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Like the Ten Virgins
“Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten brides who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were wise, and five were ignorant.
As for the ignorant ones, they took their lamps but did not take any oil with them,
And the wise took oil in their lamps with them, together with their lamps.
And the groom delayed all of them and they slept.
In the middle of the night there was a cry: Behold, the bridegroom is coming, go out to meet him!
Then all those virgins arose and repaired their lamps.
The ignorant said to the wise: Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.
The wise women replied: Perhaps it is not enough for us but, so they went to the vendors and bought some.
And just as they were leaving, the groom arrived, and the bridesmaids went in with him to the wedding, and the door was closed.
Finally, the rest of the virgins also came, saying: Lord, Lord, open to us!
He answered and said: I tell you the truth, I do not know you.
Therefore be on your guard, for you do not know the day or the hour in which the Son of Man will come, like the fig tree.
“As if a man who was a traveller called his slaves and gave them his money,
So one gave five shekels, another two shekels, and another one shekel. Each according to his ability. And he traveled on his way.
The one who took the five minas and traded with them, gained five more minas.
And so whoever took two ounces, also gained two more ounces.
And he who took the weight went away and dug in the earth and hid his master’s silver.
After a long time, the master of those slaves came and counted them.
Then came the one who had received five minas and presented five more, saying, ‘Sir, five minas you gave me; and look, I have gained five more.’
His master said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful in a little, I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your lord.
Then came the one who took the two weights and said: ‘Sir, two weights were given to me. Here are two more that I have gained above them.’
His master said to him: Well done, faithful and good servant! You have been faithful in a little, I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your lord.
Then came also he that received the one talent, and said, Lord, I knew that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not scattered.
I weakened and went and hid your weight on the earth. Behold, it is for you.
And he answered and said to his lord: O evil and slothful servant, I knew that I reaped where I had not sown, and gathered where I had not scattered,
My silver should have been put with the money-changers, so that when I came I would have taken what was mine with interest.
Take from him a measure and give it to him who has ten measures.
For to everyone who has will be given more, and from everyone who does not have, even what they have will be taken away.
The slave who is a warrior is thrown into the outer darkness, there is weeping and gnashing of teeth. The sheep and the lambs
«And when the Son of man cometh in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon his glorious throne.
And before him all the peoples are gathered, and he distinguishes one from another as a shepherd distinguishes the sheep from the kids.
He will place the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
Then the king says to those on his right: Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you since the foundation of the world.
Because I was hungry you fed me. Because I was thirsty you gave me drink. Because I was a stranger you took me in.
Naked you dressed me. Sick you visited me. Imprisoned you came to me.
Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and give you food, or thirsty and give you something to drink?’
And when we saw you as a stranger, we took you in, and when we saw you as naked, we clothed you?
When did we see you sick or in prison and we came to you?
The king answers and says to them: I tell you the truth, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.
“And he also said to them that were on the left hand, Go ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels;”
I was hungry and you did not feed me. I was thirsty and you did not give me water.
I was a stranger and you did not take me in. I was naked and you did not clothe me. I was sick and in prison and you did not visit me.
Then they will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?’
And he answered and said to them: I tell you the truth, inasmuch as you have done it to one of the least of these my brethren, you have done it to me.
“Those go to eternal punishment and the righteous to eternal life.”
Conspiracy to Kill Jesus
When Jesus had said all these things to his disciples,
«You know that in two days the passover begins, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified.
Then the chief priests and the scribes and the elders of the people gathered to the house of the high priest, which was called Caiaphas,
They consulted together how they might take Jesus with craft and kill him.
But they said: “There shall be no feast, lest the people be in an uproar.” The good man poured out wine
And Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the Leper,
A woman came to him with an expensive perfume flask. He poured it on his head while reclining.
When his disciples saw this, they were indignant and said, “Why is this waste?”
“Because this honey could have been sold for much more and given to the poor.”
Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to them: “Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing to me!”
For the poor are always with you, but I will not always be with you.
For when she poured this sweet liquid on my body, she did it so that I would be satisfied.
“Truly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will be told as a memorial of her.” Judas’ betrayal
Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests
And he said: “What do you want to give me, while you hand it over to me?” They gave him thirty pieces of silver.
From that time on he asked for the opportunity to hand him over. Easter dinner with the disciples
On the first day of the passover, the disciples came to Jesus and said to him, “Where do you want us to prepare the passover for you to eat?”
He said: “Go to the city to so-and-so and tell him: the teacher says: my time is near. Make the Pascha with my pupils.”
The disciples did as Jesus had instructed them and prepared the Passover.
And when the evening rested with the twelve.
While they were eating, he said, “Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me.”
They were very sad, and each of them began to say to him: “Am I he, Lord?”
He answered and said: “He who dips his hand with me in the dish is a friend to me!
“The Son of Man is going as it is written of him. But woe to that man who by him shall be put to death.” “It would have been better for that man had he not been born!”
Judas answered and said to him, “Art thou I, my Lord?” He said, “Thou hast said so.” The Lord’s Supper
While they were eating, Jesus took the bread, and when he had blessed it, he broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, “Take, eat; this is my body.”
He took the cup and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, “Drink all of you from it.
For this is my blood, which is shed for many for the forgiveness of sins.
And I tell you: I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father.”
Then they went to pray and came down to a solitude by the Mount of Olives. Jesus Foretells Peter’s Denial
Then Jesus said to them, “All of you will desert me this night, for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’
But after me I will go before you into Galilee.
Peter answered him, “Even if all of them were to turn against you, I will never turn against you.”
Jesus said to him: “I tell you the truth, on this night before the rooster crows you will deny me three times.”
Peter said to him, “Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you!” And so did all the disciples. In Gethsemane
Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, “Stay here and keep watch with me.”
Then he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to feel sorrow and distress.
He said to them, “My spirit is very sorrowful even to death. Stay here and keep watch with me.”
Then he went a little farther and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, “Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.”
Then He came to the disciples and found them sleeping. And He said to Peter, “Could you not watch with Me even one hour?”
Stay awake and pray that you may not enter into temptation. For the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
And he went a second time and prayed, saying: "Father, if it is your will, take this cup from me; nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done."
Then he found them also sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.
He left them and went away, and he prayed the third time, saying the same words.
Then He came to His disciples and said to them, “Now rest a while while I am going to pray.
Let us go! Behold, he who is going to deliver me is near! The Arrest of Jesus
And as he spake, Judah, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude armed with swords and staves, of the chief priests and of the elders of the people.
And he who delivered him to them gave them a sign, saying: “He whom you accept is he. Seize him.”
Then he came to Jesus and said: “Peace, Rabbi!” and kissed him.
Then Jesus said to him: “You, a leader of the people, why have you come?” They then came forward and laid hands on Jesus and took him.
And if one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and took his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back in its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword!”
Do you think I can’t now ask my father to give me more than twelve armies of angels?
How should the books be completed: “That is how it should be?”
At that hour Jesus said to the multitude, “As for you, when you see these things, know that it is near—as in a fig tree, when its branches are already tender and its leaves come out—so it will be in my time.
And all this was to complete the books of the prophets. Then all the disciples left him and fled. Before the Sanhedrin of the Jews
And those who had taken hold of Jesus led him away to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the chief priests had assembled.
And Peter, following him from afar, came to the house of the high priest and went in and sat down with the servants, to see the end.
And the chief priests and the elders and the whole council were seeking false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death,
They did not find it. Although many false witnesses came, they did not find it. But finally a false witness came
And they said, “He said, ‘I will be able to tear down the temple of God, and in three days I will build it up.’”
Then the high priest stood up and said to him, “Do you make no answer? What do these witnesses against you testify?”
And Jesus stood still, and said, The Chief Priest said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us, Art thou the Christ, the Son of God?
Jesus said to him, “You have said it! And I also say to you, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven.”
Then the high priest tore his garments and said, “He has blasphemed! What further is needed? Now you have heard his blasphemy!”
What do you see? » They answered, «He deserves death.
Then they spat in his face and punched him, and others kicked him
They said to him, “Tell us, Lord, who struck you?”. Peter’s denial
But Peter was sitting outside in the house. A maid came to him and said, “You too were with Jesus the Galilean!”
He denied it before everyone, saying, “I do not know what you are saying!”
Then, when he went out into the porch, she saw him again, and said to those who were with him, “Behold, this was also with Jesus the Nazarene!”
He also denied it by saying: “I do not know the man!”
And a little after came the rising, and they said to Peter: “Truly you also are of them, for your speech shows it!”
Then he began to curse and swear: “I do not know the man!” And immediately the young man cried out.
Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him: “Before the rooster crows on you three times you will disown me three times.” So he went out and wept bitterly.
Judas Hangs Himself
And when morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel together against Jesus to put him to death,
They bound him, led him away and brought him to the governor, Pontius Pilate.
Then, when Judas who had betrayed him saw that he was condemned, he repented and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders.
He said: “I erred when I surrendered innocent blood.” They said: “What is it to us? You see better!”
He put silver in the structure and went away, then he went and strangled himself.
Then the priests took the silver and said: “It is not right to put it in the treasury, for it is the price of blood.”
Consult and buy the potter’s field of strangers.
For this reason, this field is called “field of the dead” to this day.
Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying, “They took thirty pieces of silver, the price of the one for whom they were valued by the sons of Israel,
And they gave her for the potter’s field, as it was commanded me of the Lord.
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked him: “Are you the King of the Jews?” Jesus said to him: “You say.”
And while the high priests and the elders were complaining to him, he did not answer a word.
Then Pilate said to him, “Don’t you hear how many testify against you?”
He did not answer a single word, which impressed the governor very much.
The governor used to release one prisoner of their choice for the group on the holiday.
And at that time there was a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.
While they were assembled together, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release for you, Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?”
For he knew that they delivered him out of envy.
While he was sitting on the throne of the state, his wife sent him a message saying: “Beware of that tree, for I suffered greatly for it today in a dream.”
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus killed.
The governor answered and said to them, “Which of the two do you want me to release for you?” They said, “Barabbas!”
Pilate said to them, “What shall I do with Jesus who is called the Christ?” And all the crowd said, “He shall be crucified!”
The governor said: “And what evil have they done?” They shouted louder: “Crucify!”
When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but rather that a riot was imminent, he took some water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of the blood of this just Person! Look to it yourselves!”
Then all the people answered and said, “His blood be on us and on our children.”
Then the soldiers released for him those who were put to death with him. But they scourged Jesus and delivered him to be crucified. Mockery of the soldiers
So they took Jesus, the governor’s soldier, to the governor’s house and gathered the whole cohort around him,
They shaved him and dressed him in a crimson robe,
They wove a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand. And they were bowing before him and were mocking him, saying: “Peace, King of the Jews!”
They spat on him, took the reed and beat him on the head.
And after they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to be crucified. The crucifixion
As they were going out, they found a native of Cyrene by the name of Simon; they made him carry the cross.
And when they came to a place called Gethsemane, which is the place of a Gourd,
They gave him a cup of bitter gall to drink. But when he tasted it, he did not want to drink.
And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments, casting lots for them, that the thing might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, “They divided my garments among them, and on my raiment they cast lots.”
Then they sat and guarded him there.
And they put over his head the inscription: “This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.”
Then with him were crucified two thieves, one on his right and one on his left.
The passers-by were rowing against it while shaking their heads
Saying: “O breaker of the temple and builder of it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!”
And the chief priests also, mocking with the scribes and the elders, said:
“The last shall be first, and the first last. If this man is the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross, and we will believe in him!”
He trusted in God, so let him save him now if he wants him! For he said: “I am the son of God!”
And so the two thieves who were crucified with him were also mocking him. Death
From the sixth hour, there was darkness upon all the earth until the ninth hour.
At about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, “Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?” that is, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?”
Then those standing there, when they heard it, said: “He is calling Elijah.”
And one of them ran and took a sponge and filled it with vinegar and put it on a reed and put it to his mouth.
And the rest said, “Leave him. Let’s see if Elijah will come and save him!
And Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and yielded up the ghost.
And the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. And the earth quaked, and the rocks rent asunder,
The graves were opened, and many of the bodies of the holy resting saints stood
And they came out of the graves after his rising, and entered the holy city, and appeared to many.
And the captain of the hundred and those with him who kept Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and what happened, were filled with fear and said, “Truly this was the Son of God!”
And many women were looking on from a distance, for they had followed him from Galilee to serve him,
And among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the twins. The burial
When evening came, a rich man from the village named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus, came.
Then he went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Pilate ordered that it should be given to him.
Then Joseph took the body and wrapped it in clean linen,
And he put him in his new grave which he had carved in the rock, and then rolled a great stone against the door of the grave and went away.
And there were Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, sitting by the tomb. The guards at the tomb
And the day after the preparation of the passover, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together unto Pilate.
Saying: “O Lord, remind us that the misled one said while he was alive: ‘I will rise again in three days.’
So he went and sealed the tomb on the third day, lest his disciples come by night and steal it, and say to the people: ‘He has risen from the dead,’ so that the last delusion would be worse than the first!”
Then Pilate said to them, “You have the guard; go, search him as you know.”
They went and sealed the tomb with guards and sealed the stone.
The Resurrection
And on the sabbath, at the dawn of the first day of the week, they came to the tomb.
And if a great earthquake should occur, for the Lord’s angel will come down from heaven and will come and roll away the stone from the door and will sit upon it.
He looked like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.
The guards trembled in fear and became like dead bodies.
The angel answered and said to the two women, “Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus the crucified.”
He is not here, because he went as he said! Come, look at the place where the Lord lay.
And quickly say to the disciples: “It is he! It is the Lord! He has risen from the dead! He is not here, but is going before you to Galilee. There you will see him. I have told you!”
They quickly left the tomb in great fear and joy, running to tell the disciples.
And as they were going, they greeted his disciples and said to them, "Peace be to you." And they took hold of his feet and worshipped him.
Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me.” The guards’ words
And as they were going along, some of the guards came into the city and told the chief priests all that had happened.
They met with the elders, consulted, and gave the army a lot of silver
Saying: “Say that his disciples came at night and stole him while we were asleep.
And if the governor hears it, we implore him, and we make you feel secure.
They took the silver and did as they had been instructed, and this saying has been spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus appears to the disciples
And the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain as the Lord had instructed them.
And when they saw him, they worshipped him, but some of them doubted.
Jesus went on and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
And teach them to observe all that I have commanded you. And, behold, I am with you every day, even unto the end of the world. Amen.
John the Baptist Prepares the Way
The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
As it is written in the prophets: “Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who shall prepare your way before you.”
A loud voice in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.
John was baptizing in the wilderness and preaching baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
And all the people of the land of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem went out to him, and they were baptized by him in the Jordan, acknowledging their sins.
John was dressed in camel’s hair and a leather girdle around his loins, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
And he would say, “After me comes one who is stronger than I am, before whom I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the laces of his shoes.”
“I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.” The baptism and temptation of Jesus Christ
In those days Jesus came from Nazareth, the Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
And as he was going up out of the water, he saw the heavens were opened, and the Spirit, like a dove, descending upon him.
And a voice came to him from heaven: “You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”
And the spirit led him forth into the wilderness,
And he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted of the devil. And he was with the wild beasts. And the angels ministered unto him. The first call of the disciples
And after John had been baptized, Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.
And he says: “The time has come to completion, and the kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe in the gospel.”
As he was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.
Jesus said to them, “Come after me, and I will make you fishers of people.”
They left their nets and followed him.
Then he went a little further and saw James and John, his brother, in the boat mending the nets.
So he called them. They left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and went after him. Expelling an unclean spirit
Then they entered Capernaum. And on the sabbath he entered the synagogue and taught.
So they were ashamed of his teaching, because he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
And in their congregation there was a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried
“Ah! What have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? art come to destroy us! I know thee, who thou art: the Holy One of God!”
Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent! and come out of him!”
The evil spirit seized him, shouted loudly and came out of him.
They were all astonished, and some of them began to ask one another, “What is this? What is this new teaching? For he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him!”
And his news spread at that time throughout all the region surrounding Galilee. Healing of Simon’s mother-in-law and others
And when they had come out, they went immediately to the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
Simeon’s mother was lying in a fever, and at once she told him about it.
He went ahead and held her hand, and the fever left her immediately and she started to serve them.
And when evening came, as the sun went down, they brought to him all the sick and those who were demoniacs.
The whole city was gathered at the gates.
He healed many who were sick with various diseases and cast out many demons. He would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him. Preaching in Galilee
And very early in the morning he arose and went forth into a desert place, and there he prayed,
Then followed Simon and those who were with him.
And when they found him, they said, “Everyone is looking for you.”
He said to them, “Let us go to the neighboring villages, so that I may preach there also, for that is why I came out.”
He was preaching in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and casting out devils. Healing the leper
An leprous man came to him, and, falling on his face, said to him, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."
Jesus opened his hands and reached out his hand and said to him: “I want, be clean!”
The lizard left him and he was clean while he was speaking.
He rebuked him and sent him away at once,
And he said to him, “See, do not say anything to anyone, but go and see the priest and offer what Moses commanded for your purification, a testimony for them.”
And he went out and began to call out loudly and spread the news, so much so that he could no longer enter the city openly, but was outside in open places, and they came to him from every direction.
Curing Paralysis
Then he also entered into Capernaum, and when he was in the house of Simon’s mother-in-law, he began to shake in a fever.
And at that time many had gathered, so much so that there was no more room nor around the doors. So he addressed them with the word.
They came to him leading a cripple who was carried by four.
And when they could not approach him for the crowd, they opened the roof where he was lying. And after they had dug, they let down the bed on which the paralytic was lying.
When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven.”
And some of the scribes who had come with them were sitting, thinking in their hearts:
«Why does this one speak in such a way with bluster? Who is able to forgive sins except God alone?»
At that time, Jesus knew in his spirit that they were thinking these things in their hearts, and he said to them, “Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?
It is easier to say to the paralytic: "Your sins are forgiven", than to say: "Get up and carry your bed and walk"?
But that you may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins.” He said to the paralytic:
«To you I say: Get up and carry your bed and go to your house!»
And he got up at once, and bare his mother, and went forth before them all; and they were all ashamed, and glorified God, saying, We have seen strange things to-day. The calling of Levi
Then he also went out to the sea. And he came to him all the crowd, and he taught them.
As he was passing by, he saw Levi ben Hلفi sitting at the place of the tax collection, so he said to him: «Follow me». He got up and followed him.
While he was in his house, many tax collectors and sinners were reclining with Jesus and his disciples, for they were numerous and followed him.
The scribes and the Pharisees, when they saw him eating and drinking with the tax collectors and sinners, said to his disciples, “Why does he eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”
When Jesus heard this, he said to them, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I have not come to call the righteous to repentance but the sinners.” Question about fasting
And the disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and came and said to him, “Why do the disciples of John and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?”
Jesus said to them, “Can the children of the bridechamber fast while the bride is with them? As long as they have the bride with them, they cannot fast.”
But there will be days when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast on those days.
No one sews a new patch onto an old garment, or else the new patch will take from the old and the garment will become worse.
“No one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the old wineskins and spill the wine; but they put new wine into new wineskins.” Lord of the Sabbath
And he went through the grain fields on the sabbath, and his disciples began to pluck the ears of grain.
The Pharisees said to him, “Look! Why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?”
He said to them, “Have you not read what David did when he and those with him were in need and hungry?”
How did he enter the house of God? The high priest, and ate the showbread which was not lawful for him to eat, and gave also to them that were with him.
Then he said to them, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
“For the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.”
Healing on Saturday
Then he also entered the congregation, and there was a man whose hand was withered.
They started to watch him: does he heal on Saturday? So they could complain about him.
He said to the man with the frozen hand: “Stand in the middle!
Then he said to them: “Is it permitted to do good on the Sabbath, or to do evil? To save life or to kill?” And they remained silent.
He looked at them angrily, saddened by their hardness of heart, and said to the man, "Out with your hand." He did so, and his hand was restored as well as the other.
Then the Pharisees went out at that time and began to plot with the Herodians against Jesus, to destroy him. The crowds were following Jesus
Then Jesus dismissed his disciples and went to the sea, and a great crowd from Galilee and Judea followed him.
And from Jerusalem and from Adummim and from beyond the Jordan. And many from around Tyre and Sidon heard of all that he was doing, and they came to him.
He said to his disciples that a small boat should accompany him for the purpose of gathering, so that they would not trouble him,
For he had healed so many that some came to him for his mere touch.
The unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him and cried out, “You are the Son of God!”
And he recommended them strongly not to show it. The choice of the twelve apostles
Then he went up to the mountain and called those whom he wanted, and they went to him.
And he established twelve to be with him, and to send them out to preach,
And they have power over the healing of diseases and the driving out of demons.
And he gave Simon a name, Peter.
And James the son of Alphaeus and John the brother of James, and gave them the name Boanerges, which is, Sons of Thunder.
Andrews, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the Less, Thaddeus, Simon the Cananean,
And Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. Then they came to the house of Jesus and Beelzebul
A crowd also gathered, so that they could not even eat bread.
When his relatives heard, they came out to arrest him, because they said, “He is out of his mind!”
And the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem said, “He has Beelzebul! And by the prince of the demons he casts out the demons.”
And he called them to him and said to them in parables, “How can a man drive out a demon and not have his own power go out as well?
And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
And if a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
