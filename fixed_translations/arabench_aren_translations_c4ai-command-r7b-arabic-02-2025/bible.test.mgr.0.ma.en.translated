Chapter 15: The Best of the Kingdom of Heaven?
And, behold, there came to him a lawyer, and said unto him, Master, which is the greatest commandment in the law? And he said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself. Luke 22:24
And he cried out to Jesus for a little child and set him in the midst of them,
And he said: “I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Mark
And whoever humbles himself as this child has, he is the best in the kingdom of the heavens.
And the one who welcomed Walid like that, in my name, is welcoming me.
And the one who fell into the Danube is one of these small ones who believe in him, it would have been better for him to be tied to the neck with a big millstone and thrown into the sea.
Woe to the people of the world for the things that cause them grief! It is inevitable that these things will happen, but woe to the one who causes them!
Otherwise, your hand or your leg will fall into the Danube, cut them and throw them at you, because it is better for you to enter the eternal life with one hand or one leg, than to have two hands or two legs and be thrown into eternal life. When
Or else your eye will be thrown into the Danube, and it will be thrown on you, for it is better for you to enter into the life eternal with one eye, rather than having two eyes and being thrown into the fire of hell. Matthew 5:29 The burning lamb
When you see one of these little ones, I tell you: their angels are in the heavens, always with the one in the heavens. »
«And the son of man has come to save those who have perished.» #18.11 This verse is not found in many of the old manuscripts
What do you think? If one man has a hundred sheep and one of them gets sick, won’t he leave the other ninety-nine in the mountains and go look for the sick sheep?
I’ll tell you the truth: if he finds it, he will be happier about it than he was about the 90 that you can’t even mention.
And so, no one among these kids would like to die.
«Except your brother's sin is your right, go to him and quarrel with him only between you and him, except you hear from him you will have gained your brother, Luca
Otherwise he won’t listen, take one or two people with you so that each word is confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
Otherwise he wouldn't listen to them, he told the people of the church, otherwise he wouldn't listen, consider him like someone who worships idols or a tax collector.
I tell you the truth: whatever you tie on earth will be tied in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. Matthew 16:19; John 20:23
And I will tell you again: if two of you agree on earth to ask for something, it will be granted to them by the one who is in the heavens.
“Wherever you gather two or three in my name, I am in the midst of them.” The example of the slave who does not forgive
And Peter came near to Jesus and said, “Lord! How many times must I forgive my brother for being wronged against me? Up to seven times?” Luke
And Jesus said to them: “Not seven times, but seventy times seven.”
For that, the Kingdom of the Heavens resembles a king who wants to settle accounts with his slaves,
And when he started to settle his accounts with them, they brought him a man who owed him millions of dirhams.
Since he didn’t have the money to repay him, he ordered his master to sell him, his wife, his children and everything he owned to repay his debt.
And the servant said: I will be patient with my Lord and will return to you with all that is due.
His master had pity on him, freed him and forgave the debt he owed him.
And when that servant left, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him 100 silver dirhams, and he grabbed him and hanged him and said: Give me back what you owe me!
His owner fell at his feet asking him and said: Be patient with me and I will give you back what is yours.
But he didn't want to, he took it and threw him in jail until he pays the debt he owes.
And when they saw that the slaves were friends, they were very sad and went to tell their master everything that had happened.
And his master scolded him and said: Ah, this slave who is not good enough! I forgave you all that debt because you tempted me,
Well, why didn’t you spare your servant as I spared you?
His master is worried, and sends him to prison to torture him until he pays back what he owes.
That's how he will do you a favor from the sky unless each of you allows his brother from the bottom of his heart.
Chapter 19: Jesus Teaches about Divorce
And when Jesus had finished these words, he went away from Galilee and went to the other side of the Jordan, into Judah.
And many groups of people followed him and their mouths were stopped.
They brought to him the Pharisees and asked him to put them to the test: "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
And he answers them and says: "Did you not read in the Book of God that God created man from dust, male and female?"
And then he said: This is why the man will leave his wife and will live with his mistress, and they will become one.
So they won't be two but one. And what God has joined together, no man can separate.
Sula the Pharisee said, "Why did Moses command that a man should give his wife a certificate of divorce when he divorces her?" Matthew
Jesus answered them, “It was because of your hardness of heart that Moses allowed you to divorce your wives. But at the beginning of creation, it was not so.”
I am telling you: whoever divorces his wife for any reason except sexual immorality and marries another woman commits adultery. Matthew 5:32; 1 Corinthians 7:10, 11
He told his students: «If this is how a man treats a woman, it’s better for him not to marry at all».
Jesus answered them, “Not everyone will accept this message, but those whom God has chosen will.”
There are people who were born from their parents' bellies and are not able to get married, and there are those who were made like this. And there are those who do not get married because of the Kingdom of Heaven. Let him who understands understand. Jesus blesses the children
They brought some small children for him to touch and pray for them, and they quarrelled with the students about the ones they brought.
But Jesus said to them, “Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.”
He put his hands on them and walked away. The young man in the suit
He met a young man and said to him: «Sir, what good deed can I do so that I have a permanent life?
Jesus answered him, “Why are you asking me about what is good? Only God is good. If you want to enter eternal life, keep the commandments.”
And he said to him: “What kind of precepts? Do not commit murder; do not commit adultery; do not steal; do not bear false witness;
“God bless you, my son, and my sister, and may the one who is close to you be as dear to you as your head.”
And he says to the young man: «I have done all these recommendations, so what else do I need?»
Jesus answered him, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell all that you have and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me!”
But when the young man heard this, he left in a bad mood because he was very upset.
Jesus said to his disciples: “I tell you the truth, it will be hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.”
And we add to you: It is easier for a camel to enter the eye of a needle than for one who is dressed to enter the Kingdom of God!
The students were very surprised when they heard this and said: «On the basis of this, who will be able to survive?»
Jesus saw them and said to them: “People cannot do this, but God can do everything.”
Peter and Gal replied: “Here we are, we have left everything behind to follow you, what is our reward?”
Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, at the new age, when the Son of Man will be seated on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. Matthew
And whoever allows his ransom, his brothers, his sisters, his wife, his children, or his land to be taken for my name, he will get back what he gave up a hundred times over and the jealousy of life is eternal with God.
“The last will be first, and the first will be last.” Matthew 20:16; Luke 13:30
Chapter Twenty: The Example of the Servants in the Garden of Grapes
«The kingdom of the heavens is like a man who has a vineyard, and he went out early in the morning to let out his workers.
And he made a deal with them for a day and sent them to his heaven.
And he went out to the market in the morning and found other servants standing in the market without work.
And he tells them: Go until we reach my paradise, and I will pay you what you deserve,
And they went. And he went out again after ten o'clock in the morning, and again at three o'clock in the afternoon, and he kept on working.
And he went out again one evening, and found other servants standing there, and he said to them: Why are you standing here all day without work?
And they replied: No one has served us there. And he said to them: Well, go and we will get to my paradise.
When the evening came, the owner of the garden told his agent: Call all the servants and give them their salaries, starting with the last ones.
He gave those he hated five o'clock money and took one dinar from each of them.
When the first ones came, they thought they would be paid more, but they only got one dinar each.
And when they were paid, they started complaining about the king's servant,
And Kylolo: those others only worked for one hour and you are paying them with us, we who worked the whole day in the sun.
And he answers the king's man one of them, and said to him: I did not wrong you my friend, did we not agree on a dinar?
Take your rights and leave! And that's what I wanted to give him, just like you.
Don’t I have the right to spend my money as I want? Or are you envious because I am generous?
And Jesus said: “So the last will be first, and the first will be last.” Matthew 19:30; Mark 10:31; Luke 13:30 Jesus predicts his death for the third time
And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve aside and said to them, “Sit here while I go and pray over there.”
«Here we are going up to Jerusalem, and someone is going to deliver the Son of Man to the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and they will condemn him to death.
And he will be handed over to those who do not know God, who will mock and beat and crucify him, and on the third day he will be resurrected.” Mother of James and John asks for her sons
And there came to Jesus a woman with an alabaster box of ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at the table.
She asked him, “What do you want?” and he told her, “Order them to sit, one on your right and the other on your left, in your kingdom.”
And he answers Jesus: "You don't know what you are asking, can you drink the cup of sufferings that I will drink?" He tells him: "Yes, we can!"
And he said to them: «Yes, you will drink my glass, but the glasses on my right and on my left are not for me, because they will only be given to those who found them for them».
And when the ten students heard this, they were very worried about James and his brother John.
Jesus wept and said to them, “You know that the rulers of the nations exercise authority over them, and those who are great exercise authority over them. Luke
That shouldn't be between you. But if you want to be big, you have to be your servant. When?
Whoever wants to be first among you, let him be your servant.
And so man was born not to serve him, but to serve and redeem many with his life. Jesus heals two blind men
And as they were leaving Jericho, Jesus was followed by a large crowd.
And there were two blind men by the way, sitting, and they began to cry out, and to say, “Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!”
And even though people were angry with them so that they would shut up, they only got angrier and said: «Our Lord, have mercy on us, O son of David!»
Jesus stood and cried out to them, “What do you want me to do for you?”
And they replied: “We want our eyes to be beautiful, my lord!”
And Jesus wept over them, and touched their eyes and they began to see, and followed him.
Chapter 21: Jesus’ Entry into Jerusalem
And when they drew near to Jerusalem, and were come to Bethfage, on the mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two of his disciples,
He told them: «Go to the village in front of you, you will find a mare tied up with a man, untie them and bring them to me.
Otherwise, he would have told you something, he would have said to you: “God needs them, and he will quickly get rid of them”.
And all this happened so that the words of the Prophet, who said:
«Tell the daughter of Zion: Here is your king coming to you, humble and on an ass, and a son of an ass».
And the disciples went together and did as Jesus had commanded them,
They brought the donkey and the ass and put their clothes on them and Jesus sat on top of them.
A big group of people spread their stuff on the road, and cut down other people’s tree thrones and spread them on the road.
And the crowds that went before him and followed him cried out, “Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!”
And when Jerusalem saw all the people coming in, she began to say: "Who is this?"
And the crowds answered, “This is Jesus the Prophet from Nazareth in Galilee. Jesus was driving the buyers and sellers out of the Temple.”
And Jesus entered the temple of God and went through the tables of those who were selling and buying, and he overturned the money changers' tables and the seats of those who were selling doves.
And he said to them: “It is written in the Book of God that my house will be called the House of Prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves!”
And there came to him blind men and lame and mute.
But the religious leaders and the scholars were worried when they saw the miracles that Jesus performed, and when they heard the children shouting in the house of God and saying: “Hail to the Son of David!”
And he said to them: “Do you hear what they are saying?” And Jesus answered them and said: “Has it ever occurred to you to read in the book of God: ‘Praise has come out of the mouth of babes and sucklings’?”
And leaving them, he went out of the city to Bethany, and spent the night. Jesus curses the vine
And in the morning, when he was coming back to the city, he got hungry,
He saw a vine by the road, and he went up to it, but he found nothing on it but leaves. And Jesus said to it, "You shall never again bear fruit! And at that very hour the vine was dried up.
When they saw what had happened to the students, they were amazed and said: «How did the grape quickly dry up?»
And Jesus answered them and said, “Truly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will do what I have done with the fig tree. If you say to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ it will be done for you. But which of you, having a servant plowing or tending sheep, will say to him, ‘When I come in from the field, you shall sit down and eat’? You shall not even say to yourself, ‘When I come in from the field, I shall bathe and eat.’”
“The need you ask for in prayer with faith, you will receive.” Who gave authority to Jesus?
And when Jesus was come into the house of God, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him, and said unto him: By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?
Jesus answered them, and said, “I also will ask you one question; and if you tell me the answer, I will tell you by what authority I do these things:
Where did John’s baptism come from? From God or from people? ». They consulted among themselves and said: «If it comes from God, he will tell us: Why didn’t you believe in John?
Otherwise, we will get it from the people, we are afraid of the people, because they think John is a prophet.
They answered him and said, “We do not know him.” He said to them, “Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.” The example of two sons
«There was a man with two sons, and he went to the first and said to him: Go, my son, and work today in my vineyard.
His son answered him and said: I don’t want to. But he regretted it in the end and left.
Bou walked to the second boy and said to him what he had said to the first, and the boy replied: Ok, sir! But I didn’t go.
«Well, who of these two did the will of his father? » They answered him: «The first one». Jesus said to them: «I tell you the truth: the tax collectors and the prostitutes will go into the kingdom of God before you.
And Jesus came to him and said, "You follow me." But he said, "Lord, I will follow you wherever you go." Jesus said to him, "The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head." Luke 9:57-58.
«Listen to another example: there is a man who has a piece of land, he planted a vineyard, built a wall around it, dug a press and built a tower, and he rented it to a vineyardist and left.
And when the time came for him to harvest the grapes, he sent his slaves to the vineyard to get his harvest.
The Janiyin, Copts and slaves fought, one was beaten, another killed, and a third stoned.
He sent another group of slaves, more than the first group, and he gave them the same treatment as the others.
And finally he sent them his son and said: they will respect my son.
But when they saw the genie's son, they said to each other: This is the one who is going to teach them a lesson! Let's kill him and take his genie's lamp!
They dragged him and took him out to the vineyard of paradise and killed him.
Well, except for the owner of the vineyard, what should he do with those vines?
And they answer him: “Those bastards will get a bad end, and the vineyard of the grapes will go to other vineyarders who will give the harvest on time.”
Jesus said to them: «Have you never read what is written in the book of God? The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. This is the work of God, and it is wonderful in our eyes!
That's what I'm telling you: the Kingdom of God is going to be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruits.
And the one who fell on this room is going to break his limbs, and the one who fell on the stone is going to be crushed.
And when the chief of the priests and the scribes heard his words, they perceived that he spoke of them.
And they started to look for ways to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowd because he was considered a prophet.
Chapter Twenty-Two of the wedding proposal
And Jesus again spoke to the multitude and said:
«It is like a kingdom of the heavens to a king who is giving a wedding for his son.
He sent his slaves to call the candidates, but they didn’t want to come.
He sent them slaves again and said: Tell those who are invited: I have found the wedding and I have slaughtered the sheep and the fat calves and everything is there, so come to the wedding!
But they didn’t care about it, some went to their own fields, and some went to sell and buy,
And some of the other guests captured his slaves, taunted them and killed them.
The king was worried and sent his soldiers, who killed those murderers and burned their city.
And he says to his slaves: the wedding is here but those we offered it to do not deserve it.
Well go now to where the roads meet and offer each one you find for the wedding.
The slaves went out to the roads and collected all the goods they could find, good people and bad, until the wedding house was full of guests.
When the king went to see the guests, he noticed a man who was not wearing a wedding suit.
And he says to him: How did you do my friend, how did you get in here and you are not wearing the wedding clothes? The man kept quiet because he had nothing to say.
And he says to the servants: Bind his hands and feet and throw him outside in the dark, and where will be the crying and gnashing of teeth. When
“Many have been exposed, but few have been chosen.” The tax of Caesar
And the Pharisees went out that hour to take him by the words.
And they sent their pupils with the Herodians and said to him: «Sir, we know that you are sincere, and that you teach the way of God with truth, and that you do not judge according to appearance, for you do not care about people as they are.
“So, what’s new? Is it right or wrong to pay taxes to the Caesar?
And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them: “Why do you test me, you hypocrites?
“Give me the money you use to pay taxes!” He got a dinar.
And they asked: "Who is the author of this picture and these books?
Nalo to him: «It’s Caesar’s!», and he tells them: «Whatever is Caesar’s give to Caesar, and whatever is God’s give to God!».
And when they heard it, they were astonished, and left him and went away. The question is about the dead man's luggage
Some Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, came to him and asked him, "Teacher,
«My lord, Gal Moussa: if a man dies and leaves no children, his brother must marry his wife so that he can have children in the name of his brother.
We had seven brothers, the first one got married and died, and since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother so that he could marry her.
And so it was for the second, the third, and the seventh.
And finally, after they all died, the woman died too.
“So who among these seven is the man this woman will marry on the day of her betrothal? Because they were all her husbands.”
Jesus answered and said to them, “You are mistaken, because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God.
When you die, people won't marry you and you won't marry them, but you will be like angels in the sky.
As for the dead, didn't you read the words of God to you when He said:
“I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.”
And when the people heard this, they were amazed at his teaching. The Great Commandment
And the Pharisees sent word to Jesus that they might join together and plot against him.
One of them, who was a religious scholar, said to Jesus:
«My Lord, what is the biggest recommendation in the law?»
Jesus answered and said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.
This is the great and the small testament.
The second testament is the same: you want what is close to you as you want your head.
And on this go of recommendations, the whole law and the prophets are based on it. Luke 10:25-28 Christ and the prophet David
And when the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them:
«What has been conceived in the mind of Christ? Who is he?» They answered: «He is the son of David!»
And he tries to persuade them: "Well, how is it that David was inspired by the Spirit of God when God called him?
The Lord said to my Lord: Sit on my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool under your feet.
“But how can Jesus be his son? David is crying to Jesus as God.”
And nobody even bothered to answer him with a word, and nobody even bothered to ask him any other questions from that day.
Chapter 23 Jesus gives his disciples advice to beware of the scribes and Pharisees
And Jesus spake unto the people, and to his disciples.
“The scholars of the sharia and the Pharisees are the ones who have the right to interpret the sharia of Moses,
Do what they tell you, and follow them, but don’t do what they do, because they don’t do what they tell you.
They pack heavy and difficult bags in the hangers and put them on people's shoulders, but they don't even move a finger to carry them with them.
Otherwise, they do something just so people can see them, and they expand the sleeves and chests of their gangs, and they lengthen their sleeves.
and they like to be in the best places at parties, and the first ones in the prayer houses,
And they like people to greet them in the market and call out to them: "Sir.
But we won’t let anyone cry for you: Mr. Sir, because you are all brothers and you have one master.
And what you call anyone in this world, because you have only one father, the one in the heavens.
And don’t let anyone cry on you: oh, the teacher, because you have only one teacher, which is Christ.
And the greatest among you shall be your servant. When
For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted. Luke 14:11; 18:14
But, O Wellcam, to the scholars of the sharia and the hypocritical Pharisees! You are closing the kingdom of the heavens in the faces of the people, neither do you let in those who want to enter, nor do you let those who want to enter in. [
But, O Wellcam, O scholars of the law and hypocrites of the Pharisees! Because you eat the sustenance of the poor and you lengthen your prayers only to be seen, your punishment will be harder than that of others. #23.14 This verse is not found in many of the old manuscripts
Woe to you, O scholars of the law and hypocrites! Because you cut through land and sea to return one Jew, and when he becomes a Jew, you make him deserve hell more than you do twice!
Oh you blind officials! They say that the one who swears by the House of God is not accepted, but the one who swears by the gold of the House of God must fulfil his oath.
Oh, you idiots and blind! As for Hassan, gold or the house of God that returns gold is sacred?
And again: Whoever swears by the slaughterhouse, his oath is not acceptable, but whoever swears by the gift above him, he must keep his oath.
Oh, you blind ones! Why not me, Hassan? The sacrifice, or the altar that makes the sacrifice sacred?
Because whoever swears by the slaughterhouse, swears by it and everything above it,
And whoever swears by the House of God, he swears by it and by God who dwells within it,
And whoever swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God and by him who sits on it. Matt 5:34
O you who believe! Do not treat the scholars of the religion and the hypocrites of the Pharisees with kindness! You tax mint, basil and cumin, but you leave the important things of the religion, which are justice, mercy and faith. You should have done this without leaving other matters.
Oh these blind officials! You are filtering the water from the mosquitoes but you are breeding donkeys.
Woe to you, O scholars of the law and hypocritical Pharisees! You are cleaning the outside of the cup and the dish, but you leave the inside full of what you have stolen and your greed.
Oh, you Pharisee! Clean the cup and the plate from the inside, so that they are clean from the outside as well.
O you who believe! Do not be like the hypocrites, who are pleased with their own delusions, as they are pleased with what they have been given; but God is not pleased with them, nor yet are the believers. O you who believe! Do not take the hypocrites as friends; they are friends to each other; and whoever of you takes them as friends, he is one of them. God guides not the people of the hypocrites, if ever they turn back.
And so until we are done, the writers for the people from outside are afraid of God, but from inside you are full of hypocrisy and sins.
O you who believe! Do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are allies of one another. They who have believed among them and the hypocrites are in alliance with one another. But God is an ally to the believers. And God is Mighty, Wise. You build their graves and adorn their tombs.
Kteplou: If we had lived in the time of our ancestors, we would not have shared in the killing of the prophets.
And so you bear witness against yourselves that we are the sons of those who killed the prophets.
Well, finish what your grandfathers started.
Oh, the Hanash, the لفاعي (Lfaai) family! How are you going to escape the torment of Hell?
That is why I will send you the prophets, the judges and the scholars of the law, some of whom you will kill, some of whom you will crucify, and some of whom you will beat in your mosques and chase from city to city.
So that the punishment of all the blood that has been shed may come upon you, Tahar Sal has been on the ground, from the blood of Abel, who feared God, to the blood of Zechariah, son of Barachiah, whom you killed between the holy place and the altar.
I tell you the truth: all this will be on this generation!” Jesus’ love for Jerusalem
Jerusalem, Jerusalem! You that kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you! How often have I desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, but you would not!
And here is your house going to be a ruin.
And Hani told you: you will not see me from now until you say: "Congratulations in the name of God".
Chapter 24 Jesus Foretells the Destruction of the Temple
And Jesus went out and walked toward the house of God, and his disciples were coming up to him to show him the children of the house of God.
Jesus said to them, “Have you seen all this? I tell you the truth, not even one stone will be left here that will not be thrown down.” The signs of the last days
And when Jesus was ascending the Mount of Olives, his disciples came to him, and said to him: «Say to us, Lord, when will these things happen to us, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?»
And Jesus answered them, saying: “Take heed no man deceive you!
Because a lot of people are going to come and take my name and say: I am Christ! And many people will make mistakes.
And you will hear about the war and the news of the war, and you will not be scared! Because all this is bound to happen, but this will not be the end of times.
For a people will attack another, and a kingdom will attack another, and hunger will come, and earthquakes will hit many places.
But all that is just the pain of being a nomad.
The clock is ticking, you will be tortured and killed. And all the peoples of the world will hate you because of my name. When
And many people will turn against their faith and will sell each other and will hate each other.
And they will miss many liars among the prophets and many people will make mistakes.
And because of all the worries, the love of many people will get cold.
But the one who remained chaste even to the point of absurdity is that Ginger. When?
And this good news of the Kingdom of God will be preached in all the world, and it will be a witness for all the nations, and then the end of times will come. The Great Tribulation
“And you will see in the holy place the filth of the desolation that the prophet Daniel spoke about — he who reads, understands!”
The rooster that was in the Jewish land is running to the mountains,
What’s on the roof doesn’t go down to get what’s in the house. Luka
And whoever was in the field will not return to take his clothes.
And woe to the women who are pregnant and nursing in those days.
Don’t escape in winter or on Saturday.
Your time will bring a big disaster that has never happened since the time God created the world until now, and it will never happen again. The vision
If God had not shortened those days, not one of the people would have escaped, but for those whom He chose, He shortened them.
And the clock strikes, someone says to you: There is Jesus here, or he is there! Do not believe him,
Because some people will lie and say that they are Christ, and others will say that they are prophets, and they will do signs and wonderful things, so that they will deceive even those who are chosen by God.
Well, I taught you that before.
Except for you: he is in the desert! Don’t go out, or he is in the inner houses! Don’t trust them. Luke
Just as lightning strikes the east and is seen in the west, so will the coming of man's son be.

I’ll tell you the truth: this generation will never get anywhere until all these things happen.
The way to heaven and earth is given, but my words will never be given. The day and the hour that are unknown
As for that day and that hour, no one knows them, not even the angels of the heavens or the son, except for the father alone.
And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of Man.

«And by the time, the kingdom of the heavens will be like ten maidens who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. Luke
Five of them were Bhalas and five were Kharin.
And they shook those five poor bastards and their wives without even taking the oil with them.
The five sensible ones brought their cans and oil in the bottles.
And when the groom got tired, all the bachelors started to play until they fell asleep.
In the night, you hear one voice shouting: Here comes the groom, get out to meet him!
And they all get up, and they find their own pots.
And the beggars to the women: Give us a little of your oil because our candles are about to go out.
But the wise ones replied to them and said: it may not be enough for us and you, go and buy it from those who sell it.
And when they were going to buy the oil, the groom arrived, and with him came those who were present at the wedding place and they closed the door.
And then the other girls came back and said: Sir, sir, open the door for us! Luka
But the groom replied and said: In fact, I don’t know you.

That one who took a single pouch, went and dug a hole in the ground and hid the pouch given to him by his master.
And after a long time, the master of those slaves came back and accounted with them.
And he came to him who had taken five d’s and paid five d’s with them and said: You gave me five d’s, well, here are the other five d’s that I won.
He said to his master: I have nothing to ask you, you are a good and honest slave! You were honest with me a little and now I will entrust you with a lot, so come and be happy with your master.
And then, the one who got two shirts for himself said: “Sir, you gave me two shirts, well, here are two more that I won.”
He told his master: I have nothing to ask you for, you are a good and honest servant! You were honest with me a little and now I will ask you for a lot, so come and be happy with your master.
And then, he came across someone who had received a single bag and he said: Ah, my lord, I know that you are a hard man, you reap what you have not sown and you gather what you have not scattered,
And because of that I was afraid and hid your purse in the ground, and now here is your fortune.
And his master replied to him: But you are a hideous slave and a bastard! Don't you know that I harvest what I didn't sow and gather what I didn't do?
Well, you should have put my money with the money traders, so that when I come back I can take it with its profit.

And when did we see you strange and invited you? Or naked and we dressed you?
And when did we see you sick or in prison and we came to see you?
And the king answered them and said: I tell you the truth: every time you do this to one of these brothers of mine, because of their small status, you do it to me!

I was a stranger and you didn’t invite me, I was naked and you didn’t give me clothes, I was sick and imprisoned and you didn’t come to me.
And they will answer: O my Lord! When did we see you hungry or thirsty, or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not help you?

Chapter Twenty-Six: The Jews of Kechاورu to Kill Jesus
And when Jesus had finished all these words, he said to his disciples:
«You know that Easter is in two days, and the man will be crucified by the people.»
Your time, the heads of the religious men and the sheikhs of the people gathered in the house of Qayafa, the head of the religious men,
They consulted among themselves to take Jesus by trick and kill him,
But M'Bali: «We won't do that during the holiday, so as not to cause chaos among the people». The woman who anointed Jesus
And it came to pass, as Jesus was in the house, at the table, of Simon the leper,
He brought a woman close to him, she had an expensive perfume bottle and she sprayed it on his head when he was eating by the table of food. Luke
When they saw what their students had done, they were not happy and told them: «Why all this waste?
"As this scent could be sold for a high price, its cost is shared by the poor".
When Jesus knew what they were discussing among themselves, he said to them, “Why are you talking about it? She has done nothing to me but good.”
Because the poor are always with you, but I will not always be with you,
She put this scent on me, she put it on me so that I could be present at the funeral.
I tell you the truth: wherever this good news is proclaimed throughout the world, what this woman has done will be talked about and remembered. Judas agrees to hand over Jesus
For your time, one of the twelve disciples, called Judas Iscariot, went to the heads of the religious leaders,
And he said to them: «What are you going to give me if you hand me over?» And they agreed to give him thirty pieces of silver.
And from that time on, Judas sought the opportunity to betray Jesus. The Easter meal with the disciples
On the first day of the Paschal feast, the disciples came to Jesus and asked him: “Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal for you to eat?”
And he answered them and said: "Go to the city to such and such and tell him: As our master said to you: My time is drawing near, and I will come to spend Easter with you and my students."
And the disciples did as Jesus had instructed them and prepared the Paschal feast.
And when it was near evening, Jesus went out to the mount to eat with his twelve disciples.
And they were eating and drinking, and he said to them: «I tell you the truth: one of you will betray me».
The students' sadness was great and each of them started to ask himself: «Am I it, sir?»
And he answers them and says: «The one who has his hand in the bowl, that's the one who will hand me over!
Man is destined to die as it is written in the book of God, but woe to that man who will deliver man's son, it would have been better for him if he had never been born.
And he said to Judas who had agreed to deliver him: "Am I that, sir?" And Jesus answered him: "You said it." The Lord's supper
And as they were eating, Jesus took some bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave to the disciples, and said, “Take, eat; this is my body.”
And after God, the cup, and thanked God and gave it to them and said: “Drink from it all of you,
This is my blood, the blood of the covenant that will be shed for many people so that they can be forgiven for their sins.
And I tell you: from today, I will not drink this grape juice again until the day I drink it with you again in Pa's kingdom.
And after they had worshipped, they went out and looked towards Mount Olive; and
Jesus said to them, “This night all of you will be put to the test, for it is written: ‘I will gather the remnants of my flock.’”
But after I have suffered death, I will precede you to Galilee. Matthew
Peter answered him: “Even if they all complain about you, I’ll never doubt you!”
And Jesus said to him: “I tell you the truth: before the rooster crows on this night, you will disown me three times.”
And Peter replied: “Even if I have to die with you, I will never curse you!” This is what all the disciples said to him. Jesus is praying in the Garden of Gethsemane
At that time Jesus went with his disciples to a garden called Gethsemane, and he said to them: «Stay here while I go to pray!»
And after that he took Peter and James the son of Zebedee with him, and he began to feel sorrow and distress.
And he tells them: «I am very sad to the point of death, stay here and keep me company!».
And then he got up, prostrated and started to pray and said: «Oh my God! Can you please get up after this ordeal, but not the way I want, but the way you want».
And then he went back to the disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, "Could you not keep awake with me for one hour?"
Stay awake and pray so that you don't fall into the test, the soul is strong but the body is weak.
And he walked for the second time and prayed and said: «Oh, by God! I could not have gone through this without tasting it, so it is only your will».
And he came back and found them sleeping, because sleep had overcome them.
And he left them and went again, and he prayed for the third time and repeated the same words.
After that, he came to his pupils and said to them: «Are you still sleeping and at ease! The hour is near and the son of man will be delivered into the hands of the sinners,
Let’s go! There he is, the one who will greet me.
And while Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived with a large group armed with swords and clubs. He was sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
And the one who delivered it had given them a sign and said: «The man we are going to kiss is the one, catch him!»
Your servant at the hour near Judah to Jesus said: «Peace be upon you, my Lord!» and kissed him.
And he says to Jesus: “Why have you come, my friend!” And they come towards Jesus and seize him.
And one of those who stood by Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
And Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back into its place! For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.
What do you think, that I can't cry on my father and send you more than thirteen divisions of angels?
But how will the words in the Book of God, which say that this is how it should be, be realized?
And at that hour he said to the crowds, “You come here with swords and clubs to take me by surprise, as if I were a thief. I have been teaching you every day in the house of God, and you have not arrested me! Luke
But all that happened so that what is written in the books of the prophets would come true. And then the students all let him go and ran away. Jesus in the Jewish court
But those who had arrested Jesus led him to Caiaphas, the high priest, who was the seat of the Sanhedrin, the Jewish council of elders.
And Peter followed him from afar all the way to the house of the head of the clergy, and he entered and sat with the servants to see what would happen in the end.
And the chief priests and the elders of the court were looking for some false witness against Jesus, so that they might put him to death,
But they didn’t find it, even though they came with a lot of false witnesses. In the end, two witnesses came forward.
And they say: "This man said: I can build the house of God and in a few days I will erect it." John
And the priest and Solomon say: “Don’t you answer anything about what these men are saying against you?”
But Jesus remained silent, and he said to the high priest: “I came to you by the living God, unless I tell you: Who are you, the Christ, the Son of God?”
Jesus answered him: “You have said it! But I will tell you more: from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of God, who is able to do all things!”
And the clock struck the hour, the chief of the religious men said: «This is an apostasy! We have nothing more to do with the witnesses, you have just heard his blasphemous words.
“What do you think?”. He replied: “He deserves death!
They poured water on his face and beat him, and some of them slapped him
Naglu: “Come on, tell us, Jesus, who hit you?” Peter denies Jesus
Peter was on the outside, in the courtyard of the house, and a servant came to him and said: “Even you were with Jesus from Galilee!”
He turned to the whole audience and said: «I don’t know what you are saying!»
And then, he went to the entrance of the house and saw another servant, and told those who were there: «Even this one was with Jesus of Nazareth!»
Pierre denied it again and swore: «I don’t know this man!»
And after a while, those who were standing came and told Peter: “Without a doubt you are one of them, because it is clear from your speech!”
And he seemed to curse and swear and say: «I don't even know this man!» And that's when the rooster crowed.
Peter thought about the words that Jesus had said to him: «Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times». And he went out and wept greatly.
Chapter Twenty-seven
In the early morning, all the religious leaders and the heads of the people agreed to kill Jesus.
And they delivered him, and stripped him of his garments, and clad him with an scarlet robe. And when they had plucked out his eyes, they led him out, and killed him, and buried him in a vault. Judas Iscariot hanged himself
And when he saw Judah, who had betrayed him, he felt sorry and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders.
And he told them: “I was punished because I delivered an innocent man.” And he told him: “It’s not our business, sort it out yourself.”
And then Judah cast the silver trumpet into the house of God, and then he walked and hanged his head.
And they took the heads of the religious leaders and said: «It is not forbidden to put it in the box of the House of God, because it is the price of a human life».
They agreed to buy the Fakhari acre and make it a garden for foreigners,
And that's what they call this plot of land, Fadan Al-Dam, even today.
And at that hour you will do what God inspired the prophet Jeremiah to say: "Take thirty pieces of silver, the price at which they agreed to deliver him,
With this money they bought the potter’s field, as it was commanded to me by the Lord.” Jesus before the governor Pilate
And Jesus stood before the governor and said to him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” And he answered him, “I am.”
And when the heads of the religious men and the sheikhs accused him, he didn’t even respond to them.
He said to Pilate, “Did you not hear all these things they are testifying against him?”
And Jesus did not answer him even with one word, and this astonished the governor very much.
It was the custom of the governor that every Easter he would release one prisoner that the people wanted.
And they had a famous prisoner by the name of Jesus Barabbas.
And when the people had gathered, Pilate said to them, "Who do you want me to release for you, Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?"
For Pilate knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered him.
While Pontius Pilate was seated on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message, saying: “Be not so severe on the man, for I have had a very heavy burden upon me in a dream because of him today.”
But the chief priests and the elders provoked the crowd to ask Pilate to release Barabbas for them and to crucify Jesus.
And Pilate said to them, “Which of these two do you want me to release for you?’ They answered and said, “Barabbas!
And he says to them Pilate: “What shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?” And they all answered: “Let him be crucified!”
And he said to them: "What kind of evil house is this?", but they increased in their obstinacy and said to him: "It is a house of punishment!"
And when Pilate saw that it availed him nothing, but that the people rather cried out, he took water and washed his hands before the multitude, saying: “I am innocent of the blood of this just man; see to it yourselves!”
And the whole nation answered him and said: “Don’t make us and our children pay for it!”
Your men have just released the criminal, while Jesus is handed over to be crucified after being spitted on. The soldiers are laughing at Jesus.
And the governor’s soldiers took the governor to the governor’s palace, and gathered all the governor’s soldiers around him.
And he wore a red turban,
They braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and tied a reed to his right hand, and began to beat him and to laugh at him and to say to him: «Peace be upon you, O King of the Jews!»
They beat him up and took the cane and hit him with it on the head.
And after they had laughed at him, they stripped him of the robe and dressed him in his own garment, and led him out to crucify him. Jesus is being crucified
And as they were leaving the city, they met a man from Kairouan called Simon, and they made him carry the cross of Jesus.
They reached the place called Golgotha, which means the place of the skull.
They gave him wine mixed with a herb called mir, and when he tasted it he didn't want to drink it.
They crucified him and divided his belongings among themselves after they had beaten them with a stick.
And they kept on nagging him,
He had a sign above his head with the words written on it: “This is Jesus, the King of the Jews”.
And they crucified two of his donkeys, one on his right and the other on his left.
And the people passing by were mocking him while they were turning their heads
And if you will: "Oh, the one who left the house of God and will rebuild it in three days, if you are the son of God, come down from the cross!" Matthew
And the heads of the religious men, the scholars of the sharia and the sheikhs were also laughing at him and saying:
«Other people survived but he couldn’t save his own head! If he was the king of Israel, he would come down from the cross right now and we would believe in him!
Ya'ku tala 'allaah! Iwa ya'tqah dhabba il-la yabghih, hadi hiya qala: Ana wlad allah!
Even the shفار who were crucified with him mocked him like the others. The death of Jesus
Darkness fell on the whole country from noon until three in the afternoon.
With the three o’clock bell, Jesus cried out in a loud voice: “Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?” which means: “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”
And some of those who were standing there told him: “He’s calling for Elias”.
One of them took a piece of cloth, soaked it in water and put it on the head of a man's cane and gave it to him to drink.
And they said to each other: «Let’s wait and see if Elijah will save him!».
And again Got Jesus spoke loudly and died.
The pictures of the House of God on Google, from top to bottom. The earth quakes and the rock splits.
Graves are pleasant and many sanctified people from death follow them,
They came out of the graves after following Jesus from death, and entered into Jerusalem, the holy city, and appeared to many people.
The military chief and the soldiers who were sleeping with him saw the earthquake and everything that happened, they were very scared and said: "In truth, this man is the son of God".
And there were many women who had followed Jesus from Galilee who were making fun of him, looking on from a distance. Luke
Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. The tomb of Jesus
And in the evening, a man in rags came, his name was Joseph, and he was also a disciple of Jesus.
And this man came forward and approached Pilate, and asked him to give him the body of Jesus. And Pilate ordered him to give it to him.
And God took Joseph and his shroud,
And he put it in the new grave he had dug in the rock, and brought a large stone back to the door of the grave and walked away.
And Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting opposite the tomb. The stone was on the tomb.
And the next day, that is, after the day on which they prepared for the Sabbath, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate,
And he said to him: "We thought, my lord, that that liar, when he was alive, used to say that he would be followed after three days.
“So give the order for the tomb to be kept until the third day, so that his students don’t come at night and steal it and tell the people: I was followed by death! And this last lie will be worse than the first.”
And he says to them Pilate: “You have a guard, so go and sleep at the tomb as you wish.”
And they lit the chamber of the tomb and put a lid on it.
Chapter Twenty-Seven Jesus Followed from Death
And when the sabbath was past, and the first day of the week came, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.
And a strong earthquake struck, when the angel of the Lord came down from heaven and shook the chamber on the door of the tomb and sat on it.
His face was as bright as lightning and his clothes as white as snow.
The Asasawa trembled with fear and became like the dead.
But the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid! I know you are looking for Jesus, the one who was crucified,
We're not here, because he followed death as he said. Come and see where he was put.
He went quickly and told his students that he had been followed by death, and that he would precede them to the Hereafter, and that is where you will see him. “Well, I have told you.”
The women came out of the grave, very scared and very happy, and they ran to go tell the news to the students.
And he met them by surprise and said to them: “Peace be upon you!” And they came to him, and they tied his feet and fell down before him.
Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid! Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me.” The centurions were telling each other what had happened.
And as the women were going, some of the Easaa guards from the cemetery went to the city and informed the heads of the religious leaders of everything that had happened.
They gathered with the elders and consulted them about this, and they bribed the military with a lot of money,
And he told them: "Say that his pupils came at night and stole him while we were asleep,
Otherwise, the governor will bring the news, we will convince him and nothing bad will happen to you.
And the Romans took the money and did as they were told, and this news was passed on to the Jews even to this day. Jesus taught his disciples
The disciples of Jesus went to Galilee, to the mountain as he had commanded them, when
And they didn’t see them bowing to him, but some of them complained.
And drawing near, Jesus said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
Go, therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. The works
And teach them to do everything I have told you, and here I am with you for all the days, until the end of time.
Chapter 1: John the Baptist Prepares the Way for Jesus
This is the prophecy of the birth of Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
As it is written in the book of the prophet Isaiah:
A voice roars in the desert and says: «I'm going to send my messenger in front of you, who is going to show you the way.
And so John came to the desert to baptize people and to tell them about the baptism of repentance so that their sins would be forgiven. They found the way of the Lord, and they straightened his paths.
And all the people from the land of Judaea and Jerusalem came out to him and were baptized by him in the Jordan, while they confessed their sins.
John was wearing clothes made of camel hair, and he was girded with a leather belt, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
He would tell people: «After me, someone will come who is stronger than me, and I don’t even deserve to bend down to untie his shoelaces.
I am your baptism with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit. John baptizes Jesus
Your name is John, you are from Nazareth in Galilee, and you were baptized by John the Baptist on the Jordan River.
When he came out of the water, the sky opened up and the Holy Spirit descended on him like a dove.
And there came a voice out of the heavens, saying, “You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” Matthew 3:17; 12:18; Mark 9:7; Luke 3:22 Satan testing Jesus
And so it was that at the time when God’s Spirit left the body of Jesus,
And forty days and forty nights the devil tried him. And beasts were around him and angels mocked at him. Jesus preaches in Galilee
And after John had been put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God.
And Jesus answered and said to them, “Produce fruit fitting for repentance! And do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father,’ for I tell you that out of these stones God is able to raise up children to Abraham.” Matthew 3:2 Jesus chooses his first disciples
And as he was walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.
And he said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.”
And they left their window open and followed him.
شي increased a little bit when he saw Ya'qub, the son of Zibdi, and his brother John on the boat repairing their net.
And Jesus wept not over them, and they left their father Zebedee with the servants in the boat and followed him. Jesus healed a man who lived with a demon
And they went to Capernaum. And on the sabbath day he went into the synagogue and taught.
People were amazed by his education, because he taught them like someone who had authority, not like a religious scholar. When
There was a man living in a house next to the mosque, he started to scream
And he said: «What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to kill us? I know who you are: you are God's holy one!»
And Jesus arose, and rebuked the unclean spirit, and said unto him, “Be still, and come out of him!”
The jinn threw the man to the ground and started rolling around, and the jinn shouted with all his might and came out.
Everyone was astonished and started asking each other: «What is this? This is a new kind of education that is taught by force, even madness obeys when he orders them!».
And quickly the news about Jesus spread throughout all the country of Galilee. Jesus was healing Peter’s relative and many people.
And as they were going out of the temple, one of the servants said to Jesus, “Master, look, what wonderful stones and what temples!”
Nunsipha Simon was in bed with a fever, and they told Jesus about it.
He came close to her, took her hand and she got up. The fever left her, and they invited them.
At dusk, when the sun had set, people brought to Jesus all who had various diseases and were possessed by demons.
The city's people were gathered around the door.
Jesus healed many sick people of many diseases, and cast out many demons. He did not permit the demons to speak, because he knew them. Jesus was teaching
And Jesus got up early in the morning, while it was still dark, and went out and walked to a desolate place, and there he prayed.
And Siman and those with him started to look for him,
And when they found him, he said to them: «Most people are looking for you!»
And he said to them, “Let’s go to the neighboring villages, that I may proclaim the good news even there; for that is why I came.”
And he went about, preaching the gospel in their synagogues, and casting out devils. Mark 1:39; Luke 8:16 Jesus heals a man with leprosy
A leper came to him and, throwing himself on his knees, begged him, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."
He patted him on the back and said to him: «I wanted it, so be clean!»
