The First Chapter of the Ancestors of Jesus Christ
These are the names of Jesus Christ’s ancestors, David’s and Abraham’s:
Abraham the son of Isaac, and Isaac the son of Jacob, and Jacob the son of Judah and his brothers,
And Judah begat Pharez and Zarah of Tamar; and Pharez begat Hezron;
And Aram the son of Aminadab, and Aminadab the son of Nahshon, and Nahshon the son of Salmon,
And Salmon fathered Boaz of Rahab, and Boaz fathered Obed of Ruth, and Obed fathered Jesse.
Yisy, the son of David, the king. And David, the son of Solomon from the wife he married, Uriah.
And Solomon the son of David, and David the son of Jesse,
And Asa was the son of Uzziah; and Uzziah was the son of Joram; and Joram was the son of Ahab,
And Uzziah the son of Jotham, and Jotham the son of Ahaz, and Ahaz the son of Hezekiah,
And Hezekiah begat Manasseh, and Manasseh begat Amos, and Amos begat Josiah,
Yoysha, the son of Kenia, and his brothers were in the time when the Jews were exiled in the land of Babylon.
And after the Jews were returned from Babylon, Kennia the son of Shalthiel, and Shalthiel the son of Zerubbabel,
Zerahiah the son of Abihiah, and Abihiah the son of Sheshai, and Sheshai the son of Azariah,
And Azur son of Sadoc, and Sadoc son of Akim, and Akim son of Eliod,
And Eliud begat Eleazar, and Eleazar begat Matthan, and Matthan begat Jacob,
Jacob, the son of Joseph, is the husband of Mary, the mother of Jesus, who is called Christ.
All generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, and from David to the time when the Jews were exiled to Babylon are fourteen generations. And from the time when they were exiled to Babylon until the birth of Jesus Christ are fourteen generations. The birth of Jesus Christ
And so was born Jesus Christ: when Mary was betrothed to Joseph, and before they were married, she became pregnant by the Holy Spirit. Luke
And Joseph, her betrothed, was a God-fearing man who did not want to expose her, so he decided to part from her in secret.
While he was thinking about this, an angel of God appeared to him in a vision and said to him, “Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child in her womb is from the Holy Spirit.”
And she will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.” Luke
And all this happened so that the word of the Lord may be fulfilled by the prophet who said:
«Here the farm will bear a son, and he will be named Emmanuel», which means: God is with us.
And when Joseph awoke from his sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him and married Mary,
But he went in neither by day nor by night to the temple. And he did not lay his hand on any of those that were sick. Luke 2:21
Chapter 2 The scientists of the stars came to see Jesus
And when Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, in the days of King Herod, behold, some stars appeared to the east before Jerusalem.
Kissoulo: «Where is the king of the Jews who was born? Because we saw his star rising in the east and we came to worship him.»
And when King Herod heard this, he and the whole house were afraid.
All the heads of the religious men and scholars got together and asked: "Where was Christ born?"
And they replied: "In Bethlehem, in the land of the Jews, for that is where it is written in the prophecy of the prophet when he said:
And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, you are the smallest in the region of Judah, from where will come the one who will rule my people, Israel.
And after that he sent Herod to the wise men of the stars, and he questioned them about the time when the star appeared.
And then he sent them to Bethlehem and said to them: “Go and look for the child. And when you find him, come and tell me so that I can go and worship him.”
And when they heard the King's words, they went. And they saw the star they had seen in the East, which went before them until it stopped at the place where the child was and stood still.
They didn’t see the star, so they were very happy.
And when they entered the house, they saw the boy and Mary, and they fell down and worshipped him, and they opened their boxes and gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
And when they had seen the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh. And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way. The family of Jesus flee to Egypt
And after the scholars had left, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said to him: “Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.”
Yousef struggled and took the boy and me at night and went to Egypt.
And it remained so until the death of Herod to verify the word of the Lord through the prophet who said: “From Egypt I cried to my son.” Herod is killing small children
And when Herod saw that the wise men had come to pay him homage, he was greatly troubled, and he sent and killed all the little children that were in Bethlehem and its neighborhood, from two years old and under, because so it was his custom to do what the wise men had told him.
And so the word of the Lord was fulfilled, as the prophet Jeremiah said:
«From Ramah you hear cries, a lot of wailing and lamentation, Rachel is crying for her children and does not want anyone to console her, because her children have died». Jesus’ family is returning from Egypt
And when Herod saw that an angel of the Lord had given good news of the child to Joseph in a dream in Egypt,
He said to him: “Get up, take the boy and his mother and go back to Israel, because those who wanted to kill the boy are dead.”
And Joseph took his son and his mother and came to Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was ruling in the place of Herod his father, he was afraid to go back. And since he was warned by God in a dream, he went to the region of Galilee.
He went to a city called Nazareth and lived there, so that what was said through the prophets might be fulfilled: “He will be called a Nazorean.” Mark 1:24; Luke 2:39; John 1:45
Chapter 3: John the Baptist Prepares the Way for Jesus
And here is your brother, John the Baptist, in the wilderness of Judea, preaching to the people.
And he said to them, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
And this is the man the prophet Isaiah spoke of when he said: "A voice cries out in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths."
John’s clothes were made of fine hair, and he wore a leather belt, and he lived on locusts and wild honey.
And people were coming to him from Jerusalem, from all over Judea, from the region of the Jordan,
And they will repent of their sins at his hand.
And when John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to be baptized by him, he said to them, "You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
Well, let your good deeds be your repentance,
And don't be stupid: I am Abraham. I told you: God is capable of making children for Abraham out of this stone. John
And now the olive tree is planted on the walls, and every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown to the dogs. When
I will baptize you with water, but he who comes after me will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.
“He will study and gather wheat in his granaries, but he will burn the straw with the good fire that will never go out.” John baptizes Jesus
And after that, Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.
But John wouldn’t let him and said to him: «I need you to baptize me, and you come to me to baptize you?
Jesus answered him, “Let it be so now; for it is proper for us to fulfill all righteousness.” And he allowed John to be baptized.
And unintentionally, Jesus came out of the water, and the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him.
And from the heavens God said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.” Matthew 12:18; 17:5; Mark 1:11; Luke 9:35
Chapter Four: Satan Tests Jesus
And after that the Spirit of God Jesus went into the wilderness to be tempted by Satan. The Hebrews
He fasted for forty days and forty nights, and then hunger came.
And the devil came to him and said to him: "If you are the son of God, tell this stone to become bread."
And Jesus answers him: “It is written in the book of God: ‘Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”
And then, Satan went to the holy city of Jerusalem, and stood on a high place above the house of God,
He said: «If you are the son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written in the Book of God: God will command his angels to take care of you, and they will lift you up so that your foot does not strike a stone».
Jesus answered him, “It is written: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’”
And after the devil's descent, he went up to a very high mountain, and behind him were all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
He said to him: «I will give you all this wealth, except for my prayer and my worship».
And Jesus answers him: «Get lost, Satan! It is written in God’s book: you shall worship the Lord your God, and him only you shall serve.»
After that, Satan left him, and some angels came and were mocking him. Jesus is preaching in Galilee
And when Jesus heard that John the Baptist was put in prison, he withdrew into Galilee. Matthew
And Nazareth was left, and he went and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the country of Zabulon and Naphtali: John
And so this is what the prophet Isaiah said:
«In the land of Zebulun and in the land of Naphtali, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, in the land of the Gentiles, the people of the land of Galilee of the Gentiles!»
The people who were walking in the dark saw a great light, and those who live in the land of death and in the middle of it, one light was shone on them.
And from that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Matthew 3:2 Jesus chooses his first disciples
And as he was going along by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who was called Peter and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.
And Jesus said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.”
And they left their window open and followed him.
And then, he saw two other brothers, James and John, with their father Zebedee, in a boat mending their nets.
And they left the boat and their father and followed Jesus. Jesus was teaching and healing
And Jesus went about through all the cities and villages of the Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease. Matthew
He said farewell to all of Syria, and brought all the sick who suffer from the disease: the possessed, those with the wind, the wanderers, and he healed them.
And many groups from Galilee, the ten tribes, Jerusalem, and the land of Judea followed him, as well as on the other side of the Jordan.
Chapter 5: The Sermon on the Mount
And when he saw the crowds, he went up on a mountain, and when he was seated his disciples came to him.
And he seemed to teach them and said:
“Happy are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”
Happy those who are crying, because God will console them.
The happiness of the humble, because they will inherit the earth.
Happy are those who are hungry and thirsty for God's obedience, for they will be satisfied.
Those who pity them, God will pity them.
Happy are those whose hearts are pure, for they will see God.
It is a blessing to help people live well, because they will be called God's children.
Happy are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 1 Peter 3:14
And may your joy be full. Let not the sun go down on your anger, and give not place to the devil. 1 Peter 4:14
Frahou and fly with joy because of the great reward in the heavens, for they have violated the prophets who came before you. Acts 7:52 The salt of the earth and the light of the world
«You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has become tasteless, with what shall it be seasoned? It is no longer good for anything but to be thrown out and trodden by men. Mark 9:50; Luke 14:34, 35
We are the light of the world, a city on a hill cannot be hidden. John
And there's no one who lights the candle and puts it under the bucket of the lantern, but it is put in its place so that it lights up everyone in the house. Markos
So let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and give praise to your Father in heaven. Matthew 5:16
«It is not my intention to remove the law of Moses or the books of the prophets, but to complete them.
And I tell you the truth: the heavens and the earth will pass away, but not a single letter or a single dot will pass away from the law until all that is contained in it has come to pass. Luke
Whoever does not do one of these small commandments and teaches people to do likewise, will be the smallest in the kingdom of heaven. Whoever does it and teaches it to people, will be great in the kingdom of heaven.
And I tell you: unless your obedience is greater than that of the religious scholars and the Pharisees, you will never enter the Kingdom of Heaven.
«Did you hear what the judge said to the first people: You don’t kill, and whoever kills should be sentenced.
But I will tell you: anyone who worries about his brother should judge him, and anyone who says to his brother: "You are of no use", should be judged in the great court. And anyone who says to his brother: "You fool", deserves the fire of Hell.
Otherwise, I’ll bring your gift and put it on the altar and I’ll think of you as right in your claim for your brother’s sake.
Put your gift in front of the altar and go reconcile with your brother first, then come give your gift.
Make peace with the one who is angry with you, none of you are left on the road to the court, before you get to the judge, and the judge puts you in the hands of the gendarme, and the gendarme puts you in jail.
I’ll tell you the truth: you won’t get out of here until you pay the last rial you owe. Corruption
«And you heard him say: Don’t spoil it.
But I tell you: anyone who looks at a woman to lust after her, he has already corrupted himself with her in his heart.
Otherwise, your right eye would be thrown to you as a sin, take it and throw it on you, so that you lose a part of yourself or all of yourself is thrown into hell. When
“If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire.” Matthew 18:8; Mark 9:43 Divorce
“And if a man divorces his wife, he should give her her mahr (dowry). When
But I tell you: whoever divorces his wife for any reason except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery. And whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. Matthew 19:9; Mark 10:11,12; Luke 16:18; 1 Corinthians 7:10,11
«And you heard again what your grandfather said: if you swear not to go down, but you die for your oaths.
As for me, I will tell you: never swear, not even by the sky, because it is the throne of God, Jacob
Neither in the earth, where his feet are, nor in Jerusalem, where his throne is, shall he be.
And don’t swear by yourself either, because you can’t turn one hair gray or white.
But if it's not that, then it's from the devil.
«And you heard the saying: an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
But I tell you: don’t return the bad, but whoever slaps you on the right cheek, turn the other one to him too.
And if someone wants to sue you to get your caftan, let them have your chamois too.
Otherwise, one person will force you to go with him a thousand steps, go with him two thousand.
If someone asks you for something, give it to him, and if someone wants to borrow something from you, don’t turn him down.
«And you heard it said: love your neighbor and hate your enemy.
But I will tell you: you want your enemies, and pray for those who are attacking you.
So that you are the sons of your Lord in the heavens. Because He makes His sun rise on the evil and the good, and He sends down the rain on the doers of good and the doers of evil.
If you only love those who love you, what merit do you have? Is it not even the tax payers who do this?
Otherwise, you just shake hands with your brothers alone. What makes you better than the others? What is it that even those who worship idols do like this?
“And all of you, as much as there is in the sky.”
Chapter 6: Zakat
«Be careful, don’t do good in front of people so that they see you, or you will not have any reward with your Lord who is in the heavens. When»
And if you want to give some charity, don't do it in front of people like the hypocrites do in the streets and in the mosques to be thanked by people. I tell you the truth: they got their reward from people.
But you didn't give me anything in charity, your left hand doesn't know what your right hand is doing,
So that your charity remains in secret, and He who is in the heavens, to whom nothing is hidden, is He who will reward you.
And pray, do not be like the hypocrites, who like to pray standing in their houses of prayer and at the crossroads so that people can see them. I tell you the truth: they have received their reward from people. Luke
When you pray, go to your house, close the door and pray to your father who is in the secret, and your father who does not escape from him, he is the one who will reward you.
And when you pray, do not repeat empty words as those who used to worship idols, thinking that the more they spoke, the more God would answer them.
“Don’t be like them, because only those in the sky know what you need before you ask for it.”
And this is how you pray this prayer: Our Father who art in heaven,
And your kingdom will come, and your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
The bread that feeds us today,
And He forgives us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us,
We saved ourselves from falling into the experiment, and we escaped from the devil.
Unless you forgive the faults of others, your faults in the sky will be forgiven.
“But unless you forgive people their mistakes, you will not be forgiven for your mistakes in the sky.” Fasting
«If you keep quiet, you will not look like hypocrites who smile to show people that they are fasting. I tell you the truth: they have earned their reward from people.
But when you fast, anoint your heads and wash your faces,
“Even if you are not fasting in front of people, your Lord who is in the heavens knows.” Treasures in the sky
«Do not amass for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal. James
But you have treasures in the sky, where the rust and the worm do not go, and where the thieves do not dig and do not steal.
“Wherever your treasure is, there your heart will be also.” نور الدات
«The eye is the lantern of the soul. If your eye is good, your whole body will be illuminated.
But if your eyes are ugly, your whole face will be dark. And if the light in you is darkness, how hard it is for that darkness to shine! God and money
«No one can be a slave to two masters, either he will hate one of them and want the other, or he will be loyal to one of them and fall for the other. And the same goes for you, you can't be a slave to God and money. Don't worry about it»
And that's what I want to tell you: don't worry about your food or your clothes, or about your family. Is life not more important than food, and your family more important than clothes?
Look at the birds in the sky, they don't sow, they don't reap, they don't gather in granaries, and yet what is in the sky feeds them. Well, aren't we much better than them?
Who among you has the courage to add an hour to his age?
And why do you prefer to suffer for clothes? Look well at the rose in the field how it grows, it does not suffer nor spin.
But I have to tell you the truth: even Solomon in his own glory, he never wore anything like these flowers.
Hey, you guys with your faith! If the spring that we see today, and tomorrow it is thrown in the fire, dressed by God like that, how could you be better dressed than us?
And for all that, do not worry and be anxious: What are we going to eat? Or what are we going to drink? Or what are we going to wear?
Even those who do not know God ask for all this, and He who is in the heavens knows that you need all this.
But look back to the Kingdom of God and its purpose, and all of this will be added to you.
And don’t burden yourself with worries about tomorrow, leave tomorrow’s worries for tomorrow. And every day just burden yourself with your worries.
Chapter seven, don’t judge anyone
«Do not judge anyone, so that no one will judge you.
Wherever the judges rule, they will rule over you, and whatever the expression you use, that is how you will be expressed. Markos
Why do you see the straw in your brother's eye, but you don't pay attention to the stick in your own eye?
And how are you going to tell your brother to let me remove the straw from your eye, and you have a stick in your eye?
Ah, hypocrite, take the stick out of your eye first, then you'll see well enough to take the straw out of your brother's eye.
“Don’t give the sacred thing to the dogs, they will bite you, and don’t throw your essence to the allies, they will step on it.” Ask, look, and knock
«Ask and you shall receive. Turn your heart and you shall find. Knock on the door and it shall be opened to you.
Whoever asks for it will be given it, whoever looks for it will find it, whoever knocks on the door will be let in.
Who of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?
And he only asked for a snake and he would give it to him?
Well, if you’re not good at it, you know how to give your children good things, how can you not give good things to those who ask for them?
As you wish people to do with you, so also you must do with them, for by this the Law and the Prophets are fulfilled. Luke 6:31 The Narrow Gate
«They entered through the narrow door, because the door that leads to destruction is wide and its path is easy, and many enter through it.
How narrow the door and how rough the road that leads to life, and few find it. The tree knows from its fruit.
«Pay attention to the lying prophets, who come to you wearing the clothes of sheep, but are wolves from inside.
My way, you know them. Can you pluck grapes from thorns, or pomegranates from the acacia tree?
So every good tree bears good fruit, and every bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot give bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot give good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown away. When
“And so that you may know them.” Matthew 12:33 We need to do God’s will
“The one who told me: ‘Sir, sir! He is going to enter the Kingdom of the heavens’, but the one who enters it is the one who does the will of the one in the heavens.”
I would give anything for someone to say to me: Sir, Sir! Was it your name that predicted it? And your name that made us crazy? And your name that made us do many miracles?
I’ll tell them: I never knew you! Get away from me, you city people! Two houses
The one who listens to my words and follows them, is like a man who built his house on a rock.
And when the rain came down and the fields were full, a strong wind blew and the house didn't hold, because its foundation was built on rock.
And the one who hears my words and does not act according to them, is like a stupid man who built his house on sand.
And how the rain fell and the fields were flooded, and a strong wind blew and the roof was torn off, it was a real mess and the snow was really deep.
And when Jesus had finished speaking, the people were filled with wonder at his teaching. Mark
For he would teach them like a man in power, not like their religious scholars.
Chapter eight Jesus saves the old man
And when Jesus had ended his instruction, he descended from the mountain, and great multitudes followed him.
One of the people present was a magus, and he prostrated himself and said: «O my Lord, if you wish, you can make me pure».
And he stretched out his hand and touched him and said: “I wanted him to be clean!” And at that moment his leprosy left him and he was clean.
Jesus said to him, “Be careful that you do not say this to anyone, but go and show it to the priest, and give the offering that Moses prescribed, so that it may be a witness for them.” The soldier’s master is sick
And when Jesus came into Capernaum, a captain of the guard, desiring to see him, came,
He said: «My servant in the house is in bed, paralyzed and in a lot of pain».
And he says to Jesus: “I’m going to go and cure him.”
The military chief replied: «I don't deserve you to come under my roof, but say one word and my servants will kill you.
Even I have someone who rules over me and I have an army that I rule over, I would say to him: Go! And he would go, and I would say to the other: Come! And he would come, and I would say to my servant: Do this! And he would do it.
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, “I tell you the truth, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith!”
And I say to you, many will come from the east and the west, and will take their place with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. Luke
As for those who should have been in the Kingdom, they are thankful outside in the dark, where is the crying and gnashing of teeth. When
And after that, Jesus said to the captain of the army: “Go! As much as your faith has helped you, so will it be with you.” And at that very moment, the servant was healed. Jesus healed the cousin of Peter and many people
And when Jesus came into the house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
And Jesus took her by the hand, and the fever left her, and she got up and received him.
And when the evening came, many people came to him possessed by demons, and he expelled the demons with a word, and healed all the sick.
Thus the words of the prophet Isaiah are fulfilled: “He took our sicknesses and carried our diseases.” How should those who follow Jesus behave?
And when Jesus saw the crowd surrounding his disciples, he ordered them to go to the other side of the sea.
He approached one of the religious scholars and said to him: «My Lord, I will follow you wherever you go».
Jesus answered him and said, “The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.”
He said to another of his disciples: «My Lord, let me go and bury him».
But Jesus answered him, “Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead!” Jesus calms a trembling
And when Jesus had taken leave of his own disciples, he departed and went up into the mountain; and when he was seated his disciples came to him.
A very strong wind came from the sea and filled the boat so much that Jesus was sleeping.
They drew near to him his disciples and woke him up and said to him: «We are saved, my Lord, for we are perishing!»
And he says to them: “What are you afraid of, you weak of faith?”. And then he stood up and calmed the wind and the sea, and the world was pacified.
Men were astonished and said: “Who is this man, whom even the wind and the sea obey?” Jesus casts out the madness from two men suffering from leprosy
And when Jesus had crossed over the sea to the other side, he met two madmen coming out of the tombs. They were so dangerous that no one could pass that way.
And they started to get angry and say to each other: «What do we have to do with you, you son of a bitch? What are you doing here to torture us before our time?».
And one of the pieces of the Halaf was large and grazing in a place near here,
They wanted Jesus to go crazy and told him: «If you don’t take us out, we’ll go and enter the piece of land of the infidels».
And he says to them: «Go!» and they went in, and the whole boat was pulled and fell from the edge of the mountain into the sea and sank in the water.
And they escaped, went to the city and told them everything that happened, and everything that happened to the men who were taken crazy.
And the whole town went out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they wanted him to leave their region.
Chapter 9 Jesus Heals a Paralytic
And Jesus got into the boat, and went to the other side; and his disciples were amazed at this.
They brought to him a man who was paralyzed. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man: «Be of good cheer, son, your sins are forgiven.»
Some of the religious scholars thought: «This man is saying blasphemous things!»
And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, “Why are you thinking such things in your hearts?
As-Sahil, it-tughall: forgiven for your sins, or it-tughall: get up and go?
But I will show you that the son of man has the power on earth to forgive sins.” He said to the paralytic, “Get up, take your bed and go home.”
The man struggled and walked to his house.
And when they saw the crowds, they were afraid and gave praise to God, and they gave praise to God in the highest, and they said: “To whom shall we give praise in the assembly of the saints? To whom shall we give praise in the congregation of the people? To whom shall we give praise? To whom shall we give praise? To whom shall we give praise? To whom shall we give praise? Jesus chooses when
And as he was going along, he saw a man named Matthew the tax collector, sitting at the tax office. And he said to him, "Follow me." And he got up and followed him.
And after Jesus had eaten in the house of Matthew, many collectors of taxes and sinners came to him and were eating with him and his disciples. Luke
And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, «Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?»
And when Jesus heard them, he answered and said: “It is not those who are well who need a physician, but those who are sick.”
Go and learn the meaning of this: “I wanted mercy, not sacrifice, because I have not come to call the righteous, but the sinner.” The question is about fasting
And some came down from Judea and asked him, “Why do our teachers of the law and the Pharisees fast so much, but your disciples do not?”
Jesus answered them and said, “Can the guests at the wedding feast be sad while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will be sad.”
Even if one repairs an old dress with a new patch, the patch will shrink and the tear will get bigger.
And not even one makes new wine in old skins in front of them, because if they did, the wine would be ruined and the skins would be ruined. But we make new wine in new skins, so that neither the wine nor the skins are lost.” The president’s daughter and the woman who touched Jesus’ garments
And when he was telling them this, a president came to him and prostrated himself and said: «My daughter just died, but come and put your hand on her and she will come back to life».
And Jesus went about doing good, and healing, and driving out devils.
And there was one sick woman, twelve years she had been flowing with blood, came up behind Jesus and touched his garment.
She thought to herself: "I will only touch his things to get well".
Jesus looked around and said, "Believe me, daughter, your faith has made you well." And at that, the woman was made well.
And when Jesus came to the house of the chief, and saw the noise and the crowd,
He told them: «Get out of here! The girl is not dead, she’s just sleeping!», and they laughed at him.
And when Jesus had dismissed them, he went in and took her by the hand, and she arose.
I bid farewell to all the news. Jesus heals two blind men
And as Jesus was going along, two blind men followed him, crying out, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”
And when he came to the house, he approached the blind men. And Jesus asked them, “Do you believe that I can heal you?” And they answered him, “Yes, Lord!”
And the clock struck midnight, Jesus looked at their eyes and said: «You will have what you want, as much as your faith will allow you».
And they were so pleased with themselves, that Jesus said to them: «Do not tell anyone!»
But they went out and started spreading the news in all that area. Zizon is recovering
And where were they going to take the blind, when they brought him a man with a big nose and crazy.
And when Jesus had cast out the unclean spirit, the syrophoenician woman said: «We never saw it like this in Israel!»
The Pharisees said to him, “This fellow drives out demons by the prince of demons!” Matthew 10:25; 12:24; Mark 3:22; Luke 11:15 Jesus’s tribulation
And Jesus went about in all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and every sickness. Matthew
And when he saw the crowds of people, he had compassion for them, for they were weary and scattered about as sheep having no shepherd. Mark
And he says to his disciples: “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Luke
“They asked the owner of the harvest to send his harvest to his harvest.”
Chapter 10 Jesus sends his twelve disciples
And after wept Jesus on his twelve disciples and gave them the power to cast out devils and to heal people from every sickness and every disease.
And these are the names of the twelve apostles: the first among them was Simon, called Peter, and his brother Andrew, and James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother,
and Philip and Bartholomew and Thomas and Matthew paid the tax, and James the son of Alphaeus and Judas Iscariot,
And Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot who betrays Jesus.
Jesus sent out these twelve and gave them instructions: “Do not go into the territory of the Gentiles, and do not enter a Samaritan town.
But go to the yellow sheep of the people of Israel,
And through your way inform the people that the time of the Kingdom of the heavens is near.
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, and cast out the demons. Take nothing, give nothing.
You don’t take gold, silver, or copper in your pockets,
No bundle, no two clothes, no shoes, no cane, for the servant is worthy of his food. 1 Corinthians 9:14; 1 Timothy 5:18
And the city or the village you entered, just ask for someone who deserves to entertain you, and stay with them until you leave.
Otherwise, enter any house, and greet its owner.
Otherwise, the owners of the house deserve your peace, your peace should reach them. Otherwise, they do not deserve it, your peace should come back to you.
Otherwise they wouldn’t have accepted you in any house or city and they wouldn’t have listened to your words. Get out and blow the dust off your feet. The works
I tell you the truth: on the day of judgment, the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah will be less severe than that of this town.” Luke 10:4-12 The coming onslaught
«I’ll send you like sheep in the wilderness, then you’ll be like the antelope, and as nice as doves. Louqa»
They will bring a lot of people against you, because they will take you to court, and their prayers will hit you, Mark.
And they will bring you before the governors and kings for a witness against them and against the nations that are not of the Jews.
And don't make me tell you not to throw it away, neither how nor what you're going to say, because at that time I'll tell you what you're going to say.
It's not me who is going to speak, but the spirit of my ancestors in the sky who will give you the words you are going to say.
خو غيسلم خوه باش يتقتل، والبو غيسلم ولده باش يتقتل، والولاد غينوضو ضد والديهم وغيقتلوهم، مرقس
And most people hate me because of my name. But the one who remained steadfast until the end is the ginger. When
But if they attack you in a city, flee to another. I tell you the truth: do not go looking for any Israeli blogger until the Son of Man comes.
«The student is not better than his teacher, nor the servant better than his master. Luke
It is better for a student to be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. Otherwise, if they call the master of the house Beelzebub, what will they call his household? Matthew 9:34; 12:24; Mark 3:22; Luke 11:15
Don’t be afraid of them, because all that is covered is going to be revealed, and all that is hidden is going to be shown. Marcus
And for that, what I told you at night, say it during the day. And all that you heard in secret, spit it out from the rooftops.
Don’t be afraid of those who kill the body and cannot kill the soul, but be afraid of the one who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
Two birds for a single dirham! But not one of them will fall to the ground unless you want it.
Even if we haven’t reached the top of your head, it’s all accounted for.
Well, don’t be afraid, you are better than many birds.
Whoever recognizes me in front of people, I will recognize him in front of my father in the heavens.
But he who will deny me before men, I will also deny before my Father who is in heaven.” 2 Timothy 2:12 Come and see
“You think I came here to make heaven on earth? I didn’t come to make heaven, I came with a sword.”
I came to distinguish between the boy and his father, and between the girl and her mother, and between the doll and her grandmother.
And they will be the ones who will be left behind.
Whoever loves his father or mother more than me, does not deserve me. Whoever loves his son or daughter more than me, does not deserve me.
And whoever does not take up his cross and follow me does not deserve me. When?
For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life on my account will save it. Matthew 16:25; Mark 8:35; Luke 9:24; 17:33; John 12:25
«Whoever welcomed you, welcomed me, and whoever welcomed me, welcomed that one who sent me. Luke
And whoever welcomes a prophet while knowing he is a prophet, will receive a prophet's reward. And whoever welcomes a God-fearing person while knowing he is God-fearing, will receive a God-fearing person's reward.
“Whoever gives one of these children even a glass of cold water will be rewarded, because this is my student, I tell you, he will not go to waste in his reward.”
Chapter 12: John the Baptist Sends His Disciples to Jesus
And when Jesus had finished giving the twelve disciples the instructions, he went away to teach and proclaim the good news in the Jewish region.
And when John heard him in prison about what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples to ask him.
He said to him: «Is it you who is coming, or are we waiting for another one?
Jesus answered them, and said, Go your way, and tell John all those things which ye have heard and seen:
The blind are seeing, the lame are walking, the maimed are clean, the deaf are hearing, the dead are alive, and the poor are hearing the good news.
And that's the one who doesn't cheat.
When the disciples of John had left, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John and said: “What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
And what did you come out to see? Is it a man wearing thin clothes? Because those who wear thin clothes, they live in the palaces of kings!
What did you go out to see? A prophet? I tell you, he is a prophet and more than a prophet.
And that is what God said in his book: I will send my prophet before you, who will show you the way.
I tell you the truth: I have not seen among the women born a better than John the Baptist, but the little one in the kingdom of heaven is better than him.
And from John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force. Luke
And the prophets prophesied until the time of John the Baptist.
Except you are the Christ, then John the Baptist is Elijah who must come. Matthew
Well, if you have two ears, listen!
But how are we going to explain this generation to Ash? It's like the kids in the market shouting at each other and saying:
We inflated the lira for you and you didn’t dance, and we called you and you didn’t cry!
Here comes John, and he doesn't eat or drink, and he says: This is a demon.
Man was created to eat and drink, and they say: “This is a drinker and a smoker and a companion of those who pay taxes and are in debt!”, but the wisdom of God is good in its yield. Oh woe to the blogger who does not repent!
And at that time, Jesus seemed to be more popular than other bloggers, because their followers did not repent.
«Oh, poor Korzen! Oh, poor Beit Saida! If the miracles that have been done to you had been done to Sur and Fassida, how long it would have been since they had been done to them, and if they had worn sackcloth and sat on ashes # 11:21: to show their repentance.
But I will tell you: the punishment of a photographer and a blogger in the Day of Reckoning will be lighter than the punishment of you.
Went A Kafr-Nahoum! What are you going to do even to the sky? You are going to crash even into the abyss. Because if the miracles that were done in Sodom had been done to you, they would not have destroyed it and it would have remained until today.
And I say to you: the fate of Sodom will be lighter on the day of judgment than your fate. Matthew 10:15; Luke 10:12 Come to me and be at rest
At that hour Jesus said: “I give thanks to you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for having hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and for having revealed them to little children.”
O Lord, this was your will.
The Father has given everything to the Son, and nobody knows who the Son is, except the Father, and who the Father is, except the Son, and the one whom the Father wants to reveal to him. John 3:35; John 1:18; 10:15
Come to me, you who are tired, all of you who carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest.
Shake my stick over you and learn from me, because I am kind and modest, and you will find peace for your souls.
“My burden is light and my load is easy.”
Chapter 11: Jesus Teaches on the Sabbath
On one Saturday, Jesus went through a field of grain, and his disciples were hungry and began to cut the heads of the grain and eat.
And when the Pharisees saw them, they said to him, "See your disciples doing things that they are not supposed to do on the Sabbath!"
He replied: "Didn't you read what David did when he and those with him got hungry?
And how did he enter the House of God, and eat the bread that was offered to God, which neither he nor those with him, except for the priests, were supposed to eat?
And didn't you read in the Torah that the priests, when they serve in the house of God on the Sabbath, violate the Sabbath, and yet, despite that, they are not to be blamed?
But I tell you: there is someone here who is older than the House of God.
If you understood the meaning of the verse that says: I want mercy, not sacrifice, you would not have judged those who are not to blame.
“Where man was created, there is the Lord of the Sabbath.” Jesus heals on the Sabbath
And he walked from Tim and came to their mosque,
They found a man whose hand was paralyzed. They asked him: «Is it allowed to cure on Saturday?» They asked him so that they could find something on him.
And he answered them, “Except one of you has a sheep that fell into a pit on the Sabbath, will you take hold of it and lift it out? Luke
Well, the value of a human being is much more than that of a sheep! That's why doing good is allowed on Saturday.
Jesus said to the man with the paralyzed hand, “Stretch out your hand!” And he stretched it out, and it was restored, like the other.
The Pharisees discussed how to kill him. Jesus is the chosen one of God
And when Jesus heard of it, he departed the next day, and went into the country of the Gadarenes. And many of the multitude followed him, and they were healing every one that had any sickness.
And he ordered them not to tell anyone about it.
So that the words of the prophet Isaiah may be fulfilled:
«Here is my servant whom I have chosen, my dear one whom I love. I will put my spirit upon him, and he will make the nations know the truth.
He won’t fight and won’t shout, so no one will hear his voice in the alleys.
A broken stick will not be mended, and a wick that lets out smoke will not be extinguished, until the truth prevails.
“In the name of God, the peoples will do their best.” Jesus and Belzebub
They brought to Jesus a man who had a withered hand. They also brought a man who was possessed by a demon, blind and mute.
And the groups of people were astonished and said: «Is this Ben David?»
And when the Pharisees heard it, they said, “This fellow does not cast out devils except by Beelzebub, the prince of devils.” Matthew 9:34; 10:25
And Jesus, understanding their thoughts, said to them: “Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and every divided household falls.
Well, if the devil is going to come out, the devil will divide and turn against himself, and if he divides and turns against himself, how will his kingdom remain stable?
Otherwise, I would be like Baalzebul, and drive you all mad. So who is this one that your sons are using to drive you mad? Because of this, it is your sons who will judge you.
But if I am the spirit of God, I will bring out the madness, the kingdom of God is in the middle of you.
How can someone enter someone else’s house and steal his things without even tying his shoes, and then steal his house?
Whoever walks with me is against me, and whoever does not come together with me is separating. Mark 9:40
That's why I told you: every sin and every blasphemy will be forgiven to people, but the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
“Whoever says anything against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, in this world or in the one to come.” Luke 12:10 The tree and its fruit
«Planting a good tree is good and it will bear good fruit, and planting a bad tree is bad and it will bear bad fruit. It is from the fruit that you will know the tree.»
A trika el-لفاعي! How can you say something good when you are not good? That which comes from the heart is what the mouth speaks. متى
A good person brings out the good things from the good treasure in his heart, and a bad person brings out the bad things from the bad treasure in his heart.
And I tell you: all this empty talk people make, they will be held accountable for it on the Day of Reckoning.
“With your words, you will either be punished by the law or by the people.” The scholars of the law and the Pharisees wanted to see a sign.
And some of the religious scholars and Pharisees said to him: «O Lord, we want to see a sign from you». When
And he says to them, "An ugly and corrupt generation asks for a sign! And no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. Matthew
That's how Greece was in the belly of the whale for three days and three nights, that's how the son of man will be in the belly of the earth for three days and three nights.
The people of Nineveh will follow them in the Day of Reckoning and bear witness against them, because they turned back when they were warned by Greece, and here is now one of the remnants of Greece.
And the Queen of the South is going to follow the day of reckoning with this generation and bear witness to it, because she came from a distant land to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and here is now one of Solomon's favors.
The road to get the gen out of people goes around places without water, he looks for comfort and he doesn't find it,
And he said: I will go back to my house that I left, and he will go back to it and find it empty, cleaned and arranged.
And Kimchi and Kedi with him have seven more idiots worse than him. And when they enter, they settle in, and that bastard's situation becomes worse than his first one. That's what's going to happen to this generation that does evil as well». Jesus' brothers and Me
And when he was talking to the groups of people, Me and my brothers came and stood outside wanting to talk to him.
He tells one of the attendees: “There you are and your brothers standing outside wanting to talk to you.”] # 12.47 This verse is not found in many of the old manuscripts
And Jesus answered him and said: “Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?”
He pointed to his students and said: “Behold my son and my brother,
Those who do the will of God in heaven, are my brother and sister and mother.
The chapter of the farmer's metal
And he went away by himself to a mountain, and when it was evening, he was there.
A great crowd of people gathered about him, and getting into a boat, he sat in it on the sea. And the crowds of people stood on the shore. Luke 5:1-3
He repeated many things to them with matoul and gal: “This is a man who went out to plant,
And while he was planting, some seeds fell on the way and the birds came and ate them.
And there were other seeds that fell on a stony ground where there was not much soil, and they sprouted quickly because the soil was not deep.
And when the sun rises, they burn, and since they have no walls, they dry.
And other seeds fell in the middle of the thorns, and when the thorns grew, they choked them.
And there were other seeds that fell on good ground and yielded a harvest, some of which yielded a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty.
“If you have two ears, listen!” The purpose of the مولّد (mūllid)
They brought his disciples to him and said to him: “Why are you speaking to people in a foreign language?”
And he answered them, saying, “To you it is given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.”
Whoever has, will be given to him and he will be increased more than he measures. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him. When
And I was talking to them in French because they don't see what they don't see, and they don't hear what they don't hear and they don't understand.
And thus the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled in them: Although you hear what is said to you, you do not understand it, and although you see what you see, you do not recognize it.
For their hearts are hard, their ears are deaf, and their eyes are closed, so that they may not see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, nor understand with their heart, and be healed.
But we are happy for your eyes because they see, and for your ears because they hear. Luke
“I tell you the truth: many prophets and righteous people have wished to see what you see and have not seen it, and to hear what you hear and have not heard it.” The meaning of the example of the farmer
«Just listen to you, you understand the meaning of the example of the man who is planting:
Those who hear the words of the Kingdom of God and do not understand them, the devil comes and snatches what is sown in their heart, and that is what I compare to the seed that fell on the path.
And whoever sows in the stony ground, this is he who hears the word and accepts it with joy,
But the word of God was not well received in his heart, and his faith remained only for a short time, and when problems and adversity occur, he quickly abandons his faith.
And the one that is planted in the middle of thorns, is the one who listens to the words of God, but the world and the love of money suffocate the words of God in it and do not give a yield.
That one that is planted in good soil, that is the one that hears and understands God's word and that is the one that bears fruit, sometimes a hundred times over, sometimes sixty times over, sometimes thirty times over. The example of the wheat in the field
And Jesus gave them another parable, saying: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
And when the people were asleep, his enemy came and sowed wheat in the corn and went away.
And when the crops came up and the shoots came out, the weeds came up along with them.
And they went to the master of the house's servants and told him: Sir, isn't it the good seeds that you planted in your field? So where did these weeds come from?
And he answers them: This is an enemy who did this. And his servants say to him: Do you want us to go and remove him?
And he answered them and said: No! So that the wheat does not get mixed with the chaff.
Let the mustard grow with the wheat until the time of harvest, and then we will tell the harvesters to gather the wheat first and make bundles of it so that it can be burnt, while the mustard is gathered and taken to my storehouse». The example of the mustard seed and the example of the yeast
And he gave them another example: “The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and planted in his field.
And even though she is the smallest of them all in love, as she grows she becomes a tree bigger than the rest of the plantation, and even the birds from the sky come to nest in her branches.
He gave them another example and said: “The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about three kilograms of flour until the whole batch was leavened.”
And all this was Jesus teaching the crowds in the synagogue. And if he had not been teaching them, he would not have told them anything.
So that the words of the Prophet may be fulfilled: “With the muluk we will speak and tell of everything that was hidden from the day the world was created.” The meaning of the example of the muluk
And when it was evening, Jesus left the crowds and went back home. And his disciples came to him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field!”
And he answered them and said: “He who sows good seed is man,
And the fadan is the world, and the good wheat is the children of the Kingdom of God, and the tares are the children of the devil,
The enemy that sows tares is Satan, the harvest is the end of times, and the harvesters are the angels.
And just as the broom will gather and burn in good health, so will the end of time:
God will send His angels, and they will gather from His kingdom everything that causes sin and all those who sin.
And they throw them into the health phobia, it is where the crying and gnashing of teeth will be.
But those who obey God will be like the sun in the Kingdom of My Father. So, if you have ears, you will hear!” The example of the treasure, the jewel and the net
And the kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and again hid; and for joy thereof he went and sold all that he had and bought that field.
And it is like the Kingdom of the Heavens again to a merchant who was looking for pure essence,
And when he found a very expensive jewel, he sold everything he had to buy it.
And the kingdom of the heavens is like a net thrown into the sea, and it collects fish of every kind.
And after many years, they took them to the sea side and the fishing port and started to sort them out, the good ones they put in the bags and the ones that were not good for anything they threw away.
And that's how it will be at the end of time: the angels will come and separate the righteous from the unrighteous,
Wermio cities in the valley of health, and where will be the crying and gnashing of teeth. The new and the old treasure
And Jesus taught his disciples and said: “Did you understand all this?” They answered: “Yes!”
And he says to them: “Well, because of this, each of the scholars of the law has known the kingdom of the heavens, just like a master of the house who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.” Nazareth did not accept Jesus
And when Jesus had finished speaking, he went away.
And he returned to his city of Nazareth, and he taught in their synagogues, and they were astonished, and they said, “Where did this wisdom and these works come from?
Isn’t this the son of the carpenter? Isn’t this Mary’s brother, called Joseph, and his brothers, Jacob, Simon and Jude?
Isn't all his sisters living in our town? Where did he get all this?
They were displeased, but Jesus said to them: “A prophet is honored everywhere except in his home town and among his relatives” John 4:44.
And there are not many miracles in that place because they have no faith.
The Quarter-Hour of John the Baptist’s Death
And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.
And he says to his servants, “This is John the Baptist who came back from the dead, that’s why miracles are done by his hands.”
For Herod had put John in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife. Luke
Elahqach Yohan was telling him: «It’s not allowed for you to marry her».
He wanted to kill him, but he was afraid of the people because they believed he was a prophet.
At the birthday party of Herod, Herodias’ daughter danced and pleased Herod.
That's why he swore to give her what she asked for.
Having urged her to tell her what to do, she said to Herod: “Bring me the head of John the Baptist on a platter!”
The king was sad, but in front of the swearer who swore and the people present, he ordered that she be given what she wanted.
And he sent the one who was to cut off John’s head to prison,
They brought him in a plate and gave it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother.
And the disciples of John came, and took away his body, and buried it. And they went and told Jesus. Jesus feeds five thousand
And when Jesus heard these things, he went from there on the road by himself to a deserted place. And when the crowds found out, they followed him on foot from the towns.
And when he got off the boat he saw a big group of people, and he blessed them and healed their sick.
When evening came, his students came to him and said: “We are in the middle of nowhere, so tell the group of people to go to the village to buy food for themselves.”
But Jesus said to them: “It is not necessary for them to go away; give them what they have.”
And he said to him: «Here we only have five loaves of bread and two fish».
And he said to them: «Show them to me here!
And he orders the groups of people to sit down on the spring. He took those five loaves of bread and two fish and raised his eyes to the sky and thanked God. And when he broke the loaves, he gave them to his disciples, and the disciples gave them to the groups of people.
They ate them all until they were full, and then they gathered 12 bags full of bread crusts.
And those were the five thousand who ate, not counting women and children. Jesus walking on the water
And Jesus commanded his disciples to get into the boat and precede him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds.
And when he sent them, he went up the mountain alone to pray. And he stayed alone there until evening.
And the students' boats were in the middle of the sea and the waves overwhelmed them, because the wind was against them.
At dawn Jesus came to his disciples, walking on the water.
When the students saw him walking on the water, they were scared and said: «This is the imagination of a ghost», and they shouted out of fear.
At that hour, Jesus addressed them and said: “Be encouraged! I am; do not be afraid!”
And he says to Peter: «My Lord, if you are he, order me to come to you walking on the water».
And Jesus said to him, “Come!” And he immediately took up Peter from the boat and walked out on the water to Jesus.
But when he saw the wind was strong and it was starting to blow, he started to drown and he shouted and said: «Save me, my Lord!»
And quickly Jesus stretched out his hand and caught him, and said to him: «O of little faith, why did you doubt? »
And as soon as they got on the boat, the wind calmed down.
And those who were in the boat fell at his feet and said to him: “In truth, you are the Son of God.” Jesus healed many people in Genesaret
And Jesus and his disciples were led up the other side of the sea, and came into the land of Gennesaret.
And they knew the man who owned that country, and they entrusted him with all their news from the outside, and they brought him all their sick.
They asked him to touch them even if only with his eyes. And anyone who touches him gets better.
Chapter 15: Debates on the Habits of the Elders
And after this, some came up from Jerusalem, from the Pharisees and the lawyers, and they were questioning Jesus.
«Why don’t your students follow the habit of the elders? Because they don’t wash their hands before they eat».
But he answered them and said: “And why do you even disobey God’s command to follow your own custom?
Hait Allah kifoul: Tahlou fbak w mak, walla sab bah wala mah khasshe yettakil.
But we are as you know: what I said to my father or my mother: that's what I should help you with, I gave it as a gift to God,
It is no longer his duty to marry his mother-in-law. And thus, I will cancel the word of God so that you can follow your custom.
O hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you and said:
People of this nation praise me with their mouths, but their hearts are far from me.
And in vain they worship me, because they teach teachings that are just people's advice». The things that make people impure
He cried out to the group of people and said to them: “Listen and understand:
Whatever goes into the mouth does not defile a person, but whatever comes out of the mouth defiles a person.
And then the pupils came to him and said to him: «Did you know that the Pharisees were upset when they heard your words?»
And he answered them and said: "The fruit of the tree that they did not plant will be plucked.
Leave them! Those are blind people who are leading blind people, if blindness leads to blindness, they will both fall into a hole. Luka
He said to Peter: «Let’s explain the meaning of this example!»
And he answers: "Even when we are finished, you still won't understand?
Don’t you know that everything that goes into a human’s mouth goes to his stomach, and then comes out?
What comes out of the mouth comes out of the heart, and that is what defiles a person. When
Bad ideas come from the heart: like murder, corruption of married and unmarried people, theft, false testimony, and cursing.
That's what makes people dirty, but food with unwashed hands doesn't make people dirty». The faith of the Canaanite woman
And Jesus went out from there and walked toward Capernaum and by way of Cana in Galilee.
And one of the women of Canaan came to him, and she cried out and said: "Have mercy on me, O my Lord, O son of David! My daughter is very ill, and he is tormenting her very much."
But he didn’t even answer her. His students came to him and asked him: «Send her away, because she follows us and screams!»
Jesus answered them, “I have been sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”
But then that woman came and she prostrated herself before him and said: “Help me, my lord!”
He answered her and said: “It’s not reasonable to feed the children’s bread to the dogs.”
And the woman said to him: «Oh, my lord! But even the dogs eat from the water that falls from the water troughs for them».
Jesus answered her, “Your faith is great, O woman! Whatever you want will be done for you.” And at that very moment her daughter was cured. Many people were healed
And from there, Jesus went on by the sea of Galilee, and he went up on the mountain and sat there.
And many groups of people came to him, with cripples and blind men and hunchbacks and lepers and many others, and they laid them at his feet and asked him for help.
And the crowds were amazed, because they saw the paralyzed walking, the blind seeing, the lame walking, and the lepers cleansed, and they glorified the God of Israel. Jesus fed four thousand with a loaf
Jesus wept over his disciples and said to them: “Stay with these people, for they have been with me for three days and they have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry so that they faint on the way.”
And they ask themselves: «Where are we going to find bread to feed a large group like this?»
And Jesus said to them, “How many loaves have you?” They answered, “Seven, and some small fish.”
And Jesus commanded the multitude to sit down on the earth,
And God took those seven loaves and fishes, and thanked God and broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.
They ate them all until they were full, and they took seven plates full of bread crumbs.
And there were people who ate four thousand one without the women and children.
And when Jesus sent forth the multitudes, he got into a boat and came to the region of Magdala.
Chapter 16: The Mark of Time
And some of the Pharisees and the Sadducees came, and to test Him they asked Him to show them a sign from heaven. Matthew
But he answered them and said: "When the sun sets, they say: the weather will be clear, because the sky is red.
And in the early morning he said: Today it will rain, because the sky is red and foggy. You know how to interpret the weather, but you cannot interpret the signs of time!
A ugly and corrupt generation asks for a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.” And leaving them, Jesus went away. Matthew 12:39; Luke 11:29 The yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees
And when the students arrived on the other side of the sea, they forgot to take the bread with them.
And he said to them, “Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees!” Luke
And they think to themselves: «Why are you saying this to us, we didn’t bring the bread with us».
And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, “Why are you thinking this in your hearts?
What do you still not understand? What do you not remember about the five loaves of bread that were distributed to 5,000 people, and how many bags of bread did you collect from the bread crusts? When
And you didn't remember the seven loaves of bread that were distributed to four thousand one and how many rafas you gathered? When
How could you not understand that I was not referring to bread with my words to you? Guard yourselves from the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!
And at that time, he understood his disciples when he said to them to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees, not of the bread of God. Peter bears witness that Jesus is the Christ
And when Jesus came into Caesarea Philipp's, he asked his disciples, “Who do the crowds say that the Son of Man is?”
And they answered him: Some said, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and others, one of the prophets. Matthew
And they asked them: “Who are you in our eyes?”
And Simon Peter answered him, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God!”—John
And Jesus said to him, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For it was not flesh and blood that revealed this to you, but my Father in heaven.”
And I, Peter, I tell you: on this rock I will build my church, and the power of death will not prevail against it.
And We will give you the bracelets of the Kingdom of the heavens; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in the heavens, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in the heavens. Matthew
And after that Jesus recommended his disciples not to tell anyone that he is the Christ. Jesus predicts his death and sends his disciples
From that hour, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer greatly at the hands of the elders, the chief priests and the scribes, and that he must be killed, and on the third day he will rise again.
Peter grabbed him by the side and seemed to argue with him and said: «God forbid, my lord, that this happens to you!»,
He turned to Peter and said, «Get away from me, you devil! You are the cause of this family's misfortune, why are you thinking about people's affairs and not about God's?»
And Jesus says to his disciples: “Whoever wants to come after me must allow himself to be set apart and take up his cross and follow me.”
Whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. When
What good is it to a human being to gain the whole world and lose his life? What is a human being going to give in exchange for his life?
The day will come when man will come with his angels in the midst of his wealth and each one will be judged according to his deeds. When
I tell you the truth: there are people here present who will not die until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
Chapter 18 Jesus appears in his glory
And after six days Jesus took Peter, James, and his brother John, and led them up on a high mountain by themselves.
And his shape changed before their eyes, his face shone like the sun, and his features became pale and gleaming like light.
And it will be shown to them that Moses and Elijah are talking to Jesus.
Gal Peter to Jesus: “How good it would be to stay here, my Lord. If you want, I can make three loaves of bread, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
And as he was speaking, a cloud came and cast a shadow over them; and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son, whom I am well pleased with; hear him!" 2 Peter 1:17, 18
And when the students heard that, they fell on their faces and were very scared.
And drawing near, he touched them and said to them, “Arise, and have no fear!”
And they lifted up their eyes, and saw Jesus alone.
And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them and said: “Do not tell anyone what you have seen until the Son of Man has risen from the dead.”
Soulo said to his students: "Well, why do the scholars of the sharia say that in the first place, the prophet Elijah must come?"
And he answered them and said: “In fact, Elia Giji is the first and he will fix everything,
But I will tell you: Elijah has come and they did not recognize him, and they did to him what they wanted, and so the Son of Man will also suffer in their hands.” Matthew
And then the clock struck, and the students understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus is healing a possessed boy
And when Jesus and his disciples came to the crowd, a man came up to him and fell on his knees.
Ghal: «My son, my son, my poor boy, he is suffering a lot, he is often sick and weak.
“I brought it for your student, but they couldn’t heal him.”
Jesus answered and said, “This generation is a wicked generation! How long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy to me!”
And Jesus rose up the spirits, as he was coming out of the boy, and the pig was healed at that very hour.
They brought the disciples closer to Jesus and said to him: “Why couldn’t we cast out the demon?”
And I tell them: "Because of your lack of faith! And I tell you the truth: if you have faith the size of a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you. [
This kind of madness only comes out with prayer and fasting.”] # 17.21 This verse does not exist in many of the old manuscripts Matthew 21:21; Mark 11:23; 1 Corinthians 13:2 Jesus again predicts his death and resurrection
The disciples were gathered in Galilee, and Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is to be delivered into the hands of men,
And they will kill him, and on the third day he will rise again.” The students were very sad. Jesus is paying the tax for the house of God
And when Jesus returned to Capernaum with his disciples, the tax collectors and the people who sat in the tax booth with them approached Peter and said, “Doesn’t your teacher pay the tax for the house of God?”
And he replied, “Ah, he’ll pay it.” And when Jesus came into the house, he said to him, “What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take toll or tribute? From their sons or from foreigners?”
Peter answered him: “I am from the outside.” Jesus says: “Because of their children, they are exempt from paying taxes.
But so as not to cause them any problem, go to the sea and cast the line, and the first fish you catch, open its mouth, and you will find four dirhams, take it and go pay for yourself and for him.
