I am saying the things that you don’t want to understand, يا صالح
Any problems, Saleh, open your mouth, open your mind, open the world around you, open the people around you, what are you doing in the world, what are you doing?
If only his brothers
And he who wants to develop himself and those around him
Ya Saleh, don’t ride your head
No, no, no, I don’t care about you
And she walks the path
And pass like a cut fig
And you will die Malioe
Eat or don’t eat
No eating
Here, a man agreed
Relaj this, I don't know where you live
I want it with him
This is our chance, God, our cars are old and their models have failed
Try you try you with him after a while and whoever surrenders to you
These are normal and known matters
Bull, but the one without a personality
Oh yes, he’s afraid.
I’m so pissed off
The budget is in his hands
What is this project that he is holding
The Akbar Government Project
What is beneath and what is above
I have the right to take
You are in a ministry and he is in a second ministry
Shedoh yeme naseety
A day in the garage
That means I
I consider myself a contributor to them
What is happening, nothing is working, what a project, oh peace
I have nothing to do with it.
It means that I will participate as well
We are supposed to all take
This is a government project.
He will understand your son Thor
I understand him
You kick the good
This is a government project.
And this is your chance
Like your oil, it will not be good
A good plate is in front of you
Take your meal and put it in your throat.
Ariel Makan in his hideout
I heard it with my own ears.
They say the government is well-known for its projects
And one third of it is sucked
Slom son
Going to Souq Waqif
One funer is 84 shekels
Put it in the budget
and 80 one-hundred-ths of a shekel
They said we didn’t do anything
You will get along with him
Seek refuge with Allah from the devil.
I just feel that his head started to lean a little bit.
God willing
Oh, chairman of the committee and everything is in his hand
The most important thing is don’t forget us
A quarter of you, we are
It means that we have to be together
This government project is an opportunity
Sure, Ali.
And we can’t do without you
What do you recommend to us, Ali?
And God willing, all those who will be part of the project's team
This is for sure
Last night me and the gang were chilling
We are on your side.
All members of the project committee are reassured
Fearing Saleh, the head of this committee
They say that
Tell me good news, Ali
And reassure the group
God damn it, Abu Fahad
May God bless you, but you didn’t tell me
Then don’t forget, Sa’ut.
No no
Inshallah, things will go as best as possible
Khalo'a yawaqaf hal'ala salih
Come on
My mother gave me the razor or not
Is that possible?
As long as you are with us in the department, you are contributing to the project
But the most important thing is that the matter is between us
Bake a tray of bread and meat in front of you
I need to eat
Congratulations and best wishes
You have something
Every time you get like this
We won’t pay
We will never finish like this
Or ask any question
We will help and cooperate
How can we get our share
A child, really?
What did you write on it
Then you’ll see that we’re not the only ones who take
Everyone who contributed to the project is claiming his right
Why not?
No such fear, Saleh
We are the ones who set the budget
And the piece of land he bought today and registered it under his name
Find it later
He says he won’t buy it
Where did you get this talk from?
Connected to me today
He says call your brother’s phone in Msaken.
He is better off dead.
Your brother, as fast as he can.
See the second earth
The one who bought the land for him yesterday
They agreed to sell it.
Tell him to call him and tell him if he wants it, just register it under his name.
He wants to kill her with his own hands
And our
And we consider ourselves as his partners
Even if we are not shareholders
The biggest piece will go down your throat
You are depriving your brother and your mother of their rights
I didn’t come here to argue with you.
We are also shareholders in the project and we have the right to demand our rights
Say it to her, say it to her
Oh, so yesterday when Yah Sultan called and asked for a refund
But I didn’t let him.
And you are wrong if you don’t allocate an amount for the project.

Listen to what I tell them on the phone
Enter their brothers and their relatives
I know that this government project is a way
We don’t want a lump sum and leave
Money
If my brother Sultan wants to ban our meetings he can
Since the members of the committee
Project budget
But what is required
You didn’t do bad
Ohm, may Allah protect you with Saleh.
Your brother
Do you like it?
He will serve us with the project
Let me be remembered
We distributed the tasks properly
You, Saleh
And I have lime, bricks and concrete
And the rest electricity and water, leave it to me
Dudes
Determine your share
And God, I really
Sometimes I say take a lump sum
And sometimes I say
Make it a percentage
It’s not a problem, Saleh, it’s not a problem
Take whatever you want and the way you want
The most important thing
We’ll see
Icon this week
Let everyone decide the amount he wants.

This is the last name.
This is Saud, your friend, how many names
Izzed izzed isma'a aqoulu khnafa'hum
Put it in which percentage collection or flat amount and
Don’t put it with the others
Count again, when you put for him, you put for him, that is, put for him 20,000.
Just...
Even in a note here they wrote
I am a descendant of Freija
But this is Saud, his list has exceeded that of Abdulaziz
Put them all in the first stage budget
Jacky, I feel so bad
What’s left from the list that my mother gave me
Who calls every two hours and adds people as she pleases
May God prolong her life, hahaha
The view of my eyes
And whoever delivers it to you, she is sick and poor and poor.
The woman has nothing
O God, may He guide you, I only said that, but this is the last one
Tell him, agriculture is good.
Here is a moment, how much do you charge?
Just give me an apartment, a hospital and a clinic

You are very good at breeding
Only your love is precious to me
O Allah, guide him, put her name on the list
Hussein, oh Hussein, daughter of Ahil
And you give it to her from your pocket
Reassure her and tell him that nothing is left from the second stage
I I AM 88,000
You son of a bitch, they are going to get a new one
Tell him, tell him, let him add another 2,000 so I can buy presents for the girls
I’ll say it to you once
One hundred and fifty shekels for me
Any حسينه بنت اهلال
I can see that you are failing her at your friends.

They will define the project tomorrow
And now, God willing, Benzelon will pay us the installments, first بول.
A prophet known as
Give us one at a time or in batches
What the hell does this mean, more than us?
In a round in sucking the most important thing, keep quiet. The committee will wait for them and they will come
Oh God, oh God, oh God, tell them to shut up, meaning shut up
You have no shame and you have no imagination
If you hear one of you
Cut his tongue short
Oh, take your time, guys
You know, this is also about money, not just like that.
Before it was cool
fifty million
What are you, a gel oil?
In the end, you are the president
What a stupid head
We adopt the budget
Through your talk about the project, Professor Saleh, I noticed that it is vital and important as well
And Allah has given you this for not only this generation
Yes yes
Tomorrow the opening of the second phase of the project
We are very grateful for your presence and congratulate you
And I welcome
On this occasion
United Nations
Where is the project, Odoo?
Kid, where are we?
Where the hell are we?
This case
You are the delusion of the officials, and the people applauded you
We are at the official opening, what’s wrong?
That means you are now الحج (hajj), that means we are in the project
Oh, we are in the project
People are worried
And this is the box, I don't know why they put it here
What's the job in the box
This box, God preserve the infrastructure
The official opening of the world’s beaches
Ashfeej for the third millennium
God knows, I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Oh, thank God, the old man is bad
Jane Zain, I know why you called me
Just stop the car
Halieh was surprised
But when she said to me
No one has sent me anything
I saw it myself, and it has a farm as big as it is.
Alhamdulillah, you are comfortable
And Jaleq Ayg and you are sitting at home comfortably
Why the cruelty, oh mom, don’t you let anyone play, oh wise الشيخه منيره
Praise be to God, ya Manira, that you have brothers like Rashid, Saad and Saqr.
They are afraid of your share and invest it for you
I have a new book by Rafeiشتi
Her brothers don’t give her her father’s share
We don’t know about these things
This is a legitimate right
This is a matter of trust. You don’t trust us.
How is my mother?
I didn’t like my brother Rashid’s speech
Go and fuck these guys who give me this every three months
This is my right
Just tell me.
You don’t trust us
The talk about inheritance and money needs clarity
And you are still my father, you are not comfortable anymore
You know what you do to people
And this is the poor one safe with you
Who should I believe that she is the heir to millions
Asb beh akhvanha
Money destroyed the world
But the truth is the truth and this is God’s law
And then what?
And we are doing the company
We invest in lands, real estate and money
No problems and no headache
You say that it was passing by the earth in the desert
Just stop it already.
Let Nsour be real about the whole thing
What's the story?
Your sister seems to be digging
That's the story.
She is going to make us talk.
We should give her some money
Saqr Aahda ant
We need to find us a solution, Rashid
In my head
What is this?
My share of my father's inheritance
Whoever gives me charity every three months
Everything is known
40,000, nothing has changed
They invest money in Hell
Hollow hollow hollow
Why now?
It needs no thinking
They said add it so she can be happy and shut up
Your whole speech was fair
They are giving me a hard time.
If I could see their wives
Al-Mas’s teams in various shapes and colors
I wish I could live half of their life
They are taking advantage of my father’s property
If I may say
These are your rights
Legally and by right
I feel like they are stealing from me and lying to me
I am not comfortable with their way, it's over.
God knows what happens in this world
Beat me, torture me, mother
They do not know that there is an account and a punishment.
And Allah will punish them for eating forbidden money
And bear with me, mother, and show them what the courts are about.
You will make them happy, God willing.
The more, the merrier, or the more the population
That's why I tell you, mom.
eat a little
Everyone has a building, you can call them skyscrapers
I want only my right
My father wants my son to be a Muslim before he dies
And my father gives charity to the half-paralyzed
Inzain yeme am salمين
Be stupid in Tangier, mom
And they did not know the court process
And he is not to be blamed
Do you know why?
In these times
Makool has her right
Why do you ask the accountant?
You who ask the accountant
Reply to them
No, I mean, it’s God, I mean, peace be upon you, I’m here for my sister.

A genie is out of the bottle
A known and definite share
Tell her to take 60,000 or 60,000 dahias
It is forbidden to them
Expect anything, Manira
Abou Company
Eight buildings
Non-real estate and houses
Tell me 600 pounds
And what do you expect me to give up?
No, Minah
Bear with me, I’ll convince you, bear with me, I’ve told you.
You have the right to know everything about the land and money, it’s not their business
Just the company
You are a partner with them
Now they are expelling you from the company
I’ll tell you, no one can stop me

Thank him by saying to him
This is our money
All the youth are like this, they inherited
God bless you, I forgive you, the company is your company, only good things happened.
We are present
This is Samir, the accountant.
If brother Nasser wants anything, he should just let me know
The whole company is at your command
Now get in the shower and relax, mol mol, don’t ask about anything.
You are perfect

A trap took him

And no one talks about it.
Poor thing
Her father left.
Four apartment buildings
I thought they had three lands
And every land is bigger than the other
God is our judge and they are in good hands, dad
It's forbidden for them what they are doing
Don’t Threaten Them
What can I do, Yam Salman
I have no other remedy but to go to court.
Iffl give you these two pages
The case has been postponed
Endure, O my father, Nasser
Let them know about the court.
You left your bed and the doctor is looking for you
Come on, Ya Salmin
My soul is your stone
Why Muslims are sick
What did he say to me?
Excuse me
Oh, I remember you, I knew you, I knew you.
Yes yes yes yes
What about it, bro?
It doesn’t matter, be well.
They will slaughter me now, when the day comes for millions
Do you think that, God willing, this Abdullah who sent it to them can do it?
So he is a friend of Rashid عدله
He knows it well from years
Do you believe, Menrah
Even Abdullah advised me
Stay behind them
O you! And you! Do not throw them at each other
Try to take as much as you can from them
Do you know Abdullah Shiquoli
It's not normal for people to live to 70 or 80 years old.
Our courts are for people who live for 200 years
May Allah have mercy on her.
May God have mercy on her, she would say
The number of inhabitants has reached 40,000
The case takes ten years and more
We need to be detained so that we can review the courts.
This is it.
Hey boy, you’re with them
May God guide you, God willing.
You have an old friend from school days
This world is not worth it
I am good with you
And you, by God’s grace, are from a well-known and big family
Real kids
Ava ya Rashid, we are quarter
Think kindly
And now pronounce it
Oh my God, oh my God, without all this nonsense, quarter quarter
Are you going to do it or what?
He took a set of 290,000 from the jewelry exhibition
Where did she get it from
They are taking money from their wives
You are depriving your sister of her legal rights
Still you have hope, Nasser
You and them fight with you
Yesterday when I called him in the mosque
Let me be like I told you
Arab children and well-known
Why not?
But I was just going to say...
O Lord, make this meeting blessed with these bright faces
O Allah, enlighten our hearts with what is good for our religion and our worldly affairs.
Listen to you
Do you have another topic other than the topic of my sister’s inheritance?

You are the best manager
Why don’t you go to him and let him sign it and be done with it.
He has nothing in his hand.

It stinks
In my nose
The stink bug
Your main shoe
I don't care about the branch near the market
And the spirit there
I’ll go to the branch in the market after they tell me I’m not there for sure
Inshallah ya Allah, with peace.
Fini was beaten by the sun
Two lines of sun
I entered my neighbor’s house
The maid knew me.
What’s wrong with you?
May God guide you.
Lala la, I’m not in the mood for Yam Sadid
Oh my god, where is my father now
From Al-Luyah
This is what he says after any bank
They told him the papers were incomplete.
Tell him to take a taxi.
Oh my god, we had a meeting with the director
The important thing now is how is my father, God willing, I hope he is fine.
I feel a little dizzy
That’s what I told you in front of it
Let your father rest
Poor Yam Sadid
They have to commit to the attendance after these reports are written about them and therefore
How are you?
Hey, Abu Shahan
You can say I’m lazy and I’m not lazy
How does that mean
Those years
It is written that we should suffer
Your kids are gay
We are obliged to help them
And poor people say to me
You’re full of shit.
Does this mean that young people who don’t have fathers will never finish their transactions
It doesn’t matter if he has a job or not.
In your job, you mean, let you go out
May God reward you.
No, just the coffee behind you
Where are you, يابو سعيد (Yabo Sa’id)?
With the spirit of a loyal transaction, my son سعيد
In this ministry where I am drinking coffee
I will take her lands after God helps us
Bye
Ouch, what's up, okay, I'll see you later.
It is better for you not to.
I warned you.
Because I heard you say to Saeed
Your father is sick
I don’t care about you.
You will know your father when he complains to you.
I don’t want to see him quiet
And what speaks
You treated him badly, you want him, be afraid of God in this money
You woke me up with your shouting, what's going on there?
You were an employee in the government and you know what an inventory means
And they write this first
Now, after it’s really now, what are they going to do
Tomorrow is the last day to submit transactions at the Development Bank for farmers
Lala la, who says
Get lost, you bastard
Cut two words to him and he believed it
He says he has a committee for inventory.
Ashbalaj
Yeah, how are you?
Run spirit, and finish his treatment
Nothing, nothing, nothing
He came back from outside and he was quiet.
I’ve been talking to him but he doesn’t answer.
No shame, no decency
You shouldn’t blame your father, don’t take a stand against him
If you are happy with that
Thank you, you did a great job.
He was supposed to call you
Why is he calling the bed attendant?
Dear and precious mom
You have never let us down.
Wipe me
Come on, me!
That’s it, mom
Strengthen and honor
‏ chirp chirp
‏ Thank you, Yzak
Please, mom.
May God reward you.
We decided from now on
If we finish our transactions ourselves
You didn’t do anything, your father thanks you, thank God
And may God protect you, dad.
Consider it the last one
But it can’t be done.
Call me now
I'm not going to the minister, uncle, I'm not going
The minister will be angry with you
If you upset him, you should go before you upset him. No, no, no, this is not possible. This is everything except the minister.
I don’t want to go, mom, I don’t know what to tell you, I don’t want to bother you.
No, don’t say anything.
Consider it as a gift from me.
Hey on your way finish the deal with سعيد my brother
And whoever hands you over to me, father.
Consider it the last deal to get it done for me
Whatever you say, mom
But your son had to sign this paper
That means take it and bring it tomorrow
To be honest, I advise you to get it today.
And if the transaction is not introduced to them
You’ll wait for me after two months.
lalala, I’ll make him sign it now and send it
lalala ma yahtai
Just call him, but wait for two minutes.
And make it yours
That means you don’t know Said
No permission taken
And only Morocco
No, they all have a quarter.
Who are you asking, where are you?
Tell me, I am happy.
I’m waiting for my shift to end
Okay, Mom
Yeah, burn your own papers
Jan Tarsh A'ayyalak
You don’t have kids, do you?
Do you feel anything strange?
Please, my uncle.
You didn’t do bad
No use
I will leave you
And go to the home for the elderly
I don’t want to tell them where I’m going
What do you say to them, Abu Sa’id?
I’ll write them something else
Alhamdulillah
He was released from prison yesterday.
No, God damn it, my brother
We’ve had enough of these things
Don’t you and him speak on the radio or on television
What I wanted him to do, he did, but with all the nonsense.
Oh God, may He guide and reform him, God willing
Oh God, my brothers, take care, God protect you
The prison shower
I was traveling yesterday.
My brothers, what should I say?
Call once on the program of this ميلس which is called
And there you go, my friends, talk to the real one
This is Khalid Jassem
And he says, no more nonsense
My yacht, listen to them, his four guys at work
My cat is talking about the government.
Web site oil money
Madi, madi, what happened to this boy?
Not one in four
Those who were happy with him and told him to do this and that
They all disowned him
God guide him back
And I’m back, my brothers, let me go, I have a cook behind.
Welcome to you
Come here, mom
Come, sit
No more nonsense, my son
God, Dad, I’m tired and sick.
Here she is, she’s in the hospital
You don’t deserve it, God forbid.
‏ What I wish happens to you, happens
Dad, I told you.
What, ya mama
And he kept screaming
I am not among you
Mom, this time I made it.
That’s what I’m telling you.
Ava Aliyji yeme
Forget the subject
We are fed up with nonsense
Why did the manager fire the poor thing?
Haram means after all these years you come today and tell me you’re here for a business meeting
Do you understand the speech, Saleh?
We are fed up with nonsense
Just give us one
Order, Saleh
And you are a man who doesn’t care about these things
You, by God’s will, are concerned about public affairs and criticize
Not easy
It just means we canceled out one G.
And you are one of them
It's not you
It’s over, bye
Bro. Saleh
But, God willing, your uncle Bu Munira won't know.
Don’t forget to call me tomorrow
Where does he get the money from?
If I were you
Tell him to work.
I told you I would bring it to you.
I asked my mother and she said that Yahu works
It is necessary.
Mom, you have to come in.
What shall we do with her now
Anwar and our son
What you want me to do
I’ll give him a two-week deadline.
But if he works, God, I don't want anything to do with him and I'll take him to court and tell him to divorce
Have a coffee now
You’re the only one buzzing around in your head.
Oh my God, for real?
My father came out
What do you want
I know you want to go.
Your heart is eating you because of the coffee
I want to talk and get confused
God, go to sleep, you’re annoying
Go out and find a job in the morning.
Inshallah I will get up in the morning, God willing
Oh my God, I told you, I’ve really quit this habit
God damn it
Oh my God, I feel a little bit bothered
And don’t even get me started on nonsense.
Go to hell
We don’t need the old-fashioned stuff
Where are you, man? You look like you’re on silent, give us one of the old ones, man.
We heard, we heard, but enough of nonsense. We heard.
We are fed up with nonsense
We are fed up with nonsense
Saleh is present
Saleh Raqid
My son did something wrong and I didn’t know.
We just need to have Saleh in the coffee.
What did you say?
Oh my God, do it justly
Because there were people present
You are Nadia but
Don’t waste your time with me
If a one-legged man comes to the door, he will kick his leg
But I’m not hungry
I wish they would stop you from going too far
My son and my bread know you well as well as well.
You're like the one who made these papers
Either you guess or you don’t guess, I say or I don’t say, I say, no more nonsense, or I don’t say, no more nonsense.
That’s what I’m telling you.
I bought a bomb on the radio
wala saleh bsnna kharabees
Professor Saleh, you are a man with a very high national sense
We are sorry to trouble you
But what should we do
Oh God, please forgive us
Hello Saleh, how are you?
Jane, you didn’t have to do that, we love you.
No, God forbid
My brother, I’ve been waiting for you to say it, enough of this nonsense
You are a brave man, I’m afraid
And if someone once converts to Islam, say it
I am God, I deliver you, finally
Stop smoking, it’s bad for your health. Just say no to cigarettes, and that’s all there is to it.
Oh God, the real one is going to get you, just one at a time for the sake of it
Wow, bro
‏ It’s important now, Your Majesty
Regarding the job
The job in reverse, you deserve it, you are a national and dear to us
We were calling you to inform you.
John exposed your shame in front of God
Are you serious?
Everywhere I go they tell me there are no vacancies.
Poor people, I wish they would occupy me but there are no jobs
And how are you going to manage the house now, you and your mom?
And don’t forget after
Four kids
God is generous
Don’t give up my love
Hold on to hope
And I won’t stop
You need to go and look for a job for me.
So that my father doesn’t make problems for us
I’m ready to do anything for you, God willing, Manira.
And repent after saying, “Enough with the nonsense”
‏ No more nonsense
Do you know what he is doing these days?
I told you.
But you, God guide you, Mr. Fahad
You listen to the words
I will go and tell the minister about the mess he is making.
The Minister Ashbiqan
Sure, he understands it like that.
You are right
But this is something
What is hushed up
You know the rumor that he is going to be put in your place and that you are going to be lifted very strongly
I am looking for a way to pay for it
I don’t want anyone to feel that I have a stake in the subject
You are right.
Are you still thinking about it
The way that pushes Sultan out of your way
Have you heard about Saleh Saleh? No more nonsense
May Allah protect you, this is from our neighborhood
Benhda'a 'alayhi
You deprived us, brother Saleh, of your voice
No, Saleh
I am one of your biggest fans.
No, Mashallah, after what I need
And God willing, soon
He comes back and you hear his voice and you are happy
Bu Fahad asks about you himself
Just say it, Saleh
Why did you stop?
God, there are some problems and psychological and health problems a little
Just tell the truth
You are a fighter
We haven’t heard from you for a long time
Allah, Allah, Allah. I need you, Ya Saleh,AAD.
Just once, for my sake
I want to hear it on the Sank.
Saleh says it’s done
No guys, it’s really hard, I swear.
What's wrong with you?
The Real You
Abdulrahman I am a boycotter
Then you didn’t tell me that you were looking for a job
This is your chance
Let the Real hear you and be pleased with you on the second day. Go to his office and ask for the job.
And the womb, if you tear it.
I only want your best interest
Do you know how
Just leave us alone, go to your house.
No, no, no, we don’t want that.
Azain, ya khay, ass, ass, ass, sabr ya khay, let’s understand
Just stop it, we don’t want it
Inzin inzin
I mean, if I were to go back, this would be the last time, of course I’m cutting it, but this would be the last time.
For example, shihab means bu bu bu boufهد hears that he loves to hear
Chally Ayansah means there are a lot of problems and troubles
What is the best thing to listen to, or do you like protests, I don't know, say you
According to the contract
By the rule of his responsibilities
87 centimeters
The job is fucked
Until he interrupts me
Why are you like that, employee?
And seventh seventh
‏ Until he interrupts me
Seventh, Your Excellency the Minister
Why the employee?
When the ministry moved to its new headquarters
My brother's car
Guys, enough of this nonsense
And you’re still returning to us with your voice, we don’t want you to cut us now
These people are dear to me, meaning the last time
And I’m straight, I mean
Oh my God, you said that it stopped
And you are the one who prevented it
Oh my daughter
This is what they call no nonsense, he should expose them on the radio
I just heard that, they told me.
I doubt that there is one in the ministry who leaks the information.
‏ How horrible the weather is now
The weather is terrible
Minister's present seekers
I don’t give a damn
All my time is for the ministry, God protect you
I heard him, my lord.
O, God, I said it just for you.
He gave me the cold shoulder
He didn’t call me.
Abd الرحمن Aygüly Ruh busy you
He didn’t call me.
God, you are poor, Saleh
You really broke my heart
I am the secretary of Boufhed.
And he knows the whole story
The gang exploited you, the goal was specific, they wanted it.
Unfortunately, they reached him
And you know who's behind all this.
Abdul Rahman Ould Freijkom
Oh God, who planned all this
Bufehd it’s impossible that you get busy
One day, I will do the same thing to him that was done to Sultan
Madam, I’ve heard a lot about you
It’s impossible for anyone to bother you
I was taken to court for divorce.
I found the solution
We are now the best community in the world
Flawless
We don’t have
We have no flaws at all
We are comfortable
I heard the intermediation
Even if one knows you, he would tell you to wait in line.
Because it is the system
He takes more rights than a stranger
We Don’t Depend on the Stranger
We don’t have
Your effort is your work, we have no flaws, we have flaws.
And one of the big ones
He will go and sit at home
We don’t have it like that here
And my regards
Saleh Rashid Saad Rashid Al-Bahahery
Famous as Saleh Bsnna Kharabeesh
I don’t want dinner
I was running, then a man saw my shirt and split
He saw you wearing a new dress, more beautiful than you.
He saw a boy wearing the new shirt that you and I just bought from Villaggio
This is a pull of his own two oceans, meaning a little bit of him
And this is good, what he said.
And I put it on my conscience
You, judges, when you saw a boy who was handsome, you liked him
As he pleases
Why is Walid’s shirt so difficult
I saw you wearing just a new t-shirt, you made me mad, you should ask your father to buy you one.
Do you think so?
Why did you tear Walid's shirt
Until I tell you.
Don’t leave me to carry the can.
I say, my brother Sultan
Why after I hit him like that and he screws up his face like that
Shower, you little kid, you’re not that old.
This is kids, this is kids
Hey there
And he wants people who are fair to raise him and educate him
Don’t let him
The price of your words, Sultan, and about the nonsense
I want to go to school, I am a child
You’ve always been arrogant
Raise your children properly
And if you are not capable of raising
I respect myself now
And I won’t make fun of him in front of his wife
Who is the biggest among you, O brothers
And God, if you enter Adul and Taq and Walid again, or if you do something to them
He is to blame only for himself
I am just wasting my time with you
Behave yourself!
It made me happy, so let's go there
I will not answer them
Hey where are you, the first time
And pure intentions
Oh God, with forgiveness and health
My brother can’t find anything better than this at your place
La la la da akbar haqeh
Do what's in your hand and come quickly
The core of the problem that fell on our heads
But just tell me, what’s going on exactly?
Sorry Ahmed, his work is becoming a problem at home and I have to go.
The judge’s trousers went
This is the act of a jealous person, whose heart is sick with envy and hatred.
This is the action of Sultanu
Where can he cut all these clothes
My new clothes, I didn’t congratulate myself on them, I didn’t even wear them, God is my witness.
I have to show him.
Sit down and I’ll tell you.
If you go at the time when he says "ya houl" and does other things
What is your opinion?
You are my beloved child, do you know how to ride a bicycle
I know.
Waleed Habibi
Hey, hey
Just say it.
Where did you put the scissors, mama?
Under the bed
Destroy them, may God destroy their lives
But there is Araujie
I will not be silent about it
This one is stupid and crazy
The most important thing now
And what will change
But this computer story is a promotion I’m doing
Brawij mb amkhlie
So that our son is more reasonable than the child who broke their computer and we didn’t know
My soul, my soul, let me look at another, or else not.
Let go of the nonsense, Fuhud
My soul, my soul, go to your quarter, my soul. Laugh at others.
I’m telling you, change.
Let your spirit laugh at others, Fuhud
Aouish Hayaj
The Time of the Calm Hearts
And pure intentions
Yahal
It's not me who will go to look for his quarter
Laugh at others, Sultanu
So that he can accuse me falsely
Scissors
Respect yourself
Oh, Abdulrahman, come to me, dad.
The blame is on your brothers, Fahad and Sultan
Mom, every day it’s the same, they fight
I don’t know.
A meeting like this
We should sit it down
To examine our works
The works of those who preceded us
And what we will become
We take the lessons
And we learn
Not the peace meeting of Genkm ya halo
The size of a camel
Do you have children?
He doesn’t understand anything
His role model is his father, not your father.
His role model is his father
You, Sultan
And you, Fahad
And I am your elder brother
Because of me
Paying for the computer
Now, when you reached out to him
It’s not that you made up?
No, just like that, I didn’t raise my hand so I could get rid of him
Get away from Abdul Rahman, he is talking non-stop.
Where are you going?
God didn’t leave him
You did it yesterday
Look, don’t be scared.
If you are real, you are the champion of the door. I’ll tell you, you are the champion of the door.
You said that Abdul Rahman Saleh is on your side
But, by God, if he enters his room and breaks it, it will be broken.
Your brother has
Unnatural
Your brother is not normal
Now you are brave, take what is coming
Fahad on his head on his head
Shut up, shut up, you kids, they are just fighting and they don’t even have the decency to be ashamed.
You are just kids, just kids, but dad, but dad
Oh father, by Allah I will show you, I will show you, by Allah I will show you.
Pull it, pull it, oh my mother, pull it with the biggest one.
‏ Mom's blood
My heart skipped a beat with this shouting
O God
Let’s leave our situation
And God, it’s a shame
This and I am with you and my interests are with you
He won’t let them down
One day in the night he will reconcile them
‏What was it, mother, that he had time for?
‏ And therefore
And what God has given him
Haji فصيح
But, oh mother
‏ God guide you
You are supposed to kill yourself
May fire be kindled and fuel for the fire be found.
Oh God, what will happen
Come on, Abdulrahman
I want you to help me, I have become a Pharaoh
You, mom, be reasonable, God guide you
Two more behind
‏ Single single
You have shamed us, may God guide you
Our neighbor Saad is looking at you and laughing at us
Mr. Officer wants us, wants us and we tell him
Don’t worry about it, the officer will ban it.
It doesn't matter who deleted them all
Please
Come on, don’t come to me, don’t come to me
The officer prohibited me, believe me, I’m coming from above.
He heard the officer's ban.
From above means away
My brother was right about him
Please, you have now signed that your children will not do it again.
Thank you, thank you
Hello brother, hello, please come in
How did the officer let them go? Believe me, I’m sure.
‏ Hear me
I didn’t want to tell you that in front of them
This is Abdulrahman, their brother the oud player
Assistant to the Deputy Minister
And the second is their average brother, the director of the authority
Spirit, take two pendulums and rest
The officer prohibited any pendulum
You have two pendulums here
Weh weh, I swear to God, I will take revenge on the enemy.
God is my judge against the enemy
God is my judge, play your game with me
What the hell is this? What is this question?
Yahel ayi ayoوصل min ahnaak li ahna
This is the hand of his father in heaven, what would he do to flat him out?
Do you believe it?
Wampei is a man of the people, respectable and polite.
And he says, this is the daughter of the poor.
Even if
Now you can
Or what has come down to him from Ali?
Wamlq Alaiyaj
Hey, all, until the opportunity comes.
What does it mean when you passed and looked at me
Accident means
You turn and she turns at the same time
No, but definitely something
You notice me when I walk by you
I feel that she is happy from the inside, she is full of joy and happiness.
Ya kii rooh goolha aateni kalem
Take my notebook.
Did you know her name?
Too Much of a Romantic
No, you are now in the 21st century
God, you are going to get it so bad
It is the truth
As long as we sit like this
Don’t worry
And from today I intend to devote myself to you
But you really need to rest a little now
My father came especially after yesterday’s outdoor shooting in the desert
God forbid, my brother, we have horses. The secretary told him to see if he doesn’t want any press meetings or TV interviews or even contracts.
Let me be free to cook for my family
God be with you
Even when you are busy
The first thing I put in my mind
And I have the number of its shepherd, I will call him today
What did you miss?
Buy the villas and live in them for a few days
Gar in series and acting
Um Abdul-Aziz said that they are poor people and are as they are
It's not our share
Good morning, uncle.
Hope for the best
Mom, this car is calling us every other day
It seems like your battery is dead
It's no problem, I have a needle and I'll thread it for you right now, God willing
May God reward you.
We are here, we are here, my friend
Peace be upon you
Waleed is right
I’ll get my pay tomorrow, so don’t bother me and don’t ask me to stay here so that you can come every day
Be loyal to us, what do you want, what do you want to do?
But, okay, dad.
‏ Please
But what about Walid?
Rashed Abdullah
The same name
The right of return of Abu al-Stans
Amaj was true
I was very happy when I found out that Rashid Abdullah, the actor I love, is a yarner.
Everyone praises him
They say he is modest and kind
Before the house, yes
I only take pictures of him
So that the quarter at work believes me
I can't believe our house is next to the actor Rashid Abdullah's house
Talk to him, talk to him so that he believes.
Look around the world
What I see on TV
I hope to see him
Our Lord, praise be to God, O Lord, praise be to God
You know, if they want a goat with a beard, I have one here.
I am present, but guys, go easy on it, I haven’t really gotten used to it yet, I haven’t really taken it properly.
You have received the news
Yes, God, he didn’t do anything wrong, may God reward him a thousand times.
سلام عليكم
They confirmed that there are employees being transferred to the new branch of the ministry in Ad Dahhan
What did they tell you, back from?
I didn’t hear the names
No, but what I heard and surely
But Bo Ali is with them
‏ My name is I.
But until we know exactly who we are going to move.
I am I, Winnie, and we, Winnie, and where smoke cannot reach you, God willing.
You can or you can’t, this is work
The committee is actually still studying the subject
But if you choose me
Thank God, welcome, بو وليد سم
You’re welcome, my friend.
Sorry, Mr. Rashid, but the furniture
We are neighbors today
According to the people
This is your good nature, Abu Walid
May God reward you, brother Rashid
I heard a lot about your kindness
God is our love
Just, my daughter
And I am ready to help you find the best and cheapest furniture that suits you
When will you honestly get new furniture, it’s so old
It has to be changed.
Inshallah
I told you before, my sister.
If you need anything
Consider me like your sister
May my eyes not see
Where did you go my love
Yesterday she talked to me and forgot about Ahaasha
Lala my love, I don’t want to bother you
No more.
God willing, bye, I’ll call you later
I was telling her the truth.
But these people are not from our cloth
They are rich, where are we and where are they
Oh my, you don’t have to do that
What the hell is this?
You wait a bit for me
And I’ll give you the signal when you want to propose to me
I told you.
No, it’s okay.
And you ask me to marry you
I put the dinner in the hall.
If you want to have dinner
Now I’ll let the driver take it to the university, God willing.
And then we agreed that we are people
Who stole my car
And soon God willing
I called to thank her.
Ayawid wayhbon al-khair ai na'am
Oh yes, you are right mom.
Even if our people don’t do it like that
And my name is definitely with them
Are you sure?
Oh my god, what a mess!
I don't know what to do about this news, I'm confused.
روح روح روح روح روح روح you are now inshallah inshallah for the better thank you may God reward you may God reward you
What’s happening, Abu Ali
The committee met today.
And the list of names of those who are being transferred to smoke.
My name is with them
The director said, "Write down your name.
What is the use, O Ali, what is the use
He said there is no hope.
The Great Artist
Consider your name not to be on the list
You did a great job, God bless you, Abu Salem
Come back when you can.
I would like to take a picture with you so that I can show it to my kids.
Oh my children, the Bistansons are coming now
God keep them for you, God willing
A picture of an artist
Under your command, may God protect you
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, I’m here
You and what you love
Say it a day or two earlier.
Oh my God, oh my God, mom get ready
Get ready, what right?
What’s wrong with you?
And she said, I have no objection.
Come on, mom.
Oh God, go to them
But son, just
You make me feel like we are poor people and we are as we are
You have to dress up
Where do I get my clothes from?
You look like you got me into trouble with people
When you showed me the jewelry for the first time, I’ve never seen you like this
It's my right
Ali's right
Um Ali is fighting for her son Ali's rights
You want to buy some fair clothes and some jewelry
According to her, she wanted to prove to them that they are still people and have good
Oh oh, ماشالله
I can handle it
Masha’Allah, she is my destiny, it has been prolonged and blue
Masha’Allah, I say
May God bless you, Queen.
You also need to get ready
Because they say let my father meet his father
I'm definitely not going to wash the clothes
The first thing I did to them is to show them my new hand
Come on, mom, slowly slowly to annoy the wife
My mother, you didn’t do bad, give them a little bit of a shock.
I I
Zain, we really have to become like them
Why didn’t his mother go to ask for her hand?
But that women
Now I have to go see the men
May Allah protect you as you are doing.
All that’s left is for God to protect you, the chust.
The good people didn’t fall short
We didn’t cut it, we’re still in the coat.
I’m back, take it from you, finish the rest.
Everything is for you
I just want to say to my brother Rashid, how can I be like that and he likes the chaste
Just see, come on first of all
This one needs to be closed

They’ll give it to you in a jiffy, inshallah
The left has sunk as low as the right.
I know my friend, Laayisha.
Who is Aisha, what is wrong with her
Do you know what I should say?
Tell me, since we are such good friends and I don’t want to part ways.
My brother says truthfully that he will go and ask you for your hand in marriage
Say nothing to her brother and embarrass herself
I’m tired of all the letters. These days you keep telling me that Sa’ad wants me for her uncle and today it’s for her brother
They want to take my girlfriend
And I am watching
They don’t know the relationship we have.
No, they don’t know, we are just colleagues
That’s it, kid
They should know by tomorrow.
Why did Walid reject?
I am screaming
You reject my son Walid
The actor is more honourable than you hypocrites
But you
You will be representing yourself for the rest of your life
What are your roles?
Serve the people
You are deceiving people
You wear the clothes of acting in front of God and His creation
The coat I wore on TV
I and you
You wore accessories, gold and jewelry
I played the role
You get married
What is the meaning?
One walks in front of his wife
Take off his hat like two steps
Neither to the right nor to the left
Ya khi remind me of that best friend of yours who you talk about who is with you in the office
Come with him, a boy and a girl
Why does he walk like that?
As it is said
God help him, Real.
Walk, Said, don’t stop
Poor, he has no character at all
He laughs after being happy
Swo lana lbaas stei
No, no, no, it’s not nice when you sit like that
That’s how it is when you walk and stand up. Get up. Get up. Get up.
‏ Please, Khamis, please
What are you doing going there?
Come here, I want you to cook.
Where are you going? Sit with us for a while
He beat his wife.
You like it like that
Oh, Thursday
Turn off the TV and if you look at the host
I am afraid that you will make problems for me
And by God I’m at work
I swear, I'm sitting with Salem, my colleague at work
Haja
The line is blocked.
The phone is ringing, you are causing me problems at home
Now you say you didn’t leave me, meaning your friend is with you, but he’s with you more than ever
So, like, now now maybe God will help me with the eviction
And then she’ll kick you out
You are the first one to release

May God forgive you for what you have done to my mother in her grave
My mother told me to...
She told me not to divorce.

Salih in particular is one of the best young people we have in the region
He will tell you to divorce.
He told me to divorce, OK, OK, OK, OK.

Allah Salem
I am your brother Khamis
No and I’m serious, I’ll talk to you seriously, God willing
Bro
They are erasing my name so that I won’t be banned, you bastard.
How does that mean we strike your name?
The only one who can strike off your name is His Excellency the Minister only.
My brother, this is a meeting at the ministry.
Official meeting
I am a feminist
Salem salem salem
Tell the truth
Who were you arguing with and you were hiding behind the tank
Salameh, Salameh, Salameh, Allah, Salameh
As long as you are safe
Say or how
Ali I am
It’s not me, Khams
So you’re saying the truth
No casual stuff with me
You brother, I complained to a girl
‏ Such a life
Whoever delivers you safe and sound, call.
And the one who will deliver you so that you will believe
Oh, who told you to call?
What are you doing?
I don’t interfere in what doesn’t concern me, or else I know how to deal with you as well.
I’ll complain about you
Who are you?
How do you live with a girl whose tongue is so long?
Let’s start the meeting now
You’ve been good, Hassan, go call Khamis
OK, let’s discuss the real estate budget first of all
‏ Please
Inshallah I’ll find it
I’m telling you, as soon as he saw the women, he was scared.
I went to the ministry and you are not going here
Oh my God, oh my God, the guys are waiting for you in the meeting room
I can’t sit with women
How do you know your wife, Thursday?
I’m afraid you’ll call
You're a fool, you're a fool, my brother, you don't understand.
icon airen and michelle after they brought me home
Your wife will only call at this time
Of course, you are a big company
This project that your company is implementing for our ministry
It is the biggest project in the history of the ministry
Guys, what's wrong with the table, it's shaking
No, your eminence, I am not sitting at this table.
Stay put, respond.
Who is with me
Who is the student?
My phone for you
‏ Moment Moment Baqolj
He actually fainted because he was afraid of going to their house
Oh my sister
He said, "My sister, if you finish your work, this is what you deal with women, I won’t come home.
That's why I submitted a letter to the ministry so that they can transfer me from our department
He himself told me that the minister agreed to transfer him, so do whatever you want, do whatever else.
Bro, what’s with his wife
This is Yنون
Hey Khamis, talk to whom?
I’m telling you, you’re not right in the head
And now what are you going to do, you’re not your wife and the kids are coming tomorrow
God knows what I should do
And you carried out her request, why don’t you leave her alone and go back home and see your children?
So she can confirm it officially
Azain, give her the papers.
That's what I did, I sent her brother, I gave him the paper.
So that he can see the minister's signature and confirm.
And God willing, if you agree, God willing, tonight we can go home God willing.
Me and this is the minister’s signature
After Ashbin
Tomorrow he will attend the new department
So tomorrow I will go to an office and work somewhere else than where I am now
May God protect you as you go to this section.
May Allah protect you. And this is the minister’s visa.
Nothing, nothing, that's in your right hand
Yes, yes, God is peaceful.
Here is your food, enjoy!
And Sa’ad and Abdelkader and Macha’allah, that means a big office, yes
Bye
How do I request a transfer?
Damn, the whole department is women.
Madam yaa
Only the minister himself can take a decision again
You have to stay until the minister returns
Dude, you agree with your colleagues
And call them by the names of Reial, so that your wife is not recognized.
And I left you two more from the increase in the new employee's salary
The new employee, you meant the new employee
I went to the minister's office yesterday and I will come with us tomorrow
I swear
And his shape makes you laugh, and imagine a real mercenary between five women, he's a real antique
But they say to his wife that she is jealous of a fool
G ره عميه
Poor as he is
But he asked us not to talk to his wife, so we kept quiet and didn’t talk.
Which Abdel Qader are you with in the office?
This is what you value, you see it or not.
My son called and said that my wife is coming to pick me up from the office.
What are you doing
Roh Sida Amin al-Awwal Bab
This is the office of the guardianship
With my five women
Hi 6 female employees
It is present I act that if it is enduring
Not on this bullshit
This is my wife, I’m scolding her.
I'm sweet
Now God will guide you, Sultan
We just want to know where we are
My uncle, what happened is that my brother and I, Saqr, were at the bank yesterday.
See that I am in this regard the project
‏ Peace be upon you
My brother, I have an important meeting at work.
Oh my God, go to the kitchen, quickly, oh my God
Now I am wearing a hero to go out
It was supposed to be in the kitchen
We don’t have women, we don’t obey men, God willing
And the scorpion, if it offends God, is enough to ward off the evil of its sting.
This is necessary for the rain, see see
Look at my uncle
Live and the one who will deliver it to you, call the secretary and tell him to inform the employees.
He says that Aminah postponed today’s meeting to tomorrow.
Inshallah, good
They issue orders like that
Oh, woe to us if we do not implement
They should know that you are a big responsibility.
Warging Communications and Responsibilities
In their society, women are only servants.
In my life, I have never seen people despise women like them.
Still living in these old times
Come on, don’t go to work, go to the kitchen and cook for us.
Where are the servants?
The second one is missing for a week
Even the servants were not spared from their insults
They are right to be scared.
God help you
The notes from the bank are simple
What's next
My uncle is saying something, what does he mean
A villa complex without a garden is not worth it
The garden is now
My sister, before you go, I want to ask your opinion on something
My love, Fatoum, I have to go to work late.
O God, please tell me what's wrong with you
You say or I go?
And play it at school
Yat returns to the Women's Union Committee
The school chose me to play with them in the national team
You are stupid
Now you’re telling me you’re going to the national team
Do you think that if you say this to your brothers and sisters-in-law, what will they do to you?
You blame only yourself
That’s what we warned you about
Don’t tell me to go and see her, just greet her, I haven’t seen you in a long time, dad.
Annabbo sanna sanna majofk
Marry him or else
God guide you
Whoever takes one who is uneducated and doesn’t have a certificate and doesn’t know anything, God will guide you.
Lala la, it is not a fault of the Real that he is not educated.
And then this is Khamis, son of scorpions
She bit him, catch him
No and I will not take more than one from his level
Like a Clock Hand
God help you
What should I do, Aisha?
The minister traveled and all transactions are being transferred to me
And saying the truth, Mustafa, the director of the resources department, you need him tomorrow
Just, the ministry’s documents have arrived today.
The program is with you
And now I’ll focus on you, Aisha
Here is Mary
O God, come quickly, quickly
What are you saying, Aisha
Halbawi, where did you come from except from these brothers
My mother what's happening
My love, you need compresses so that your face doesn’t swell.
We warned her and told her not to tell them
She said to them, "beat her and rape her.
Do you think if I told them they would hate me?
Why are you so upset about the weather?
You play football
Next time, break his neck.
Who is he talking to?
The Scorpion and the Frog

Sultan and Saqr, I spoke to them
They have no objection to marrying you to Amanirha
‏ Fight later
No, our Thursday deserves better
Arrange a meeting with them and inform me God willing
My candidacy is included in the delegation
I appreciate your circumstances
But give yourself a chance for tomorrow
I'm telling you the truth
You're very interested
Your candidacy comes from above
He is right.
My brothers and I know them
It’s impossible that they will agree
I am surprised at them
Their monthly payments are deducted from my salary.
It’s me who pays the bills
No, and then you’ll say travel with me.
We’re going to get married this week
What do you say?
Thursday the fool who doesn’t even have a middle school diploma
Marry and travel with him
Science, O God
God forbid what they are doing
If I refuse, they will kill her.
Mom, I told you this so many times
There is no place like home.
I will pay tomorrow, God willing
And don’t worry, I’m a scorpion, son of scorpions.
Even if I don’t like it, it’s still happening
I don’t want to marry Khamis
God, go to the kitchen
Put them in the hall.

The minister's efforts
May God preserve her and make her life longer, she is there.
Please, sir, please.
Good evening, Minister.
Yes, my lord
Washed the dishes
The soul of the coffee for Captain Emad
And then after
We are leaving for China after tomorrow and we will play a match there.
Captain, after I introduce you to my sister, Mary.
What are you going to, uncle, I’m going to my father’s, I’ll fuck
You are a fool
I don’t know your elbow from your knee, you want to take a minister

Why don’t you take Mary’s role?
It suits her better.
30 days of November
I’m done with this curse you put on us in the committee
This is a problem, I’m sure he won’t be silent
And he stops for us on the unity
He talks to you about art, the value of family, and meaningful and well-guaranteed art, mother do you know what
This is from what he put for us in the committee
The minister, he is the problem of the committee
Me, you and Hamoud can throw it on her but hack
No way!
There is nothing to prove that it is mine or Al-Hamid's
Even if he goes to the Ministry of Economy and asks
After we find our names
May Allah protect you, the company was registered in the name of Hamoud’s wife
From this point of view, I don’t agree.
Then I’ll make sure who the committee chairman is, not me.
The last word is decisive, it will be mine
No, everything is fine, you.
I talked to them and agreed on everything
سلام عليكم
Peace be upon you. Hello, Professor Rashid, please come in.
And like you know, you know that this meeting is dedicated to deciding on the approval of the rape of conscience series
Wahoh from the production of the Modern Touches Institute of Arts
Sweet, strange, bold, action series
I am with Hamid
To be honest, the series has a very good story.
I am with you, Hamid
What I liked most was when the mother took the gun and killed her neighbor
And she went to put the gun in the car, and she picked it up.
You don't know that those are his car's action movies when the police searched.
Oh, and where is his son from school?
What is the cartoon by Rolle?
John gives him that strong kick and flies the cartoon wide and gets in from the window of the mother's room
Here is the surprise
Oh my God, this is the shot, this is the shot and the cartoon came into the mother's room
It is beautiful that a local company has reached this level of work
We have to encourage them and take their hands
But brother Rashid, we didn’t hear your opinion
You left me with brother Rashid
With respect to your opinions and impressions about the series called Rape of Conscience
Rape of Human Values
Surprise of Smge
A man and a text in every episode
They left the text for the episode after
A TV Series Written Without Social Awareness
A message that does not elevate society
Crying is necessary for the audience
Rashed please
You said your opinion, Ali said his, I said my opinion, let Professor Rashid say his.
It is clear from the night.
It means I can smell an agreement between you
Arrange the matters
Some people understand this and this is their specialty, and some people have nothing to do with the subject.
I reject this series
I am afraid that our country will cause us problems
Don’t pay attention to him.
Ashbisui wa aibqadr aisee hi
I’m going to keep my word
John gives me the cheese and tells me this is from Mama Samira
I don't know what's going on again
I can’t believe it, Nasser
Oh, the new series I told you I would make soon
I know that he raped his daughter
From all the good that we see from him
First of all, that beautiful ring on your hand
How are you?
In the name of Hamid's wife who sent you the ring
And of course, his role was to fix things and matters
He has a 5% work rate.
A sweet role
I hope he acts like that in the series, I haven't seen the series Amani Taa'a, it was so good
By the way
What rape, what rape, my God
Rape of dreams
Why are all the names like that, they are so similar
For example, last year most of the series were about girls
That means you find the series with more than eight girls and ten more
Durjoy Motsom
We have many torches
Oh oh, your luck has changed after you were insulted
Hala Omar
I ma'ali ma'ali
My love, I have to go to work. What’s going on?
Pour a glass of water and go
He says it is a necessary and important matter.
I have to go.
I know that Rashid went and met the minister.
He says he sat with him for half an hour
And they said these guys will get you in trouble
I’m telling you, he complained to us, you tell me it’s good
What happened now, what happened is that the minister’s office called me to say they need me
And be afraid after the minister believed him
I will meet the minister
The real Yanii will tell me his opinion about the series
No more.
This is correct, Your Majesty.
But first, I, the minister's assistant, wanted to clarify a point, and this is not something that is in my nature to talk about a colleague artist who is not present
May Allah protect you, Rashid, everyone knows this feature
He is envious of everyone around him.
All material interests
But he is a specialist
But God protect you, that is, not everyone will come and replace you in technical matters
Especially TV shows
The series of raping the conscience, God protect you, on which we are working
A Bold, Big Move
On the Gulf level, God protect you, we will have an information precedent
The Spread of Horror
You are, of course, specialized in this and know more about it than I do
Hollow condition series Eypbzh
And raises our name above
But the one written by the journalist Abdel الحميد, listen, listen, listen
In fact, one of the representatives commented
The series contains immoral calls
He laments the decline in the moral and artistic taste in work
God, that is bold speech and strong criticism
They will torture your group if the journalist Abdul-Hamid is behind them
And if their speech reaches the officials
These are smart people who know how to manage it
The tail of a gang
We want a website for us.
We put all the company's activities in it
The company told me what its name is
From today on, you are my media consultant.
And the series "Rape of Conscience" is supervised by the Mercury Company for Artistic Production
A qualitative jump in Arabic drama
due to the noble thoughts and values it carries
It is a series aimed at developing society
The journalist Abdul-Hamid himself who has been criticizing them for a few days
It's ridiculous to transfer like that 80 degrees
How can Abdul Hamid accept himself like this
Journalist Abdel الحميد واشكال
Don’t worry, Mr. Hamid
What do you think of the series? I told him that the series is being broadcast across the Arab world.
God hears you
Guys, my artistic feeling tells me that our series is going to be a hit
That's what we don't know where to put it
And this guy puts his bag down and goes
‏ We start by encouraging
You all are like that, the things they bring in the series, we neither see nor hear about them in our lives
What is written is written
To be honest, all your authors are welcome
What can happen if it doesn’t happen
Your series is so boring
What do you think?
It seems like he needs to get a lot better.
And we are satisfied with the trivial series
No one can understand and catch it from the first time.
In threads and hidden dimensions, it needs concentration so that one can understand what he wants to say about this work
By the way, this is a political thing
It is forbidden to expose people to it
‏ What’s wrong with you
Whoever sees you like that, he’ll say you’re eating poison
Yesterday evening Ali and I were in Souq Waqif.
And sitting in a coffee shop
He gave me the side-eye.
Nasser, what’s your opinion on the subject? If سعاده the minister gets upset, this will be a big problem.
In one week we will all stay at home.
God and the series are fair, what did they do to deserve all the people who saw it and say it’s a failure
I hear that Rashid is going to go to him.
And he’s sure to tell him what I told you, that this series is a failure and a drop and there is no action
You suck, guys
Leave the subject alone
And the Joveon Nasser Ashbaisoy
Listen to me, Eli
From now on, I don’t want any subject to be posted on your page that criticizes the series
Elie رجاء
I saw the subject a few days ago, there was no criticism of the work, only an insult to the work.
Please don’t make me upset.
He sentenced him
But I was an opportunity once
I would never say such things if I were you
But to be honest, I didn’t receive any message to thank you for the series
شو شو the unparalleled success
Bye
My brother Rashid, let me
Do you believe me or the newspapers?
Rape of conscience in the world of television
You’ve been saying this is a journalist we agree with
Listen to the second newspaper what is written
After they agree with the people, read, read in the readers’ page
My heart stopped
I’ll roast it, they’ll tell me
Oh my God, the minister is happy with you
And God, honestly, ناصر
Get Ready for the Rape of Conscience, Part II
No, just no, my friend, I don’t want this to pass.
The first and the last series I write
I’ve finished my work, it’s better for me to do it in the scrap than to do this work
Part two after this mess
And the third and fourth
What's wrong with you, you don't want benefits
I am one of the four guys who are sitting in his mill
This is what we have here
The magician said
Onward
We want a word on the occasion of this anniversary.
Alhamdulillah for the success
The Skeptics’ Success
I am surprised
How can a series win the award and be bad and a failure?
But these are specialists
Give them the awards, they must be seeing something we are not seeing
Prepare for us a second part of the series
God willing, long life
They didn’t say magician but magician
Remembering the rape of conscience, part two
I saw you were standing with the minister at the beginning of the party
After the TV festivals we agreed
Listen to him say to them, get ready, then there is a second part
The same thing
Unclean hands enter the bank so that they can be washed and become clean
These series I watch are cheap, low and worthless.
They will enter the Gulf and Arab festivals
So that they can wash it, give it awards and make it a high-class series for people. Clean it.
Is that reasonable? Why isn’t it reasonable?
As long as the same arbitration committees are the ones who produce the series
سلام عليكم
Peace be upon you and mercy. Thank God you’ve arrived.
Yes, we signed a contract with them, but they want to reduce the price.
Come to the office.
We are a small bakery or you can buy roti and bread
We are one of the largest bakery companies in the world
Nothing down, no dollar
They want it or we cancel the contract
It is enough of the contract we signed yesterday
With the European company
كي كب دبليو اب
What you see
A big job is a job that didn’t happen
For the first time, my product will be the first product in the world
This is what I’m bringing, not the biggest baker of roti in the world
I’m telling you
How did you close the bottle
Either cancel it or go to the kitchen, I’ll keep looking for the prisoner until I find him, and sometimes you might cut your hand.
Sawa rotay hada el-somon bil-sousta
The icon has been put in the cheese and the return has been pressed.
‏ This is my roti, this is my pantaloon
No and you are the flatbread pan bag, how then how then
Abu Nasser and the spider, how is it?
That’s why when I go to work I tell my boss I’m fasting two zips
The dough of the نور الجبال hospitals why didn’t go to them yesterday
I know I’m asking you why didn’t she go yesterday
The thing is, Your Highness, that the bakers and the bakers’ assistants who are in charge of the baking
Reply again to the bakers
That's what happened to you
Shamsawi is back and yelling at him like that
Sit down with all this crap, football and non-football, and mess up my work
Do you know that your son loves football?
If a few employees are having fun, that means the company is doing well.
You have 400 employees in the company, right?
These 10 are considered the main players
And above them, after he took four reserves and two administrators, but Schmack took 17 but
and the team's media spokesperson
Make a story out of this for these idiots
But I walk the situation until I develop, although the fans, that is, the audience consider the most important player on the field and the player number thirteen
His friend is happy when he kills his other friend in front of him
And we are people who have signed contracts with them
Now, when he said I want to play football, why did you make a big deal out of it?
May your ears hear your obedience.
Nothing else.
Now he has brought a few employees and made them play in front of him, he looks at them and amuses himself with them, and then he starts to get upset.
What he says, he doesn’t hire employees
Even if some of your relatives need employees, their one employee is enough.
The Important Bakers
Oh my God, oh God, why do you take the important bakers after it happens
Second time if you hire employees say
No, no to this transaction, let Hamdi review it with me
Hamdi in the hospital
Why isn’t anyone talking to you, my lord?
I finished work and I’m going to drive my car
Listen to you, Nasser, may God prolong his life, he is watching Ali.
I walked on him
The goalkeeper who plays with us told me that he couldn’t find it and we have an important match tonight
He said that he would look for a goalkeeper and we arrived at the stadium
What should the goalkeeper wear?
I have never played football or touched a ball
This is the situation
What is hushed up
And we will hate you, and we will see a job for you to work in it, God willing, no time waste, no quarrels, no nonsense.
Let me tell you.
Hey you, I want you to solve the team and delete it properly
Yes, that is correct.
Zain, God willing, just for this nose, but I’m asking you
Haram means get out and ruin the final match
No, no, he has a right to the boy
What did you say?
Zain, congratulations on the victory
Professor Nasser, congratulations on winning the cup
We wanted to know how you planned to win
See, I’m the team’s morale, physically and mentally, and Alhamdulillah, the coach didn’t fall short.
Inside the Hotel
Congratulations to all of you and the party was like I promised you
I say, your father seems happy
I’m afraid he is embarrassed and stammering.
My uncle Abu Nasser, start like that and pray for the prophet. We want to congratulate you on the big win of your team, International Bakeries.
The Great Victory
God bless you, God bless no, no, no
A picture without a chaste, a moment by moment, hold on a bit
No
I wore the bash.
Without any doubt, your great care, interest and creative opinions played a great role in this victory.
The coach’s plan
But in the final, he played in a 5-5-3-2 way.
And as a great athlete, you know that changing the plan confuses the players. But the Bakery team did not get confused and presented a great game.
The coach’s plan
As the first athlete in the International Bakery, what advice would you give to the players?
Until the end of time
Hello
May your life be long.
He greeted them with Hamoud Sultan
God bless them, they honored us, they will have dinner with us now
Dinner
May Allah bless you, Abu Abdul Aziz
And it is a contribution to the private sector.
Team Toh
Envy us
No one means
Bo Abdul-Aziz
The agency of the machines we use in the factory
Did you see how
This is the one you wished you knew.
The ball introduced me to him and I hinted to him
Kill him, O Abu Abd al-Aziz
And you will be away from hatred all your life
And what's it to you?
I see the ball in his hand, and it’s 50 centimeters away from her, so I’m closer to her.
Abu Nasser hasn’t arrived yet
No, God, he didn’t come today either
In a lecture about sports injuries, he, the platinum sponsor, must be present
I haven’t seen anything yet
I saw the building behind the bakeries that was going to be a workers’ housing
Hello, this is flooded in the field
Like we are used to do, dear viewers, before every match we meet one of the sports icons and we talk to him
This man who inspires the bakery team with his great ideas
How is the International Bakery Team? We heard that you are going to do a comprehensive development.
I mean, on these offices and on this fatigue
A trivial amount, I mean I’m tired of all this for just one million dollars
No, just grill some meat, grill some
Heydi, it was your mistake, not mine, my brother Shahin.
It’s my mistake
I said something wrong
But you didn’t tell me that the players are wanted in the Gulf.
Prices in the Gulf reach fantastic prices
means the player who is going to die 1000 times
They take three and four million dollars for a house in the Gulf
Understand me Mr. Masoud how
Stabil fax from me here
Where is he, while he is present?
I was telling you, my father bought four new players for the team. This is in addition to the new shipment that contains four players.
Here this what is this strange this he puts you Billy and Rinateno this all in his hideout
It has "8000" written on it
Yes, yes, dad, but this is the price, God bless you, he put it from a Turkish club.
In the Emirates they want one hundred and twenty million
Look at me
Can we check the goods?
Sure in front of you
He cooked the man
It’s all done.
No, I will give you everything for sure
Fat, ماشالله, what a beauty, fat
This is the pivot of this right pivot
Thirst for Fat
This hungry muscle is the most important thing for a player if it breaks down, there is no use for it
I didn’t fail.
Let Adriel get them to us by the robot. I said I’m the robot.
Screw him
Oh God, let’s go.
‏ Congratulations
This is God, may He protect you, buds
Yes, I will take them from the jungles of Africa, what will we do with them?
Teach them, educate them, then crush them in the stadiums.
I didn’t ask for anything, I didn’t ask for your anger, dad, take it, take it, you have space in the car or I’ll carry you in the بيك.
It was a bad day when they saw them squeezing on us
Let the attacker down
Cacakanua Makalali Dndh Laa
Let the guns speak
Kajou Makakakanani lulululu this is what is supposed to be downloaded
Our coach is a fool.
Inshallah on Mars
God willing, not even Spain on Mars
I don’t like the way he reads the match report.
This walks on a line
The match has its rules
Inshallah two days
What's wrong with you? Your voice is too loud.
This is a Spanish bra for you
He doesn’t want to be convinced that the coach is an idiot, he doesn’t understand football.
Listen, listen, what does Mitsu say? Please.
He knows that the KFA fighter سيلولوتيكاواوا was born in the penalty area like Ahmed Al-Taib said and he knows how to center
Mhaden ba3iwar rasak
Stay away from me
And I know how to deal with this coach
Why did the team go back?
What is happening now should make the team of the International Bakery Center think about changing half of the match.
Because the players don’t play in their positions
And the player Takolamamakokolalala, this is not his natural place, he must move to the place where he always plays.
The coach’s right word
Cocunaly withdraws Hopoway Malalo
Inshallah, inshallah, inshallah
No, no, no, what is happening in the stadium
What is happening now is something that should not exist between the team manager
and the team trainer
If there is anything to be postponed until after the match
Now everyone is watching and everyone is boring and the thing in front of the camera
The ball is in play, a fourth goal for the team of success
He scores the fourth goal and he is the star of the match today
This coach is stubborn as a mule
He said, "It's over, my dear Bou Naser, you are not wanted as a coach for his team.
And what after that
I’m watching the match on TV and you stay on the bench and do what I say.
My son, don’t do that to yourself, it’s not good.
Now we have a match, how do we play without a coach
What should I do with my father?
Rashed, enough
Ouch, my daughter, my heart, what’s wrong with you? Tell me, what’s wrong with you?
Divorce me, oh divorce me
How did you get divorced?
My mother, oh my mother
How come you’re calling me? It’s only been a month since I got married.
By God, I don’t know, I don’t know
That means I’ll come and pick you up on the way
Oh my God
Oh my God, I have no idea what he’s talking about, he just said get up and go to my family’s house
Why did he kill her? He said to her, "It’s over, you’re divorced."
I don’t know what’s going on, I swear.
A city where married people are separating, what do people say about us
I am with you
And God, I’ll tell you
I didn’t even know he divorced her except from you now
Stay put for a minute and I’ll be with you
Of her high morals
Barcelona's Saturday
Abdallah's eye view
Yani came back with a tear on his cheek
He says, "My mom said Barcelona came back, he will die for this team, he respects it a lot."
You hurt him and wound his feelings
He said to his mother, "I will tell him to let Barcelona go. I will tell him to forget about it and let her go. He will get someone else for her."
I’ll tell you, your daughter got divorced because she left Barcelona’s team
Just because this is the reason I divorce her, seriously you
I don’t care about you.
It is easy to hurt feelings
Wife stabs husband over his loyalty
I can't believe what I'm hearing
A girl who doesn’t respect international teams is not worth our time.
This time he made fun of Messi
Problems between spouses arise and it is supposed that we
Unit 1 alternative
Girls are a lot and I wish I had one son
Listen to my words, you woman.
But I don’t want to hear anything.
And please don’t enter this son of mine and I know him well.
We told you not to enter.
I’m getting angry at you now
Don’t worry, mom, don’t think about it.
Unit 1 alternative
But why are you so bothered
But every time I mention her words
Real Madrid is better than Barcelona
Here my love
Poor thing, heal her like this
Hey girl, it’s Mona.
Married for a month and divorced
And even if I went to tell you, why did you look, you're going to die laughing
We need your reform
What benefit is there, mother, from a man like this who divorced his wife for a football team
The hairdresser knew them and told me about the whole story. Mom, don’t get me involved with him and I don’t want to get into trouble with a guy like this.
You are lazy, you let these hairdressers who have nothing to do go.
Do you know how to tell them that I don’t agree
Let her get confused and say whatever she wants
Hi
Kill her, kill her, my sons, don’t cut off her livelihood.
If it was a matter of her provision, it would be a matter of her destruction.
Except she cuts our and her own livelihood
This building
He says no to me
God damn that shitty hairdresser, mother of all the talk and gossip
Just listen to it and spread it
I don’t care about it
Understand it and tell her not to cut the door of good that is opening for us
Oh he knows how to convince her
Are you crazy? Do you really believe that the guy divorced his wife because she left Barcelona?
Let go of the nonsense or you’ll become a fool
Don’t miss the opportunity.
And she is the reason, and there is something or a defect that made him divorce her
Listen to me, girl, don’t waste your two bras
What is this after two towers?
But they are about to discover that they are two towers
That’s why they called his father Shahin Bu-Bargin
‏ God bless you
O nonono sweet thank you missy
Oh Mr. Morsi, don’t let them deceive you, please.
You’ve been saying that for a long time, they asked for it and you signed it, and the money has been spent already.
Your number is not clear and it seems like you are very busy. This is since you arrived.
That was the first wedding month, now it's a new wedding, Abdullah divorced.
And before that he was married and divorced

And that’s the story, man, just take it easy
Real, this is a difficult generation
The Other Opinion
‏Congratulations, congratulations, mom
Oh my God, don’t forget the fur coat I put on top of the bag
So you can take it in your hand while you are on the plane
Where did you all come from?
Hey, you guys aren’t planning to go to London?
Hello
Any beauty, it’s over
Because she’s coming with us and is doing shopping anyway
Malaysia Malaysia

Bye, mom
Heal her now
And I don’t know
This is it, ask her right in front of your eyes or I don’t know what’s going on
What's wrong with you?
I gave her nothing in that sweet.
A girl from there
She is supposed to put you in her eyes, use you with her hands and eyes
Is it really here, you are pouring water
No and the cup is not what you can carry and drink.
She’s not well-behaved

And this is the one with him
Hey girl, Asma Mashal
Poorly painted and stupid in the honeymoon
You won’t be a failure if you fail.
May God bless you, my aunt, thank you
Your aunt will advise your aunts after.
I just don’t know where my mom booked us.
Oh, hello mom
Oh my God, where did you book us?
She thought she would go with us there
There is no power and no might except with Allah
Screaming at him like that at the airport and screaming at him to take the kids
What’s going on between them
Now you ask me what I know about what’s happening between them
God, I miss him
Where is Ayel and Amniyah
Aky in her room gossiping with that stupid guy
Now you tell us that it has been two days since she called him and called his phone off-hook
What I caught only now
This is what we’ll wait and see what happens
He is annoying the boy, he is tired and wants to be held.
Oh my God, every day I tell her to get me an apple, peel it, and she doesn’t peel it, every day she annoys me.
Then you know that I don’t like apples with their skins.
Or, the apple is peeled.
What?
You are divorced
And when necessary
Soul of my eye
I would die for you
Here, here, what did Minrah say?
Washfiq after you are bothered
Call him three times and tell him I’m divorced
Shut up and get lost
My mother fucked me off at the disco in Spain and went to tell him
He really has no story.
That's right, he doesn't have a story
You dance for her twice, three times
After that, let him who will release my daughter, die. Only he exists.
How do you call it
Come on, where are you going?
Where are you going? I’ll go cool my temper with this one who doesn’t blush.
And it has a tail like a peacock
Inlaid with gold, rubies, coral and onyx
Your daughters are a toy for you and your son.
They don’t have any mothers, they burn them to death.
What you put in your ass
And you let them go as you please
What did you drink, my water, let her be Barcelona, let her be, let her be.
Going to a nightclub
No shame, no decency
A minister’s agent, a Muslim and an Arab
His reputation and the reputation of his children were accused.
Stay still and don’t move
Keep some humanity.
My father's right
Who would sell a piece of land like this
Bou Sakhr take it from my father by force
Why did your father sell it?
God guide you, Bu Sakr, that is, if he sets his eyes on someone, he can say no
Just leave it to God, Real.
Live, live, shower, shower
Oh God oh God
Here Bou Saada, what’s the status of your project
Put your hand on it
Zain, didn’t you say last week that you’re going to the office?
I told you that if you want your project to move forward, you need to smooth things over with your age and grease the wheels.
Bou Sakhr the Millionaire
Whoever eats in this world, does not eat
This is not a problem and I’m your brother, I’ll eat it and fill him up and pierce his stomach the problem is how to reach him
You need to know the key to Bu Sakr so that the doors will be opened to you.
He died while performing Umrah and was buried with the Muslim prayer.
What I need to know as long as you are throwing it, you behave yourself, but you need to know the right opportunity
I’ll tell you, the secretary told me that Bu Saqr is waiting for you for dinner
Along Dakeet Salaf Weit
This is Bou Sakhr, God preserve him, he makes dinner every day

It was my son who took the license out.
May God bless you and grant you peace.
Congratulations on your license, Falcon
God bless you
Bou Sakhr, your longevity
Please, don’t refuse me, say yes.
Just say yes, for the sake of your life.
A gift from me to him
Whoever gives you peace, do not turn him away.
Moshte Amori
It’s normal, you met him and said to him, what?
You still don’t become stupid
Come on, no big deal, ya Abu Nasser
Understand me, what is the way, what did you do?
Circumstances served me
And we are sitting with him
Joud and his son Saqr take the license
I have a gift from Saqr
If the car
Affordable
Come, come and sit by me
What happened
He was released from the hospital
I want to remove my tonsils
And he’s definitely going to make dinner
You deserve the boy’s safety, O long life
May you be rewarded and remain in good health. Inshallah he will not see any harm, inshallah.
We met at the shop selling rosaries
I think, God knows
Real, we are forgetting that we are getting old.
They told me again that the room where your shoes were was your son Shahin and he came out
I said I would visit you.
And I congratulate you on the peace of Shahin Absalam
You are good, God. Listen, my lord, you’re not leaving unless you have dinner with us.
I’m in the mood for it
You said it would be done before
On the occasion of the discharge of our dear son Shahin from the hospital
In the tower I have on the promenade
It’s over
Oh my God, don’t put your head on the block.
I don’t like trading and I have no inclination towards it.
Whoever gets something in this time starts his business without capital
In the vehicle and bulldozer agency but he says what is this
Love from God and people love you from the love of your father
even the university
All the doctors love your father and respect him
And three-quarters of them are with him every night in the mill.
Masha’Allah, your father, nobody loves him, you just point.
Oh my God, people take loans from banks so they can start a company or trade
I sat in the assembly
Opening for rent
Something new with depth
This is a hawk, look into my eyes, give me them yesterday and he said simple try them
He came back yesterday with their goods
I saw how
And after I say, O mother, all the traders love me, may God love his creation in you, O Lord.
Oh, my lord
I’m on my way now, on the way to the office.
I saw a new supermarket
Just get ready
I really liked it
My mother, who is it?
Congratulations, congratulations, Uncle Sakr, congratulations.
May God protect you
‏ In the name of God, in the name of God
What is it that he comes to take it cold and chilled
You, now he can say no
What's the story?
What does he say, I mean?
Dush ma'ah
You don’t know who his father is.
Whoever doesn’t work, his father won’t help him
He said to me, I am Qasem Sadyقه Abbas, you have F in Zubsb.
I have a baker, thank God, I earn my living from him.
I don’t like the name.
What I noticed
No, my brother, the name is not nice
Well, that's a suitable name for Iranian bread
I found him by grand mail
We call Qassem Khalas a Grand Bread Bakery
Wait for me a bit
سلام عليكم
Peace and God’s mercy, may you live a long life
Excellent, excellent, what else do you want?
No, thank God, everything is fine
I’m saying to Ayad, this is a new employee at our place
She sent my car for repair, and she took my car because she is the advertising representative of the company that makes the repairs and she didn’t offer to give up the car.
You might still need your car
No, I don’t need the car today at all.
Oh God, whatever.
This is the time of science, knowledge and study
I agree with Dr. Rashid, a person should arm himself with his article whatever the article is.
Well done, Dr. Sami
Sm, old man
Study and study
You are just listening to us, dogs
No Lessons, No Trade, No Economics
He never read a book, not even a newspaper, he never held a paper in his life.
You all know who Sakr is today
Even if I didn’t want to enter this field of trade and
Aunt Bou Naser, he is alive and well in front of you
From the خاطره
But there are people who are naturally inclined towards business and love business
You are right, Dr.
Inshallah, Shahin, you will see your brother
God is generous, God willing
It's people now
Of course, this depends on education
You’re too early, Dr.
To be honest
How did Falcon mean it so easily, he who hated trade, reach this great economic sense
If a hundred billionaires in the world were enemies today, their enemy would be one of them
Do you know, Mr. Falcon?
Saqr chose the فارس ( فارس) award for the market
Peace be upon you
How are you, Nasser?
I received a call from Mohamed who said that Bou Nasser is in the hospital.
He told me once that he heard that Bou Sakr’s son, Sakr, wants to take over the car agency from his father.
The agency flew away from you
The world is not full
It was his father who helped him enter the market
And that's what made him open his eyes to trade
To be honest, the doctor says his condition is very difficult.
But that's not how it works
Nothing is impossible
A shocked or supported one, it's not my business. I'm telling you, divorce her, divorce her, I mean divorce her.
In the 21st century in Heik
And we meet dear viewers with one of the men of good and giving in this country
A man who knew the right way of the needy and the deprived
Of course, we have the founder and owner of the Falcon Charity Association
Of course, if you were to talk to us, my lord, about this association
We all know your noble goals that you are trying to achieve, of course for the world and of course for everyone.
Without any pretension or vainglory, God forbid!
And praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds, recently we were able to deliver thirty qirats to our brothers in Africa
And now, Alhamdulillah Rab al-Alamin, we are preparing to deliver
Seven crates of sweets for our children in Gaza
Masha’Allah, oh long life, may God increase in number such as you
We left the house, me and my wife.
But my wife takes half an hour to open her new project
And I’m waiting for her
What is wrong?
I really love to cook, I love to cook with you, it makes me happy.
I provided for my children
All of my life
It seems like you want to waste my time
Out of Problems

Oh love, take me to my homeland
Hi Fadi
‏ What’s new with ‘Aunoud Sho?
No no no no no
Now you told me that the dress will be ready after a week, yesterday I received a message from you saying that it will be ready after ten days, you stupid
You want him to take a bit more and more
And God willing, now I will talk with Al-Anoud and ignore me.
Why are there so many نوره (Noure) around us
Don’t be sad, the world is not worth it, and don’t be sad about Enood.
Wait a minute, Fadi, they came at you.
Oh, how beautiful their words are. I envy you, not like our people, I envy you.
‏ Just don’t forget the subject
My dress is ready
Fadi, please.
Thanks, my brother Fadi
Hey brother Fadi, I’ll pass by next week to pick up the dress, God willing, bye for now
What can I do for you?
But just send me the dress at home
No, I didn’t like it.
What a shame, I went to the shop today, Fadi was there, everything was perfect and the girls were coming and going.
Alhamdulillah we succeeded in this project
What happened?
Bou Nasser, my uncle
Fix it after
See the envy
We’ve never heard of a project by this bankrupt guy, where is he going to get the money
She needs a good sucking
And the first thing I started trading
Are you sure?
Listen to what I say
And God willing, you are planning to keep quiet about it
Seven in the morning
Y Y Iبون لك الريوق
Don’t give it to me, I’m thirsty.
I just want you to say one word
I heard that you
I want to get into a business
But where am I and what are these stories? God guide you, my cousin.
Designing women’s clothes, we design something, for example
I will tell you a story
I am a merchant of trade.
No, no, yes, but only I
I want to consult you, I want you to know that I am present, that is, if you want me to help you with something
You’re welcome, my nephew, you’re welcome
Sorry, God, I’m going.
Please, sir.
It's the first time you tell me if you want more
Oh my God, oh Fadi, arrange the store, it’s crowded, I see
The shop is not open.
I said you were taking the shop that was reserved for me, so get on with it and take it.
I wish
This shop is the one you should buy from
There is a man called Khalf Sultan Al-Saeedi other than your cousin Bou Nacer
No, there isn’t.
I came from the Ministry of Economy, I see his name in a transaction with one of my friends, his name is Essam, he is holding the documents.
Women's fashion design
Sure
I see the lease contract and his name is written on it
Fix it, meaning fix it, fix it

‏ You are brothers
My friend Ibrahim advised me.
Get a Lebanese designer
I asked myself once
Know our women well, they die for Lebanese
Madam, this is not good for you, no, no, there is nothing like this in Doha, at all.
Yee, madam, what are you wearing? This is so sweet, and the piece that they are selling for thirty to forty thousand.
Any such thing
Your repression that I did last year when I brought the Lebanese carpenter
Madam, I will make you a wardrobe that you won’t find anywhere in Doha.
How to succeed
What exactly is it?
Why don’t I know
The meaning of customer service
What do you say, uncle, let’s go somewhere else
Ava Ava ya Fadi
They play with their souls at that time
It means we lost no
We have to face it
And our customers will return, whether they like it or not
OK, you pay.
I didn’t pay my family.
I am ready to do anything
But the important thing is not to beat me.
This is the dress you chose, it costs 60,000 riyals.
Sure, without the ties that exist in the text
‏ This is a gift from the designer, me
And he put a crystal on it, there are only 50 of them in the whole world, this is a special one from many.
Of course there is no discount, our prices are known worldwide.
No, definitely no. Who would do such a thing?
What happened, Madame شو by شو?
Come on, Sa'ad, come on
They are making a sale.
Butch us, we don’t have any customers left.
Haydi isma warb ya bu Nasser
And we are not going to keep quiet for them
We need to fight them like they fight us and respond to them.
Tomorrow I will take a loan from the bank
Start the war against them and I will show you what I can do to them
May you bring her back to me, Bu Nasser
Watch the ad
See the announcement he put up.
We are offering two evening gowns for free with every wedding dress
He has four evening dresses with each wedding dress
And we’re putting a quarter-page ad
Jوفي هو حاط نص صفحه
My mother, what are you planning to do with it?
Do you believe it, Oum Naser?
It has been six days since a single customer has visited their shop.
No and this afternoon I’ll tell you what, they didn’t open once, they banged.
And if you hear that he is offering his shop for sale
‏ Kill him, kill him
They can’t even sit outside
Alright, drink your Jake and go see him.
Oh my God, where am I going and where are you going, this is a problem
Are you an enemy of someone?
This is God, may He protect you, someone intentionally poured this place with this smell
And these are chemical materials
Are you sure that someone sprayed perfume in the store?
You are grown-ups, not kids, stop fighting like children
Yeah, at night and the smell is bad in the shop, meaning this is fair
What did I do to you? What did you do to me?
On mistakes
You wrote a pledge to the police for yourself
No, thank you.
I am this time
He is equipped with a hellish plan
Without anyone holding Ali by the nose
No, everything is normal.
What is this that confuses me
I don’t know what’s going on, this is the fourth day that not a single customer has visited our store
The shop's second floor made me reveal my face, God guide you
What did the doctor say?
I see the shop is empty, there is no customer.
I don’t know what you did to him, Amsawin.
The women and daughters don’t come close to the shop at all
I say, what is the designer Saad's magic spell?
It’s not far, don’t rule anything out these days
Magic is real and that’s a fact
Is Zain sleeping or sitting now?
Man, go in there, I’m afraid the ceiling is going to fall.
You lost, Sultan, you lost
My mother made him a cup of tea.
He is a beast.
Calm down, mate, don’t upset Abu Omar
My mother what are they doing
My beloved taught me that they say to you that his four friends got together and gave him money to pay his debts
The designer who has
Lebanese man
You said to him, you said to him
Do you know where I’ll go?
The stars are there and the extras are playing their roles
Call the Real again, maybe he has an excuse.
What’s up, uncle Ahmed?
What is this, uncle Ahmed? You’ve been sitting here and leaving the guy to torture me. What are we going to do or what? Where is the extra guy you said you’d get for us?
Get away from me, it’s better for you. I called him and my head hurt so I asked Prof. Abdullah.
First of all, I don't scream because we are actors, we want to be a little relaxed, we want to focus on our roles. Secondly, the real one called more than once in front of me, calmly.
What do you say, Mr. Abdullah, what do you say?
‏ Professor Abdullah, what am I going to do? This crazy guy will finish the scene and leave me alone.
Oh my God, you guys, oh my God, the next one, the next one
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Professor, we will finish, but these extras who are supposed to film the scene after don’t.
Don’t you want someone to treat you well like that
Do your work well and without shouting
This is our situation, all day long shouting from the morning we want to focus.
I found a solution for you.
What do you say, I'll manage on my own, until I get an actor to play the role, insha'Allah.
It’s really time for him to work on one scene
But this is the most important scene in the series
But please, add some pictures, sorry.
But if you were ready I will pack today
Above the youth, God
What's your problem with a Filipino?
You know Bou Walid, he’ll just walk away and say he wants someone to invite him to the cabaret, and he’ll be from the cabaret and a Qatari.
Sir, I will put a kaffiyeh and a cap on him, he won’t be seen anyway
Alaa, are you serious? You only want things to be like this? This is a production, respect people's feelings, people's intelligence.
You are putting all the work on Alaa’s head, distribute the tasks and you will feel better
I'm giving it to you so that we can think together. Do you remember anyone like this from the group?
Who am I?
Remember Ahmedy one in the neighborhood of As-Saltlah, his name is Saud Aknar
Saud Aknar otherwise
Saud Qatati says
The man wants a rich and respectable one, and you want tins.
My beloved, in the end, he is a bit player, meaning he brings a rich and handsome one who gives him bit parts
But a little make-up, Reem, and put on a clean shawl, dress and a nice car
Inshallah it will be useful
How will we reach that medicine?
I am their daughter.

Yeah, thanks dad, you didn’t fall short.
Now how can I go to my mother without this only hat that my uncle brought me from the trip
You only have that one that you wear
Mom, it’s in the drawer under my clothes
The gang, my god, wait for me at the door
God bless you, dad
Today they are going to film you on TV
Oh my God, they said that they are going to show me on TV as one of the big ones
Sit down, you fool.

May God guide you, God willing.

Peace be upon you and God’s mercy and blessings.
This is Abd al-Fattah Abd al-Sabour's son
Hello
Hello Saud
This is what makes the scene
Inshallah inshallah he will do a good job, relax and wait so that they give you a longer role, okay
Ask mom, how is she?
A few of those who were caught on the first side
Shame, shame, stop it, oh my, Saudi.
You started wearing glasses
The slave's hair turned grey
And I won’t change, I regret nominating you.
The brother who is being trained to play the role of King Abdul Aziz
Oh, hello, dad. Hello, God, hello, hello, hello.
‏ Look at this, this is our teacher, Mr. absent-minded.
The most important thing is that you are not afraid of the camera
My brother, I am afraid of no one but God.
Don’t move, just relax and listen to his instructions. Tell the director, inshallah.
My brother, please, you’ll play the role of a cabaret artist, a singer, do you understand or not?
Come here, boy, come here, boy
I am talking to you
This is very light, trust me, the role needs someone heavy
Everything is acceptable to some people
Ask me why I walk this way
I’ll take you to the make-up room, listen to me, I’ll take you now, and I’ll show you the way.
Damn, damn, damn
Come here, please.
We got to know her
بس بس بس عندك عندك
Come, God has brought you, please, please.
My teacher, the car you want for the scene is ready.
Saud is cleaning everything that is in order
I'll call again once more and tell the assistant director so he can hear you and check on him
Imagine yourself as the old trader
What are you saying?
I’m telling you, be patient, don’t be in a hurry, I didn’t expect that from you, you are BO ABDULAZIZ, say something.
On our rights
Sweet and know
Come on, man, clean up your act.
Benjaf and complete the name full Bouabdellah Falah Al-Marzook sweet
Sweet, just keep going and consider.
Consider your daughter divorced
What’s the problem, why did you divorce her?
Your daughter is divorced, she is beautiful.
It’s very nice, keep going and consider yourself not taken
Why don’t I tell you to go fuck yourself
You are like a rose, God bless the prophet, you are like honey
My tooth hurts
How come, what
Sir, the owners of the house woke us up and they want the hall in the Muxarak al-Nنقaz, the place where the scenes in the hall are filmed. Then, Ansur the hajqats outside.
‏ How does it mean they don’t want
Yes, they want to, but just postpone it a little bit, they want to shoot another scene and we’ll follow them, God willing.
Leave them, they will come to you.
سلام عليكم
Peace be upon you
May God bless you with a good morning, my lord.
‏ Hi, who are you, boy
I am Salim Bushuei, the socialist.
And the Shua'bi are well known
You deserve it
I was bitten in my mouth after the lips were put on
Come here, my friend, those with weak noses
I wish
If it wasn't for you, I would have died from laughing
I wish I could
Oh my God
My mom is tired now, I need to go to her fast, man.
You go away naked
What I can tell you is that my mother is sick and tired.
Listen to me, you can go like that, but when you call me back, come quickly.
We and Wahoo can’t change the location
Alas, alas, find me a taxi, man.
What taxi are you talking about, if I look here and wait for a year I will look for a taxi and I won’t find one.
Do you think this car is ours? It’s for the scene.
She was still standing in her soul.
Yeah, man, please, I wish you would give me a syringe, my mom is sick, and I really need a syringe, give me one
In the car
I want a chair
Daeiye halan daeiye abet lek kersi halan halan ya sheikh
I’ll tell you, I’ll tell you
I’m telling you, my mom is tired, God, in the car I wanted a chair, God bless you.
Where is my friend inside the car
Oh oh my mom my mom what happened
Be silent or speak in my ear while you are silent
‏ Peace be upon you
There is nothing, but your aunt, her mother, has an asthma attack, God willing.
Let them show the bed
Alright, alright
And don’t worry about it
God will punish you what have you done
Alhamdulillah ya رشيد
They killed our son, Rashed
Please, come with me, Mr. Rushod
Be kind to him, Mr. Rushod
I’ll take Mr. رشاد and do what is necessary.
This is your Mamun
I’ll make the nurse check your pulse and see what you’re drinking.
Please, sir, Rشود

We are two people waiting
The problem is that he didn’t give us his address
Sier Snu Yabi Yisreb Jay Kوفي Kabgnou
Ya, you are the first one, I am going to take a picture of the sugar cube in the hospital with a Filipino woman
And who told you that I refused
Not a single one gave me a face.
Philosophers and no conditions
Except he doesn’t have a degree, what do you want from him? What do you want from him? Go fuck yourself.
Ya kii fe wahda fe almishrf eajabani
Ya, mb I didn’t give you a reason, look for another one.
My heart is attached to what cannot be
Your brother, medicine and love, would you believe me if I told you
I’m giving this to Dr. Mohamed
It is snowing again
Oh my God
By God, on this face
Your aunt is in perfect health
You are a professional actor, Saud, God bless you, guys, the next one, God willing.
Oh, you’re amazing, you saw how they clapped for you and praised you.
Oh my God, go change your clothes and wipe the make-up now
Son of a bitch, leave me alone and come sign for me here first
Yes, from today my name is Falh Al-Marzooz
Let go of this talk and write Saud
Saoud is dead
‏ From today I am called Falah Al-Marzooz Bouabdellah.
God bless you my love
One buffet
Suite two
Until I heard one of the bride's people say, "God, these people are very civilized, I don't think anyone can do what they did at the wedding."
I love you, my dear, take care
Here it is
I have to give them something as a wedding present.
What, ya mama
Look at your brother who makes us fail
And his wife is a failure, you know
But it will go as far as we go
Why should the servants eat this?
He wants to keep us in his zoo
Say what you see,زين.
This is the kind of free class for those people
The Mediterranean’s Tarifa
No, we want something extraordinary, we want something that not everyone can buy.
Forgive the الشيخه who doesn’t know you, you are a long-lived one, order.
Just shut up, you don’t know anything.
I’m afraid the money I have won’t be enough.
We didn’t fail, spirit, pull the card
Oh oh oh, what a nice thing, God!
Saleh Malj yesterday
Saleh Nasser
Come, come
Come to me, Abha
I have reserved a small hall and food for Glaga.
VeriGip
Al Lam Al Laqalaha 'an 'Urus Bayt Is'a'id
Surely all people say the same thing
That's what scared me.
My dear wife
Just sit and wait for my money
And it does not matter what people say
He wants to keep us in his zoo
But it's not supposed that I get something for us according to our conditions and circumstances
Do you know that some people borrow money and some sell their houses and cars just to have a luxurious wedding and they don’t let people talk about them.
Just get out of the story and it's enough, the pocket that I wanted to fail us in
You said that the director was impressed with the Chinese dish and took it home
The bride’s family said: “You chose the hall and the tent and prepared everything on your own.
And God willing, we will choose anything
Mo means nothing, but I mean the shop we went to for a while, I mean its price is very suitable
This is the shop that made the wedding house of gold
One used it before
And God, to be honest, once
Marry a girl to a long life for Mubarak
No, we don’t want anything used.
My father, we are the first people in the world to use it
‏ You want to stand out
What are you doing?
‏ This is the first time this shed enters Qatar
Inspired by the information surah, meaning Facebook and Twitter
Very modern and minimalist
And all the price of the garbage with the equipment
Could you just calculate it for me, but not the one from 25,000
Oh my God, oh my God, this is not enough for our money, everything is more expensive, better and unique.
Everyone is like that
Shut up and if you are saved
What is the meaning?
What do you like about this?
This is Noah’s Ark
Two of you are my grandfathers but the ark of Noah is more precious than twenty thousand
No and what, God bless your parents, I say the luxurious couch is much better, to be honest.
Shut up, I want Noah’s Ark
These are the weddings and their costs, and we consider ourselves average people
So you need to pay 50,000 for the kitchen and 50,000 for the hall. This is the Royal Hall, as you call it.
We didn’t say he was a magician, but he is very showy and everyone wants to look like the second one and everyone wants to do better than the second one.
The battle of مظاهر (Minhar) benefits only the owners of wedding halls
Those who know that everyone wants to stand out, they take advantage of us and lie to us
And God knows, one of my friends says his brother has a wedding shop
The cost of the sandbox is not 2000 rials
Don’t beat them, I didn’t believe in God, her father. May God guide her.
Grow up, kid, act.
Like others before you, the young people got married and spent
Hello, Sheikh, may your age be long.
How are you?
I know you love excellence.
And that's why I'm doing it.
For the first time in Qatar, by the design of the world artist Peter Salmo
The Formation of Her Employees on the Nine Planets
From the solar system
With the ark of Noah's ship something much more beautiful will come up
Armony Mafi, there will never be the first one in Qatar who uses the nine planets
That’s it, kid
It was fifty one thousand and now
Any salvation
God will give you peace
May your right eye be blessed.
It is wide expenses and I am your brother
In general, I couldn’t manage all the 80 of them
All I could do was 60,000 and 20,000, I took it from my brother
You didn’t do anything, you didn’t do anything, God my brother, my brother Fahad
Get lost, Fahd, as long as we are showing off and you are making an appearance at the wedding, we don’t care.
No show, no fuss
Sure, I’ll send you the cards you want.
Inshallah this week we will start with the cards
If our wedding is more beautiful than theirs
Oh my God, my daughter-in-law is making the wedding cards
Where does your brother live?
People now travel to countries just to make wedding cards
Mo and Amin went to Italy to design, print and bring the cards
They go to France, even people who don’t have much money will go to Lebanon, they will go to Lebanon and bring their cards
After the country like that, we are the ones who have to break the rules
Why and where do you want to travel, God willing?
It means we have a lot of very cool cards
She is really expensive but
But she is unique and no one else is like her before us
A button is not nice
I say, gold is better to polish.
Why didn’t he have the money for the wedding?
He tied himself up in knots.
And leave us with all this pretension and snobbery at weddings and the useless losses
And no one benefits from our mental illness except these hotels and wedding halls.
He is poor.
Let me go and deliver it to him, it's a shame I might not find anyone to take it to him
May your heart be filled with love.
I won’t let you down, Nasser
Ya kii ahle el-rouse, after they are supposed to stand with you
But I only once, only once.
I’m saying, it doesn’t have to be in a huge hotel ballroom
We found our daughter in the street and the others are not as good as her
This problem, everyone is looking at everyone
Who told you that I got married
At least people don’t have this pretentiousness
It’s just a simple party and expenses are according to the situation
‏And then come on, Real, these days people are having wedding parties on Facebook
cheaper and less expensive
So you’re not married to your country
Forget to show me here
Araoui is back
If I don’t get the right for my son Abdullah’s wedding, Arwishd or Nawal.
Go fuck yourself, she looks better than me
I say my love
Miss Walaad has the number of Aroweshd, give it to us so we can talk to him
OK, my love, you’re not being short, God bless you, bye.
We agreed with Yame on DJ, but I changed my mind.
Um Nasour’s outlook is better than mine
You forgot who she is and who we are.
Those who are less than us can become better than us
The subject is not like that, but I just saw your brother Saleh and he broke my heart and we don’t want to pressure him
I really broke my heart
Oh, my God
In the hospital, Amti and I went to the hospital
My mother suddenly fell on us
I heard that talk and then you would fall on us
He doesn’t have a story, don’t blame me after I prepared everything and people did their part, he says he doesn’t want a wedding.
He wants to fail us
What did the doctor say?
He wants to cancel the wedding, sister.
And God willing, only good will happen
Don’t break her heart
Mom, you’re real and you’re the one who brings the money
The spirit of the wind in her heart
And God, if I said that to Boyousouf, his heart would stop.
Do you know why the minister is keeping me away from Youssef for now
You know, he was supposed to retire three or four years ago.
There is nothing, he is helping me.
No, by God, you’re not right
You understood that I am younger than him now
Leave him to deal with the papers and the statements until you return the money
This is called the excessive cooling delay.
Why are you scared, I didn’t say anything?
There is nothing and then I will return the amount in the end
Do you know what they call me? Do you know what they call me?
The committed and disciplined
My uncle, my uncle, I tried but there is no other way
I gave you the IOU after the audit.
And their condition is for Allah, so I don’t audit them quickly quickly
Love, love, love quickly
I ate the whole thing
No, Inshallah, we will be in the hall at 7:30 to receive the guests.
No, we will not be there
I will have a wedding for my son and it will be the talk of all of Doha
Surprise
I want to talk to you, my love, Fatemeh.
I’m afraid for you, my son, they will envy you if you come to them like this in the future.
Here, he is, he is tall and handsome.
The police are coming
O God, make it good
Six policemen, stay here, I’m coming to you.
God will take his revenge on you, Salouh
Your marriage is over
The cage of marriage is now the cage of prison
They discovered the papers I hid for your loan, God! Now it occurred to them and they caught me.
And why are you bothering yourself
Do you hear bigger troubles than this?
Shenqol has returned
A respected, loyal employee
Does he like his job? The ministry contracted a company to do the maintenance.
The employee, out of his concern for his work, asked about the materials.
He found her for 420 riyals
Saves the ministry one million and six hundred thousand
The minister will not punish him, I can’t believe this.
And why don’t I believe
Here he is, Saad has arrived
He must have all the news.
Fire him from work
What is happening in the world? Where are the values?
Or he wouldn’t tell you to call the director of his office
And he said, "Khal Hedad instead of عثمان
And the one-dimensional
The daughter of the manager of the same company I submitted my maintenance offer to
And Ali عثمان exposed them
No way!
You are all surprised, Saleh
The company anyway, who is it?
Who has
That's how we became
What are you saying?
What did this poor employee, عثمان, do now?
His fault that he is an honest and loyal employee
Is the manager in his office now?
What did he do yesterday?
Let the world go to hell
We did strange shapes
I’m with you, عثمان doesn’t deserve it, but you can’t do anything about it
It is a sin, may God prolong your life, he has seven children and no ID.
Sاتر ساتر عمره ابهالوظيفه الحين وين ايطق ابراسه وين ايروح
You saw what happened
The new employee the minister hired
I went to عثمان's office and I insisted that I stay with him. عثمان poor guy wanted to take his things and I stopped him. I told him to go and I will send his things with the bed.
Where is he now?
The scales have tipped, عثمان
These are the last.
God’s will is God’s will
And praise be to God
God is generous, عثمان. God will not leave you, God willing. Take care.
May God forbid, is your voice not normal
I know you are very sensitive
I don’t feel like going to work, I’m done, I’m leaving.
And then I will go to see my mother and I will go to get the things.
I don't want you to be like this, troubled
What's wrong with you, shouting at me, I'm your mother
I am not screaming, I am praying.
Do you normally let your father-in-law, your brother-in-law, and your husband ride with you?
The world has changed, where are you living?
I wish my mother
Are you awake?
People have been liberated, the universe has become a small village, where are you living?
But what to say
Be modern and live in the time, do not be late to catch up.
Drop the make-up, quickly, God! Open your mouth, you're just staring at me, God, close it properly.
May God forbid, what’s wrong with you, Saleh?
You are not yourself today
And so I shouted at the maid, who had nothing to do with it.
You know, I had to do it, I swear.
No, I don’t feel like it
So I can forget the troubles I've seen
My love, there is no despair
Papa, cook today, he’s upset
Something that makes us happy, Your Highness.
Thank you, thank you, you didn’t do a bad job.
And hard work, diligence and perseverance
That’s right, سلام (salam)
The most important thing
The most important thing for me in this ministry
You are right, my lord
Tell me what is the benefit of an employee who does not take bribes
It is of no use.
That's why I want all of you
No Place for the Devout and the Ballet of Principles
I will discover one day
He is to blame only for himself
We didn’t take the blame on ourselves
That's why I want you to cooperate with me
And if you doubt
Call me as soon as possible
Thieves and sons of thieves and our sisters, of course, they don’t need any more.
Noura, if one day I don’t take a bribe, I’ll go to the government and she’s going home
Masha'Allah, Masha'Allah, well done on you, this is the way to do it, you all should be like her, I don’t want it, but she wants you all to be like her.
May God bless you
That's why I want you to leave the purchasing department and become my office manager.
Frankly, you knew how to choose. You chose the right thief for the right place.
Come on, Um Saoud, come on, don’t torture me any more.
I didn’t take you to jail.
But God alone knows best, he is the one who tempted me and made me see the trust as a good thing
And he said, become an honest man
You are a real father
Your hand with honesty and loyalty
You have always lived as a thief and been comfortable
I’m so glad I became an honest man
Let me talk to your dad.
Hold on, I’ll repeat it once again
One man walks, his master bribes, yaps and flatters, lives comfortably
My father is in jail because all his money is haram.
Stop stop
This is a dress you wear
We are a respectable family
It’s not your fault
Where is Tangier?
Why isn’t it exposed
You are shameless
Blush, my brother
In unity, one is ashamed these days
‏ What’s wrong with you, shouting?
Jوفي بنت اشلابسه
In a decent place, you wear this kind
And God willing, you will walk in the street without showing anything from your body.
I want her to listen to reason
And I'm not being short with her
She looks great in those transparent clothes that don’t need anything.
Be careful if you see me wearing it under my knee from now on
He who warned has been excused
May Allah protect you.
Inshallah just saliva and secret.
Look at his father
He looked at you.
Good real, honestly, where can we find like it
My eyes are not allowed to open, I am black and blue
And yes, the truth is, I really like my daughter Sarah and I care a lot about her future.
Don’t you mean you’ve heard about her?
Alhamdulillah masha'Allah, I heard it was terrible
I will enter the house at 3:30 in the evening.
And he says, "Oh, my God, come at 5 o'clock in the morning.
Ay yo, what's up?
Come, take me from the bar.
Your old car’s battery is dead, come and get me from the bar
I’ve never seen a father who doesn’t listen to his son
God, dad, get a job, move your car, god, wait for you
Mary I love you
Oh love, you to me are finished, I am finished, I am finished.
basically my father is here
‏ وينه
From quarter to half past my father’s clock is a mess, he doesn’t give a damn.
I introduce you to my boyfriend Majed
Abdulaziz doesn’t like that boy friend of his any more
Come on, come on, a chance of hashish
And the Arab and Israeli satellites
I discovered that many Palestinians haven’t cut their nails
According to the commitments of the State of Palestine in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement
In general, the United Nations today meets to decide on Israel's request to send special teams to inspect the fingers of the Palestinian people
If their nails are long or not
There was a condition that there should be nothing in Palestine that would make anyone angry, hurt or bleed
The State of Palestine
I call on the whole international community to visit Palestine
Comprehensive Peace Agreement
We make it from cork
Zaltonat ya zilmah
We press the olives like this, like this we press the olives
We, the Arabs, call on the international community
By inspecting the nails of Palestinians
And now we start voting
No, no, no, not to that extent, no.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
What's wrong with Saleh Saleh?
I dreamed of what
I dreamed of the world upside down
Rashed, you need to be a strong person
Now, brother, what is the number of the school I will attend tomorrow
I am a teacher like you
Why did I change my school when I started teaching?
What character, my brother?
But the problem is that his character is weak.
By the way, the teachers who stood up for him are the important ones.
That’s so crazy, bro
You see him silent
After that he explains
It should not be mayonnaise with
Bro, we’re not saying these things to make you mad.
We are telling you this because this is your last chance
He said that I accepted Rashid although his character is weak.
And too nervous and too good
Whatever it is, this is a local boy
Why are you silent now, my brother?
So that what you say is all true
You are all right
I hate it
Professor Rashid Al-Yaide
Professor Rashid
May God bless you.
Forget about it
And I hate
What kind of justice is this and then
That’s what I’m telling you
I am a teacher and I don’t like mistakes.
I wish a boy would tell you what the boy told him in the primary school and the inspector is sitting
Take your bag.
Ashawi Ashawi you broke the door
One learns from one's mistakes
From the first minute
That’s what I’m telling you
I am nervous.
How am I
Shut up, Zin
Jannah said, "Shut up, Zain."
I heard him
He said, “Professor Rashid threw me out.
Ava jannah said Allah, God, fine, but I don’t want to see your face here in the line
Professor, I don’t know who
‏ Born of
There is a teacher Rashid coming.
Here we come
Teacher, there is a problem if he says something to his father
Anzein, you guys are taking advantage of the opportunity, where can I see it, you are taking advantage of it
You can get it towards the chairs base
Over the Chairs
Chairs chairs
And in the end, man is a human being
But you shouted at me
A quarter and playfully tease Playfully tease me
My father is traveling and will return next week, and when he returns I will tell him
No, Abdul Rahman, who ever you are
We, we, a quarter, you know, raspberry ice cream is very good, you may not have tried it, it's really great.
God, get it to me quickly
Everything he is afraid of is that he will tell his father
You said his father is traveling
O, the traveling woman, her father has no father, that is, he took a stick, and they said to him, they sent him on a journey.
God be with us, God be.
And he took his bag and put it in his car and gave you his phone number in case you need anything, call me, I’m your friend.
Just...
But what
You told me that
Scream and be strong
The dove, the dove, the dove
Ya Rashid
Sleep, you sleep, sleep, it doesn’t matter, sleep.
Professor Bou Nasser, Professor Nasser in the bathroom
One juice and
Come, come, come, come, give me
Oh my God, so fast
Put them on the table
All people are equal
That's why I gathered you to hear your ideas for the party
Who can guarantee the children?
You’ve given us a lot of problems, Bal Jan. This is the one that’s connected.
Three o’clock
To the sugar, let’s have some fun, God willing
Hurry up, hurry up
‏ Peace be upon you
Inspector stands up
Yes, sir.
Come, come, here, sir
I upset him
I’m not joking, man. I’m asking you, are you done talking?
Either he finished it or he didn’t. Where is the teacher’s dignity? You are making a mockery of yourself. You are insulting the profession of teaching.
زين زين خلاص خلاص
Raise your voice a bit

Respect yourself, it’s better for you, and you’ll take additional classes, whether you like it or not, you’re going to do it anyway.
Come on, you, get up, get up, get out.
Inshallah we will go out
How are you, we said to you, boy
We must stop him in his tracks

I didn’t know that it was a rainy day until I heard his voice.
You know that he is called the Blue-eyed.
He is in charge of eight boys’ and girls’ schools
The magical Ash-Shar secret, he will tell you the secret that he fished out of the bottom
I told you from the first day
And I explain what I hear no sound
And we will not name
Respect yourself
After you have been on my nerves, go out and leave me alone, God, go out, go out, go out
As soon as the decision to appoint you as a minister is issued, I’ll look for a nice job for you.
Come on, don’t tell me come and take this job
Or the فلانيه one doesn’t give me choices of so many jobs and I choose the most suitable job from them
My brother, the minister
God knows I didn’t rest from the calls I received.
Masha’Allah, everyone is blessing
What will they say, my mother God calm down
This is a normal job, every minister comes and occupies a quarter and his gang automatically
From that point of view, don’t worry, you’re nice to meet you, have a nice day
Of course you know that I will become a minister
I need a bottle of shoe polish.
We have found a treasure, a treasure that is opened to us
The earth returns
Oh my God, everyone went to congratulate the new minister
Oh God, oh God, oh God
Congratulations to the minister’s efforts
Al Mubarak, may your life be long, congratulations
Congratulations, the minister deserves it
You deserve it, Minister’s assistant
My brothers, responsibility is heavy, may God, God willing, enable us to bear it.
And as they say, choice falls to those who deserve it.
You came out after I told you to call Boss Saleh
It was a little far from him
Don’t worry about it
What kind of love fell on him once
And Bou Sultan is not easy
Yes, I unlocked the car door
You’re the best, you didn’t fail me.
We are waiting for our brother to become a minister
I told you, mom, that I didn’t believe you
Are you telling me coffee talk, coffee talk
After her husband died, she said that I was the one who fought for him.
God is witness, God is witness
That is, you have nothing to say, you have nothing.
Oh my god, get up, let’s go, you’re pissing me off, get up
What do you mean, no one has a special status
Rest
I just shouted at them because they annoyed me.
They are right
But I didn’t like to say such a thing in front of my mom. Do you know my mom will expose us.
Whatever you hear, spread it, they call it the whispering; we don’t want the scandal
If they remove him, they will put you in his place
Because I asked
And if you win, you will be the first one to be nominated.
What the hell do you care about it, they are taking it anyway
No, this one is sure.
Ava Alija, do you see his shirt like I see in front of me now
You cast a spell on him
But the plan in my head is sure and effective
Plan of the burning and the waiting
He bans any activity to take place in the country
At that time, it will burn and until the burn comes, it will come the constipation and until the constipation comes, you will be well with the shileh
And God my brother I don’t know how, I don’t know what to tell you
Your trip is called participation that reflects how much you love the country
That means you’re stupid
You are a state man today, you have to be in the picture
I have to participate in everything, forgiveness, long life, forgiveness, forgiveness
Before I forget, thank you for the sheep you sent me yesterday
You're a long-lived one, this is just a simple sheep, not in your league, you're a long-lived one. What did you say, my lord, would you like to go with me today?
Real Interkبره
Do you know, honesty
I don’t want to go
I’m fed up with all this preening
You are the minister today, you changed your words and you are a social personality, رز عمرك
God bless you with this good rial
You receive, you receive, you receive
I don’t see myself
Give him, give him
Today I took him to a wedding and a party if he doesn’t clap he will clap with a pickle picture
I’ve got something nice for you, I want you to take it to her.
Listen, I’ve arranged a very nice educational activity for you.
Like that, let him shine, I want him to shine, shine, shine until he is polished, I will be the shine.
The shopkeeper, thank you, congratulations, congratulations, may your cycle be blessed, if he sees the picture, the picture of the minister, give him the picture, give him the picture, I don’t, I don’t want to, give him the picture.
This cycle
Congratulations on the opening, God willing, may the minister’s wishes come true
Image image, you are so fat, fat.
Nothing, may God bless you
On the second page
No he knows
National participation
Remember Allah
This is the fourth friend who called me today
Everyone praises your activities, O Khaled, you are called the active social activist
Yesterday I heard a word that hurt me
Yesterday the party that بوسلطان took me to
The victory party of the young swimmers
One is saying to the other’s owner
They think I don’t hear them
This minister says
My father wants to buy a birthday gift for his nephew.
Hello hello
I will be inside the newspaper every day, Papa
Right, right
This is what you are doing here, making a lot of light, Papa, what is he doing, I am doing what, damn Papa
What he pays, I pay, no problem.
What kind of minister would not be troubled by that
I am I Bouzali the minister
Bاسلطان is coming to take me somewhere I’m waiting for him
And he sits me in the front row and goes to his car to rest
I don’t want anything from him, God guide you
Oh my God, my dear, may the father of my father have mercy on you, listen to me, I’ll call you in a bit to make sure.
And you have become the one I call
People are giving us discounts
I told you that.
The job is very nice
This will take me back
The minister’s men are looking for him, God, God, help him.
Hello hello minister
No, I’m a little tired today and
Okay, if you have that much enthusiasm, Tamr
You’re a man, but my brother Saad will take you and look for you, God willing, he’ll find you a party, something
A great party
No activities today.
No, there isn’t.
Where did he get a son?
Thank you, thank you.
I say, is there anyone we can ask?
May God bless you
I’m telling you, get some rest.
The moment of سعد
Inshallah, anything
What beauty!
And then at a lost time
And that's just a cool shot in the cabin and just look at the photographer and let him take a few shots of his face and a few shots
God, how beautiful, God, take care
You shaved for him
I wish I could play in the reserve league, God willing, I’ll go to the field
This is the minister, he has imposed himself on us
Sweet means reaching the top
It's almost the end, it's been a long talk about people
Your eminence is now more famous than you
You’ve been with me for a long time, if you go somewhere and take Boosalah with you
Oh, long life
A shining star
Turn it off and then turn it back to its normal size
The minister has arrived, the minister has arrived, the minister has arrived
I can’t imagine, I swear, if one of you takes my picture, I won’t break you, I’m not coming down.
Brooke broke my camera that I use for taking pictures
Salama aleij waid
Like they say, the train has left the station
This is Khalood my sister
There is no power and no might except with Allah
Why like that
This is the first time I’ve seen it
It's the first time you've seen it.
The first time I saw it, years ago.
‏ Ooh
This is Khaldia
It’s been a while since I saw you, come my love, come to me
‏ What shall we do? I’m used to it
Oh, never mind, it’s Allah who has the power. You brought up the same issue again.
Get out, I say. Get out, or don't you stop blowing my mind. I'm going back home from the wedding at three in the morning.
But just let me rest, this is not a big deal.
Your brother built it
By God, I will tell my father what you did to yourself, you are like my son.
means he was playing
He was playing, I tell you, with my make-up.
But this is Saud, I know what to do with him
Khalood came back, wish all kids were like him
On these advertisements and nonsense that he publishes about his brother
Oh my god, my loves, come and greet
Hi my darlings, how are you
My eyes aren’t going to Spain this summer.
Who are you?
Fuhoud from Kuwait
Hey Hamade
Listen to me, I’ll tell you.
There is no power and no might except with Allah, the Most Great.
I’ll leave it up to my beloved to choose
But seriously
I say that what is on the sea is the best
In the near future we will buy an icon line so we can go from home to the sea directly
We and our children
Oh God, set a date for the wedding
It’s almost a year and a few months
What is this, your brother put a lot of perfume on
I hope for honesty, I notice your brother Khalid, I don’t know how
But it’s totally different from your brother Saad
He’s back, and he’s not just anyone, my God, what a change in his behavior
Then your backward-thinking fiancé doesn’t know that there are gender-neutral perfumes
I say, let your imam keep his rights
I don't care
Khaled didn’t believe it
You only use perfumes like women
You use even their colors
Why are you doing that, Khaled?
Oh, for real, you’re such a mess
Oh my God, why don’t you want to date him? Don’t you see his moves and behaviors?
These days perfumes are for both
Did you hear me, I warned you
Have you seen Bluetooth?
Listen to the quarter Isolfon in the mill, they say it is widespread in Doha
I heard about him, Rauna.
You’ll see, I’ll tell you later.
Oh, how do you dance
The land of movements
These are girls, look, this is the one you say is dancing properly and doing moves, do you know who this is? This is Kholood, Mohammed’s cousin.
My uncle's sister's dog
But wait, I’ll show you
Wait for my brother Saad to come.
Why let him come and I’ll show you, let him come, Saad sent him a Bluetooth so that his family can see it
سلام عليكم
Peace be upon you, hello hello
Surely defeated
Where is my uncle? He is sitting far away.
I don’t have anything to say, but your Bluetooth is open.
No, just send me something
Thank you, الشيخه (Sheikha).
Shut up, you bastard!
You are a fool, Saad
I’m leaving for a trip tomorrow.
I won’t see my face in the country
Where is your brain where is your brain
What do people say
They say their son is lazy and travels. Do you want to make a scandal for us?
Oh, my God
What Kholood, your daughter, has done is a source of pride and honor.
A 1000-year-old mold is not a disaster
Mali, what did they say, this is my brother
Say he travels, he gets treated, he studies, he works, he commits suicide, anything.
The important thing is that I live in a place where shame is chasing me every day
Where are you going?
With a spirit of 60 million
This is the end
That's where we don't know where to put it and that guy is putting his bag to travel.
Even we don’t know where he wants to go
Ashkenti, do you expect it to happen
What's wrong with you now? I'm coming to your house so that you can feel better, I'm going to listen to what hurts my heart.
I was saying, pay attention to it.
Don’t leave it to the servants.
You didn’t know about it and you were distracted
My father is busy with his work and leaves the responsibility on you
You are right
No hope for you because of your sister
In this you are right
Nothing else but Kholood left us all, we have nothing to do with people
I can’t see anyone.
You told him something
That's my father's biggest mistake
We are in the shitty queer world of Kholoud
I didn’t tell him.
On CD and give it to him
And I’m going to the airport
I’m very afraid for him
Our house should reach that level, Amal
Don’t be surprised
Khulood and her relatives did not accuse them of slander.
Their brothers and sisters heard
Whatever they call them, religious values
And they go to dance and fight.
In the toilet
I and God, my father, confuse me
Bye, dad
Take care of yourself, mom.
I have a small gift for you, dad.
A gift for me
Now he has put the CD in the laptop, I am afraid of what is going to happen, walk with me
Oh my God
It's ridiculous, dad, my CD, it's only three minutes long
Can it be
Where will it go and where can it go
Reply to what's wrong with you, Abu Sa'ad
‏ ybe
Sorry, Amal
And if I looked, I was very tired.
So I can find someone with your morals
But forgive me
‏ May God guide you
I say, did you go out on the roof?
My love
We live in the age of freedoms
The Age of Human Rights and Nothing Else Matters
Whoever has a real, take the fee, my dear eyes
Of course, God will make America my love
Hain Arf in Maj Jada
Malum wahed f watnin meh
God will punish you, and you are the one who stopped with Adriel. I asked him how much is your salary.
‏ Mom, I have a lot of homework
I don't know why he keeps complaining about his salary, it's of no use. We agreed with him on 700, take the license and add 100 to it. What about you?
He said to me that when the year is over, I will get an increase in my pension.
He is greedy and will mess us up.
Just, just, just, do us a favor, just shut up, go away and leave us alone
It's easy for you to say that word easy
You mean you’ll leave him alone, I hate to ride with him in the car
Let it be on him
You just told me the story, I am the head of the house, I will keep quiet, you too, just shut up, I will take care of it.
Get out, I want to go out.
Come stop
What do you say about me?
He says, "Where is your money? He says, "He says or he doesn’t say.
Papa, this is not a partner, this is a man, I am the brother of the brother of the father of my money.
Inshallah, five minutes and it will blow
5 minutes
She is in the brain of you, what a beauty
You don’t have the right to Mr. Kahle, he says to him, increase the pension, increase the pension.
Everything in the world of the weak is expensive
After eight months of being together
Papa, I have a problem in the country
This is a driver inside a dough in Hassel and a thousand thousand two hundred
In a possible bad in a three hundred over the father's door
I will think about it.
Look, I’ll give you and Ahad 100 more, just shut up, no more after that.
You don’t do what you say and you’re over the limit on your job.
A promise of a promise
I say, you say
It's no use
Two hundred is no use
Shashi I am in fear
Not Kوف
I want to say something
Asan saql bar'a tlathe al-f arba'a al-f
There is no point in spending money inside the house
I am afraid.
This is all so boring
How many in
2,500
In fear of my police in this Egypt I wish I was in jail
There is no such thing as a free lunch
I am the son of my father
I say, you’re wearing a bra, I’ll go out.
I will vote for him, no one answers me.
His room is empty except for repression.
Amina, her servant, is lost for a year
I only say, God is my witness against him
I'm coming to you.
I went to the police and informed them.
You have reached the end of your rope, you have no responsibilities anymore.
Insha'Allah we won't fail
And you can see him in the neighborhood, maybe you can find him, tell us
Whoever is rich and has had enough, should surrender himself
I lost them, I bought them, I fed them, I trained their cars
As he pleases
Match starts now دش دش inside best
We were afraid to tell you
These are the Foxes’ team and the foxes will never reach it
Do you know if more than three have registered, meaning we didn’t win, we need 10-15.
Clear mockery Clear mockery Let’s be honest, clear mockery
This level if it gets more than three MB on MB team of foxes this
I’ll tell you, take it.
In the soul and in the player and in the performance
They have nothing to be thankful for, they will be thankful when they go out with less than three.
Any words of our team's appetizers are still hungry, this is the team of foxes and get away from us, dad.
You scored a goal, relax, now you can rest
I expect no more words, or else I’ve stopped on you.
This is a good one, this is in your mind, you saw it from me, there is no good in you, you are in the role of capital, you are this thief who eats chicken.
No, I don’t have a car.
You are my money partner
You heard what he was going to say
He says this is a very problematic fox
You are in GoodMafi
Yes, sir
What do you know?
This is the foxhole of the rabbits
He spends hours in a talk show.
Heiglبوكو today will be defeated
God, you are a team that does not know defeat, you are the winner of everything
What will Thaeloub say about today’s result?
What is this in the result
The result of this class in foxes
This theory comes to take the money he earns.
We thought we would be realistic, you know. God, don’t tell me the foxes won and flew away.
This is Papa's foxes
This is a fox taking a chicken to eat.
Oh, Your Majesty, you didn’t see what he was doing in the stands
The audience is laughing to death
Zahir daakhil mlaab wassalamah mal ant
He’s the real fan, the one who has real loyalty to the club
This is with the big Qataris who go to the malls and all that
My friend invited me for a cappuccino
Look at the world, my brother
This guy came out with 50 riyals in front of my eyes and paid the bill
Listen to the poem I wrote about our match with the frogs
Salameh is present, Arab from the tribe
You are in a frog.
You are so cheap, I don’t even want to waste my time on you, you are a mess

Every month we meet to choose the ideal fan
Masha’Allah, and who did you choose this month, God willing, for recognition
The members of the board of the association are the ones who decide
May you all be as big as a camel
I manage this big club, Thaeloub
Get up, get up, the old driver who left us is on TV
Now this is it
This is a fair argument, that other guy is a dick.
Pen, you are a bad snow will say you
But now I know how to get to him
Oh God, let the audience see
Roll it around
He rolled me
It is an accelerator
We’ve wasted it now, Zin
Sweet
You shut up, it hasn’t been decided, I am the real head of the house, I decide.

May Allah protect you. You don’t have anything to talk about. What would you like me to do? May Allah reward you for your kindness.
Tell me, are you sure like that? I wanted to fail us with the cabaret
God be with us
Oh mother, oh mother, mother
Now what is your father going to do with us, we don’t know
I didn’t mean it, mom
Please, mom, don’t say anything about my father.
Your father is turning the house over our heads
He will definitely kill you now.
Oh my God, I don’t really care about the workers
Why don’t we go and get glue and stick it?
He stuck it in his pocket
Where can we find like it, what do I know, where did your uncle bring it, he brought it as a gift
God, I’m afraid for you from him
Oh my god, I’m afraid my father will hit me
The door slammed shut so I can look for a solution to this issue
Oh my God, go to your room fast
My uncle, my uncle, my uncle, you are blind
My uncle broke the vase, my uncle
Oh my God, Walid, what’s wrong with you?
No, mom, nothing is happening to you
He ran away from home, scared of his father
That's so wrong, mom, be afraid of God with the boy
Oh my God, this is not parenting, God guide you
What should I do now, dad?
I don't know how to handle it
My mother just told me I’m afraid for him from the cars in the street
God bless him, God willing. I say, maybe he went to the shop or to the neighbors’ house to play with the kids.
I love him so much, Walid is so handsome and nice, I miss him so much, my mother.
Oh my God, seek refuge with God from the devil. God will do only good, God willing.
God, I wish I could say goodbye
Wneh Waledo
My father beats me
My aunt, my father is going to kill me
Don’t be afraid, my eyes
Don’t be afraid my love
I didn’t let him touch you.
I broke it on purpose.
Come here, mom, come, have a little bit of amouie and relax in my room.
And he turned yellow
God fix him but God fix him, come here, mom, come here
O God, You are the Most Generous
I’m afraid my father will come here.
No, mom, don’t make me.
My son doesn’t need anyone to interfere in his education
This is my son and I am raising him in the way I see fit.
But the boy is scared of something he did, go on, tell your father.
Why doesn’t he have eyes
Just open it
The bag hit the vase by mistake, believe me, he didn’t mean it.
You, you have to defend him
You don’t tell him anything for my sake, forgive him this time, the boy is afraid.
But where is he, where is he now? He's sitting with you until this time
It is a mess here
Where are you?
Pour a cup of tea inside the cup

Hey mom
Come on, Mom, don’t ruin it for us
‏روح يا به عاد خلاص لا اتمصخها روح روح يا به بنقوم بنذاكر بنقوم
What is this, such talk? Look
If you do, I’ll call your uncle Bou Walid now.
No, no, don’t say anything about my uncle, no.
I don’t owe you anything
Tell him, I said, listen to the words.
Oh God, let everyone go and take their book and study.
Okay, dad, put your phone in your pocket, we’ll study, okay, don’t tell my uncle.
And God knows, I’m confused, I don’t know how to act.
I’m afraid if he knows, he will make a problem for us.
Sure, she asked me why I liked to go to the hospital
What else can I do for you?
If he knew that his son, Aybol, was in his bed, he would kill him.
Oh my God, it’s all his fault
Oh my god, this is psychological

I sleep on my bed every night and you don’t tell me the story
He said he needs to take him to the hospital so they can treat him.
Her problem is that she doesn’t have any story
Nothing is missing.
He is right.
He needs to go to the hospital, Mom. Call the ambulance. What’s wrong with him?
Waidour has a dry, just right, tight hose.

Eat, mother, eat
I won’t say anything.
I want to take a quick shower and I’ll go get your clothes, God willing.
Please, ask your request.
I have to discipline them
Don’t interfere.
This is what you call success
and Kholood is forty-nine of fifty
This is a success
But their signs are beautiful
Tell them, Willkomm, that if they don’t bring fifty out of fifty.
Please don’t send them to my brother
They need to be disciplined
These are my children
God damn it, my eyes, for the last time
Why don’t you bring fifty of fifty fifty of fifty
Add one more
I’ll say, don’t go with us to public places
Yesterday we went to the hospital, he entered and they said to him, don’t enter, what do you have to do with it?
You’re going nowhere unless you go with us
But I should call on my brothers
My uncle is dying, oh my god, my uncle is dying, one last time, my uncle is dying
Let me behave, God.
Be careful, this is not the kind of thing you see at the end of the year if one of you doesn’t get 50.

Call, call, talk to his friend in the class
He says he saw it at the school gate.
Call, call the app, maybe he’s going to his grandma’s house
No, it didn’t go to them
Where did this child go? Where did he go?
There is no power and no might except with Allah
Damn kids, what's the matter with you
Hey, you must be a failure and scared of your family.
Oh, what a loser, may God give you only the child, he is outstanding and ranks second in the class
But he is afraid to go to their house
Because he is just two grades short in math.

And nuclear energy
This represents 60% of global oil reserves
Saudi Arabia leads the world’s reserves with 24 percent
Then Libya, the United States and Nigeria
Three percent of them and the rest of the world is 10 percent
And therefore
And also from production
And perhaps this is one of the secrets and reasons for the rush on this region and its countries by the major industrial countries
At the head of which is the United States, the world’s largest consumer of oil
However, oil prices are on the rise
And in tandem with a decline in the role of the US dollar
Who Should Set Oil Prices?
Where the price of the barrel yesterday arrived
This has led to an increase in the income of producing countries at the same time
To increase inflation in it
Inflation in some of these countries has reached 15%.
The most important source of energy in the world
On the Prices of Life and Goods
And that in a direct dialogue with the Deputy Prime Minister
Minister of Energy and Industry of Qatar
Abdallah bin Hamad al-Attiya
And for our viewers who want to participate, they can call us on the program's numbers and phones.
Welcome to Deputy Marwa’s time
I would like to start with the unprecedented prices that oil has reached
Where Can Prices Go?
Of course, where can the prices go, this is a puzzling question
Or what is called market force
Not OPEC
And the Producers Are Not
And it’s not the producing countries and OPEC has nothing to do with oil pricing.
Is it only the relationship between price, supply and demand?
And not even the offer and the demand has a great deal to do with it
‏ What are the factors if
Other factors in addition to supply and demand
What for the investors
They felt very big pressures and turned to oil and gold or what is called commodity marketing.
Investors lost confidence in stock markets
And gold as well
We have seen gold rise from $350 in recent years to $970 now.
Or, to this day, as I mentioned, about 109 countries.
‏But all of them are in addition and if they decrease slightly
Let me remind you that in the first quarter of this year
What is the second quarter, it is supposed that its prices should decrease because of the low demand on oil
But we have seen the market in an exciting and strangely changing situation
In the second quarter and at the beginning of spring, it rises above $100
But that means that the previous factors that determined the price increase in relation to winter and consumption have now changed and there are other factors
And Economic Growth
At the same time we see that the price of oil is rising so much
I talked about the political factors and said that political tensions play a role in this matter
To Iran, do you expect Valon's resignation under the political complexities?
Her friend and today she topped most of the American newspapers and world press can affect the price of oil
100% 100% today
Today we are in the era of globalization and the effect comes quickly
Unreal factors can affect
And they create a kind of disturbance in the market
Also created a kind of political rumor
He said there was no plan but he did not deny that other options could also be considered for Iran.
The Qumra always interact with the markets
Of course, now it is not certain that America is at war with Iran
And I am one of those people who doesn’t see this scenario
It may be Falun and there may be other things we have not seen what it will be like in the future
But we are the ones who work in the sector of the tyrant
We see all these political tensions
In the World Oil Supplies
And vice versa, there are very comfortable supplies
What does it mean that there is oil going to storage?
There is no shortage in oil supplies at all
Perhaps preparing for the next war
In the light of this reassuring image you speak of supply and that there are no obstacles to supply
In case the American president Bush and the United States decide to implement their plan
This is something else
Prices rise to record figures
Oil prices may reach
The World’s Oil Reserves
You are here today, the Gulf represents the most
in addition to Iraq, Iran and other Gulf countries
They represent today more than sixty percent of the oil reserves so that which is T he is certainly
You today
If a very minor accident happens
Therefore, it indicates
That means that in case of any war on Iran, the price of oil cannot be guaranteed to what extent it can reach.
God knows, and today you may receive, we received without
Wars for 177 and 177 dollars and it may jump to 177.10 God knows
Today oil is living under psychological and political tensions
Yem and speculators took advantage of these tensions
Just an oil investor
Or what is called not an investor of course real investment no, it’s future purchase or future market
It is also called oil paper
And all of them are speculations in oil paper
All of its production is about 3,000 barrels or less.
Maybe they will push for more purchases and then for more rise
I wish April fools’ day was April fools’ month
I hope there won’t be
Jenny is coming to the region and it is said that this is on his main agenda
Geli is the owner of this project as many politicians and media people said
I didn’t know what was in Jيلي’s bag.
And I can’t even predict what it will mean
Will He Spark a War
America in Transition
And why doesn’t the son do anything else?
Let's see what happens if we talk about April. April is very close, just a few weeks and we will enter April.
The World May Pay
And America is a major consumer country.
In the Gulf States
The Gulf Will Be the Hard Number
You can’t throw this number
His production costs are cheap.
Comparing with West African countries, most of which
The Gulf, no other country in the world
We have heard this talk from the West and the United States for many years
Very useful
And the Caspian Sea War, remember the story and
Whatever these are, they are just dreams
When you sit with the relatives in a closed circle
You hear them speak in a different way
What do they say
On supplies and the importance of the region and the importance of reserves
When I asked one of the European officials, I said you are strange that you talk to us in closed rooms
In a way that is different from what you are talking about in front
Or the media said no, this is for political reasons
And of course there is the so-called standard rectum or anal meaning two fingers
The coffee that everyone knows is the role of the Gulf countries
It is important today, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, for example
The largest oil producer and exporter in the world
and entering into
Despite all this
Leader of the Middle Strip
Waging War on Iran
Even by air war or air strike as they say
In the supplies
‏ That’s not late, that’s very kind of you
I don’t agree with you, we are not in
We do not deal with Westerners
We deal with America
Where are the good prices?
Regardless of the nationality of this market
Non-renewable energy means
‏ For between brackets for generosity
Arab Generosity
Please give me
Observers say the real price of oil
Why Oil Prices Are Soaring
You, the Gulf, OPEC and the countries
You are very generous with the Americans, you insist on sticking to their currency
You said the price of oil should be $70
The real price against the dollar is 60 to 70.
Okay now the price is 100
59: because the dollar has fallen by 53%.
And now over $100
If we take the proportion and the ratio
No one can deny that
One of the main reasons for
Comparing to the decline of the dollar
If we take, if we take the
If we take this comparison
Oil prices
Because the United States
Of course it is in the interest of the current situation that the dollar decreases
Weakness or recession in the American economy, the United States can not make a list
So what happened in this weakness and economic stagnation
You are also becoming
US keeps interest rates on the dollar
Why Do You Insist on Linking Oil Price to the Dollar
Let’s talk about why the price of oil is linked to the dollar
The first one over a hundred years
The first oil barrel was exported from the United States.
And it was issued in dollars
It has been since the beginning of the 20th century to the present day
Dollar pricing Oil priced in dollars
Historically became
And for a hundred years the whole world has been interacting and pricing
And which considers Norway today the third largest oil producer
And its source of oil
Russia is the second largest oil exporter
And the production of the North Sea field in Europe
It is priced in dollars and not in
Everything is changing in the world, there are other sources and information that indicate something else other than this
You are the Gulf countries
There are secret agreements between you and the Americans
And oil became the real cover
S S it is true that there is no
And these agreements
It is based on keeping oil as the cover for the dollar in exchange for the United States protecting these systems
This is not true and there are no secret agreements
Today let’s not take the OPEC organization
You have 66% of the votes, the deputy said.
I am from 24 countries
58 per barrel 40% of OPEC share
There are many big countries that produce oil
Outside the OPEC
What are the other obstacles to pricing in another currency?
See, I’ll do it for another price.
Not all adults when they decide
You are Saudi Arabia and the countries of the Gulf
Today OPEC as a whole
There are sixty percent
Even if OPEC hypothetically wanted that
There is an agreement between all the oil-exporting countries to
There is a tendency or intention to change.
And this is the attempt
But now these countries are not able to change the pricing currency.
Unless there is an agreement between
What is the effect of frequency?
Let me speak now, except about Europeans
Why don’t they release their oil?
From the North Sea or Russia and Norway in Euro or Ruble
Because it is in their interest to have a high, strong and elevated currency
By the opposite No, by the opposite
Here is where they will lose
One euro twenty-five per barrel
It’s not you, it’s the currency, which has dropped because it’s pegged to the dollar.
And it is also a very big loss
The connection of currencies here to the Gulf is historical
Do you remember in the 1970s the dollar was the strongest currency in the world
And now you are associated when you talk about disengagement
This is like marriage when you get married
And you come with divorce, divorce is not easy
No here
Or are you just making a casual deal with the dollar?
And the costs should be studied in a way
To study in a professional way and study in
And Kuwait also freed 25% of its currency from the dollar
Saudi Arabia Bahrain UAE Qatar
It may change its currency price
I’m not going to discuss the topic but that means you have no intention to study the topic or think about it
The study, of course, differs. The Prime Minister stated
Wal said that the Qatari riyal is 2% undervalued.
Enter within this study
مش فا ليس هناك توجه انكم وحدكم تنفردوا بهزا الموضوع
Kuwait alone, why don’t you take a step
Economists say it is more profitable for countries and their people to break than to lose
But we
And nothing else.
If these four Gulf states announced
All means believer
And I mean I’m one of his supporters personally
You will support her
You should be part of this study
‏ by itself
What was created from one state or two states or
Until the time of work
You won’t jump on the bandwagon
This of course will be studied by specialists
And they will be the owners
This is not a matter of specialists, but of political decision
Let’s wait and not rush now, see what happens today
People started
Of course, in a complicit situation
The MP's efforts mean that the inflation rate in Qatar for 2007 reached 4.5 percent and will increase to 5.5 percent in the coming year.
Here the salaries of people are eaten and consumed by the salaries of the people who work here
Salaries of people living in Qatar have been reduced by 35 to 40 percent
We will be back after a short break to know the size of the increases that will be made in salaries
Employees in Qatar at least in the upcoming period, stay with us
Welcome back to No Borders Without Limits. In this episode we are joined by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy
Qatari industry Abdullah bin Hamad Al Attiya on the huge price increases
In oil, which has brought tens of billions of dollars to the Gulf and producing countries
For the oil and my question was about the expected increase in staff salaries but before this increase I would like to give you some important information
The Emirates has a reserve of 99.8 billion and attacks 2.6 billion of 10 billion
Only 1 ton and the Kuwait Times reports an economic report on the revenues of the Gulf countries
Saudi Arabia's 2008 expected revenues are one hundred and ninety billion.
And she was
Two hundred and seventy last year, the UAE six hundred and sixty this year, it is expected to be fifty-seven.
Kuwait 46 and 45
One twenty-first of oil is not fifty-five billion
From gas as other reports say, not to envy God, I don’t envy you, you happy deputy
Iraq 47 billion
One and a half trillion
The areas of spending were one and a half trillion dollars.
The Gulf countries imported one billion, meaning one trillion
‏ multiple dollars imports
Investment in the United States is 20 billion
And nine out of ten billion
There were three in every hundred in Bahrain
There were 6.5 in Amman, which will increase to 7. There were 10.5 in Qatar, which will increase to 540 in Qatar.
This means that those who live in Qatar will witness more expensive goods, prices and life
Life is swallowed up and prices have risen by high percentages and to more in Qatar
We feel for everyone
So the processors must be
Monetary policy aims to control inflation.
That means you will increase salaries by 50%
They don’t say you are against the wage increase.
This is not true and in
All Ministers against the Salary Increase
There is a problem and the solution should be the optimal solution.
No Patchwork Solution
‏ Okay, is there a balance between the two?
And this is it
The important thing is to deal with inflation.
And here in Qatar in the committee
His Highness the Amiral issued the formation
And Taze
Hold and put means rules
Strong solutions to solve the problem and control inflation
The important thing is to control inflation first
Inflation
Oh, if you don’t control it
Be a deputy now
The specialist in market analysis and published at the end of February last year, a few days ago
Among these about entering
Now you will get stuck with inflation and let inflation eat the income of these people
Many of them now
Income to other countries
Increase our salaries and then we will deal with inflation and lower it again
I am the one who said the words that they are saying about the subject.
But now
And it is not a temporary treatment
And the problem is getting bigger
Therefore here
From Inflation to Deflation
The loneliness will always
Because the increase was huge in the past year, in the previous year, right?
The dot the dot
And the zain also work with the government, not only with the private sector
The Private Sector Is All But Ignored
Now this issue of the increase should also be viewed fairly
I don’t know where you got the you, these notes or got
We are living in Qatar, the deputy is not living in Germany
I’m telling you the opposite, today the private sector started to pay
Most
Many Qataris who used to work in the public sector have moved to the private sector.
Because of the big salaries
He is facing a problem
It moves to the private sector because the private sector is vital and dynamic
and gives good salaries
We are linking the so-called market forces
Or by Market Power
They don’t come with very high specializations
Don’t come to Qatar because Qatar is the least, meaning salaries or less, تك تكاليف
They come at a cost
OK, with our full understanding
I don’t anticipate events and I don’t say that there is an increase in salaries
There is no hope anyway
To control this inflation
Let’s give it some time
Controlling inflation
And God willing, this is what he says that the report says that Qatar in 2008
God willing, that is to say, we say that
We see that these figures will decrease.
A little bribe to people
It is a process, to be a professional process.
Of course, with professionalism and everything but
From Inflation
Since spending
The big on different projects
Let me ask some questions from the viewers and I hope that everyone asks them directly. Abdelaziz Mohammed from Morocco, your question, Mr. Abdelaziz.
This is based on the fact that the ruling families in the Gulf
I do not agree that the justification for that is the lack of agreement by OPEC
Second, all oil revenues go directly to the ruler.
Then for the ruling family and the rest is spent on development
In the absence of an accounting, it will be as it is.
Peace and God’s mercy
May God bless you, my brother Ahmed
My brother, I will not prolong the conversation, my brother mentioned with regard to the ruling systems and the issue of linking the dollar to the riyal or the riyal or the Gulf currencies to the dollar but
America wants to globalize the world under its umbrella
The US trade deficit with China has reached $288 billion
And with him the European Union reached sixty-eight billion dollars
This means that all global policy directions are against the dollar
We are paying the price of this now as Arab and oil-producing Gulf countries
The End of the American Confrontation
And between the first developed countries like China, Russia and others, and it may become
Purely military
Explosions of Chinese, Russian, Japanese and even American bombs
Thank you very much for this explanation and this information
Your question, Mohammed
Hello, your question
Can you lower the TV volume and ask your question?
Ask your question in medicine
But what I see is that the MP is determined not to cooperate
The topic of decoupling from the dollar as the dollar is falling
And, God willing, he will fall to the lowest depths.
And he is a good man
It is better not to follow the style of the Arab brothers
Thank you, Mr. Mohamed, thank you. Another question from Ahmed Hassan from Qatar. Your question, Ahmed.
May God bless you.
Thank you very much for the nice interview
Salary increase, God willing, things will get better. What do you mean? What is the purpose?
We are right to face problems in our universities, not from salaries
Salaries, God willing, the matters
‏ Please answer my question fast
It seems like you're writing in Arabic, but the text is not clear. Could you please rephrase your question or statement?
All of it is the price of the price of everything, all of it is trading all imported goods
Out of European countries
Well, we have all the Arab countries with factories and laboratories
Thank you Ahmed, thank you for your time.
Now the issue of high prices is an important issue
The case of the rich with the poor, the poor are the poor, stick with the poor, the deputy is the deputy
‏ The one who talks about the one who doesn’t have a billion is a poor guy
Here it means we are for some of the brothers, of course
Those who do not know Qatar
This is not true for the state of Qatar
Today when he comes to Qatar he will see what the indicators are
What are the growth indicators in Qatar?
The World’s Top Growth Indicators
This rope, where are you taking it? What are you going to do with it?
What is the framework in which to respond to it?
That's when he spoke, meaning the brother from Morocco spoke in a way that is not true and not real.
The person who does not see with his own eyes
If the person who means he comes and sees what huge developments take place in Qatar
In growth you are yes ask
And everyone has the right
And you, the residents, will you accommodate people from where?
Will you really import, for example, surplus goods from China, for example?
We will not import, God willing, and
The state is built on a plan and
With optimal independence for these money that comes from oil and gas, and everyone knows that oil and gas will one day end.
To be a state of Qatar
It is considered one of the biggest historical achievements in the Arab homeland
Today too is the day for
The focus on
And what will have an impact
The Big After Oil and Gas
So if you don’t like Dubai, don’t come
Every country, every country, every country has its own, every country has its own particularities
We focused on education in Qatar
On the LLMs
This is a medical city as far as people are concerned, you can trust to get stuck here
It will be a city of media that will host
Of course, today is the world’s day. Today we must build.
We are building a vision
The Post-Oil and Gas Era
There were fatal mistakes
And unfortunately we did not benefit from this boom because we were surprised
And we were not ready for it, neither humanly nor technically nor educationally
Today I changed after thirty years
Also, most importantly
Today is here, so here is here imagine
And vision
And vision
Thank you very much, dear viewers.
On good following up, we hope that we have presented to you
Many observers see Qatar’s foreign policy as foggy
Qatar enjoys special relations
And while Qatar was establishing relations with Israel, it still is
Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas
And Qatar presented
And she started
The largest Arab country
What angers the regime in Egypt
Anger from Qatar has reached a point of accusing it of conspiring against Egypt
Qatar was not far from important files
Like Darfur in Sudan and Houthis in Yemen, even the Israeli soldier captive
Qalaatashulit was extended to by Qatari foreign politics in a way that angered the larger Arab countries
And what power do you put in this place
From these achievements
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al-Thani
Or they write to us via our website w w w dot aljazeera dot net z
His Excellency Sheikh, welcome.
On September 22, 2007 to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
It was a landmark visit in the relations between the two countries at least in the last few years
Redrawing the Map
Washing what got stuck
This is what it says.
Al-Haquaz newspaper or magazine
which you held with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and through which you renewed the relations and the Saudi ambassador returned
To Doha
In the beginning your introduction was long and it needed many answers without your last question
I think he carried the campaign
Especially in the subject of Saudi Arabia
What is flour?
Saudi Arabia is an important country for Qatar.
It is present between the two countries
I talked about silencing Al Jazeera
I spoke about a revolutionary movement
I think these things have been clarified by both parties
And we accepted the clarification
In Qatar
The dispute with Saudi Arabia
He was always confined to a range
Points of view
And to Allah we are grateful, and this is by the command of the two leaders
King Abdullah and His Highness the Prince
‏ A big change in the Gulf
More than a hundred years
They were always bright,شرف, and trustful relationships
I want to put it down to a misunderstanding between the two parties.
This subject was done and there were no conditions
In solving any problem
But there was an understanding and there was a sincere intention from both sides
To solve this stuck subject
It is not a seasonal job, but a strategic relationship
We wish for her not to last but to develop
Beautiful diplomatic speech
Until Saudi Arabia withdraws its ambassador from Qatar
I am not used to being diplomatic, otherwise I would have avoided many problems
I always said what I believed in
Saudi Arabia, and therefore it is not diplomacy, but faith.
The subject of Al Jazeera falls under the subject of media.
Between the two sides and in many countries, it was introduced into the line
She believes that it can be ignited or that it can take points at the expense of other countries
Or on the account of Qatar
Or on the account of Saudi Arabia
I saw the conflict within the Al-Khaligi house
It means, in contrast to what was before
A Political Agreement on Knees
No, no, there was no agreement except for an agreement of love and an agreement of interest
But anything that contradicts that, this subject is asked about by Al Jazeera Management, did you build the Al-Aala strategy?
There is nothing between you and Saudi Arabia until what happened before is avoided
The relationship was originally based on a close strategy
Can we go to one, two, three, four?
There must be solidarity
And I settled some differences on this basis
Between some Arab countries, we should settle the other differences
Now if we notice the differences in the Arab world, they are differences of opinion
When we have an opinion on a certain policy in a certain case and another country has a different opinion
This is a two-way view.
That is, some observers thought that you enjoyed criticizing Saudi Arabia
Criticized for
Are you tired and decided to change direction and then headed to a bigger country, Egypt?
It means the same, the same idea
No, we don’t enjoy it and we are not free.
If we deal with any other party in this way
This means that the reasons for the dispute with Saudi Arabia are over
Between them and I know that there is an understanding
It is very big and you know we founded it
And there is a kind of prototype
But Saudi Arabia but but Saudi Arabia
Let me put this under two lines
You started to pester Egypt's Al-Ahram newspaper in its April 20 issue last month
The official Egyptian newspaper
In a comprehensive investigation, it was said that the extended investigations
In Hezbollah network uncovered a subversive plot
Egypt targets Iran, Syria and Qatar
Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood
A well-known trumpet fanfare
Qatar is the smallest Arab country
The Plot Against Egypt
We respect
A Struggle Over the Years
I am not saying it to stir up the feelings of anyone.
I will complete what you have completed
We can
And the Egyptian President
keirish
On Arab Relations
The first point.
The Gaza Issue
‏As they say and as we admit
Qatar is a country
Its size is small
You can participate in a scheme of this kind
Because we suffered from the interference of countries at one time, and I don’t want to return to this
Who sold the interventions of some countries in the Qatari affair
Therefore, the policy of His Highness’s government
Now that they discovered, they say it is a conspiracy
Also, the name means we, I mean I want to say to the house, may God protect it, Syria and Iran will defend themselves, I will not defend them
Stability in Egypt
And why does Qatar want to change or intervene in a subject of this kind
And the Pyramids do not speak from inclination
Doha sought to fail Egypt's role and its contacts with Turkey and the European Union
My efforts to host a parallel conference to the Arab Summit to grab the most attention
And you use a cheap propaganda tool, which is Al-Jazeera.
Oh please.
With Hezbollah
And we are not comfortable, Mas means
I can say to you with certainty
We
We don’t think we should interfere in such circumstances
Whoever forced our brothers in Egypt, this is what we apologize to the Egyptian officials
The dispute or sensitivity that exists among some members of the Egyptian government
But some officials are allergic
What is it?
I will come to you on the subject
The days of peace in Foua and Qarya and if we
And it was held before in Egypt
And then it was held here.
Because Israel
We have a disagreement with her
You have no conflict with Israel
And now the conference and since then
Any Islamic conference, there is a sensitivity among Arabs
Why this sensitivity
Sit with them and
Let me finish for you.
And we always hope for the best
We discovered this allergy
O or three means
The Gaza Conference that was
Egypt doesn’t want complications in Qatar
It's not Arabic
In Qatar and in the summit in Kuwait we said to them, guys
The Palestinian people are marching to beat
More than two weeks
But we held it before the scheduled Kuwait conference, which we were the first to ban.
People are being killed
And by by means by procrastination
The dispute appeared
No small state stood against this fight
Of course I know that there are some brothers in the government and this is also an insult to Egypt, not to anyone else.
When they said that after
OK, you are in the island
Israelis were informed that before it, the day before, there was a meeting to stop the fighting before any speech or anything
What is
My brother, they entered medicine and food during the strike when our brothers are being struck.
Sometimes they say the gate is narrow
What did the trucks enter?
They told us once that there is an agreement on the second side and they have to come
It is not the time for us to bring in Fatah or Hamas
I don’t care about Fatah or Hamas, what matters to me are the one and a half million people who are being beaten.
And they have no medicine
When we started talking about this subject and talking about the Gaza conference
Qatar’s intervention in the matter causes sensitivity for the regime in Egypt
It’s not your business
We didn’t talk about how Egypt is handling the situation because this is Egypt’s jurisdiction
It means one of the officials said we discovered a big conspiracy behind the subject
He still didn’t tell us what the conspiracy is
We mean, what about this official?
He says to us that Egypt is a big deal
Okay, my friend, we understand that Egypt is a great Arab country and we always say that Egypt is a great country
That is why we always ask the big countries for many things
Because Egypt is for us
And you invited them to a conference as well, which was also provoking for them
We were not invited to the conference
The Age of Gaza
And we coordinated and our position was unified
People suffer in Gaza
Forbidden means I know that Turkey has entered something through Israel
I am happy if I see it through our brothers in Egypt
‏ From us and to us
And if Egypt wins or does good politics
We believe this is in the interest of Qatar and the Arab world
Stability in Egypt is important to us
If she does a good job, that is important to us.
Let me finish your question for you, your introduction took a quarter of an hour.
The case you are now wasting my time with but
No, I’m not going to do it, I’m not going to do it, I’m not going to do it now, because of my anger
Whoever angers the officials in the Egyptian system on you
We Failed the Doha Summit
The second thing is that they failed to hold the Doha conference
King Abdullah has a wisdom that he wanted
And he wants to reconcile
And therefore, some countries ban
This is something I said to our brothers in Saudi Arabia because we
We have no disagreement with Saudi Arabia even on this point
The problem is that it appears to be an internal issue
He or any of the officials
‏ B to the top officials
One big country, one responsible person, and a small country is doing these things
So that was for you
She is she she she she she
Darfur is a part of Egypt's national security and Sudan
Read the five major countries
If any country other than Qatar had done it
But these sensitivities lead to increasing the matter. Why do you put your nose in everything? I am suspicious of you.
We want to solve the allergy, let’s take allergy medicine. They tell us what is the allergy?
Why is it sensitive?
Some of the brothers in the F.F.L.P. government
They have internal failure
They want to divert attention from the plot in Gaza to a coup
Like they say, the English are blind to the Italians
Whatever is easy
A receiver for more than just instructions for analysis
I don’t know what happened, okay, because because
The Case for Local Solutions
Don’t treat
No, my priority is my country.
My priority is to do first thing the issues that concern my country
And then look if I have enough time
Consideration of the issues of the Arab National Bank
Otherwise, Qatar tried to fix
And thinking of every Arab issue that you can contribute to with our contribution to the extent possible
Why are you provoking? Why don’t you take it in good faith
I can’t treat you.
I can make my opinion clear.
Don’t throw it on me
And we, we, we have our opinion
Who came from his heart
Let me finish for you.
When the initiative of reconciliation was announced and the presidents met in Kuwait, we were optimistic and I issued a statement welcoming this topic.
In dictation
Of course, the Egyptian official who exposed his heroism
In my opinion, in an interview on TV or something, I won’t respond to her
Because I have an answer for each point
But I am preserving the minimum level of relations that tie us and tie the Arab interests
And also in response to the call mentioned by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques
But all I advise is this and nothing else.
And they try to correct their mistakes, both internally and externally.
In politics, economics, or anything else, just like we have mistakes in politics and economics, no one is immune to mistakes.
They accuse Qatar of these accusations
You deny any relation of Qatar with anything related to Hezbollah cell
This is a funny subject
To distort the relations of Egypt and fail its role and communications with Turkey and the European Union
We are first, we are few in number
If we are able to do this role
This is not true
There are accusations against you personally
to pay money to the kidnappers of Shalit so that Qatar gets Shalit and she takes advantage of the Egyptian role in the matter
He always accuses us of paying money first. We didn’t pay money and we didn’t talk to anyone about paying money.
But this is the case
We are in favor of Egypt solving the problem as we are in favor of Egypt and we still support it in solving the Palestinian issue
God willing, the Palestinian president will remain in office until this issue is resolved.
We were there and the first to support the State of Qatar
The Authority and the Palestinian institutions remain until the dispute is resolved
And we said, “Here is.”
In the Arab League he says no, we have passed it because we believe that there are people who do not want this subject.
But we passed it with intelligence
Does he address his boss?
his prime minister
Dude, I don’t know if there is a problem
From us, from them, I don’t know
They decided it last April in the number 10 issue of El-Shroq newspaper, which published the news exclusively
The political leadership in Egypt decided to launch a news channel to confront the propaganda machine called Al Jazeera and end
It is only a matter of days until everything ends and is put
But you are afraid that the island will become something of the past
means now a political adolescence living
As you gave up to Saudi Arabia, the Emir of Qatar sat with the King of Saudi Arabia
We did not give in, and they did not give in to us
We treated them as brothers
A small country gives up to a big country, Egypt.
No, Saudi Arabia is at an important point that needs to be clarified
Qatar’s relations with Saudi Arabia are different
And then we will talk
Qatar’s Relations with Egypt
And we put a lot of hope on it
Let me be frank with you, is solitude
Am khalaf f al-siyasa al-rئيسيه ar
No personal differences, I told you we respect the Egyptian people
If you asked me now, what are the two problems of Gaza and what else?
And this is a case that has affected us a lot
I want to treat this psychologically, meaning I want to solve this problem
Published in some newspapers
Minister of Foreign Affairs
The death of Prince Saud Al Faisal
We talked about everything.
But it was clear that the situation had worsened and not solved.
No no there was in no see
That means I can’t tell you that we have good relations with Egypt
‏ They have a complaint and they are entitled to it as our brothers
And we have a right to reproach them as younger brothers
In the big country, we don’t want to compare ourselves with any big country
Egypt is bigger than Tahrir
It’s not a matter of life and death I mean, but that the solution comes from heaven
We, for our part, if there is anyone waiting for his satisfaction
Or someone who waits for style
Qatar has
You treat him not as an equal and not as a brother
As a major country, yes, we are proud of Egypt as a major country
But if anyone is deceiving anyone
This means I know that Israel is following us
And even though the previous American policy in the previous administration was against me
I think they want to imitate neither Israel nor America on this subject
And then what, if my son also takes their policies, they are also under pressure from external parties
In several MMM cases, let me finish for you
We understand and know that there will be more amendments even for the major countries
The Dress That Moves You
We don’t have any movement, our movement is one thing.
Qatar's internal interest is this my internal affair
In the Arab world, in any field in which we can help, we will help.
What are the sources of power Al-Jazeera Channel and Al-Mayadeen Base A
You could say this isn’t strong
In faith in God and in ourselves
He or the vision of the Prince
I don’t want to hurt anyone
Let me finish for you, I don’t want to argue with anyone.
And I don’t want to compete with anyone.
They say what they say about Great Qatar or others
But we have our point of view
We kicked out the Israeli office first, we closed it.
سبحان الله اول كانوا ايقولون سكروا المكتب سكرنا المكتب زعلوا راحوا ايقولون للامريكان شوفوا هذيلا Praise be to God, at first they used to say, "Close the office, we closed the office, they got angry and went and said to the Americans, "Look at these people."
They went to stand with those who call them the Devil’s Team
What do they say
For Americans and Europeans, these are not our friends and we know how to deal with them
The conspiracies
which was exerted
It's a flaw, we reached the stage and in the end what
First now
What is your vision to solve the problem with Egypt one two points
And on the basis that Egypt has a big role in the Arab world
We think it is important that you know
And I am sure that President Hosni Mubarak is keen on this
But some of the crew
He needs to leave
Engage the Egyptian public or government or others or their values in trivial matters
And focus on Egyptian and Arab interests
Are there any steps?
We are behind them, not in front of them, because they are a great nation
In the foreseeable future
And God knows, I think this subject, I can’t imagine how the subject will be.
And I know that there will come a time for reason
And the time has come for those who are from us
If I were
Or from them
They are united by great Arab interests
We will find one day that this subject
The world is still going far
That means we don’t do it the Egyptian way you have.
If anyone stretches his hand, stretch your hands a meter.
Now with His Excellency Sheikh
‏It means we’ve never got used to running
On a solid basis, we are ready to run to Egypt.
Stop the Egyptian Stop
Now there are many rumors about the damage to Egyptian workers in Qatar from this issue
And there are contracts for Egyptians working in the jobs whether in the الجمعات or major jobs
Are you aware of this subject? First of all, it is not in the character of Qatar to cancel jobs and cancel.
Because these are people who have nothing to do with what is happening
This is a market where there is a change in demand in one, they cancel it in one, and then another comes
He is a generous and loyal person, and in other nationalities, they hid in nationalities that increased.
OK, answer quickly
The office was there
We worried about the office, so we should close it now
We teased them in the days when they were waging a campaign that all our losses in negotiations with Israel were due to this office
Hey, we closed it, let them solve the issue with Netanyahu
He was a guest
And they were among them and we used to invite all the ambassadors accredited in any foreign country
It wasn’t an official invitation to Akram Kabriela Chell
No, we didn’t treat her well before, when the relationship was as they say, good. Now it’s a bit difficult.
There is no reason now that forces you to reopen the office in this period
The office opens if the reasons cease
You made him big
the size of Egypt means
It is Egypt that imposed this
Our relationship with America is a strategic one. Let me be clear with you.
In some matters and this
‏ What is the most important thing?
In matters in our region in treating some issues we were different with the previous administration
Now we have a great hope for the administration, especially with the steps taken by President Obama
We believe there is great hope in this administration
A road to move the peace process A road to solve the Palestinian issue
All our friends and we do not deny it
What is happening in Iran and its effect on the Gulf and you
This is a subject that Iranians decide how to solve their problems
Among them
In their usual ways and I am sure that they will overcome this crisis
Iran's stability as His Highness the Emir mentioned
The Gulf region is important for our region and we share a common border with Iran
Of course we have special relations with all our neighbors, including Iran.
Because we are a country that seeks peace and stability for this region
And we were intervening in everything that was in the side that wants to change or replace the Doha agreement
I thought that Saad Hariri said
Now it’s over, so the strategic talk between the president
And among the Lebanese groups
How can I see
As for Yemen, do you have a role or have the Yemenis taken a stand against you?
See first, we are known for supporting unity when almost the whole Arab world was against Yemeni unity
We are an isolated Arab state and we stood with the unity of Yemen and the Gulf
The southern issue: we spoke with Yemen and His Highness the Prince sent me twice to meet His Excellency the Yemeni President
I made it clear to him that our goal is stability in Yemen, because Yemen is an important country in the Arabian Peninsula.
This agreement was not respected and I don’t want to say any more, what did each party do?
But what really hurt me is...
Qatar, which has taken this position, should be accused of paying money to the Houthis and senior officials.
Yemeni, we do not interfere in these matters
And whoever stands with unity does not stand against it
And for another purpose for the benefit of Yemen, whether political, economic or otherwise
This is a subject we have no objection to, but to be honest I was shocked.
Since I went more than ten times during the fighting, His Highness the Prince sent me to Yemen among the Yemenis.
I'm sorry, this accusation is strange
Time is up but in a nutshell, will these problems that you have predicted from your efforts to solve the problems change your policy in intervening in other Arab problems?
And God, if His Highness the Prince listens to my words, it is true that I think there is no need
And once showed us a big amount
More than five billion dollars at that time, if we invested it, it would be fifty billion, better than the headache
I just say it and I believe it because time in the Arab world now means
What is allowed in H under these circumstances
Thank you very much, His Excellency Sheikh
And perhaps even exceptional with Sheikh Hamad's State
What happened in the agreement in Doha
How the Doha Miracle Happened
On the empowerment of the committee and giving it all the support
Subject: Lebanon after the Israeli aggression in Lebanon
When there was an Arab consensus
And we went to New York, we were able to make the decision somewhat balanced.
And we touched this in Doha that both parties were eager
We tried as much as possible that we don’t listen to him or that he wouldn’t be there
Since we knew the committee, we knew
In reality, we know what the problem is after we sat with the Lebanese for many hours
And I think it’s a joint success
But there was a determination
I think that the problems of Lebanon are directly reflected in the atmosphere of the region
Whether peaceful or not
‏ Lebanon was destined for this location
‏ To be so
And unfortunately
External Rebounds
I can say the problem between Lebanese even if there is a problem that is not the number one problem
State Dr. Sheikh, I know maybe it’s not too early to talk about the behind-the-scenes, but
What happened? Why are you here?
Stop, if you will, this ground engagement
You didn’t delay for a single moment, meaning
What exactly was going on? I know very well even the Lebanese leaders at that time were telling me what happened
No, I was from the beginning
‏ When I talked to His Highness
Kill him if we come to Lebanon
I am putting forward this idea as it was endorsed and supported by His Highness the Prince
All Lebanese leaders are present there
Since you are here in Beirut, take a look at everyone in their area
And you are in the same hotel and in the same place
And on the same plane you met and talked
So we created this atmosphere, but from the beginning we thought
And this was the most important decision that was important
Of course there was
And this is what I felt from the Arab University
We Will Be Honest Brokers
And I believe, praise be to God, that this has been proven to everyone that Qatar has made an effort
To both sides
To reach aشرف solution for both parties
And if there is a solution, there is no one to lose
Before you take your step
It was discussed in the Arab League and we found support
What we have done
And I spoke to him and we were there
And if we succeed in Lebanon, we will transfer them to Doha
And he ordered me
Turn off their mobiles and take them away
We were able to bring them there and also the Syrian brothers were supportive of the position
I told you at the beginning, without Arab support, the committee would not have been able to do anything.
They wanted why they wanted the solution
I think the situation in Lebanon and the escalation that happened
And this tension
There is tension in Somalia. There is tension in Sudan.
In several decades it will be surrounded by the Arab world
And all that the fire could consume
It is in the interest of the Arab world to avoid foreign interventions and
And we try as much as possible to be in
Sends troops
Even Militarily
In this I think the subject
‏ At Sheikh State Point
He always said to solve the Lebanese side and the Lebanese file
A Saudi-Syrian Accord
With Qaf Qaf, if it is correct, Qaf Arab means Qatar and the Arab League.
Can what happened in Lebanon lead to a serious reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Syria?
In the Arab world, we need to introspect
‏ Arab differences
And any agreement between two Arab countries
And we tried that
In the War of '73
When Arabs agree to solve a subject
I think this is in the interest
Saudi Arabia and Syria play an important role in Lebanon
Both parties
Let Wisdom Prevail
Arab Relations on the Right Track
Because we face huge and big challenges in the Arab world
Everyone is playing in our yard
And we have no power nor any might
How do we stop playing in the Arab arena?
As Arabs, at least we agree
Unfortunately, we complain
We are spectators
The lack of agreement among us Arabs and the lack of trust between us Arabs is lost trust between Arab countries
And then the Arab countries
It’s not about mistrust, but rather a kind of
What is the name of the session?
This is a case that needs a stand from everyone, I mean, I believe
Medicine: Will this wish be embodied? Will you really ask for an Arab summit?
We feel sad when they feel sad and we are happy when they are happy
I mean, it came with the talk
Can you play a role in rectifying the situation between Damascus and Riyadh even if in an indirect way?
They are keen to find solutions and I am sure that by their wisdom
They may reach an understanding
Among them in many issues
And he was in harmony in politics and I am sure that God willing this
Relations Are Improving
Both sides need to want to take a step forward.
But I can’t be sure that this is what is happening now
I am sure if the Arabs focused on solving the conflicts between Arab countries and the problems of some Arab countries that I mentioned
My state of optimism and my state of pride at the citizen that there is a general Arab awakening
But I can’t connect what happened in Lebanon
It can be translated by the earth, meaning there is an Israeli-Palestinian escalation.
There is an escalation, maybe American-Iranian, maybe other issues, means
Will you still be afraid of it in the coming months?
We Arabs
We can only ask for food and medicine delivery
And electricity for the people
We are ready in Qatar, His Highness the Emir always
More than one and a half million Palestinians are besieged
We do not want them to have weapons, nor do we want them to have victory, nor
They do all this
and electricity
And we will give him, God willing, the Red Cross to reach the Palestinians.
We delivered food and medicine to the Palestinians.
And our disagreement with them continues.
I wish the Palestinians on both sides would prevail national interest
And They Leave the Illusions
This Palestinian rift is a big wound
On the solution
And they did not and would not comply
This is a dangerous subject, they should stick to the Mecca agreement
And they should ask that even if they go again to Mecca or to Saudi Arabia
And solve this dispute
They won’t benefit
Oh, promises from any party
I hope it will be a solution but
Our position is known in this subject and an amount for all concerned parties that we
We will not be a party and will not accept to be a party in any military conflict with Iran
We have good relations with her
But the most important thing is that we are a sovereign state and they are a sovereign state
Everyone sees his/her own interests, but these interests will not be seen by them or us.
We believe that the Gulf is destined to have a clear agreement between the GCC countries
Iran and cooperation and peaceful coexistence
But when the Sheikh’s state says that Qatar is not a party
Can you elaborate or clarify?
Just a hint
No never
Okay, I would like to go back if you allow me to the Lebanese file
To be frank, the Sheikh’s country meant that we were facing a big deadlock, and then in the last few hours we reached a solution
Some linked what happened to what was announced
Maybe it's information that may be scattered and not related to each other, but what happened?
Until you reached this result
What happened in Istanbul, I know that there were specific dates before
Oh, you knew about the negotiations
‏ Continuously on the subject of the solution in
And without any doubt, the support of the Kingdom is very important.
Changing the Course of Negotiations
About the talks led
To a positive result by bringing together so many parties from so many sides
And we started to talk
This is an Arab and Qatari approach to this paper
Tell me what is wrong with this paper
And we started talking about substance one after another
At the last moment, an obstacle was overcome.
But the Prince passed by the outskirts
And remove this obstacle
And he was absolved.
We heard the word of the Emir of Qatar in the opening session in Doha
Don’t you think that your role now
See, the most important thing is that we keep this topic out of the spotlight.
We Have No Regional Ambition
And God, we will have control over the country or something, because we are a country
We are proud of ourselves, we do not think that we can help solve things with other brothers
But in the Arab world it is very important
AN IN دول
We want her to do something and this is very important
Enable some small countries to play this role and support them in it
It means in some things it’s great, in some things it’s good, and in some things it’s less than good.
The last question, State Sheikh.
What is the central priority?
Is it a political priority?
Amniah, reform of the family
What is the Arab-Israeli conflict?
We stopped playing in the Arab square
We can solve our problems in the Arab countries
Now an active member in Iraq
‏ To send him the conditions
Regionally and internationally
But if we put our heads on our shoulders
It means any victory for us or we have no hope
Thank you, Your Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al-Thani, for this interview
The international efforts to put an end to the war on Gaza
and we start by requesting that you call a meeting of the Arab League Council at the
وزاري and you have abandoned
On the request to hold an emergency Arab summit
In the beginning, I am happy, brother Hassan, to be in this program.
Even if the circumstances
Humanity exposed to our brothers in Gaza
Circumstances call for us to do a lot
Qatar has not given up on the Arab summit
We were the truth when we went with the idea of the Arab Summit before
Unified not only by a Security Council decision but also through
Not Always Stepped on and Underestimated
And let me put it in another sentence
And we will discipline
The street can no longer bear it if it is carried by the officials of the Arab street
Does not bear
When we were in Cairo
There were 10 to 11 written consents
Some of them spoke at the meeting and the meeting could have been held
If we have a problem as long as there is an Arab consensus
And I don't blame anyone who thinks that there should be a meeting where they can see.
He or she solved the problem how
It’s going to be solved
This is the important subject
Our goal is not advertising or promotion, our goal is to find
That means you didn’t consider the summit.
And we ask of ourselves
I’ll go to press on the poor other side
The previous and the following and the Security Council decision but let’s just stick to the Arab summit. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad
It is clear that the situation may require an Arab summit of those present.
And we found that the majority of the brothers support holding the summit
To whom it may concern
And I don’t know what they mean by moderation
We are the only nation
Only the Arab nation is, if we go to any nation in Asia, Latin America, etc.
And Unresolved
which are classified as moderate countries
And what is moderation in our view
Should We Give Up the Palestinian Cause
What we like
Should we interfere in Palestinian affairs in a way
So, there is no mother who would allow the interference of who is good and who is bad
I don't know if Hamas and Hezbollah will be a second party tomorrow
Is she a student?
And can we be a part of the Arab body?
It was planned for us to enter into an Arab internal strife
OK and we go to the Security Council
There is no decision by the Security Council
Please after I complete my mission in Israel
Good, the second Arab Ministerial Meeting you were invited to
which was dominated by discussions, conflicts and sharp arguments
He is at an important point
This is not the point
And if we work together
From the crossings
There is no peace for Qadiyyeh
Are the ministers ready for that?
Because in one corner they say no, we have to wait
Okay, we are in an Arab initiative
Peace Talks with Israel Frozen
We don’t say that we are losing in this subject
In a greater loss than what we are losing now, well we have always been respectful, polite and committed to decisions since the truce
Saada Al Sheikh says that the clashes are not important
So who wished for a war with Hamas and so on
This means that it is an expression of a political position rather than a dispute between a minister and another minister and so on.
Unfortunately, this is a situation that happened
But not everyone
I don’t want to speak on behalf of others
It is very important that we are men of our own country.
We are running our country's politics
Who does this on her behalf of such things
I think, that is
I don’t think they respect us in the end
Yes, is there anyone who plays the roles on behalf of the West?
No, God forbid that I accuse anyone, I do not want to accuse anyone about this subject.
After the Security Council’s Decision
What will be his agenda
The position appeared in the decision in the Arab effort
And here is the disagreement if Israel immediately applied the decision
We can say that we can decide
But Israel has not implemented this decision
Are we now ready to go and ask for Chapter 7? I know that there are difficulties, of course.
Don’t ask who by the international community and if you ask
With a blush
The the the position
They see that they have done right by the Jews or Israelis
They should take their rights
The Arab Moment
If Arabs Hadn’t Gone to the Security Council
And they agree on a summit and make difficult decisions
And the western countries will seek for us
Because we are in the Arab depth and in the world and in human beings and you see how the Arab street is moving in this subject
But this decision is important
Summoning our presidents one after another
It means okay and in the end they said, well, it turned out to be nothing and that’s all.
Okay, if we were like Germany or something, would we ask?
They don’t need to pay compensation for what they did, you are providing incorrect information.
And kill hundreds of thousands
This is because you are a weak Arabic speaker
We, as Arabs, went too far
How to
Remove the subject
بطريغه and it was the end of the matter and fate
If the Arab nation says that if you send troops to Darfur, we will send troops to Darfur
Arabs considered o o Thameh considered the decision one thousand eight hundred and sixty
And the gang was keen to issue the decision
What was issued by the Security Council
I just want to say that the victory of Ahwa is not a victory
As things end
Let’s assume that victory
What are we going to do
We assume that the rest of the decision is not committed to
But I assure you that we will abide by the decision.
Unfortunately, you will have to comply with it, but you shouldn’t comply with the decision.
Even after the Israeli rejection, Israel returned and accepted
That means we
Will you have an alternative or rather you are the one who calls for a ministerial meeting
I don't think the Arab nation
In the current situation, she is not ready for any alternative.
And I don’t think the Arab nation is ready
Implementing the Gaza Siege
For Other Political Goals
To favor one class over another in Palestine, instead of rectifying what is between them
We started to try to plan
Once they held a meeting, I don’t know if it was an Arab or European intelligence meeting, without mentioning names.
And they did it once, so we are going to subscribe
In implementation
What the West Must Do
But if we go
This means I want to sort it
So I’m not talking about the decision, I’m talking about
The consequences of this, as this subject has been going on for two years, is the Gaza issue, not now
I will talk about the subject two years ago but in the decision topic specifically
Do you have any reservations about its clauses?
What was issued and what was implemented
‏ We were not called
Maybe they think we have a different point of view.
Everyone was supposed to be on the same page
It’s not necessary that we all have the same point of view, but I think that those who went did their best.
And we thank them for it
Regarding what has been happening in Gaza for the past two years, I said that the parties
A group prevails over another group in the subject of the siege on Gaza
You already agree with the words, hints or accusations that have been issued here and there
On the Real Arab Complicity in Everything Happening Now in Gaza
That means we’ve seen the part
On the subject, let me tell you, we’re not privy to everything
But I know
The Palestinian-Palestinian Conflict
Arab and International
And if it had not been for the fact that they did not stir up trouble, they would have differed in this difference.
And what happened after the elections
The Hamas Spirit for the Authority
With the majority
It is assumed that we gave them a chance and saw
Do they want reform or are they still revolutionaries in the sense of revolution? All they know is the rifle and fighting.
But in the day inside
Arabia, my brothers, in belief that these are radical movements, they should not come to power
Now they say to each other that there is an attack
Hamas broke the truce before, or the Palestinians from Gaza broke it
‏ Truce
The Palestinian people in Gaza will remain hungry for two years
This is nothing.
For Israeli Security
It's clear, okay, we don't want them in power. This doesn't concern me. I'm in Qatar.
But what is the fault of the remaining people
And then who decides
These are not all countries that have their own sovereignty in choosing.
‏ Both governments
It is the basis of the problem
But I am sure that it can be treated.
If we were to be honest, we would admit that we fuel the conflict
But it seems that we are required to defeat a class over another because this class
A group we consider terrorist or the one we consider terrorist
‏ What is happening now has led
And also the promises they made to the party that will survive are suitable
They didn’t do anything to him
We return to the international and Arab efforts to put an end to what is happening. You mentioned
There is a Security Council resolution that Israel has so far rejected
And there is the Egyptian initiative that
Egyptian in Cairo
On those Egyptian efforts
It’s not a wrap
An important role is required of her
And also Egypt has borders adjacent to Israel and Palestine.
If we
And now we need to stop the chaos
In Gaza and Wangig people stop the chaos in Gaza because
This is Not the Way to Peace
There must be
And that’s why we always ask for a bigger role.
‏ What was announced
So the initiative cannot be evaluated now
Or give the possibility of success or studying
I think the chances of success
If the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt can
Bringing Palestinian Perspectives Closer
And the one who discusses the initiative assumes the injured party in Gaza
Lan is the one who can say yes and can say no
And this is an important point
When the decision 1860 was issued
Problem with us is a Palestinian car
We don’t want to hear from anyone.
But I would have liked it if the Palestinian delegation had gone
‏And when they went to the university they asked for someone to be with them from Gaza
So that they show the Israelis now that this is our brothers, we are with them as one
This is an important point.
Don’t Make Power
It is our goal to protect and we build our policy
Staying in Power
Sheikh al-
So I don't know if we can discuss the Egyptian initiative since you haven’t read its articles and but
Do you think in principle that it is suitable for it to implement the international resolution 1540 as some have stated?
A Balanced Role
I am not going to hate tomorrow or the day after tomorrow because
Every day passes
In the blood of our brothers it is spilled
I don't want to drag the Palestinians or the Israelis into this issue until they finish their own business. Let's start by putting forward this initiative.
And I am sure that the brothers in Egypt know this and are keen on it
And I want to make it clear that all I’m saying
It is now necessary to solve the problem
And it's not like what Israel wants
This marks the Turkish role since the beginning of the crisis
Does it mean an expression?
The Arab Void
There was no doubt that the position was striking
And it has an Arabic depth
‏ Her entry is in Arabic, in Arabic deficit
We Know There Is an Arab Deficit
Part of it due to disagreements
Part of it is because of each one’s point of view, I think that I believe my point of view is the best.
And this one thinks his point of view is better
And in Consensys how can we make people respect us and know that there is an Arab decision
And they will not single one of us out.
One says, no problem, we give them two or three more days so that I can call them and bring the group, so that they will be ready for the two levels and the issue will be solved.
We should rise above this and not accept this
They may have mistakes, we will hold Hamas accountable
Arabia Arabia
But now
At least I can say no to them.
As part of the position, Qatar is also required to agree. We will return to this point but
In the field at the same time, you heard
Khaled Mashal yesterday the head of the political office of Hamas
First, it is not necessary that every time brother Khaled Mashal says something, with all my respect and appreciation for him
Why don’t we sit with Khaled Mashal and talk to him as Arabs
Bring it to the Arab League and tell him
This is important talk
From Hamas
Israel’s conditions also impose conditions
Let them impose their own conditions, meaning they are not allowed to impose conditions and Israel is not allowed to impose conditions
First, what is your opinion about this Arab popular gift?
The mob or these are crowds, we shouldn’t listen to them. Once they told me, “Do this”, I didn’t listen to them.
Diqoul, the first thing is to liberate your country
With and without allies, he liberated his country from the Nazi occupation
Now we are talking about
The Arab Spring, we are supposed
The imposed presidents represent the views of their people
The Arab people in all those demonstrations we witnessed
It can be met from these classes of claims
Many of those who criticize Qatar in this position also demand
In view of what is happening and the office and representation, it is still open
They are talking the same logic
By cutting ties, we will go along with all Arab countries
Cut off all relations even if someone says he has a treaty with him
They want Qatar to just disappear
If we
And this is more important than the relationship
Not only in this decision, but in this and in decisions that are harder
‏ What is the reason for this decision
So, we must have a unified Arab position
‏ for others
Don’t sell anyone to anyone because it is based on getting moral or material gains or calling
Yes, meaning before we close this file in this subject there are also countries that have taken individual steps
Good Shaffir's article is different from Shaffir's conflict with America
What our people need is for us to call
Five permanent members of the Security Council presented their arguments. This is a movie.
We finished it, the street is now smarter than that
The highest happiness is Sheikh Sa'ad's roof
He or she calls on the resistance forces in Lebanon to confront the Israeli aggression and so on.
Do you think that if this matter was framed within a single Arab framework, it could succeed?
But we call for an Arab position that will respect us through which people
I don't think the Arab countries are ready for war
And we are not motivated
How can we get Syria, and we get Lebanon and we get the other countries, and in Arabic countries don’t talk to each other
What should be there
A qualitative leap in Arab relations
This is the current policy between the Arab states
On the list, but I think its validity has expired
In in the objectives
The important case
And we know how the Lebanese are made
Lebanon Without a doubt
She gave an example that she returned her lands
The situation in Gaza is different The situation in Gaza is still
Surrounded from All Sides
And this siege
Nature gives different
Yes, I mean the goals in relation to Israel, that is, the goals of the operation in relation to Israel.
The day when so-and-so will be punished, the day when so-and-so will be punished, so-and-so day, the day when so-and-so will be happy.
And therefore, the example that happened in Lebanon for them is not a good example
The Lebanese Model of Resolution
She considers it valid
To Gaza
Look at the problem in Gaza or the Palestinians, their solution is easier than the solution in Lebanon
Some of us think that we will get our land back today, while others think that we will get it back tomorrow.
Their Differences Over Power
On the Distribution of Power
And this is different because the fabric is not closer to some
From the fabric of the intellectual in Lebanon
And therefore the solution is easier
And here is the problem
Saada Al Sheikh
That means we only have minutes left to summarize this subject to where can we
And a diplomat means
How can this process end
For the Palestinians in Gaza
Let me tell you.
Or he rejects
And in-assisted
Who didn’t go with us
Beicon failed for us, we are Arabs
From a strategic point of view
But on the Palestinian side
There have been some efforts but we haven’t seen a comprehensive initiative
Neither before nor now, why?
It's not about the initiative, it's about how much we feel
Whoever solves the issue, we will help without mentioning the name of Qatar, as some people may be allergic to the name of Qatar
And our goal is not to bring the summit because we have the summit in March
If we take the initiative, will we be better than our brothers? I don’t think so.
And don’t push them.
History won’t forgive us if we oppress them
That means we are moving forward with this initiative. We saw all the parties at the meeting on Thursday, which was postponed because of going to the Security Council.
We hope that, God willing, we will make progress. We hope that our Arab brothers will help us as much as possible in this regard.
We reflect that we keep him away from the subject of competition

They were attacked in Taji because of their disagreement with the Sudanese government at one time
And this is also one of our problems, okay, we fight, we disagree, we
What I want to talk about in this topic
In Kuwait on the 19th of this month, I think, the Arab situation is as
As you know, as you mentioned and explained Your Excellencies
Is the whole Arab weather helping the first economic summit?
His Highness
And we of course attend any summit of any Arab brother, we always attend
And we always prevent the holding of any summit
But doesn’t he fear that it will turn into a political summit?
Of course, considering that time is pressing.
It’s too late even if it means after ten days
We are talking about Palestinians after they have eaten and been beaten for twenty-four days
means it will
It is not said that the Arabs could not meet
This is what we said
This is what we said
With my respect, this summit is programmed and we are committed to it
I think we

On this meeting
Thank you viewers for following
And farewell. Coverage continues of the ongoing war on Gaza. Farewell.
A few days ago, the World Day of the Disabled was celebrated
Sheha بنت خليفه ال ثاني
Doha and contributing to the preparation of the draft law
She has also been a member of many local and Arab councils in the field of childhood
I have also given more than seventy lectures, workshops, presentations and published articles in Arabic and international magazines.
At the beginning let’s agree on the term currently used
For the reference to the disabled, are they people with special needs or like what you said, disabled?
It is now first good evening
Since the disabled have been taken from the legal aspect or from the culture of human rights
Because it treats people with disabilities as people first
Human
And so his disability was created by his attempts to adapt to society
‏Then the medical concept prevailed
Then the LLL went on to develop the concept into a concept
The science of special education and special education appeared
This class has become
We started calling them people with special needs.
And these are the standard rules from which
The role of the Special Rapporteur in monitoring the implementation of this document
‏Then the pace quickened until the international agreement appeared, which was legally binding and distinguished from the rules in this regard
And I made a basic condition or a basic rule for this term
Who treats these people as human beings as people as individuals
With the change in terminology as you preferred, is there a change in the view towards this category of society?
Yes and it is measured
‏ Different from one region to another
But the special thing about this subject
The Arab world has distinguished or differed
However, the legal trend is that human rights culture is present, for example in Africa.
In Latin America, but the reasons may be due to lack of financial resources.
Of course, this is what I wanted to say, that culture is there, but there is a lack of resources. Sometimes there is a lack of political will.
Sometimes legislation but
But unfortunately awareness is very low and also there is no culture of human rights
10% of the world's population is disabled
Eighty to 90 percent of people with disabilities in developing countries are of working age
And they suffer from unemployment
means through my visit to Darfur
He and with the mines and the weapons
For men, a lower grade is better
People with disabilities are in remote areas in faraway regions
Therefore, there are many trends from organizations working in this field that try to raise
Realizing the Right to Education
Instead of establishing many religious centers as the term is understood
It goes to the fact that she establishes rehabilitation centers, hospitals and schools
And this is just one of the things that, thanks to God, we do at the office
I tried with the organizations in the State of Qatar
Set the agenda
She schedules the agendas of these humanitarian organizations so that they include those centers
In light of the decline in the situation of people with disabilities around the world
I can’t call it or agree with you that there is a decline
If there is a decline in the Arab region, it is because of the disability issue
Within the social context, within the political context, within the economic context, we cannot expect that the conditions of people with disabilities will
And they are from the marginalized groups
F in a country like what I said like Gaza like Darfur
On the contrary, I cannot absolutely say that there is no improvement in the situation.
And it was actually translated on earth, for example, if I can hit an example
In the manner of the Qatari Red Crescent
We agreed that the projects will enter
For people with disabilities within the health sector as part of this strategy and there are other projects
We also tried to enter it
The Role of Earth-Based Organizations
Mother is with us now, Kamal Kro from Syria, welcome Kamal.
Good evening Suleiman Qro
Suleiman Kro, excuse me, please.
‏ My best regards to you and to Mrs. Hafsa, may she be well.
First, is there a mental disability included in the UN laws?
Mental disability means a healthy person who became a pressure factor and was not exposed to mental disability.
His disability is a result of torture and imprisonment, which caused him to become mentally disabled. He has been receiving treatment for six years.
I know about 40 people, between children and adults, who are disabled as a result of prisons.
Is there a law in the UN?
The truth is, I mean
They know, as they know their children
And all means intention means intention without without without without what they make themselves مسمياته
And there are values in the West
Agreed but people
I understood from some people that those who have converted or have been converted from Islam will not be taken from them the wisdom
Thank you very much Naif Al-Saad, tell us from Kuwait.
I return to our guest to comment on what was said in
Communications سليمان تساءل هل هناك اعاقه فكريه
Yes, included in the classification
The World Disability Day, for sure mental and intellectual disability as it is called
Among these disabilities are sensory disabilities, meaning visual or hearing disabilities, and motor disabilities.
Of course, as I mentioned, disability is
Action and reaction happen within a specific social context
In the Arab world or in any other region
Surely, confronting disability has taken a long way
And even at the level of the UN
There I was, for example, during my experience and work as a special rapporteur on the issues I tried to address and work on
The Right for All
Until he prepares for them
The different rehabilitation to ensure their entry into schools also work with the organization of work
works on professional qualification which includes people with disabilities
I entered it with many improvements
Especially after the reform
In general, it is present in this international body
I am also, as a special rapporteur
The practical truth and this was positive for me if not directly related
and which supported this position
I have seen it in many meetings, for example the international convention
For the rights of persons with disabilities
Does she suffer from these restrictions or shortcomings?
e.g. with regard to legal capacity
And this is just one of the basic points in the world of disability which
The United Nations unfortunately was suspended during preparation and drafting
Regarding organizations and agencies
For example, Wansahi this
The world Governments and non-governmental organizations Member States of the United Nations
We sent you another questionnaire
For the United Nations organizations and its agencies in the various regions
So that we know to what extent disability programs are on their agendas
If there is participation of people with disabilities
Human rights
More than Development
‏ Okay, we are receiving more calls. Naji from Algeria is on the line. Please, Naji.
And the peace be upon you
I wanted to ask my sister exactly from which part of Algeria and Souf.
I liked to ask, I am originally from, I am physically disabled
OK, we will ask her this question. Naji Mchri spoke to us from Algeria. Thank you very much, Ahmed.
Halabi from Greece, please Ahmed
Good evening, ma’am, good evening to your guest.
Health care, housing, seasonal clothing, even taking them on seasonal trips, this is what happens in Europe
Is a mental patient considered disabled?
Especially, they may harm others or themselves.
Everything we talk about is in the unproductive discussion space, thank you.
Sister Hessa mentioned the financial shortfall.
In poor countries in particular in Africa and Latin America I call on them
Establish an international fund for disability support and allocate one percent of the net profits of every institution in the world.
And that will be mandatory and without exception for any institution or company
It will provide relief to the many disabled, war victims, etc.
Thank you very much for what you have done, Mr. Ibrahim Abdullah, you have told us about Saudi Arabia.
Naji Mashri wonders and reviews his problem, he is a handicapped
‏at the local or national level meaning through algeria
The needs within the local community must be met within that community
It is the same rights that should be given to any other person
The right to life first, then the right to housing, the right to health, and the right to education
Therefore, I really call from this platform, governments and Arab governments in particular
For the benefit of this citizen and this individual
For the sake of
Those needs and rights are part of the already existing agendas
No, there is no need to create any devices
New to meet the needs of the disabled person or no need if this country
She can, and she should be committed to doing
I first advise him to return and refer to the responsible authorities at the governmental level if possible
That is within the national scope and it must be included in this scope
Your mention of the international convention for the disabled there are many signed countries but they do not comply
Here we ask a question from a caller who said why there are no laws
It is a definite truth, we are in a human society, where there is a lot of mistakes and a lot of right.
Of course, many agreements and certainly many covenants do not contain literal obligations
Or an ideal commitment of many countries joined many like CEDAW and others
But there are violations and abuses and we know that
But the issue is that we adopt an agreement and join it
First, we will ensure that there is awareness
And this awareness starts from the top of this pyramid, which is the decision makers.
and officials and then down to the community as a whole
It is also our commitment to prepare reports and these reports reach the United Nations
The issue of knowledge, understanding, and raising the level of awareness and
For the reports, did you work as a rapporteur at the UN?
Yes, from what I saw and what I recorded there is interest
Therefore, I believe that there is a relative advantage to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
So advise, encourage and call
It is also important that people with disabilities
And we will hear what Ali Abid al-Senari, the president of the Qatari Association for the Deaf, will say to us
The deaf speak about it, سيد ناجي سغرنا اهلا بك سيد ناجي وسيد علي كذلك
‏ Peace be upon you
And the peace be upon you
With me is Mr. Ali عبيد السناري, the chairman of the board of directors at the Qatari Cultural and Social Center for the Deaf
‏ which is dominated by the happiness of Sheikhessa Hessa
Former UN Special Rapporteur on Disability
Kasim from Qatar
And the chairman of the Board of Directors of the truth is that Sheikh Hessa had a long history
And the international convention that you are talking about now is in fact
It is a great benefit for all people with special needs around the world
And especially in the Arab world
And we and Inni wish Kasim
That these countries implement this international agreement
which will serve people with special needs and it is essential that
It is really necessary to activate this agreement in all countries
Aboud Al-Senari, who is the president of the Qatari Association for the Deaf
We stop at
Here we continue our conversation but after a short break, stay with us

Dear viewers, welcome back and a warm welcome to our today’s episode with Sheikha Hessa بنت Khalifa Al Thani
For disability, an international fund to support
Disability and it will be mandatory for all countries to provide funds. What do you think of this proposal?
The UN has a fund called the Disability Case Fund
And unfortunately, those contributions are very weak
Monitoring task for applying standard rules
When I worked for these six years, there was no support at all
Except for China and Austria
And it always means that I thank this country for this support
The main supporting country is my country, Qatar.
Which established the office through which we were able to implement many activities and projects, praise be to God
Yes, this lack of support indicates what?
Means like like what we put at the beginning and always this point is raised
The Plight of Ordinary People
How do we care for the disabled or care about the disabled
means that if there is a realistic, real and serious commitment
All in all, in all categories
the disabled child teenager immigrants refugees
All of us will actually reach the degree of what is called
Equal Opportunity, Participation and Equality
And there are those voices that always demand, never tire, never give up.
In the Islamic region and the Arab region, why not allocate a part, excuse me
For the sake of these programs and projects
Just as I presented the truth and I thank him from this platform
Islamic Bank for Development
‏ Among the balance that is allocated
The non-commitment you talked about, the payment of financial dues
Funds for helping the disabled only cover developing and Arab countries or
Even Advanced Countries Don’t Deliver
means the the person before me who is the Swede yes
Also some EU countries
And certainly there are many countries, especially in the Arab region, which may not have
You know even about the existence of this special course
In my case, that is, what happened
Sweden and China
And the Arab region, unfortunately, there were also many promises, but unfortunately only one country
We will talk about the Arabic region but
‏ We have more contacts. Hamad Al-Marri from Qatar. Please, Hamad.
سلام عليكم
And the peace be upon you
‏Dr. Marah, hello Sheikhah Hessa
Almost ten years
This girl, now we’ve noticed that she has a psychological disability
What is your role, I mean, in relation to a girl like this who suffers?
She is with her colleagues
With, sometimes even if we stay
What is your role regarding the Qatari girls?
Thank you very much, Hamad Al-Marri. You spoke to us from Qatar.روان Behjat from Kuwait, welcome.
Just as they say, Sheikh Hessa
Why don’t you keep our oil in your cup?
Arab people with special needs can be counted
‏ We can help them
We have huge financial resources
We can break the psychological barrier between us and them
Reviving the morale of the individual
And you use it for this noble purpose
This if we are really believers
Thanks and appreciation to Sheikha Hessa for her efforts and what she has done during the periods of her mandate to the Special Rapporteur
With our thanks and appreciation to them and thanks to the State of Qatar for everything it has done for people with special needs
Thank you very much, Aisha Mohammed, for telling us from Qatar.
‏ Peace be upon you, Professor Wasilah
And peace be upon you
‏ And on your kind hospitality
‏ سعاده الشيخه حصه
My question is about prevention
Prevention is better than cure
There is another level of disability regardless of wars and traffic accidents
At the genetic level, it may be a result of the families’ negligence, which is marriage between relatives.
I think this is a big percentage
leads to disability
Thank you very much to the flag-bearer, Sherif, who spoke to us from Tunis. Our guest will now return to you.
The first connected Hamad Al-Marri wondered about
Where is he going with his disabled girl with a psychological disability?
Where is it heading?
In every country
‏ There are definitely services for all types of disabilities in Qatar
For these disabilities, whether mental disabilities as we said or any psychological disabilities
This is for the schools
‏ In the past there was
Either private education or the Ministry of Education which has now become the Supreme Council
Standard-bearer Sherif from Tunisia pointed to a very important point
and scientific papers etc
B. I have programs for organizations working only on disability, but even within campaigns that
Adolescent programs
All of this has been the focus of many reproductive health campaigns and programs
I talked about this aspect
Adopting healthy strategies
raise awareness
The dangers of marriage to relatives
Genetic factors
I think in the state of Qatar
And by customs and traditions but it will certainly take time
Especially in tribal communities
But over time, there will be a response to it, but it is necessary to have a legal obligation, meaning
Yes, Karwan Behjat asked and suggested that one percent of the budget of Arab countries be allocated.
Let me help the disabled first
Yes, there is the statistical appreciation that was applied by the World Health Organization to the whole world
There are forty or about forty million disabled people.
Half of them are women
‏ But these numbers double
‏ Like there is a study in South Africa that saw and proved
Certainly the statistics that appeared about the war in Iraq about the war in Gaza
Every dead person was met by three disabled people
And since our Arab region has become a region of conflicts without any dispute
Even the suggestion made by Behjat Karwan
One percent is not enough
To assist people with disabilities in the Arab region if
This issue of proportionality is for the disabled or other marginalized groups
Frankly, I don’t think it agrees
which requires addressing their problems and needs
She stressed that people with disabilities are the most neglected
Governments’ Surveys Don’t Count the Disabled
It is also true that this is related to the culture of the community and sometimes to restrictions
Societal meaning when the population is counted by
The concerned devices
About having a disabled person in the house
‏ There was only one question asked, is there a disabled person or not?
The the section concerned with this employee and through the concerned ones there
We cooperated in preparing the form
We recommended that more details be provided
First clarify if the type of this disabled person, if there is a male or female
Does his assistant wake up or not
So, even the number, as I know is correct, why didn’t we reach the accurate result
It is also important to follow up on the progress of Fatima Al Dosari with us from Qatar, welcome Fatima
And peace be upon you
I am a Qatari citizen and I have a child with disabilities.
And I thank the country's ruler, Sheikh Hamad.
And his wife, Mrs. Mouza, for embracing this category
I really feel proud of the care and attention I receive
On her important role
Latifa Al-Masfri, please
Because they represent a big disability in the society without education without treatment
Thank you very much, Nasim, for being with us from Qatar.
Abdulkarim from Jordan, please go ahead, Naseem
Please be kind and let us hear you.
And peace be upon you
Thank you. Honestly, I have an input.
First of all, I am an audiologist and I worked in Qatar for about four years.
And we had a month of awareness of hearing and speech problems and
We were holding conferences, lectures and awareness sessions on hearing impairment
Now I want to talk about Jordan. I have been living in Jordan for almost three years.
Frankly, it offers new and wonderful services
Frankly, it provides new services whether from the material or immaterial or moral side.
Even the Jordanian Ministry of Education means ف المصادر
What is affiliated with the Ministry of Education in government schools
‏ Also we as private institutions
We receive great and beautiful support
Taib Kareem, do you have a direct question only due to lack of time, I apologize to you
Do you have a direct question?
In Qatar and the UAE, Jordan is great services and I think it’s very great and
Comment on the viewers' calls
means a person working in this field
Regarding the subject
I will also return to the issue of the agreement
which is required once it is ratified and acceded to
And it is the duty of this state or of these organizations
Because it starts from the issue of the rights of these people regardless
And frankly what
Doing it during that period for the disabled and
And you wish now that it would happen
Of course, I wish that both
I wish this research or this survey would be measured and more qualitative research would be conducted in this field
It also became clear to me from this experience
The six-year experience
And coordination between the Arab countries as well
They also have a role. It’s not just a matter of rights, they are recipients of rights.
Sheikha Hessa بنت خليفه ال ثاني, former UN Special Rapporteur on disability, thank you
We receive the elegant presenter of the الدوري والكاس channel, Lana Lana, good morning.
I am also pleased to welcome the shining captain of the Em Adhusal Club, Captain Ali Qassem.
Hello there Ali
Hello
Good morning
I will leave you the field to congratulate each one will congratulate at his ease as I am reserved
I had an open studio for five hours and Ablla had two hours Ablla Abiyoum
I congratulate the State of Qatar, government, people, who certainly deserve this global achievement
It was my chance to be here and congratulate Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani
He, Sheikh Tamim, the Crown Prince
Yes, of course, Lana, you are from the mathematical field and from those who work in this field and know these lines and this field very well
Even we
And between means we deserve it, we got six votes between us and America, 40 votes for Qatar and 80 for America
It's not night because our file is rich and comprehensive and supported by many ambassadors, it's supported a lot, let's say the stadiums
So some people were afraid that maybe there would be like America
And maybe in some countries these things are ready, so they don’t need to prepare stadiums and some projects for this event.
Since Ordi said they are ready
But they were afraid of this point.
Captain Ali, you are a great athlete. I expected this to be a very important achievement for the athletes.
I expect that it will enter the arena of politics, health and economics.
Just Christians
What does quantum mean for this achievement
Of course, it’s a great achievement, especially for us Kuwaitis. You’ve even seen the joy of non-Kuwaitis.
Insha'Allah Ali will tell me so at the announcement
And God, I was going out of the exercise and we were listening to it on the radio
We used to wait for him and I was with one of my friends
We are driving in the car and we have the radio on.
The first they announced on Qatar and
We all screamed, we were two, and of course we were idiots opening the door.
My friend came out of the hole
Shouting and the whole world is watching our work, danger and march in our souls
We made a track from the beginning
Alhamdulillah it was not a very special day, I expected and all channels probably focused on this event
Lana, you are definitely present in this topic
And especially the private sports channels
How did they celebrate this topic and what was their reaction
There were media from many channels in the world
The main teacher has become very clear on the known map of Qatar
Of course, Ali, too, means the presence of the player in the team is a very important job
And I expect that this is a big responsibility on his shoulders
What is your opinion on this point specifically
Okay, Captain Ali, what are the characteristics that this player who will join the national team should have?
Now in more than one sports event on the way
And we mean that now we have to breed a strong generation
He means he has basic rules and thoughtful football techniques
What are the rules and basic requirements that must be met in this player?
I think professionalism includes everything
شهادة في التمارين المواظبه على التمارين الانضباط
Hi, all of these are basic things to help the player put everything he has in the F matches or in the exercises
Each stage has its own meaning, so don’t say it has a special stamp.
She has so many moans and feelings
From different programs, variety to sports, where, where is the most beautiful in your opinion, where, where do you feel more like yourself?
God, it’s beautiful
You make me really want to take care of myself, you know? I know that I can keep myself in shape through sports, and that's the most important thing.
Then there is football, the public's beloved, everyone follows it, whether you like it or not, when you miss the field, you will love it
What confines the media to one side of us
It puts you in a certain side.
It’s not a must but football
Either sports, medicine or sports are nice
Also, in many important jobs, we don’t like to talk about it.
I didn't like it that you came back like that, so that you could reach 2022.
I didn’t wish for this job
Of course, we all wish for this, especially since the World Cup is now any player
If only one person is watching the World Cup, he will be happy and joyful. Why not play in the World Cup?
I hope they will live up to the expectations, God willing. This is their chance, God willing.
What is the word you want to say to a professional player from the bottom of your heart?
Half a year and we loved that you were with us
God, just like the current one, means permission
I returned to the championships after an absence of ten years from the Gulf Cup championship
You were definitely meaning it, ماشالله, a beautiful stamp from Qatar TV and nice memories
Masha'Allah, meaning Qatar TV has now become like a university graduating a large group of media professionals
Our team is a strong team, God willing, it will reap many different awards
Let’s talk about his work with the AM Aissala Club mission
What's up there, how are you there, I hope you are fine.
Surely, God is All-sufficient, honestly. Really?
Of course, yesterday, he was with us in the studio and we talked a lot about the players
I expect that some of the young people who are watching us still think that you are one of them
‏ Wanted
means a natural picture in the professional league of transfer of players
I had my chance in reality, as for appearance or reality.
I have the power to take Asia Cup place with the team, Alhamdulillah
And God's is well with the team
Sport topic how can we make it a social affair
And not Qatar, how is it possible to introduce sports among women, children, youth
Connects them together, means everything is complementary to sports
Women have no role in different sports
A sporting awareness is now spreading among us, from the young to the old in this society.
It's been almost a year until we reach or make ten years until we reach this occasion, I expect that it is enough time.
Because new generations keep coming up with new ideas
A generation is passing by and growing older, but a generation after them needs to be educated about sports from a young age.
We have Aspire, the Aspire Tower, which is a very big building, a foundation.
Ali and Number One for the new generation of sports
We just need to put our mind to it and get going.
They love football in particular
How can I get the audience to communicate throughout all the different matches between clubs
God, the honesty, it's a problem in the Qatari league, which is a lack of fans
But the problem is this attendance, meaning that the Qatari Union has not yet found a solution to attract the crowds
What is the style that we should attract them to follow these matches
It depends on the person himself, some of them don’t like to attend the stadium
Media plays a major role in the popular abstention
And now they have a current system of ticket or point accumulation system where points are collected.
Lala, he means the union has a plan with several steps to attract the masses.
Some clubs have ways like Al-Rayyan to attract the masses. Of course, Al-Rayyan is rich, so it doesn’t need fans.
Some clubs need that some of the club's administrations do activities and events
The right of the public The right of the public but I think these are the means that are available
Alayba means the new generation
Their love for their work is their faith in their abilities, and just like the sea, it is not only the material support that is very beneficial, but also the moral support.
We are definitely grateful for this good meeting, ماشالله
‏ We wanted to take your last words on the occasion of this wonderful victory, of course, Qatar winning the 2022 World Cup. Please start.
I assure you that Qatar did not insist. On the contrary, it kept its word and always fulfilled its promises.
God willing, Captain Ali, the last word I would like to say in this meeting
And I say to them, congratulations and God willing to the Imam God willing
Thank you, Captain and player Ali Qassem, and we wish you all the best, God willing, in your sports career and also in your life. God bless you, my lord.
And left us to love sports more and more
The subject of the episode is young talents
Some young people think that these songs are a recent phenomenon, but they have a long and very deep history
A group of young people sing Arabic or English words
Today we will follow up on this topic with a group of rap fans
We will get to know them very well through our meeting with them on air.
Hello and welcome our viewers wherever you are
Years ago, a new kind of singing spread in the Arab and Gulf scene
Coming from the West and America specifically, it is rap music.
And before delving into the subject of rap singing
There is a fear in using any word without any reserve.
Can anyone rap?
Regarding writing the lyrics of the songs
Almost all rap singers write their own lyrics
In general, all these details are very important, and we will get to know them through two people who are very active in this field.
They made a good team
‏Welcome to Yousif Al-Naeymi and Salman Abdullah Yousif, good morning
Hello Salman, good morning
Good morning, hello
I am very happy to find you with us through, of course, this program
And also of course through the rap singing
What's it to you, يوسف
We saw that rap art didn’t exist in طر
The sweetest bitch
In the voice of the citizen
In it is the cheerful, the sad, and what means political topics
Yes, I am the first rapper
And these songs I long for are an art, like how visual art draws a painting, and the poet writes a poem.
The singer can sing, the musician can play on any instrument
You can feel the acceptance of this kind of songs by the Qatari and the Gulf societies
Twenty-ten
You feel like people are starting to love to own rap albums
different ages
And there are families and there are people who hear more than they speak
‏ So it was like a website
‏ And how many of you are in this band still?
That means everybody can say words and write poetry and do it in a rap style
The rapper is like what you say, you can say that whoever sings is himself.
It is he who plays the music sometimes and he who invents the words
Oh, okay
Listen to it, and by God, I recorded this song
Okay now all these songs that you produced, from Salman, from you, from anyone from the same band
Did you think that it would be available on a certain CD sold in the market
But you know that when you are a character, it means I go and make a boom and put it in the market, this is difficult, a business record and procedures, means
Well, why didn’t you think that you are twenty-five in number, meaning that one hand cannot clap.
You have 25 hands, God bless you, you are all young men and brothers.
Do you know CD, this CD you can promote about it through more than one website
Do you have Facebook, do you have YouTube, you also have it through local newspapers
There are thirty songs, I think.
Registration is not at the same time
It was a little cloudy but it was quite clear.
The quality is a bit weak but it's not the same as now but clear
And it is about 50 CDs
It means there is something I can’t say what it is because maybe some young people know this art for ten years
I'm not registered and I expect the distribution in this period to be different
And especially that there is a large collection of music, a large collection of techno music now
These are the young people or these are the artists who produce a large number of beautiful songs
Let’s also talk about the parties you participated in
And God, see the party that means in Doha, we participated in one party
Of course, Al-Sadd Club organized it for us, they didn’t come with us
Startle the audience
We see something that we did not expect the number
What surprised us is that families are more...
Families more than young people
From to and organizing means awesomeness
We were a bit confused, it was the first time in Doha
It means we did not expect any interest
But the audience interaction was amazing
And it was a long time for the songs to fade
Okay, let’s listen to something or the words of one of the songs that you made, for example, and that came out to the public and was well received by young people in particular
For example, let’s hear some of the words so that they are also shown to the viewer.
And we can hear it on the air
‏ Please, have a seat
Stay safe
The problem is that the words are a bit too long
Let’s hear it
My mother
‏ With us now is the Doha Morning Show
Sometimes you wake up and you’re in a good mood.
Sلمان is like a mountain, he has been in the rap scene for five years
Even if he doesn’t accept, he’s poor.
I brought a lot of people to their senses
I need to cook some words
Okay, the songs you sang, for example, give me a sentence from one of the sentences you said, for example
He said that not all songs are random, it’s just what he said now, what they call free style in English
means the same weight
But when we sing a song, I mean, I write the lyrics together
Thank you, let’s continue.
We appreciate that you say good morning to my country, good morning to Qatar with the Doha Morning show
Stay tuned, we’re going live to the viewers now
They will see one one two one they will see a little bit of arts
We have the Doha Morning Show with us
Of course, the beautiful song you saw
I’m now insisting that young people should be present on the internet and everywhere
Hello, when did you record it
She was a joint stock company
Everyone has a right to himself
I feel that يوسف can’t accept my words a little or that he can’t take it or he can’t walk it
Everyone takes words
We are sure, I mean, I expect that every artist, every painter, every poet is always
It can also be written in love of sports
In Love of the Fatherland Itself
Surely you participated in the national day through the march
Through beautiful songs, because you are young Qatari, you are also represented, meaning Qatar
Doha is getting ready to host the Asian Cup and there is a big parade on the Corniche
To receive this event
And we are going to transfer to you these clips for the reception of course
Doha welcomes the Asian Cup
From Doha airport to now
And I will follow these clips live
For the sake of the future, we have the same audience and our children, the students, are the same.
I arrived at Doha's airport early in the morning and completed
Preparations for Hosting the Big Continental Event
We’ll be back with our guests, يوسف and سلمان, who are brightening the studio.
Delusion of the Arab, Gulf, Qatari rap group
We appreciate you saying that.
And Allah is... meaning we are currently...
I’m organizing a party but it’s not confirmed yet
But now you are working on a specific party and it will be announced, God willing, by يوسف
Inshallah, just means it’s not sure, means it’s still in the beginning of the journey
The beginning of the journey We wish you all the best and make sure that our program will, God willing, be your supporter, God willing, with all our hearts
It also means Salman, where do you meet, all of you, as young people, twenty-five people
Where is the meeting and how do you put ideas how do you write them with each other
Surely there should be some joint songs
It’s not necessary that for example one person, Salman or يوسف or anyone of them sings a whole song
There should be some harmony between you, where do you meet, when do you meet?
God, it’s hard to gather 24 people all at once.
Start talking to Youssef and to so and so and talk to them so that today we can meet somewhere
So I can see the idea of the song and the lyrics
And and in his second way
Register the ones that are due
Be deaf to him while he finishes
This one will be for you, Joseph will score and return, return, he will kick it to me again.
See the experiences that are available outside
You take, that is, you acquire some CDs of great artists
Take a little bit of experience from them, meaning some of the techniques
Hi, sure, we always mean
Artists who have been in this field for years or have experience and status in this field
You hear them, you see their methods, their ways, you try to do a style, you don’t imitate it.
It means if I do the same style, same tone of voice, same level of words
I'm just copying myself, I'm not doing anything new, I'm doing something that's just me.
It means we need to rely on them a bit.
Yes, I also expect there to be a large group of young people from the Gulf in the F1 Gulf itself
In a primitive way we follow this report together and benefit from it. Also we enjoy and see some of this report.
The mystery still surrounds that talent that some people have
Using very primitive means
Abu Ibrahim Abdullah Al-Dail
which is located away from the Saudi capital Riyadh
One hundred and fifty kilos
He has great ability and wide experience
In the detection of the superficial groundwater
And in depths beyond a hundred meters
You know that digging wells is expensive
But with the expert, he can determine the right place to dig the well.
Of course, the way to discover or
‏ Locating water
She has been since ancient times
They were our ancient fathers and grandfathers
They use expertise to pinpoint the locations of the wells
‏ to dig
Abu Ibrahim’s means of discovering water
Not modern devices
Or an analysis of the soil in scientific laboratories
He only depends on God’s providence in his work.
And its channels are under the earth
It is either a pomegranate stick
A branch of pomegranate or a branch of fig
Now we are practically applying the process of water ways detection
Now you start to return to stand this is the end of the stream
Come back again
Come back, come back
It returns, returns now, if from here we return we will put a mark.
And here the watercourse ends
It requires a lot of experience and a lot of patience
So that the explorer can reach the sensitivity of the motion sensor
I went to more than one area.
means 95% success
Of course, this is the way and the way to use copper tubes
And of course, there is no accurate scientific explanation
For this way
What is surprising is the success rate of those who practice this primitive profession
It exceeds 95 percent
In the detection of the locations of the superficial groundwater
سبحان الله علم الانسان ما لم يعلم. This is a report, of course, which we have taken, of course, from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
They made a special unit and they have more than one CD
It means whether they are online or some of them on the phone
In the Gulf States, there are sometimes competitions between Qatar and Bahrain, between Qatar and Kuwait, between Qatar and
Can you download a stronger song about a stronger subject?
About a problem about about means etc. a lot of topics
Either follow it or I’ll be like my role model, meaning I’ll be like there is nothing
God willing
At the same time, we should also take so and so.
It also means a large collection of songs
We tried our best to spread it
See you in another period, let’s keep in touch like this
‏ Even we know what the news is first of all for this band
But I insist on the name of the band
Qatari rappers
We will return again and our guests will be present and we will return to the Corniche and the beautiful atmosphere
We are definitely with you live through the live link that we are transferring to our viewers
Wherever you are on the Corniche and the reception of the Asian Cup
What is certain is that we are proud of them and we are proud of the different arts
It treats many psychological social problems of the youth.
But there are two in the studio
Sure, they will finish the twenty-fourth
Welcome again to Abu Yousif and Salman, may God bless you again
Stop the subscription
We are trying to reach the company but we don’t know where it is, no one answers us.
I need to develop myself, at least the one who is outside.
Facebook YouTube
means sites like this
In the name of the band
We received the goods, we will pick them up all along.
Behave like we saw with some, God bless you, you did this work
You work on these songs and put them on a series of pictures, pictures of you, personally.
He and they uploaded it on YouTube, they uploaded it on websites that may have videos that one can follow
And God, we had come down before
And in the songs of Aid means
The obstacles you are going through, if there is no place, you need a company to adopt you
You don’t really need a place to bring you together as a band.
What are your wishes so that you really wish to achieve and reach the high level you wish for
That means, we’re done with it
Do you tell us, God, we are counting for you, we are arranging for you, we are downloading for you the owl
Icon means something means something official
It means it’s a five year period now
It just means hobby.
Yes, let’s share with each other, let’s share in programs, let’s share in series
I wish that I develop into
If he means something, he supports us, he’s with us all the way
Yes, and also a prophet, we also know your wishes. Salman’s wishes are not the same as Joseph’s. What can you say?
The only wish is the video clip
God willing, we wish you all the best, God willing, through this team
Al-Tyba and we hope that, God willing, your songs will always be present in the Arab world in the world
And indeed, this is a high art, an art that is heard very much
And there are messages like what you mentioned
May God give you strength always and we wish you all the best, God willing.
Please give my regards to the whole group and wish me success, God willing
We will conclude this meeting with the song they made for the program
With you now, K.D. and DJ Mr. Bubu on the Doha Morning Show
Good morning, good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This is Mr. Bubu and this is his cat, One Hot To Brew.
We appreciate that you say good morning to my country, good morning to Qatar with the Doha Morning program
Stay tuned, we’re going live to the viewers now
And don’t forget the program starts at 9:30 in the morning, meaning that every one is sitting in front of the television.
They see one one two one they show a little bit of art
We have the Doha Morning Show with us
We have with us in the preparation Hassan Naama and we have with us in the presentation شيما الحمادي
With us in the directing, Nasser Al-Maliki, episode rappers Qatar for sure
It means again and again and can be used at home
In this trolley or shopping cart
Is it the case that everyone who shops at the F F L supermarket or elsewhere
What goods do you put in the F car, whatever you want to buy
If you have a bigger screen, you will see the components of this product.
Here is also an idea that was great and feasible
It just means that the Barakot housing development work will be done in the carriage and this commodity will be revealed
And giving the buyer makes it easier for him the subject of purchase
So he takes the whole details on a special screen for him
I expect it to be like that in a healthier awareness
When he is with you in the same carriage
More ingredients
And what are the dangers of her appearance as well
Do you have all the details in it, meaning
He is ambitious, for example, he had a number of projects, four or five.
Deals with traffic problems
Traffic jams and other parking problems are being addressed. It was also creative and very nice.
What God wills, also the Cultural Center for Childhood
Let’s talk, Professor Abdullah, about the different activities we will see, God willing, in the coming days
Yes, there are surprises, of course, but I just skimmed over it.
May ideas if you like to mention them from some of the projects that are exposed or
This, for example, is the main idea of the smart or creative idea of moving under the earth
Every person who leaves his house has a means
They gather at a certain point.
These are of course all the pictures that the audience is watching, I expect that they will enjoy them
Children’s Creativity
Exactly, yes, this is like the same cash machine
For example, for women, I have a card
Enter the card, I mean, I need a black t-shirt
This, for example, is now in some stores or, for example, I have some things missing at home, like a key I don’t know what
What I lost for example are the office keys, the
Of course, our main goal is to achieve His Highness Sheikh Moza's vision
The Highness Prince's Palace
It is very important in project design
Also selected from 300 children
And also the promising preachers in Ramadan
Yes, she presented the closing ceremony. She is a broadcaster.
We really like to open our hearts and doors to all the children who want to present their programs
And Then They Take Off
And supporting this and their presence is also our top priority.
These projects and programs serve this main idea
With the diversity and variety of children’s skills
To Self-Development
Okay, do you cooperate like that with some of the different youth clubs in Qatar
And there are also scientific institutes in Qatar
We of course build all our programs on partnerships
All our programs are specialized partnerships
With a set also of community service institutions specialized in developing these skills
It is in partnership with all interested institutions in the field
The Photgraphic Society
The Center of Creativity of the Girl, the General Secretariat of the Council of Ministers also played a very big role
Yes, he played a big role in explaining the vision of Qatar
Training Children on It
Engaging and encouraging children, all of our programs are built on institutional partnerships
According to the specialization of these projects and institutions
What’s wrong with you?
Of course, our presence in Katara has given us a strong boost and a lot of support.
And the fastest shaped
Now, of course, there are several projects in partnership with Katara that are currently being prepared for launch, God willing, within the next two months.
Of course, there is cooperation in many programs
Especially the ones related to reading
President of the Supreme Council for Family Affairs
We are going on with it now, especially since we are in the preparation time
And building a promising future for all children, future generations and the coming youth, God willing
The word I want to say to the guardians and the young people who follow us and the children who want to be present through the center
What we are giving now
‏ Our children’s ideas are not to be belittled or underestimated
We must pay attention to it no matter what these ideas are.
If someone is really interested in this idea, he will develop this idea. At the very least, he will develop the child’s love for thinking.
It is very important that I take care of my interest
I communicate with him spiritually, I communicate with him now. Our biggest problem is that most fathers
He is supported by him
Encourage him, urge fathers and educators
They give more attention to their imagination. Children of today are our future, they are the original source of this future.
We really lived while walking around this exhibition between their projects
I used to live in a dream
means in a dream, ideas of very wide, very broad imagination
And now the dream is definitely reality. There are many dreams that have come true and become reality.
And praise be to God, we wish success, God willing, for our children who were present
Our hope is in you, God willing.
With His permission
of different ages and genders
I have reached 70 projects
Considered pioneering and new projects to be implemented
To talk more about this exhibition
National and also about the cultural center for children
Professor Abdullah, also, at the beginning, that is, tell us briefly about the exhibition
What does it include, which brings together a lot, certainly many events. What can we say about this exhibition in brief?
So it was a new pattern in expression, children’s expression of their love, loyalty and belonging to the country.
Of course, it came under the patronage of the Minister of Education and Higher Education
In a round of exhibitions, this exhibition came
It starts to grow with him until it reaches twenty thirty.
Of course, we started training children to see 20/30 with its five axes
Human development, economic development, sustainable development and environmental development
He knows now, where Qatar will be in twenty or thirty years, where will it reach?
Then he starts thinking about how his way of thinking
How to be creative and come up with creative ideas
I expect so, that means he has time, God bless him, he has time.
But when we give it so many specific symbols and help
I expect his thinking will grow even bigger and more.
Professor, you launched the exhibition under the slogan, what is its name, Dreams of Generations, Facts of Tomorrow
It is the slogan of the dreams of today’s generations
He will be part of tomorrow’s Qatar, the future of Qatar
We actually felt this while walking with the children when the child speaks, he says to the happiness of the minister.
I want you to open my project. I invite you to visit my project in twenty thirty.
A child thinks after twenty years
In it he expresses his love for the country and in it he expresses what he means he loves from the field
Sure, he has different activities, events, competitions
So one of them was the winner of the Stars of Science Award
And also the winners of the first prize for the Arab League University
Of course all the children
On the margins of the exhibition there were exhibitions, meaning there were different exhibitions with a specific schedule
To exhibit their projects that they have done, that is, during the exhibition
What God's will, a unique presence
The Science Stars
Some of the winning winners of the projects that participated in the exhibition
She also won one of the main awards
This is the forest or the reserve
Let’s also talk about the colored balls
And the colored one, of course, we were also part of the vision and children's dream of the future of Qatar
Also think of twenty-two twenty-two
How can a child contribute to a project with an original idea for twenty-two and twenty?
The main idea is that there should be a slide in the ball.
Color when judging
If it goes, for example, in any means, every one will watch the movements of the ball through
Or the movements of the field and what changes in it through this electronic slide
What is there in the ball
Of course, the ideas are creative, of course, the main idea may surprise many people.
And these projects
We always say we don’t get along with the children
At this stage of forming or developing these skills, they broaden their horizons
I gave them an idea of a way to express their love of the country through these projects
Giving them self-confidence that how to present their project to the audience and explain their idea
In the field of his interests in the field of what he loves, all of this is an achievement, an achievement for L for
And he supported me, and I appreciate that.
Now it is entering the development stages
With support from many officials, the committee, and I expect also from the public
The forest is not the second forest because this child
How do subscribers enter the channels? the pipes that visitors enter under the earth
A large protected forest
In it, the visitor sees animals, sorry, reptiles, under the earth.
And in Sensis on some animals and the ICIS research center means the state of animals
And in the marine environment and entering it in an also creative way
And the reason for her victory is also the imagination of the wide meaning in all its details
‏ This is of course the nature of its people to
Of course, who talks about a tourist city under under water
In whom does the city of the butterflies speak
About whom do you speak, forest, forest, above the earth
In whom speaks about many tourist ideas
means exciting
Maybe this is what children’s minds are like now in this time, maybe two thirty thousand and fifty.
And in the future, maybe these things will happen.
means in three projects
The Scientific Club adopted these projects, I need them now, I want to work on them
A project, for example, that is the LLL of the air-conditioners
We will see the Arab newspaper now
And the news says that Qatar University celebrates the graduation
In the presence of His Excellency Mr. Saad Bin Ibrahim Al-Mahmoud
Minister of Education and Higher Education Secretary-General of the Supreme Council of Education
Dr. Shikhah بنت عبدالله Al-Musnad, President of the University
A good achievement is certainly recorded for the beautiful university
The society of Qatar is also the society of Calligraphy
And also these good news that we are reading about our students
An educational achievement, God willing, and we wish Him success, God willing, in all specializations, God willing
He is considered one of the young faces coming strongly into the Qatari drama scene
And how long also categories and colored threads
And the artist Abdel الحميد الشرشني is considered among the artists who formed themselves
If Only He Were Convincing
It would not have been chosen to be present in the works being implemented in Qatar
Currently, artist Abdel الحميد الشرشني is participating in the series "Feelings of a Killer" and "Classifications, Part 2".
We are pleased to have you as our guest this morning
To talk to him about his participation in these two important works and about his experience in general
Hello and welcome, have a nice day
Welcome to the program of Sabah Doha for the first time. I meet you for the first time and for the first time you are present with us in Sabah Doha.
And the people who are tired of the program
And you are Lisa's sister
Welcome to you, let us start the conversation before it is too late
Oh my God, let’s see
I am a responsible and administrative man.
Enforce the laws
All I can tell you
Bring the shawl
Then listen, why are you coming to me?
See if anyone agrees with you that you don’t return the dishdasha
And of course I had another question to start with, but since we saw this episode of the series "Sorts" part 1
Indicating that Khaled ibn al-Waleed
Some historians attribute the great poet Al-Mutanabbi to the city of Marat.
Many things and information related to this city in Saudi Arabia
And we continue with this beautiful report by colleague Abdulrahman Murshd
We follow with some
It is certainly a testimony of someone who does not know flattery or favoritism.
And to emphasize its authenticity, this city or that
And as much as we see its effects and hear what has been said about it by its narrators and poets
Their old and new are a rich record to be added to the city’s record
And Madinah Al-Murat is one of the cities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
It is an old country with a history that dates back to the pre-Islamic era.
Historians differ in the reason for its naming
Some attribute them to Al-Kanda’i, the well-known poet Al-Mughira ibn Shu’ba.
And the one who is attributed with the pond
‏ The date of its establishment is not known
The Pre-Islamic Period
‏ Moreover, the most famous thing in the city of Marat is Jebel Kmit, which has been used as an example.
Because it is in the city and attached to it
Al-Jaf, these are also archaeological sites
Many and since this landmark is a tourist landmark in Saudi Arabia
My mother-in-law made a great effort to do
A park above this mountain
And sessions for the parents and all the inhabitants of the Kingdom
It was named after the great companion Khalid ibn al-Waleed, may God be pleased with him.
To fight the apostates and the liar Musaylimah
From its effects also Ghadir Komit
It is a place for collecting flood and keeps water for a long time
It was one of the most important water sources in the past
And one of its effects is also the Awadi House for heritage
The old city of Medina, which dates back to pre-Islamic times
She is famous for her poets who inspired their poetry
With its beauty, its monuments and its famous Mount Kmit
Abdulrahman Al-Murshid in the program Sabah Doha
Murtah City, north of Riyadh
‏ Back again to our dear guests
I wish we could inform the viewers about these methods and means
As I said before, we have a very special infrastructure
We open a page for him, register him and create a special file for him on our system
Email of his/her guardian
This is the extent to which the focus of writing speed, the speed of gluing, and the overall distraction.
The guardian has full authority to mislead
Good, this tampering will be added to the student’s file
On his son's file via the Internet
And he sees how his son is progressing
and he sees his grades and also his attention with the teachers
‏ until we really enjoy the intelligence of this beautiful child
We took most of the children who were in the center and we send them our best regards
I entered this center with Professor Ta'i'a who is present through this center
And we get to know her intelligence and the level she has reached, of course, from her entrance to this center
Of course, the Sunnah
It focuses on work and after Ramadan
But that of course would be unfair to the work of others at the expense of other works always
And there are people who don’t watch TV anymore
He keeps watching TV and makes people spend the month of worship with the TV
Slow down, slow down, slow down, series. Slow down, let it be done in two years, it’s better.
Of course
God willing, I will be accepted in Ramadan
But God willing, I will send you all my regards
And God willing
And also in the plays
From the art of drama to the art of fashion
A fashion show was held in the Katara Cultural Village
We will definitely continue with you with all love and honesty
And develops children’s abilities and skills more
Except for the different schools that exist in this generous country
We have a definite model, we talked with our guests who were with us
Now with us is Mr. Ibrahim Hussein Abdul-Salam, welcome and good morning.
How are you, Amnia?
Praise be to God
Wait your turn
‏ Professor Ibrahim, at the beginning let’s get to know what materials are being presented through this center
And as an example of this, Aunt Amnia
God also gave her the style or the way that Mrs. Nasma talked about
I feel that there is a difference in his mind.
You feel that these skills and these methods
It was changing in relation to his skills, in relation to his mind, even his educational level was going to change
Scientific methods
Among them, I first do a global test called the TONI test for the child before starting anything else in my program
I want to start the second part of the test I just did
We can measure the level or the level of difference of the student through it
‏ Will do now a test or quick questions in math
Amani will calculate and respond through the air all along
Of course, Amniya has no idea at all about these questions
We are not concerned with this subject
Of course I had another question as a start
We ask you to participate this year in the second edition
What is your share, tell us about it
Of course, after we presented the series of one classification
Of course, thanks to God, God guided me in several roles
Professor Ghanem
Of course, distribute roles with the director Ashraf Shakhath and with the great professor
Of course, an opportunity from Tar for artistic production
Frankly speaking, for the youth
Professor Ghamm, of course, nominated me for something
Of course, every episode is different
I will make characters in several episodes
And the opposite is a nice experience, of course, there are such things in work.
A monument of Kuwait's pyramids, Mr. Saad Al-Faraj
We have artists from Bahrain, Abdullah, Malik, Ali Al-Gheer
Like Ali Mirza, we have a saying
With you is also a group of young men, Abdullah Adham
Any more young men like Abdullah Al-Asem?
This is what we do every year, we work two jobs a year
Maybe that's why I asked you if you were born in 1979
But I didn’t know that it would happen or your dream in art
Alhamdulillah for everything
You studied art or what?
It’s not a talent I took.
I took art as a talent, of course, the artist Abdul Aziz Jassem, of course.
Some artists consider me a person like their son
Whatever I have, I’ll talk to him about it.
Of course, we are with all series
We got up and worked hard, and praise be to God.
Now, if it wasn't for Tara, a big thank you is in order for Professor Abdulrahman Al-Sulti, a very big thank you is in order for Professor Abdulrahman.
If you compare us to Kuwait, in Kuwait every year from 12 to 24 new representatives are elected.
In their possession
Certainly, thank you very much, you are giving me a chance
But let’s just say
We are talking about the series “Sani Ta’saneef”, we talked and got an idea about it
The Killer Feeling
And the foot also a man's foot
With us is a model, Dr. Abdul Aziz Al-Mayouf Al-Tamimi
Until this process is done live
And let's see how we can treat the character, for example, first of all let me become Professor Sabah Abdullah, may God bless him
‏ Welcome to you, peace and God’s mercy be upon you
If we start with you, sir, please
God willing
In the name of God, of course
We shake hands
We see the nerves
It is as if it is a drawing or a message from God, may He be exalted, showing all the members of your body.
From the inside, what are the problems
Sometimes I get dizzy
Headache and dizziness
Relax, relax, calm down, it’s quiet. Yes.
So, Mr. Abdul Aziz, you will discover his specific work through his hand that he is suffering from a specific disease
The one on the left has a simple middle ear infection.
In the good, what does it mean, Professor Abdul Aziz?
You have a problem with your ear
Who created me when I was small
Here I feel the pain more.
the nasal cavities
S al-m f al-khams ayeek sadaad huna
I have a headache here
He has a problem with his nasal cavities.
Is it causing him a headache between the eyes
Weight gain without eating
His thyroid is a bit tired, you have laziness and apathy, always heavy in the body
Too much sleep
How many times I sleep or my body is lazy, I always feel it is heavy
Inflammation of the tonsils
Look, do you notice the tremor?
He is stressed and, of course, you will never walk barefoot again, maybe the last time.
The brother from Tunisia
Masha’Allah, you told us about His presence and
Can this massage also be used for children?
The pain of a mother is right, God, by the size of the child's belly
‏Where do our children usually sleep?
When you lift him, he doesn’t like it. People think that he likes being lifted because he has gas in his stomach, may God protect us.
As soon as the mother explains to her child like this, spread the thumb.
An icon in the child's belly
The hands are meeting the icon of the child
Let's see, so every mother can learn this trick
It seems like you are pressing like this: right, left, right, left.
This is about a child and about the child, how beautiful.
Okay, as for discoveries, you have specific discoveries, especially for women
Like we said, in every house 90% are like that, God protect them from women
First thing and first warning, equal ceramic and earth
When we walk barefoot on the ceramic floor, of course, our problem is what to hold on to, we always walk barefoot, it’s possible, but only on even surfaces, this is dangerous
Walk barefoot or the proof that the coming of ceramic in the houses increased health problems
But the earth is cold and equal
When Fursh Khan had problems, they complained of asthma
It increased more.
She makes sure to focus on walking barefoot on the heel
This is the old area of the heel that is from the back of the heel
From here this foot is now below the heel
This is the first discovery, the second is on its way to facilitating childbirth
Just focus a little
In the seventh or ninth month
As soon as you enter the city of birth, generally
‏ It means that if she goes in the eighth, the eighth is dangerous and the most dangerous thing is that she goes barefoot
Pregnant teen walks barefoot
If you enter at the time of birth
I seek refuge with God from the accursed devil. The date palm sways to you, and its fruit falls to you fresh and tender.
We know that the provision for Mary was going to come to her.
See, even scholars in the field discussed it and said why did the interpretation of Ibn Katheer change
I am not I give you the idea that God put in this science and inspired me with it
Shake to you the trunk of the palm when the palm shook, of course how are you
Sharp like a needle, like pins or nails
When the palm tree shook, it gave orders to the wombs that were once the heaviest wombs in the middle.
The womb gave us orders to facilitate childbirth, modify the fetus
The head of the fetus is high or something is adjusted along and comes out normally
سبحان الله, how many benefits this fruit has
Hold on to your hand and guide it
Some take it as a habit, and some know that it is science.
Faihafon ayqulun lak wa ma ta3tqein fihem
Yes, Professor Abdul-Aziz, well, ماشالله, your discoveries are important
But I just wanted to know the last question, meaning time passes so fast, ماشالله
‏ One wants to communicate with you, any one who wants to communicate with you, a specific email, are you from
The mobile phone is there in the control room, anyone who wants to contact Mr. Abdul Aziz can call us after the program
Of course, here are the numbers of the Qatar television so that they can contact us and take this number
I was created only to serve people
If we believe this belief, God will bless you in your work and make people
Feel guilty like people do and do everything, that is, what comes to your mind, a normal person.
But we aspire to more good than
Always think of the best
Our viewers, God willing, I hope you also enjoyed this segment, which is about reflexology and hand massages
Also via foot
We saw a live example on air of how the person with us discovered what illnesses he had.
And what should I suffer if we ask you to inform us and if you want to communicate with him, he can also read about him on the Internet
How can it be applied in the coming days and years if it will include more schools?
Good morning
How can this experience
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
‏The problem of obesity in the Gulf countries has become a big problem
We were afraid that Qatar is the fifth state with them
And this program means that it was really the first lady in New York
She came to Doha and they had a program for her
‏ They offered it to us and we accepted it, it’s fine
It means our students with New York students with Spanish students with English students
So we hollowed out our brothers, our students in Qatar, how are their levels compared to the rest of the world, and that's what we want in the future
Because we encourage eating fruits among students
He stops playing sports
Of course, in the fifth week, your family meal with the family
Of course, this stone kills two birds.
Of course, in week 6 he will say what he learned from this experience. We are fine, thank God, in conclusion.
We are happy in the student.
They were three independent boys' schools, Abu عبيدة
Independent daughters of Rقية
Our morale is high
It means the family is aware, their brothers got excited at home, they started eating this food like them, meaning
It became a multiple relationship between the students and this teacher, and this teacher even brought this relationship to his family.
He goes around saying that I’m like that or that they taught me that.
The training staff or the one who was giving this information to the students
How did you choose it? How did you communicate with the students through whom?
Yes, they are very good to us, God bless them, they made us happy.
And our brothers at the diet center taught them to eat healthy food
‏ And learn with sister Aasha’a Al Tamimi the manners, the etiquette, the eating
How do they arrange that, how do they eat, how do they arrange priorities
To teach cooking or sports or to raise awareness of the benefits of healthy food
It was in the form of separate lessons and not a curriculum or
How to deliver these ideas to the students
In various ways, some of which were inside the school
We did at the beginning of the program a day in Aspire Zone where we gathered all the students, boys and girls
Because this is not a matter of a specific person, it concerns us all, because these are our sons
How did you students work at the beginning with
That means you understood that the results were satisfactory
But does three schools or specific classes in these schools suffice?
Now, of course, we are the first experience in the world, when things start, they don’t start on a large scale.
It starts on a reasonable scale with all the attributes sons, daughters, independent, private
So that it is in accordance with, for example, our culture with our environment with the conditions of families. Families, for example, accept things for their children, they do not accept things.
‏ Fibonacci actually means they participate in it and it is really important
A student at the age of eleven or thirteen is the right age to know about his health
It's a struggle that many people want to be weak, but they imagine that it's impossible.
Some heroes we see in the cinema are like that and their bodies are weak, this means it’s like a myth, isn’t it?
We talked in detail, but unfortunately there are still many weeks left before we can cover it.
It is possible that through the Doha Morning we can also remind them of it
And the fruits that contain it mean vitamin B, which you can get from fruits or vegetables
Man knows the benefits of fruits and knows that if he eats them, his health will start to improve, which gives him morale.
Hey in the fruit section they would go to the supermarket and choose their fruit.
‏ This is a dot, for example.
It means that they competed, each school excelled in its teachers with different ideas
The spirit of competition is the spirit of
We gave them the general picture and each one can be creative
The teachers who were training the students are not there and there is no special staff
We train them, we train them
But, like, the teachers were adding, for example, some schools like Abu عبيدة said on Saturday we will do it for the students' activities
The examples of the days outside of school are when they decided to adopt the school of Ruqaya, they said it was worth the effort.
We are going to have a healthy cooking day like daughters, we didn't force the boys to cook healthy food by themselves, because girls' work means they have more skills in this subject.
Of course, thanks to Rayan Water, which provided all the water to the schools for free. Rayan Water on this subject.
Of course, it means healthier water because he will need to cleanse his body from all these toxic materials that enter his body daily through water
This week we said the third
It means, he is the one, his body started moving
They can play football or basketball but he doesn’t know that I love sports.
It’s absolutely true. Some of them might want other games. Some of them might not want a team game.
How much live on air
Professor Mr. Abdul Aziz Al-Jaber, founder and director of the Qatari Association of Multiple Sclerosis Patients, welcome to you
And of course we try to focus on most important topics as much as possible
We liked to get to know our beloved viewers and to know what is the disease of multiple sclerosis
Because this name may also be a bit strange for us Please.
The number of women affected is more than the number of men
‏All currently available treatments are preventive in nature
The white thoughts that are supposed to protect us start fighting us
We fought by hitting the nerve cell
An easier one for the public is an electric wire.
Covered with a layer of lubricant to shake it off, hey, nylon layer
It generally leads to imbalance, double vision, and vision blurring, of course.
leads to problems in the digestive system the respiratory system
It leads to madness in its worst cases, it leads to quadriplegia or hemiplegia.
Of course, the treatments
The most important functions in the human body can be disrupted in a bad way
Or this disease is called neurotic.
Theories say it is a viral transfer
It is not contagious
And it is not passed on to children
Some consider it a disease according to the region
But the equator for example was far removed from this disease
Currently we have cases on the equator affected by this disease
‏So far there is no cure for this disease because its cause is unknown
Up to now, scientists are not able to find the reason for the disease in order to find a cure for it
The current process is a reverse process
They are trying to avoid the effect of the disease itself on the human body
They are trying to start from behind in a different meaning
And maybe we are a little afraid of this topic, which means we can say that maybe this disease comes suddenly
There is a certain category that feels this disease, meaning it is spreading in a certain age.
It was classified globally from twenty to forty years
Currently the international organization for the disease has reduced the age from twenty to fifteen years
Because he has been hitting the old falcon for forty years
But it does not cure man
Of course, we are open to alternative medicine and the medicine of the prophet.
Yes, through its association with the Qatari Association for MS Patients
‏What is the reason for this association?
It is really a big collection so I thought that it would be better to have a link to this subject.
Of course I’ll give you random numbers
In Kuwait, it is said that there are 25,000 cases
100 wounded
The rest of the Gulf States, the number of cases ranges from 100 to 300
I was diagnosed with it five years ago
My number was forty-six or forty-eight.
Are there some symptoms that show that a person really has this disease?
And we don't have confirmation that it is a virus, so we don't want to adopt a certain theory. This is the point.
The second point is how do I know if I am infected or not
This is very difficult
I lost Mr. Abdul Aziz by trying to find a certain point
