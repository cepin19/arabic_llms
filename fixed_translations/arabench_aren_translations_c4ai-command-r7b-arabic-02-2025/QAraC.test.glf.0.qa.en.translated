If you don’t want it, I do.
Hey Sultan, what are you still doing?
You are wasting a great opportunity, it is a sin to waste it.
Then I’m not a child on this subject, it’s my right to take and you actually have the right to take before me, I am
Sultan, for God's sake, don't bring us problems
Saleh, you shouldn't do that. I seek forgiveness from Allah.
On your honor, is there a brother who advises his brother what you just said?
You are hungry
I found a plate of rice and meat in front of you.
The Chinese have neither governor nor master nor boundary.
Saying the truth about yourself
Don’t put the Chinese dish in front of us again
Don’t be stubborn, Saleh
You missed the opportunity on us
No, no, don’t try, it’s impossible, it’s not me who does things like that.
The problem is that he is scared.
What the hell are you afraid of
This is a government project, everyone takes and sucks
This is a rule.
Now people who have nothing to do with the projects take
He is the chairman of the Big Project Committee.
What does it mean? He has the needle and thread
Third Millennium World Beach Project (Infrastructure Phase I)
The bull fell on him
This is where the extractor fan is
If he is taking
And what's that to you?
You have the right to take from their project
When his car was broken
Who else was supposed to reach the project site but me?
No, if it’s like that, it’s right.
Whoever gives you the right to petrol, give you your car four times and five times
Come on
Don’t be a fool and think highly of yourself
Reach out and touch
Your aunt's oven
Now they say to you, you are a millionaire
One-third of the Mablag is Legitimate
One third of it is commission
Whoever hits the popular band
They say you’re holding a party for the state
And buying an old clock
What did they do to them
We lined up
There is no use, my aunt.
God doesn’t guide him, inshallah
And he will eat with him
Last night I tried with him all night long
This is an opportunity
So that good prevails
And God's mercy will prevail, God willing
This is well known.
The prophet of the matter will be with us
Look outside
After that I would recommend
Just a quarter
A problem can stop us like a bone in the throat
The rial looked like it was going to fail
Stay with him today
Two hours in the morning
And he seemed to be convinced
We’ll meet him later.
We have to work on it properly, you and I.
Whoever cuts our bread
They started the meeting with their heads down.
My brother Ali, my brother عثمان
I am my mother.
Based on the fact that today is my first day at work
Come on
How can that not be?
Sure, but are you sure I’m taking it?
Now I’m just asking you
You are hungry and walking on the street
Eat or don’t eat
I am of the type of Akil
You don’t have to
Chinese table
We just started the first item on the meeting agenda.
If you have something
And if you are afraid
I don't know
I and you are part of the project
May Allah guide you, but you, Saleh
You can because this is the first time you participate as the head of a committee in a government project
And this is simple, I assure you.
Our share is going down
I am included in the project budget
How is my son
So that no one feels the story
We will put down the deposit for the amount
This amount has been sucked
by the LL project managers
What can be done
No, no, no, Saleh
Do you know the basics?
But it seems that you are a bit scared.
This is his right, of course
In the first and last
Everything is in our hands
I can’t find any beauty
What's wrong with you, by God the Most Merciful, this is what's wrong
My friend's new car is really cool
He says
The car of Rafjah is okay, Zin
In a prominent location
Except one who has money on his way
What else did you say to me or did I hear
Whoever bought the land and registered it in his name
Please
Now he wants money in his hand
Now he is attracting
Well, we are here
That’s it, okay?
What is the rush
He’s coming out of the East Gate
He wants to eat a bite
Don’t shake your head
Or your brother
Come here and sit, there’s nothing but good mood for you to come
He kept it all night long.
He got what he deserved, no matter who he was.
I made him agree.
The supposed
And God willing, you will not take a woman just once and that’s it
This project is the third millennium global beaches
Between Brackets: Infrastructure
He will return then they will start the second stage
And you continue with him
May God reward you, you didn’t do bad.
I wish you had just agreed.
And you are like everyone else
But there is nothing.
But, God willing, I convinced him.
We want a percentage
They all agree on that.
Until he said after he agreed
Apparently they are all coming to attend the project budget determination meeting
Whatever is theirs and they have to follow it
They are putting it to the test
Hurry up and deliver it so that it can be approved
Take your time
Who is this brother, do you know him?
This is the sister-in-law’s brother. He helped me yesterday.
This means
You have the doors, windows and everything related to the finishing
Sweet sweet
One is enough for you to finish
You are very strict with yourself
We don’t get anything
Let us give our soul a week to think.
And we’ll determine the amount we’ll take.
There are people waiting and want
Abdulaziz Adul's speech
One guy who really deserves a half a million
He will be calm this week.
And he determines the amount he wants.
They decided, thought and determined.
What’s up with you?
Do what you want
Don’t worry about them
What is she your friend, what are you, what is this?
I wish God would bring him back with us
What are you doing inside this project
This is not a government project
Salman your brother's name is Sultan
This is the house of our neighbors.
It will take us hours to get there before the car breaks down.
Register at your place
Abdullah's bond
Lala in three others
What should I do with him, I want to get rid of him
Just say it, mom, let’s go, our budget is over.
No, no, this is a lump sum.
And all that is around him
And poor, he has children
Anybody who has a Zaydite, let him have twenty-four fourths of an amah
And a quarter of Amie
All of them are back, Lazqi.
These are more than what you are going to distribute to them
It's back again
The good mother when mentioned
Yes, mother.
No, no, just this is the last one, dad.
No, dad, you want to go to Thailand to get treated.
Moment by moment, you will be cured
And you are so heavy like that
Just keep the first phase in brackets the infrastructure
Used wind
Add 3,000 to them.
Buy me some watches from Thailand, the ones with the quartz that glow like that
I have recorded it
My Imamate
Don’t tell my mother, I just wanted to make sure about the name
My love, I say to you, mother.
Big Chinese
But seriously, the budget needs to be determined, it can’t stay open like this
Bajar evacuated the meeting and everyone said the amount in their mind
Ava Alij
One Million OK
My love
Guys, guys, just a moment, give us a chance
The committee is now discussing the project’s budget. The money issue is over.
I will remain excessive.
We told you to be quiet about the scandal, you are sitting in the ministry’s yard
Oh, Ansar, don’t shame us
Ya ya haden wasal ash'andkum mشتمعين kolkum ahen
Anqula, we turned off the electricity, it's broken.
Pour us a cup of tea in the Ministry's yard
Oh God, oh God
Cut I heard
Damn, you were with them, how much did you reach in the budget?
I miss my brother
With the project we mean all of us, 50 million
This is just the first stage, 50 million only
The amount has been transferred
Here is Saleh
Ya Real, the keeper of Nasifah Salem
In general, eat well
Oh God, be careful, let’s work, all the beneficiaries are waiting for us, seriously.
It’s not a problem, but the most important thing is that we don’t want any discussions about the budget and that’s it.
And we will start implementing the project tomorrow
It serves a very large community.
This is God’s project, the third millennium world beaches
This is the first stage, God protect you.
Between Brackets: Infrastructure
This project is for the coming generations
Of course, on behalf of the program, I would like to congratulate and wish you success with the opening of the project, which I believe will take place tomorrow, God willing.
And the one that took 10 and a half years to work on
One and a half
Once again, in the name of the Future Tenders Program
This project
For Future Generations
May Allah preserve His gift of oil to us.
second, third and tenth stages
With the presence of a delegate
Welcome
They are so annoying, why do they keep calling us? When will the car come? Take us
Why are you doing this to me
Praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds. You grew up and you got senile.
We sat, we were roasted by the sun, we died from the heat
You, girl
But I don’t see anything
My only wish is the sea
Why did you do that?
Aiman told me that your sister, Manira, is here.
About my father’s land in the desert
I said, "Be fair, see who cut her and told her false news.
What is this land
But when you see a farm in the desert, you say, "This is my father's.
Then deal with these things
You have brothers
They work, invest in land, real estate and companies, ماشالله
Me and the head
Ava ya Eman
And then my sister
How does that mean you don’t know?
They will give it to me against their will
Hathilayn Akhwanj
And nothing is sweeter than honesty
Because money
We are the ones who will believe her and take her to the hospital
She has been in the courts with her brothers for 7 years now
Nineteen years, if not more.
No more
The brothers of Am Saleem are thieves
He came back and you said yesterday
My father, just build a mosque for me before I die
You don’t know
I don’t say that the Muslim Brotherhood is like that, God forbid
Now my father is dead for a year
Why are you asking now?
And she saw the farm
Later
He goes to see her every three months.
Saqur Aهدا خلنا انعرف شالسالفه
مب على كيفا
We changed, God's sister, they don't see the real one
The solution is with me
Where from?
And not even a little bit of money
Manira Shajov
And whoever hands you his heart
It became fifty thousand
I dared to ask about my father's land in the desert
I’m sure my right is more than that.
Every one lives in those villas
And their children in the best schools
Shagolaj ya Manireh
I won’t keep silent about my right
I’ll take my share
It is better to invest your money in the company, no I don’t want to.
All in the head
Compassion died in people's hearts
Don’t say that the Salafis will be better than my brothers
Goffeni ana
Twelve years
I am adjusting in these courts
And in the end
I didn’t take any right or wrong.
Why are they doing it like that?
That's why I say to you, mom, they will be fine.
Take them easy
And the billung tingle
Azain and why do courts take all these years
We are all 450
If we reach millions like the rest of the countries
God knows, mother, I didn’t think it would be ruled.
Jوفي انتي اخواني
I don’t want anything, mom, I swear to God
Oh my God, what should I say
I don’t say Qir, Allah is our refuge and the best of helpers against the wrongdoer.
God is our refuge and our help, in whom we trust.
You didn’t have a court date a week ago
Why, mom?
The judge said, "Write a memo.
And this is how it is, mom, from memo to memo
They invest millions, mom, and you look at it.
And just like I told you, Adabجين Abيدج and Aprilj
I won’t take him to task.
That's why I say if I were you
Shut up about what they give me
Because she is a woman
Your father’s allowed here
Raya'eel ask you
What does she mean, eh?
A few questions, like about her share and so on
Just get to know and get out.
If what the evidence
Unfasten your belt and exchange it
Abidalf Abrooh
Do you expect a waiver document for us?
Fifty-two is too old for her to work on a farm
You’re either smart or you’re crazy
Shally made her talk now
But greed
And Paradise is not my portion
My father left me something and I want to know if I can get it or not
Neither I nor he are defined
This is God’s will
Why are they torturing my father in his grave?
I expected my brothers to come out like that
This money is not worth it
She is forty, thirty years working.
I don't know how to deal with it, Nasser
lands, buildings and real estate are easy to know about
I wish I knew how much they earn
Even the company
You have the right to go and find out everything.
I am not them
How do I go back to them
It depends on how you feel.
And however you want it, I have the right to see everything
An agency without a concierge
Your sister will get a formal power of attorney
This allows him to see everything we have in the company through official power of attorney.
Saad Falcon
Oh how long his tongue is
Saquar Khalas
Bro Nasser
With your permission, I’ll take
At your service
God, you are in front of me
With your permission, God willing
Don’t let him catch us.
Sure, now if I went to complain
And he said that you are capable.
means let him do whatever he wants
In his hand is a formal document
We can’t prevent it officially
He has the right to see all the shit of everything
If the budget and accounts dry up
We give her 40,000 every three months
If the budget dries up and justice is scrutinized
Multiply 15 by 8
Divide her section into three
Thirty-two
Do you know what comes out
This is what we ask of our students
This is in addition to if the lands and projects are known
And how are we?
We are not afraid
Welcome, welcome, they don’t want this.
He will go and deal with her.
They give their sisters small amounts to live on
Married more than once
Her husband pays for her
I bet you with money
Oh, this is the right talk
At your service
He’s happy now
Even my office
My brother Rashid, it was supposed to be
At your service
File file
When I found out about her real heritage
Apart from villas and lands you don’t know about
They are seven.
Look, there are ten lands
Wahie ‘ala ‘amaha
The poor thing was shocked.
It’s a shame
Follow them
May God’s soul bless you, dad, don’t bring the court case to me.
The most precious thing for a human being
The coldest of the Al-Ghaazi
A minute’s text
And then he will say his usual word
Seven four two thousand and I don't know how many
Do they celebrate Eid, dad?
You're not supposed to move from the bedroom at all, mama.
God heal you, God willing
Lala, the house is your house, why are they beating it?
Nasour and my sister Monwar
After we caught him with the door and threw him out of the company
A round one for the one who was with me in school and passed by
One of them is called Abdullah
Oh, for crying out loud
F*ck off
It means he can affect them
God willing, he will be able to
I I I
Don’t Resort to the Courts
The courts see nothing but memos
Delays and killing of lawyers on the last day
Years passed
And the years go by
And you don’t take one single shekel from them
May God have mercy on Um Salime
She told me a day before she died
She told me to go to court.
Tell me about our court.
She died and did not take any of her inheritance.
She died and the case is still with the judge
How if we were like the second two countries
Hala Abdulla
Brother Abdullah
Years passed
This is my brother Saad
May God keep you safe.
The most important thing
Almaha and akhawa
My brother Rashid
You are like my brother
Don’t leave problems and money and
Do you have another topic to talk about other than my sister?
Please you.
Why silence him?
She is right
They are taking advantage of my father’s property
Yesterday my mom told you that your brother-in-law Sa’ad
And her father is a reporter in the ministry
It’s all from my father’s share
We have waited for all this
Let’s try this last attempt
You sent your companion, Abdullah, to them.
They disrespected him, they were rude to him and they threw him out
Convince the volunteer Abdulrahman Ashbaisa to join them
It’s good.
Inshallah, said Nasser.
An eye for an eye
Threaten them with the court
You forgot about the late Um Saleem and her Hajj from the courts
It is normal for the court to be against Um Salamah and her brothers
Just my brothers
They can be scared of people’s words
They can say it’s a shame to go to court what will people say about us
We thought that the bent spirit Abdul Rahman would do
May God keep you and bless you
Khutbah imah is
You don't have, grab the door
What do you say, son?
He says the truth
Go ahead, come on.
I’m going to the court tomorrow morning.
Why wait for tomorrow
Then it’s me who decides, not you.
Ashbiṣr means from now on forever
Hey brother Rashid
Take it as a word from me
You told me before
Scare them with the court
He is now begging me to postpone my trip.
Because they are really dry, my love
It is necessary that I go to your sister, Manar.
What is this?
Ah, you tell me what is this? God bless you
To the attendees
A very small model of the court building
God keep you safe
To the attendees
Suck it up
It’s you who said that.
Don’t go today.
Leave it for tomorrow
So that God may accept it, prepare this document for the court building
Ready, we worked hard on it, icon on the way
Come in from that door
The first thing I do when I enter from the door
You are annoying me
My phone is some kind of iron so that it doesn’t do anything beep beep beep beep beep
When you register for the case, he says go to the 8th floor, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, elevator.
You destroyed the office
Jovi Qalaji if you need, for example, a specific Qalaji
And this one too
You want to complain to us
Ya'in indliha al-tariq
And Benjow Matibakhodin haqej
Are you taking the 200?
Just as he said
Bye
I came back today for my sister’s dinner
Oh, the ministry approved his project, بو وليد
My sister, I can’t believe you, you’re flying with joy
He said to me, "They approved my project, have dinner with me.
Oh God, thank God, once again I’ve been chosen
God, how happy you are now, Mr. Walid
I am not up to it
My sister, tell me what you ate last night because of happiness
سبحان الله يا منال
Oh Abu Walid, he has nothing to do with these matters, but God has made his sons-in-law work for him.
Inshallah, tell your father.
Sorry, we are back
To the قصر or بو وليد
May Allah protect you, Abu Walid, you didn’t do enough.
God will enrich you and increase your good, God willing
You are a good cook, God bless you, Ya Walid
Now an accountant and a secretary have been assigned to you to organize your work
They told me just pay the office fee and leave the rest to us
Please, my uncle.
And my beloved, the gaze of my eyes
My blackberry
We want to build a bigger house
See his face
Mom, we agreed today that you’ll call me after dinner.
Now, your humble servant, with a word from the project owner, my father, Mr. Bou Walid, who kindly proceeds.
Sorry about that
Congratulations, congratulations, Abu Walid
You deserve it, you deserve it, may God bless you, you deserve it
But to be honest, you are good at business and trade
Real, this project has a story, guys.
What is teli shlon?
See how that means, thank God
That year
One day, the Japanese national team will play with us
I am in the Souq Waqif
I don’t know about it
This is a catalog of the factory of the multi-ministry money halls, we are asking them to present them.
Any intruder will build for you
What understands
Any contractor
Japanese, don’t play the tail game
Just say LL for computer
I want cinema
I want a kitchenette kitchenette
I’ll tell you, the day you presented the catalog of the committee of the ministry
How is your agreement with the factory?
I paid them an amount
Preamble means
The most important thing is to agree with the factory
Alhamdulillah, he signed it
And give me a break after that, meaning ask for the first order
Stop being a child
Accept it, it’s correct
We’ll just wait for the signature of Prince بو فهد
What’s the problem with the secretary?
Bua Fahaid said he didn’t show up
Ask for Jay for me
Here, يا بو وليد, tell me what you did.
The problem with Boufaisal is that he can come and he can go.
A day exists
He doesn’t have time
What does that mean? Come now.
You are the manager here
Tbi bou fahd yadhabni
No need, he’s the one who will sign.
Go through all these files in my office and I need a signature from Al-Fahad
And the solution means
God help you
It is quarter to two o’clock, Mr. Walid.
Shift is over
What do you think that Bu-Fahad will come
God help you, come tomorrow
You say that the manager knew him for a long time and that he is your friend
Ashfij antie
A manager like this, who is so good at taking photos, is just in the office.
Explain to me why they are sitting at their desks
Just the starch in their veils
I thought you were the boss, I thought you were coming, I thought
They are not doing anything useful.
They only move the chair by the orders of Prince Muqrin.
Yesterday the manager didn’t ask about you.
The Interests of God’s Creation
You look like you’re going to them today
A real mess, God damn it
Every day I face a problem
The factory is giving me a deadline
God forbid, God forbid, God forbid
And if he is asked about you
But you just wait for Bu Fahad
Look at these files
All are waiting for the signature of Boufhed
I expect you to come today
Relax, you
And go away
So I’ll talk to you
If something happens to me just don’t call, be brave, the quarter are poor.
God be with you, bye
You scared the wife
Son of a bitch, we agreed on my appointment
But men fall, my brother, what is this talk
My daughter is losing her scholarship documents at university because you didn’t finish filling them out, dad.
And my problem with the factory is take your time
You wait a bit
All your transactions are expected
The Real drinks his coffee but they will shower on him
Calm down, I said calm down
May I ask for your time?
Bye
Moment, moment, guys
Just a moment, where are we going? Wait a bit.
Understand what happened
What happened after
He has an important trip ahead of him.
He has a special door.
This is the case
Our interests have stopped, my brother
Every day, I do inter-inter-move.
What shall we do? Wait for Fahad
Seek you, father
God has no enemy who has no enemy
Where is he going and where is she going?
The factory in Japan
It’s raining, and the deadline is about to end.
And your aunt from another side
She is a poor old lady.
Where is he going to find her, or where is she going to find him
Oh my god, I’m so scared for my father
Don’t leave him alone.
I am talking
Hello from
Bo Walid
So you can say the factory and your sister-in-law’s money
Wait for Fahad
So dad, when can I wait?
They only find fault with them.
This is how we wait for Prince Fahad
Mom, you’re not being short with me
But all my friends will attend university next week.
Shador yabe
The phone, يابوج (yabوج).
Whatever is troubling you, just forget it and be patient.
Who is this person talking to?
Hey, wait for Boufhed
I don’t know what to say to my sister.
You’re very patient with us
God will come
Bo Walid, his condition is not good
My boat caught his hot fish, it vibrates and trembles
The deadline is almost over
He has five days left.
He will lose all his money
God is my judge against him
Any better, I’m any better, I’m any better
Inshallah, the best I feel
This is a strange watch
The text above is gibberish.
The second text under the moving mall
You made me 50% crazy
Make it a discount for me
I can’t.
Inshallah, everything will be fine
My sister didn’t do anything.
She said she’ll wait for her money a bit
May God reward her well
I took you from your sister but
Our manager came out, God help us with him
Our manager probably heard.
God knows what he is planning with this manager
I’ll get it from him or from Bu Fahad
God damn it, it’s a problem
And tomorrow is the last day
My innocent life
May God not let us down
Look inside Look inside
Where have you been, you talk now
You are asking me to call someone
Bro بو وليد
I am connected to you because you broke my heart
Just stay standard by the phone
Bye
You have always been a committed person
We used to take you as an example
Don’t think I’ll miss your daily leave.
I can deduct from you.
And then what about this mobile phone
I would rather not deduct from you
I put you on the inventory committee
Today I went with them to the inventory.
Why you go outside of work
And when the sun rises
Don’t blame me after that
Today is the last day for the poor
My mother’s mobile phone is ringing. They are calling him.
I’m afraid he will fire him from work
Oh Abu Walid, my phone rang
Breaking the heart
Let him go, poor thing
Ya Abu Walid
Here it is
What's wrong with you, Mr. Walid? It's not the phone I'm calling you from.
Let your soul be free from your treatment
Don’t worry
You're not doing enough, God forbid!
Al-Zahir Dawm Bu-Fahad
Make me do it for you
This is a big official
Where does it go
Oh Pakistan
My brother, to which side of Afghanistan or Pakistan
Pakistan's third largest university
Don’t fart.
Wait for Bu-Fahad
Don’t sit.
Don’t look at me
And you want
House by house
Forward
Guys, the real one is
Do you know how old I am now?
And all these years you were
Amودي اوراق ويايب اوراق
Arkabi tahaat
Winding and walking between these ministries
But we were young
Hey, I see you, I’m a living thing, I put it on my shoulders like this, as if I’m carrying a cast for a kid.
And after Allah, may He guide you, I learned to drive a bike
Especially after the course I learned and bought
Reali khazar ziti
They flirt with me, I got on my bike and he saw it
Lamech and raising children
The manager has arrived.
When it's finished Insha'Allah we'll have the candy
Alhamdulillah alhamdulillah
A child, stop threatening the job
I witness that you, Abu Said, did not fail.
Now the prophet of peace has returned, my brother, ooh, farewell
We are ready.
What else do you want after I stretched for a year
Stop stop
May God reward you.
You gave me four years.
I should have retired long ago
All the kids are working
The last one came yesterday
Back now, Mr. Abdul-Aziz
I am looking for peace
No and your job is reporter
Come on, good boy.
Will you donate, seriously?
I haven’t eaten hummus for four years, maybe five.
How sweet he is
What are you talking about?
Whatever you ask for will happen God willing
Request me the human resources department
You finished the papers
Ouch since yesterday
Such a delay in your treatment
Damn, I’m so bored.
OK, that’s it.
Don’t cut us off
Hey Khaled
From this moment on, I’m done
Inshallah, we will rest, you will rest, ooh ooh aah
Sweet sweet
I am at work and I can’t go out.
The General Administration of Human Resources is estimated to continue.
I have a transaction there
I want you to take it and hand it over to the civil service.
تس تسلم تسلم يا به ما اتقصر
Where are you going?
My car is broken, I have to go to the bank
Our Collective Resolve
Which one now
The bank is waiting for me
Send her away with someone
I can’t go out today
Okay okay God willing bye
He didn’t agree.
He says he can’t come out.
What are you doing now?
In the morning, I was on my way to the bank.
A student for so many years
He’s definitely feeling the heat.
That’s better for him
You let him rest, now
Poor Fahad, he is going back home
Call him, he said Khaled
So he can finish his treatment
Fear God
Everyone depends on himself
My mother regrets the donkey.
This is our fish, it is destroyed.
I’m not sorry about the fart, mom.
But I say, who left work and this
Will Khaled go and what will he do?
lying in his room
Those who were lost in their sea
Good morning mom
Hello my daughter
Dad, and whatever you are sending.
Just talk to me and they said the manager is very angry
And here are the results of your treatment
How are you, Mr. سعيد?
I told you, let the kids rely on themselves. What's wrong with you, can't you hear what I'm saying?
Don’t you quit!
And on that account, Ali
Here I am, waiting for you and the ant in front of me.
We’ll eat it today
God be with you, bye
Mae li ybah an nasit aqulak
My beloved father
God help you
Yeah, go to the market
Get out of here, hurry up!
You have risen, my daughter, you have risen
And the name of God is Rahman, the Merciful.
God bless you
زين deleted the house
Els els ais
I told you to stay at home.
Teach your children how they will provide for themselves
Chasuy Yam Said
Their conditions are difficult, I have to help them
Okay, okay, relax.
I’ll bring you a glass of water
I’ll bring you some cookies to eat
Poor dizzy
And the taxis
And therefore on his face
The branch in the market is gone
I want to make a personal card
After you get in my car
Watodi has the papers
You bastard, thank God
It all depends on himself
I told you.
I want you to rest.
Hi, how are you?
Enjoy your meal
From one ministry to another with government transactions
Adabj from Wazah to the Ministry
The transactions of the children
Treat them with respect and with kindness, for sure you are spoiling them
The kids are holding good, important jobs
And their time is busy what shall we do
Every day, except for a meeting with the director, or with the official, or with the minister.
So they have nice jobs, after all. They need time to get the work done. Wow!
And wander, and settle your transactions, and practice another job, and you will be a beggar, and you will make you a mercenary, how after that?
Thank you, may God reward you.
See you later, bye
Oh God, forgive us, oh Bushahin
They called me and said that it was done.
If you send your father tomorrow, he will complete the transaction for you.
I’m going to be late
Fear God
It’s impossible now, it’s you in particular I can’t.
out of his love for you
He is annoyed and tired of you and your behavior towards him.
You don’t even respect the gray hair on his head
There is someone who has been lying in the bedroom for two days
I walked around in the streets and under the sun
May God give you the deal
And the spirit ran and delivered him
A committee that comes from morning till the end of the day
My reputation, mom
My building is delayed well
Madam Bagher is your last day in the committee
Your treatment is due to be paid.
Or else come and complain to me about them at night
He has a committee that is required to meet.
What's up, Papa?
His tears are in his eyes
I didn’t tell my father anything.
It is the committee that changed its mind.
They said they would come at the end of the week.
Azain, tell the truth about your father.
Mom, don’t go
I’m going to heaven and didn’t come
I'm not going to watch these girls in this cafeteria
laugh at him
Ok, enough.
I’m going to apologize to him.
I’m going to him
Thanks mom
Khalood, mom
Thank him, he is wrong
And he turned out to be selfish after all
And what will tire you one day is that the committee doesn’t come
You are the best and the best.
From now on
We settle our transactions by ourselves
Tils f al-bayt
And this is your head, kiss it.
Hello hello hello my friend
May God bless you with a good morning.
‏ يا اعز ابو
All over the world
Don’t be mad at me
And I am not angry
And you after as I told you
AB, finish this transaction for me
I would like to do it myself
They said to me, come quickly.
You have a meeting
With the Minister’s happiness
The happiest moment for your father
I will not give in to the elders
Alas, they said your son is with Al-Wailah and here he is.
Trust in God, the spirit of your perseverance, Marmarah
Bousaid, where are you?
And whoever hands you over to me, father.
Here is the situation in front of me
Just wait and I’ll send you the envelope with the pillow.
My beloved father
It means it happened
It seems he forgot
Because the committee met after an hour
May God protect you.
My son has a meeting with the minister today, ouyala
Just give me the deal
This is my situation, going to work and then going home to work.
Where is Magof Had?
Peace be upon you
And peace be upon you, and more peace.
No, no, I didn’t say anything to him, nothing at all.
Any of a week ago sorted goes to the beach
And you say there is a motherfucker in the farm.
Will it go in the morning?
He took his time there, of course.
No and I’ll add to the poem a house
He says, a cook doesn’t need that.
And to him
With peace
Hope for the best
May God forbid any harm to my uncle.
‏ God guide you
No, no, mom, I’m fine.
Your papers have been scattered
That one in the farm
And this is too much
The Refugtee Trade
Thirsty, mom, I want water
Yip lei mai mai
My dear sons
No, no, just cross it out, cross it out. I don’t want it.
Don’t write like that
Let them get fucked
Fij yakhوتي
And you are the truth
Lala la, killed him
Yeah, man, my brothers
Let me, my sisters
What they call the league and the cup
And he was talking about the rule.
My mother says what is this boy doing, why is he getting old?
And hold her by the teeth, no more nonsense and no more nonsense
People have returned to ozone
Waiybun has something to say and they tell him to speak on the radio and television
And more than that
Take him, arrest him, my brothers, and throw him in jail.
Believe me, my sisters
You daughter of Halal, nowadays no one can help anyone
Full of problems
And God, if he dies now
Let him talk and according to him, no more nonsense
Alhamdulillah for his safety
‏ May God’s blessings be upon us
Bye
You’re late for work like that, ya’me
Listen, mom
I was up all night yesterday.
And I warn you
Now I just want to remind you, dad.
Alas, my Lord
It’s impossible after I called
No radio, no TV, even Kyoteel is not connected
Your sister is living in a shelter for the past two days
And your fiancée, Manira, her tears are four, four on her cheek.
You bastard, mom says, may God have mercy on you and your parents
Just as you said
We are fed up with nonsense
What’s left of you is getting worse
You are your uncle Bu Amnira
Yana after you put me in jail
And it’s over
Take off the veil
After the beating, mom, I gave it to him, and he took it, and God protect him from the devil, and God willing, everything will be fine.
The second time he’ll grab you by the hand and take you to court, let go of his daughter
Alas, my Lord
Repent I say
If you call the radio or TV, blame only yourself
قت لج توبه
Let me go, I will go now
Between you and me, just that
I am the manager, he told me.
We are smart here
This is going to go badly for the administration
Just show us the real deal.
What should I tell the manager now?
Oh, he has a million excuses and reasons to say
Where should I go, means
But, like, it’s over, Afnish
I am broken for you
Al-wa na’am
Bye
I told you.
You know what I told you, Saleh
Public interest forced us to reduce the number of correspondents in the ministry
You are right but
And the one who will deliver you, just one, enough of nonsense
It’s sweet of you
We are fed up with nonsense
Yes, indeed
You are right here
We have work, please.
What the hell, mom
Len اندبر al-amور
Now I have left Salah for you
I want to buy a phone
And Manira was standing and listening when I said to you
I said
I hear them calling me, Tony is coming from the mills
My soul, you are inside now
And let me understand your father.
The prison shower we said was a mistake and we kept quiet
We will be silent now after they destroyed us
Just because we are relatives
Do you know how
‏ Seek refuge with Allah from the devil
And God willing, everything will be fine
God guides whom He wills.
Don’t drink my coffee, keep yours.
I know you
Bored
Your uncle gave you a two-week deadline.
God will not hold your hand and take you to court so that you can be divorced
Oh my God, even if I go out
You are the cause of all the trouble
Just be patient with yourself
Even if one told you
Breathe in what you hear
That's just nonsense
Yeah, man, what’s up?
But don’t punish me in the next two days
Stop it, we’re tired of your nonsense, man. We’d only like to hear it from you once, just once.
Just, that’s it.
Be the police
No, no, you don’t understand.
My uncle has a problem, so we asked him to speak tomorrow on the radio.
He was a bit hesitant
We felt that we told him in a public place, so he hesitated.
So I said, the house is right for my cousin's son and I will talk to him privately.
So you felt that he wanted to say something
means hesitant and that and that
Come from somewhere they will
بس بس بس بس بس بس بس
I am not your mother and I don’t know you and I will never forgive you till the day of judgment. I heard or I didn’t.
Saleh Saad
No God, don’t let it be, this is over, phew, thank God we’re free of her
Do you have a sense of responsibility?
A successful employee
But unfortunately
Although I tried
سلام عليكم
Why did you tire yourself coming?
I just baked, I was talking to the secretary so that he/she can tell you that you didn’t come.
Shahin Ashvick
You don’t know who I am
Ava, is there anyone in Qatar who doesn’t know Saleeh? Enough with the nonsense
You are good, but enough of nonsense
We are fed up with nonsense
Ooh, the job
But there are no jobs, you know the circumstances, means
Zain, Real, you didn’t hire him
I am Minon, I will work for us.
I didn’t leave any place, God knows, Manar, I didn’t go
Not one person told me before I came five minutes ago that there was a job, but they advertised it, so it’s gone
My sister-in-law chose to divorce her husband yesterday
It means that my responsibility has become so huge.
After one, his responsibility became so great
And I don’t know what to do, God
Stop getting close to the minister
But honestly, I think it’s not good
I think he is afraid to put him in my place
I’m done, you’ve killed me
Who told you that I would be silent
But I just want this way to be far from me
I think of the way he was slaughtered
Just once
But what is it?
I know him
What is being talked about on the radio
I will send you the mail
And just a piece of information
You, Saleh, are a citizen full of patriotism
You are a patriotic citizen
‏ Receive
I left for good, by God
I consider your voice to be the voice of truth
I talked to him a bit, you know, بو فهد (Bo Fahad).
Be honest, Saleh
He says, it’s been a long time since we heard that, this one who says, enough with all the nonsense
I want to get to know him
This is normal, Saleh
I am a protester in the tent
Forward, forward, forward
And there are few like you
Your words are very nice.
And your talk on the radio is much better
We heard it once, enough with the nonsense
Amble, oh God, just one so that Boufهد can say it now, he will say it, he will say it, he will say it
‏ No more nonsense
This is the original, Your Majesty. This is it.
Please continue, I haven’t stopped.
Make it difficult
Then stop what you are doing
I mean, I wish it would continue because of people's problems and issues
Listen, Saleh
I’ll give you just one problem
You, Saleh, are the voice of truth
You want me to cook
A big official this
Damn, man, say it, say it, she’s God’s truth
Oh yes, God!
This is your chance
And the opportunity does not come twice
No, no means no.
What's wrong with you, don't you understand
Just wait, man, please.
From problems and troubles to the high
To His Excellency the Minister
In its latest project, the ministry requested 8,000 ampoules.
The package has a capacity of one hundred and twenty centimeters
But this employee
Approved capacity pipelines
So that he can benefit from the price difference
We are fed up with nonsense
You didn’t do anything wrong, Mr. Saleh, enough of nonsense
No God, no peace to you
This is a special request call
Inshallah you call it yes
No more nonsense, no more nonsense
Do you know
The hyena and what it does
But this is the last one, only this one
Sultan Asdagh is flying
The minister carried her bag in a hurry
He says he said something right
Oh, now the Bوفهد (Bo-Fahad) playground is full.
I'm going to do all the tasks.
My lord, for so long
Minister's present seekers
Bye
We are fed up with nonsense
It’s over, this is the last one, it’s over after this
Ooh and here is your age, my lord, my job papers, sorry.
Those who wanted me to reach, have reached it
Listen to me.
Because he is afraid
Investigate him and find out his scandals and troubles
You point out the flaws and criticize
They are afraid of you
Deceive me, my sister Aasha
You are the kind one
Bajar bee emak abo Amnira
A condition worked
If they have nothing to do, they criticize and point out the flaws
Why Do They Hate Our Country
Do We Have Flaws?
We don’t have any connections
I’ve never heard of the word “waaseطا” before.
In our government offices, it’s first come, first served
We don’t take bribes
And I don’t know her.
And look at the employee
Does the foreigner get more than the local son? Never, never ever
We do everything with our own hands
You are not from our family, from our father, you are not from us at all, master.
A responsible person will get angry at you while you are at work
We are the best people
Best country
Flawless
And thank you.
Shamkhrabat yesterday on the radio
Oh my God, give me some sweet bread
I told you there’s no sweet except after dinner
It's over, there is no more candy
Chally tore the shirt
Oh my God, my friend and I were playing
Do you mean, are you playing?
But what cut the shirt
Damn you, you notaries!
Come, come, see your brother’s son, Shary, what did he do
He told me there’s no need to buy it for a high price, I told him, no problem, it’s for a boy and it will look nice.
See what happens
It's no use, I'll cancel this, it's cancelled. This shirt, it's no use, I'll cancel it.
Asawi lii allii bihi, of course no one likes it
Oh my god, where is the candy
See the crack in the labor intentionally to the last tel
He came back with Walid
It's the first time that Fahyan wears it
Baravij ve ana
Where are the witnesses?
In the garden
Why is it happening?
My father in a subject between us
What a pain!
Get a grip
Put your ass and your ass down, ya’ll
And he let him do whatever he wanted
Ruling by Fear
Don’t come and discipline me.
Come and teach me
We will teach them
About too much mistake and respect yourself
Leave him alone
You are fighting like kids
A faraway bay
No, don’t interfere at all.
Tell him to take care of his children, listen, you and him.
What the...
You are not able to distinguish between a child and a stick.
But I knew
I’m hungry, not you
Let’s go up
They don’t deserve one
Even if he answers them
I prefer that one
The Time of the Calm Hearts
Bye, bye, bye.
But Your Excellency, the minister asked for the papers and it is necessary to expect them.
Okay, okay, I’ll talk to the minister later, okay? What’s the problem? I’ll talk to him.
Both the blue and the tragedy and the catastrophe are over
His new clothes, no, Aisha
This is not a kid’s act
And the oven
Lala laa jo be behdel thiyab tebhedel
Jوفي Jوفي
It means there is no hope of wearing it
Jove, put on a pair of trousers, meaning wear one leg and go
No, no, no, this is not to be cut by hand, I’ll show you.
I’m telling you, use an electric circular saw.
But I can only say that God will take care of the one who did it.
I’m telling you
Who of you wants candy? Come on.
I know that now.
If you still don’t know God, take a walk around the neighborhood.
I don’t just love you because you know how to ride a bike.
I love you because you have something else
Are you telling the truth?
Azain, do you want candy?
Any father, two.
I’ll give you four units.
Who cut our clothes in the closet
Hey, how did your father cut them?
He has a big scissors so he can cut the car with it.
Under the bed, there is all the candy
He will get those things soon
No one but him could do this mess.
Why do we keep silent about it
The most important thing
If we insist on our words
Walid, the boy, took off his clothes
Any computer
What is he talking about?
The breaking I saw with my own eyes is impossible for anyone to do
Why don’t you believe me?
Spirit of your neighborhood spirit
Zain, give me just a moment
This is your case
Every day, Mom, they fight.
Where are you, oh times of the past
Oh God, with forgiveness and health
Oh God, guide them
Ichiel appreciates the Hulk's scissors
You are the one who looks for your quarter
Look at the hair on him
Going to get a pair of scissors, what a big pair.
Respect yourself, Sultanu, respect yourself, Aouach
Come here, mom, for God's sake, look at their asses, come here, mom.
How do I start
And each one of you
You are fathers
And the child is born
The child is born
You are my brothers
Listen to my words and reconcile, stretch out your hands.
Okin, what are you doing now?
Oh bird, I have torn their clothes
Their clothes are equal to this mess that was done to me, which caused me to lose my files, information, documents, and the whole world.
God didn’t leave him
Bring us a story about Arabic museums, and God, you won’t leave him
I don’t care about it
Bitaq bitaq bitaq bitaq Lima yateeb weyerouh
‏ Don’t fool me, I know him.
And everyone shook hands with the other
I am not my father's heart, I am not his heart, it is full of hatred and envy.
Oh, I'm sorry, I broke the computer
And he, Fahad
Sultan Otha Otha Otha
Just, mom, be afraid of God
Give him give him be careful be careful
Take your uncle's kids and go play outside
Oh God, may God correct you
May God bless you
Raya'il kl wajd astolh ash'ratha
You stole the right of the children, you stole the right of the kids
God willing, oh mother
Their brother Abdul Rahman
Can you mother f*cking do it the first time
Do you know, mom, that thing called oud
Does he know how to talk to people
And you understand them
You don’t have to be mad at me.
You are supposed to
Every one has a role
God corrects you, but God corrects you
Even you, dad, have become like them
Oh mother, oh mother, take away my son, oh God, why do you do this to us? You keep saying, get out, get out, get out.
What the hell is that?
My last son
You have failed us, you sons of bitches
Those who delete were the kids
He doesn’t want to believe it.
I see them with both my eyes
The kids told him he wouldn’t believe it
He says from above
Oh, you bastard, get off me, Fletton, but since you’re on top, I thought you were big.
Oh, I'm not drunk, I'm awake.
Please, can you go?
You might be a little tired or your head is aching.
Do you know these people?
Tell me, are they throwing stones at you?
What are you
My love
I’m telling you, go and relax now, they signed a pledge, it’s over, don’t worry.
In the name of God, in the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful.
What is this, oh God oh God
God is my judge against the enemy
Oh my God
It's all because of you
‏ The reason for you
Akbar bas asghar malt 3alaykum wa 3ala aqoolkum
I took Wodoney to the hospital, I fainted with death
I saw it, and it’s not the first time I see it
And then I noticed that he didn’t even look at you, Hazi.
Oh, he wasn’t registered in business with us
But now it's been a week since he stopped taking the subject with us
It's obvious that he's dying and he recognizes you.
Don’t be so heavy, he’s so into you.
No, my sister.
He says I’m a pain in the neck.
A strong boy hugged me and took a breath on me
Let things happen normally, it’s better
Now it’s him who will catch you and he who cut himself for you
It's true, I return the same admiration
But I don’t know, I feel like the right opportunity hasn’t come yet.
But blindness with blindness
I turned around and looked at you and how.
Don’t wait, young man, she’s coming, she’ll say, “Excuse me, I’d like to get to know you.”
My brother, be the one who takes the initiative
You are right
But I’m waiting for the right opportunity
The right opportunity
More than that you are registered with her in the same subject
The teacher was angry
Say it, you fool.
Ya Aflahna, why don’t you come, is she called Shasmah?
We’ve been waiting for three months
No one knows the second one.
Dude, what’s up with you?
You have to go and tell her, please.
May I know you?
It's not that strong anymore
I just need to wait for the right opportunity to come.
She is kind and educated.
God knows what you want exactly
We finished shooting the series yesterday
Oh yes, God!
You never forgot us and you were very kind to us
Dam ahine ana tfaraght
If we buy the villa behind us, that's Walid's right
I hope that if he gets married, he will buy us some shoes, he won't go far away from us.
Shalfayda, now he's back
You are very late.
And good news
One day I will see what her problem is
And they bought the land through the Development Bank
May Allah bless them in it, God willing.
Hello, hello dad, good morning
Here, uncle, knock on wood
Thank you mom, thank you, may God reward you, may God reward you well.
Hello, hello, Noura, welcome, welcome, come in, the car is working, I’ll pick you up, come, come, dad.
And the peace be upon you
What's the matter with you?
Neighbors and sitting there talking, what do you have to do with them
Get out of here, it’s better for you.
Neighbors and sitting with some of them, what do you have to do with them
I am in a nice test driving my car and I can’t get it out
After your permission, after your permission, give me your car key.
After I wash the car
I’ll leave you in the Titanic atmosphere you are living
See you
Bye
Now you know a lot about me
And I only knew Walid
Waleed Rashid Abdullah
Surely a lot of people, if you tell them your father's name, will think you are the son of the actor
Masha’Allah, the same name
My father is Rashid Abdullah the actor
Rashed Abdullah, the famous actor, your father
Why didn’t you have dinner with them? Someone had this vegetarian dinner.
Don’t you come and tell me
How did you know the famous actor Rashid Abdullah Yarna
Ooh, right.
O my friend, my friends at the university know them and she is the one who told me.
He loves him and loves his acting, and only he follows him
He said that we no longer live in one famous person who has a value in the community
Oh my heart, my joy
Shahlile shahlile damma khafif ay nayeem
He and his son are both idiots. May God reward him.
He who says it, knows it
You did it again
I have to take a picture with him, the actor I love, see why.
Oh my god, my mouth is on fire, my cousin's son
And I have another interview in the newspaper
He says they are making a series about the days of diving
I say, who did you drive, you brought me a lamb on the occasion of the new house
Prove that you are a good neighbor
Hala Saleh, is there anything new?
We have a lot of names
They told me, God bless you, the gang, يا بو سعد, my name is there.
And it is determined according to the need and the employee's expertise.
We don’t know
We might not be able to transfer you.
Come on, let me, I can't do anything for you
May God curse your enemy
We said we would move and sit before that and then God will provide us with females after that
Adjust your work
‏ Back, Ya Abu Ali
Please don’t consider me a stranger
Whatever you need
I am at your service.
Neighbor to neighbor and I am your brother
But now I heard and saw
زين, ماشالله, عليج, اتعرفين, ف, الاثاث
A child will go with you
You're not my sister
Whenever you want to choose furniture, let me know
My beloved, my father-in-law is going to ask his predecessor and if they agree, they will give us all the furniture.
And here I repeat it again
And only Sangh will remain
We are today according to the people of his account
And this is what I don’t know how to study with.
But I just want her to be self-reliant
I was definitely talking to her.
Do you want me to tell you and say I’ll talk to my friend
Oh my God, Ali
I am not for anything
Dam is the one who loves me and I love her, I get along with her
You are dreaming
Let me marry your cousin.
Leave the subject alone
How are you?
Man, you're a dick.
Benjuf
Good night
And you are from them
Boali Khayr
This car is banging.
Every day and the other day a story is made up about me
The girl will return, God willing, when she finishes her university.
And this is the best I can do
Your daughter is our daughter
You don’t have to
There is no need for you to put yourself out, my friend, Rashid.
May God protect you.
The car is parked in the yard and the driver is sitting without work
Ajwaf bank of development didn’t fail you, it gave you a house and a car
This is not our car
Rashed Abdullah's neighbor's car
Hollow relationships developed
Discuss topics of mutual interest that are in the best interest of both parties
Oh terrible development Hazi
Oh God, walk
Mom, I'm embarrassed again
I did not agree
Noura said, “I thought my daughter, and every day the driver would take her to university.”
You said to her that my father’s car needs a week of repair.
No, by God, I swear
She said the driver will come every morning.
Testimony to God, O Ali
Good people
No, no, no, your mom
There is no power and no might except with Allah
What the hell, what the hell should I do now
I have more responsibilities
My daughter is going to university
Yabo Ali, as long as you have the intermediation of Mr. Rashid Abdullah
We can’t say anything, it’s over
Bousaada Bousaada
Bosa’ad ana isaf
Boali knows his value to us
Thank you, may God reward you, you didn’t do a bad job, boss.
All love you, ماشالله
God, she’s so beautiful
Come on guys, let Prof. Rashid go, he is busy.
Apologies, apologies, Mr. Rashid, I disturbed you, is there anything else?
At your service, present, present
You have a strong connection.
You are our friend and brother, if we want something or anything, God bless us, don’t forget.
Just tell me where you want it, and I’ll get it for you.
What's wrong with you? Why are you annoying me?
You are asking for a marriage proposal for Manal
Agree, mother, agree
Manal told her mother about me.
I can’t believe it
Mother of Walid
And dresses when you have a party
I didn’t understand
The fortune teller is right, God willing, may my eyes see you.
She talked to me again
Take accessories
He stole my jewelry accessories
This is my mother.
Now I’ll get a nice car
ما شاء الله ما شاء الله
Masha’Allah, I can’t do anything about it
My mother says, "You're not going with her.
Whatever you gave him, give him the car
And the driver
If I go with you, they won’t believe that this bald and fair-skinned man is the husband of the queen
Ambiway
And God willing, you will go to wear your clothes
No, no, no, no, no, Ava, on you.
Without my clothes, I’ll leave you, you don’t know me.
They say that this sheikh who came to us
Coffee for the long life
Boali I didn’t know you, God! I said this for sure, this is one of the cabarets, we are going to, not Boali, you are not Boali
What do you think?
And walking is not enough
May Allah protect you, I’ll go with you to ask for Ali’s hand in marriage.

I arranged my mind from the crazy car
I’m sure you’ll find it with you
The last series you acted in
In a scene that was a wedding, remember which wedding
I was wearing that black coat that sparkles
And after my father, teach me how to wear the bشت
Even if your brother, may God preserve him, never wore a chapan.
Masha'Allah amnor amnor
How would that be, if I showered the group with emails
That's not right
What you say, my brother Rashid
You still don’t have buttons
The good
Who I always see with me and Kholoud
That’s the story, man
You are my love
We are now family
And our daughter Noura, may she not go far
Noura is right about Walid
Tell me mom, I see her at the university and I can’t find anyone better than her.
This is a blessed hour
God willing, I will say the truth about her father and God will write the best.
Why do they reject it? What is the reason?
Because his father is an actor
Your father's ghost
Tell Rashid to call me quickly
Where are you
Cry for security
You say that because his father is an actor
Don’t be ashamed of your ass
I am an actor.
But I would rather die a martyr.
I perform on stage for two hours and my part is over.
And my performance is over
You play roles
I represent
Present them a message that benefits them
But you
I’m wearing a costume.
On the Stage
But you
You acted in the Mall
The rich Sheikh
Who is the actor in us
Who is the real actor?
Don’t be sad, Walid
Lift your head
We are not ashamed
But you missed the view now that I’m coming.
And listen to her scream at him, don't turn around, don't turn around, poor thing, it breaks your heart.
His master walks.
Do you say horse heaven
It's Thursday, Real.
It is Thursday
My wife doesn’t let me sleep
بتغار عليو
That’s why he goes like that
So that women don’t see him and he doesn’t see women
I saw how his wife, Aminnte, was.
Sida la talfat
But tomorrow I won’t be in the office
Khames, please, please, show them how you wear the dress
Thursday, I’ll see you on your 60s outfit
Is she your wife? Then you can call her your wife’s dress.
Oh God, it’s Thursday already
With a hollow spirit, Salame Ashibi
Poor guy, bro
How long will you stay like this?
If you would only listen to what is being said behind your back
No, by God, even in front of me they say maybe even more
Why are you doing this?
Atgar Ali
Worry about what?
I sit in front of the TV for hours
This is it.
Oh and by God's great might
Lala normal
Hello, peace be upon you, my sister
It’s over now
I can see you now, I’ll hit you and I’ll hear the sound of a real.
God, sometimes I throw my clothes in the street
Respect yourself and divorce her
It’s difficult to let go
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Don’t come near me, stay away.
Hey, what’s up?
My intention is good.
What are you talking about?
Only these types of people sit with her
And especially this one, I, this one from the best of your quarter, I didn’t get it from the life of God, these two times, the one who is rubbing.
The gazelle that looks like a planted paradise just came out
Jalil al-Hayya li ma yastahi
You will torture me in my grave
Let me understand her.
After you, say
You understand with me
I don’t want anyone here
What's wrong with you?
Our Thursday companion
He is watching the flood and talking to himself
No, I’m saying the one with the limp, he’s jumping up and down
Normal Thursday this poor
He is all over her mother and is bothering her
God is my judge against his wife
They say, “Do you have Thursday?”
He is busy now, he has an international call, keep away, even the line is cut.
And the one with the message
I say, God help you, Khamis
What's wrong, are you sleeping?
I don’t feel like it, God knows, I don’t know.
Regarding the meeting tomorrow
With the women’s delegation in the ministry
Maybe
God guide you, but Mr Khamis
These names are coming from the office of Minister Saada
‏ And then come
You are so scared of her
If I were Salama, I wouldn’t have been afraid
Say what’s true
Why are you hiding and hiding behind the water tank
But just like that
Did you see the last number in the last line in your hand?
The last numbers
The last number you called after you deleted the number of the girl you were arguing with
What’s her name, you old man?
Kill them all, kill them all, kill them all
She has puzzles for Salime
Slom Refiji f f f val f work
You didn’t believe me, my brother
And then what are you wearing
I'm going to dive
And God my brother you didn’t let me wear it, she said get out like that
Call me
My wife's brother called
My husband
Say it, ya khook, hand me the pen, I’ll give you the number
Adaron 3ala ba3dkom
This is your nature, you men
You are one of them, but I will show you
If you interfere once again, I will not return unless the minister’s office.
This is a horse
And you threaten me to say that I have complained about you in the minister’s office
This is a very bold move.
She's trying to cut off my bread.
‏ But I was the fool who listened to you and called her
Juff is back, Khamees
If you complain about me to the minister’s office
Come with me there and tell them the whole story, get me out of the story, I mean.
It's none of my business
You are scared.
My brothers and sisters
Good morning to all of you
I am honored by your presence at the meeting
But where are the rest of them?
Bitter and homeless
It is Thursday, Waneh.
Ya, my lord
Phone sugar
Okay, don’t get drunk, just stay in the office
The whole meeting is one hour
This is my telephone
It happened and it happened
I won’t go to their house again, I’ll stay with you.
Where should I go?
May go wherever
Zak today is sitting in the same condition
Giyore giyore aliyo ghar
My love, this is not flirting
Yils ahnii f al-sahl f al-layl abrooh
Tell me to talk to your mom
My mother, my mother is dead
That's why I brought you so I can see if you can find me a solution
Madam Ai asked you to move from the section where women are.
What is military rule?
See the signature, read below
My brother, please, transfer me to the social care department.
Are you sure you are a moron? The Department of Welfare
Why is it strange?
Thank you God, keep you safe.
You are my sister, sorry, my brother Khamis
They called us from the minister’s office and told us
Here is your new section
And me and your colleagues in the office
Issa, Saleh and Jassem and
Thursday, the minister decided to transfer you.
Today I’ve brought you in the new section
I explained to you, I told you my problem with the family.
You are a transformer of the minister
So I go to the minister
Today he took his annual leave.
He will be back after a month and a half.
Oh, shit
And what’s your opinion after that?
Minister B, the same thing to you
Let’s see where we can take you this time, because a lot of people told him about your problem with your wife.
I’ll tell you the truth
‏ And the solution
They say, if a woman calls me, I won’t be rude.
What can I do to help you?
I left them put your toys in the car, put them in the box
Loneliness
I put 10 for you on the basis that there are 5 of you in the office, so each one of you gets 2.
And what about his looks, you know, he’s going to die from his wife, I’m afraid of her.
Imagine if we all called each other by our first names.
And I call myself Abdul-Gader
And it is called so on this way
He is handsome and sweet, so you have to take care of him like that
In the name of God, what’s wrong with it?
You said call me
Any Abdel Qader, I'm waiting for Hassan who is from there and is behind Khalil
These girls, each one chooses what she wants
Give me this
The deaf happy
What's wrong with you?
Please
Where is the office of welfare?
It is supposed to be five female employees
What is your name?
I'm sweet
I am Minon Ynntni my wife
I am Minon
You have now presented the project to us
And we met with them
What did they say to you?
They said
Mona, come to me, I’m waiting for you
I can’t
I entered the kitchen and got into trouble
Oh God, oh God, oh God, my soul, do what we need
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God
Oh my God, oh my God, listen to the men, listen to them
Oh God, or did you forget that we are the children of scorpion
Oh God, oh God, and here I am without thanks to God, oh God, oh God, oh God, oh God
The bank said that there are no disagreements about the project
His phone is busy all the time.
Poor people from his aid are waiting
And I have nothing but this uncle and these brothers
The maid went on a trip based on a month and now it has been three months.
God, Reem, goodbye
All amendments are in our favor
Boy of the night
But seriously, if you make the garden
At least he’ll go to at least two or three places
They say that the park is a breath of fresh air for the people who live in the complex. This is the bank
Men are discussing, they don’t need women’s opinion
Let your mind be at ease
You put the tea, we found the sun, get out of the way.
La garden no
One minute only
My sister, you know that I love football.
Omaj and Akhwang wouldn’t know that you play football at school, if they knew, they would kill you.
Know thyself
And she said to him
I say forget about it, it’s better for you.
And don’t hurt yourself.
No, no, no, I’m upset with you
What a lot of worries in this world
Thank you Ali for blessing us
Oh Uncle Shahin, we have
What God wills
This is Thursday.
Length and breadth
The fear of the thong
I wanted to find a wife for him but I couldn’t.
Origin and branch
Say something
Khames’s marriage
This is from the resources department.
Yes, my lord
Leave it aside
Then I’ll make some notes on the proposal.
May the Lord have mercy
Do you have something else?
No, my lord.
Take care of them and I will meet them if I find the time God willing
What did you do with the female employees I sent you?
It will be better
I’m leaving now and then I’ll call you
What's going on?
You are stupid
We are your older sisters
We have been suffering for a long time
You know, Fatoum, what sport do you play at school?
They played table tennis.
Just kill them
This is the mezze
You don’t know who we are.
What is our origin?
Do you know what the hour and minute hands are?
This time we fucked with you
The Big Spider
‏ عقربه
My uncle, let’s give her a slap in the face
It's enough what she got
You are a treasure for me later
I'm jealous, you didn't say that architecture is like me
You are my life
Spiders don’t have daughters working in the streets among men
Web, Structure, and Power
Where is Anody and Wihna among the snakes
Let me break my head
No, no Sultan no
Here comes the scorpion again
You broke your mother's vase
Let your brother Falcon take his chance
God forbid what they are doing
My love, at least you are good.
Jوفي ويهي انا
What the hell do they want in the morning
After the Shiban
Shador ya Sakr, get down
Oh God, face to face with me, face to face
Where do I go?
And not a word
Where are you two going?
We told her not to say a word
What did you write instead of it, upbringing?
And even if training is proven, we have no objection
After the fight
You have two options
So you know that we are democratic
Don’t tell me you were pressed
Education, Education
Oh God, make her come
‏ Give us a copy of the request
Oh my God, go fuck yourself
Biggest scorpion, dad
The scorpion is repeating his words
I'm not cutting corners, but when is the wedding, God willing
Professor Amira
What you are asking for is very difficult.
I can’t travel, Abu Khaled
I have special circumstances.
The minister emphasized it
It’s very difficult
Think right, Amira
Don’t make a decision now, think about it, not tomorrow.
How does a child like you work?
That's why we are silent
I have a suggestion.
Let one of them travel with you
We don’t have daughters who travel
تركى عنج هالخربطه
Neither dead nor alive
Why are you still at work?
When you go, you’ll apologize.
When you don’t translate
Listen while you are silent
Al-Khames from the offspring of the scorpions
From us and from us
He is stupid and has no diploma
But only the scorpion
What are you doing now, my sister?
What should I do, Fatima?
I am broken and weak.
How much can I do
There is nothing we can do
Ashbinha atswei
Next Thursday, God willing, the wedding.
We’ll call you and tell you the time we’ll be there according to the sheikh’s team.
How cute this laugh is
May your spirit tear your clothes
Mom, iron my clothes
You killed me with this laughter
My brother, I implore you
I don’t want to hear a word.
Make us some tea, coffee and cake
Who are you now, Aysheh, who are you, a friend of the minister?
I’m afraid it’s a rumor, Mr. Khalid
Amina is the candidate to hold one of the ministries in the new ministerial formation
Amina deserves it
God willing, it’s not a rumor
You will persist tomorrow
And we all cooperate to serve the country
Through the contribution of each one of us in his place Thank you
I wish us all success
Thank you, Minister Sa’ah
Thank you for the warm welcome. The minister is looking forward to it.
Thank you
May she live long, best and best
Peace be upon you
Any soap after like you told me
This is the general supervisor of the women's team's football team
How did he fuck your sister Fatemeh?
In the name of God, may God’s will be done, God is the greatest
Captain Fatima has been on the road to the elderly
Captain Fatima is a talented one, my brothers. Goodbye, son.
Captain, would you like to play my sister’s game? What is her position?
Ras Harba, that’s all
Traveling to China
Captain Jannah, move China a little bit
God bless you
Your sister is playing an important match
She was studying education, but I went today and transferred her papers
Let us study with architects
Hey captain, there is no difference between the real and the mare.
God, I just poured the coffee
Come here where are you going
I want and I’m waiting
You are a fool
Oh God, oh God, tell your mother to say, kick me out
Oh God, oh God, not your father, not your mother’s father
God, what a situation
The cup you have is colder.
During the whole year they didn’t know about you, and as soon as they hear that you have a job
How are you? How are the kids?
I dug for her
May God willing, this time you will be with us in the series.
Sure, and you play the role of the champion
Juff Ali, look for نوف (Nouf). Nobody but شعوله (Sha’ola) can play her role.
My beloved, there is something called makeup that makes her smaller
Mary is twenty-six, Madrie is twenty-seven episodes
My father will benefit from the smoke.
He keeps giving us lectures that have no beginning or end.
I’m afraid a bone gets stuck in our throat.
The most important thing is that he doesn’t know that the company the series is about is your company and that of Hamoud.
God willing, I won’t be late, my brothers
And Kahwa Rashid and Ray after
The director is ready with his technicians
OK guys, just to save time, let’s start the meeting.
Whoever wants to speak, let him say his opinion
Jank Hamid Tibi atqoul shi
I don’t think there is a better series than this one
Come on, you, on a day like today, the maid committed suicide
And I know more about the scene that affected me
The day of the maid's suicide
The day her soul got stuck in the bench, the bench creaks, creaks, creaks, creaks and the blood drips, drips, drips, drips from her neck.
Because of her strength, she stood up and shouted at her son, God is watching.
And he sat there and sat there and sat there until he reached their yard
Action summit
I want the police to search and arrest the mother
Frankly, the series is really great.
All that’s left is for you to act out the series and then sit at the table and act it out
This is an assault on artistic conscience
Rape of Community Values
A series based on queer events
Unbelievable
27 Cases of Murder
What's the fuss about this shouting
You are known not to want anyone to appear
Come on, come on, brother Hamoud, let’s be democratic
We will decide the subject by majority
Hey Nasser, don’t hide behind the majority and democracy in the critical evaluation of any work of art. There is no democracy and majority.
You got involved in the case by virtue of your government job
Bye
I’m telling you, I heard the sound of the bell.
And the day a man from India came with a gun
He asked me if I am Mama Hasa, and I said yes.
‏ If the army opens
There is a ring in it, I think its value is about 27,800.
I’m afraid the Indian will bring us this thing by mistake
No, not by mistake
This is Samira
Hamid's wife, the manager we have at the company
And this is Allah's gift to him from her
What the hell...
The ring is very luxurious
I’ve never dreamed I would have a ring like this.
‏ May Allah bless you, my dear, my beloved, Khalsa
This is my father, I call this series the series of good
Ali and Hamoud are our employees, but since they are not employees here, we cannot submit the series under their names, so we submitted it under someone else's name.
And what else is there after this ring
Just say it, I want to hear it from you.
You are a fool, I am saying the truth to someone
My clever husband
What they call the magician
Give them a 5% raise
No, my dear, they are not sweet if they agree to four million.
My husband gets 200,000 ARS
I say, let’s give the university girl a break, let’s give Nada a break.
This one is good, ride with him on a bike
Our series we are working on is called Rape of Conscience
And they just called me about a role in a series
I just want to know one thing
Always like this our Gulf series, I mean like we say the wife this year the rape
The important thing is, say my dear, what will be my role?
And you, my love, are 100% guaranteed Duraj
Zain withdrew from embarrassment
Kani yaa yaa hinn
My beloved has returned, now he will make all this good breakfast for you, he will leave me and go.
This is Omar, the director's secretary.
God be with us
He never asked me this before
And he said that this series they are making is weak and trivial.
It’s a waste of money
And then what happened?
God willing, I don’t know what to tell them, I’m afraid that Rashid, that fool, told them something not nice about the series
Don’t be afraid, you.
Let’s discuss this subject.
sick human
Social series
This is what I saw a few days ago on TV
May your life be long.
The series that is being shown now is called Rape and Unpicked Rose
But the budget we're asking for is way too big
It needs a big budget
And don’t forget Allah to protect you, the company that produces the work is a local company
May Allah preserve you, I wish you were here.
Be reassured, my lord.
I read the technical page
We hear these days about the start of shooting the series of the rape of conscience
And a huge budget was allocated to him
While it is said that the series is not up to the required standard
And another says that the series is a school for teaching deviance
There is a great possibility that the shooting will be stopped
‏ Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you. Hello, hello Abdul Hamid.
Hello, hello, God bless you, please relax.
Good morning
Good morning, hello
I am the journalist Eli Monir and I have an appointment with Mr. Hamid, please.
Okay, just take it easy for a bit, he has a meeting.
Mercury makes it possible to exploit design and create a cosmic space
And by the way, we will contact all the correspondents in the world so that they can contact us.
This is your job now, OK
Mercury Artistic Production Company
And discuss its issues in a way that makes the series one of the best works in the history of the world
Do you believe it, who wrote this stuff
If you don’t blush, do what you want.
The eye blushes
Is it really true that we have journalists like this
It is supposed that journalists have principles
Ya'een at you here
What are they doing registering positions
I met the minister’s assistant yesterday, Shaola, do you know how sad I was.
I’m telling you, our series is going to be great, with strange events.
Watch the first episode and share it with people
Hey, what’s up?
Come on mom, I’ve been waiting, this is only the first episode
A child, if he talks to himself, only in Gulf series
And then my mom said, “Stay and slaughter my children, you have it all at your house.”
My dear sons, art is a taste, not a strange case that you bring and generalize it on the society and people
Oh my, this is art, not drama at all, not at all
Oh, don’t blind me.
It seems that Eaglewood is Turkish
No, mom, don’t control me now, at least watch the first five episodes
The series is a failure
It is a shame that our children will see this.
Screw him, my brother, it’s not that bad
There are many series worse than this one
This work, Mr. Salem?
You made a mistake, God!
And every house
Go and get people who understand the dimensions and intricacies of the lines
And present it to them.
It’s not us
Go and حجوا (hajwa)
The minister passed with his documents
I went to greet him
It's us who agreed on the series
Let those who like it, but the happiness of the minister
Zain, let's hear Nasser's opinion.
It is my colleague who made the insults.
I only post messages that praise the series
No never, they are never sick
Tomorrow I will send the written and I will send my own messages to thank for the series and praise and I will start by sending these messages from the readers who sent
God willing
You’re just happy
For this year
We agreed on that
The best TV series in the history of the Gulf drama
They all agree with the minister's envoys
I’m going with you, agreed with the journalists
The headlines, the headlines only
I wish for the rape of conscience
Thank you to the Minister of Information for this series
I wish they would do it again
The first they called me was the minister’s office
You still owe us some money, we’ve sent you the invoice.
They are not to blame, for you are the magical smoker
‏ And you still haven’t seen anything
The truth is that we have now put in our money and made a profit, and the profit was excellent.
And then you see that the series is a failure
The author himself told me, I said, "I regret it.
I’m coming now, I suggest to you a second part of the series.
Minister Traa between you and me
He followed the story of journalism and the false success we made
He said, "You are not comfortable from within because of the series.
It’s impossible for him to agree to a second part
If the minister himself asked for a second part
I cannot
However, I would like to repeat my thanks
To all employees
In this series
And congratulate them on their victory
What They Deserve
The truth is that the Labor won these awards at these prestigious festivals
It is the biggest proof
What do you mean, you say that?
One is not easy.
The golden prize is guaranteed for illiteracy
Ashkan aghayekol
Tell the readers, why do they flatter us and the press, why do they flatter us?
They say there will be a second part, why don’t they say
As long as you have these Arab and Gulf TV festivals, art will be washed
Washing Art
I hear about money laundering

Illicit Money
The same thing, series
What are we going to do with 1 and 2?
How are we going to do it
We signed a contract with them, they should abide by it
Write to them
Our products are exported from Routi in various types, small and big bread, triangular and shaped.
We are deaf and dumb, we signed the contract with them
Two million dollars
What did you do with the Australian baker?
This is the inventor of roti
They told you what product he makes
They said to me that it is roti but what is roti made of that I don’t know
May Allah protect you, roti abgarar
You call it a sandwich
Instead of taking this roti, which you call a simon
This is the thought of the inventor Ayselha
Roti Jeans
This is the secret
You are eating roti with susta
Ya khi dila bi3mlo haqaat gharibe qada
‏This is her dough, processed in a way, since you are the first one to put the dough, I will melt you
And different flavors of Sesta strawberries are Sesta strawberries, catg Sesta coffee
Do you know how much I am invested in this project
Three million dollars with the rights to the patent
Come here, Samh
Yes, Abu Nasser
At your service
And we took the river, O long-lived one
What you say, Samh
They took your son Nasser yesterday to play Mag Korah football with the team he made
I agree with him
The team is not to blame for what happened to us, but the security and the drivers.
And we are considered incomplete because my mother doesn’t have more than one guard, if he gets hurt we will be involved.
And I’m supposed to have a fan club
And when you took the employees who said your mother 17
I told you something.
About the important people in the company
Who forms the company's heart
The baker took the dough from the hospitals
And therefore, all of it is very difficult for the boy
He has a fault, it’s not right, you are a son of a well-known family, it’s not right for you to go and run behind a woman and make the world laugh at us
Whoever wants to play in them, let him do whatever he wants.
But don't take the important people who form the heart of the company
My team has a match and I am missing 4 players
We have no alibis
What is done is done now
Hamdi didn’t come to work today, mister.
I got in the car with him
Qal' al-bas
And Gabonese stopped me in my tracks
The match looked
I didn’t feel anything after that.
They say to me that if a ball comes, I will go, but I don’t remember
So you used to play goalkeeper
Just for the sake of Nasser
There is no power and no might except with Allah
God bless us with this ball and all these trinkets
From today, Nasser
There is no such thing as football
I will cancel your team that you made yesterday
All the bakeries returned
What do you think about that?
Come on, let’s talk about it.
I don’t want to hear anything from you
Please, Mr. Bu Naser
Let's hear what the boy has to say, please.
Just for you, Mr. Ahmed
See what you say what’s wrong with you
We have our last match in the tournament we are playing.
Don’t break his heart, Abu Nasser, please, I beg you, please.
زين يا شباب
Congratulations, congratulations
Good luck
Professor Nasser, I need you urgently
God bless you, my team was on time today
Professor Nasser must
You promised to throw us a party
I will call and book a hall in the hotel for you.
And one day I’ll make the journalists and newspapers come there
No, Rashid, I'll do it at home in the living room.
So that my father can have a dry joy, the players and the victory can make the team continue
They brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought the cup
God hear from you only
Lala saw pictures with the players and they had a press interview together
Wako Jannah Sami, the sports editor, is going to do an interview with him
What a picture!
Don’t go far from me
Oh God, an icon image should appear properly
Why are you so unhappy?
Fai comment on the victory of your sons, the bakers, the two players, the friends, for this great victory
With fighting spirit
And the effort
Bread and Loyalty
Bou Nasser means Lamawakhza, we saw the bakery team score four goals in a row, two
Loyalty to bakeries and its trained line
Thank you, Uncle Abu Nasser
God keep you safe
Here is the guard
‏ The one who has the wealth of the الدوري and the cup is going to meet you
No, this is not the Council's tail
Del Messlaen has sent their representative to meet with you
‏ They brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought the cup
You know, we encourage the youth
God willing, I will witness that you will see it in the future
Yes, bye.
She, ماشالله, your phone doesn’t stop ringing and you’ll be in the newspapers with this ball.
You know what he told me.
He came back and lowered the price of the machine, he said, "Ask for Nasser, the ball."
Now you are famous and the newspapers only put your picture if they write that you are the first sponsor of the international bakeries
I am away from the ball.
What is this talk?
I was in secondary school when I was small
My brother-in-law was playing football.
What are you saying, stay away from the ball
As long as my brother-in-law is playing football, I’m close to the ball.
That means I’m close to sports, that means I’m a sportsperson
‏ According to that, we are no longer the international bakeries, we are the international stadiums
Yesterday I heard him saying that he wants to make a sports club.
Of course, and today we meet the sports manager at the International Bakery, Mr. Bou Nasser
Developing Football
Of course, tell us before the match what your expectations are and before you reach the platform
The match was difficult today
And the team that controls the text line today will be the high heel
Insha'Allah, we are currently contacting professional player agents to develop the International Bakery team
His name is Saud, listen to me, God bless the seriousness and the seriousness, God bless him
Listen to me, dad, the deal that went by was for the players, the shipment that came to us
We didn’t benefit anything
I was giving you the prices
Lower your prices that we sell to the world
What does that mean? Does the Gulf not equal the world
Of course, no.
That's your job.
All you have to do is wait for the Gulf buyer to contact me.
Keep your fax open
Two defenders, one midfielder and one pivot
See, my love, I’m telling you the four players’ tails
Three of them are the head
Two thousand and twenty
Dollar, take them all, give me a jack once
How many 200s do you want? I’ll give them to you in hundreds, 550,000 dollars.
Sweet now, this is for the Arabs, now we’re going to the Brazilian
This is the best player of the season, I will give him a million and two hundred thousand dollars
They put the price on it but I’ll send you the fax where it is, just wait a moment, look, I’m sending you the fax, God protect you from the club in the Emirates
You are the master and the master is your master
‏ Receive
Oh, by God, how he is beating the man
‏ How is that
The knee the knee
The knee is completely fine
We don’t play with the ACL or anything
‏ Ya Bu Nasser
What is this binding muscle
The slaughterhouse is flat, God, you did a great job.
No honestly, Bou Nasser, you’re good, that means the Brazilian and the Africans, may they prosper, may they prosper
God bless you
I say, the store, the store, these cartons, oh my god, the store
Masha’Allah you have a second business
No, just players
Hollow in Izlon Kraitin
Yes, I will take them from the jungles of Africa.
Yes, why?
Karim has one cartoon
These are people like us
It says “Bud” I didn’t hear it
He says these are buds.
Now that we are
Why don’t you give us this bud, do some advertising with them
Hey, dad (بو ناصر), if you took care of it and raised it, it will be useful to you.
Then the team will go, then the cat will meow in the stadium
How many how many how many
‏ Cook, cook for him, cook, cook for him, seriously, it’s so tender
Put it in the appendix, airbone, bye
Whatever you need, all the players are with me.
If the coach of this team understands
Fawzin, we are two zeros, we are dominating the match
Mom, this is a coach in Spain
I don't like it.
The Successful Coach
Who organizes the traffic during the match?
North, for example, this is a reverse line of the Wakhra
To be honest, this is your trainer, don’t let him do whatever he wants.
Yeah, the coach hasn’t been with the team for two months
We need to find a solution with him
If only Koorah understood that the parties weren't standing still for the whole match, they would attack from the depth.
I am sitting on the trap of the infiltration
Oh my god, please don’t blind me.
The supposed withdrawal of Kakonomalawee's father
Wu aihcht shinanwa habbawa hetawalahthawa haawawa aikhlieh
No, no, no, no, not even if he plays.
Shululu Habubu Taba Lawa Khle Ayuli
Any line
According to the plan
And خل هولولو
Something that is not necessary to be necessary to be between the manager and the team coach
And the star of the match today and the star of the team scores a super hat trick. God on you, Jaculamanando
How does it mean we don’t understand football
Listen, Sultan
Let him go home.
No, don’t call any bakeries, let him take a taxi.
Let go of your grudge
God, stay with me on the line
That’s what my father did
The coach made us sit like this
What should I do next?
The team was defeated.
Peace be upon our team
Oh my God, oh my God
No, I’m not awake, he said, come here, you’re divorced. Say, is it true that there was something between you?
I said to my mom the first time I saw him that I didn’t like this guy.
I feel like he is not responsible.
Let’s forget the extra talk and the past
May the spirit of his father rest in peace and tell him the story. Why did your daughter get divorced?
And God, I will tell you, brother Rashid
But what was the reason for divorcing her?
No, it’s not right, O Abu Abdullah, we have to know why the girl got divorced, it’s our right to know.
Please don’t interfere, it’s none of your business.
How come you didn’t interfere and the real one is here in the mill and wants to know why his daughter got divorced
Whoever doesn’t know how to appreciate his partner or respect his feelings
And who is the Barcelona
Don’t blame me, I don’t even know a bit of Spanish
Barcelona is not alone
This is Guardiola’s team
‏That means I’ll go to the real person who is waiting for me in the hall
If you go, I will go too, that's it, stay here, get out of here, you people don't know how to raise their daughters.
Don’t bang the door, don’t shake your head like that.
Why not enough that she left the Barcelona team
Messi, the magician of the ball, who never misses a match without scoring a hat-trick
Maradona said that Messi is better than me.
And your daughter who doesn’t blush in her face makes a mistake on him, look now
Your daughter is neither Barcelonian nor of our cloth
What does this mean?
Listen to me, God will guide you
May your intention be to bear.
He will go and apologize to her and make her happy.
Get lost
And then, praise be to God, there is a lot of good here
Our money will be wasted if we are not happy in it
Oh my!
The condition is that I will marry you only if the girl is from Barcelona.
Oh my god, I’m not bothered
You understand mom, just forget it, it’s gone to hell
Hack, hack, hack, Mom.
You don’t even know, mom, who is the loser.
You are the only one I wish for
Hack him
It broke my heart
Poor, it has been two days since he washed himself
After a marriage that lasted only one month, poor thing
What's wrong with you, you want to get me involved with him
Oh my god, I’m going to mess it up
And you told me all this nonsense that doesn’t make any sense
‏ Don’t worry about it
You don’t know, this might turn out to be a boy from
Ashbi thi
Just give her the money
You are telling me about the building I wanted to buy and turn into a hotel of furnished apartments
Whatever is in Mansoura
His right means that when his son takes our daughter, ask him for the building
And if you could
Talk to her brother.
Listen to me properly
One guy whose father is a millionaire
Do you know what a millionaire means?
The opportunity does not come twice
You know that they have a villa in Spain just so they can spend their summer there every year.
Here we go, let’s talk about Barcelona, how does that mean?
The family might have spread this rumor about him so they could prove that their daughter is innocent
And even if it is true that the real one loves Barcelona and is loyal to Catalonia
His wife is supposed to respect this.
And I won't make a mistake with the team
This if we assume that the story is true
Salim Allah his father called him Bou Bregin because he has two towers on the corniche
They are tied to each other in a strange way, like a rope.
People who see them from afar think they are one tower
You are the best thing that happened to me
God bless who ever that is
May God keep you safe. Give me something to eat, please. May God keep you safe.
Thank you, Darling.
But tell me, my eyes, my son, Abdullah is waiting for your reply
No, O mother of Abdullah, don’t let go, look into my eyes
If I were to magnify the Cooperation Council, I wouldn’t find anyone better than you
Oh God, they are going to present us with their estimates for building the architecture
That's it, I'm done with your requests, whatever you want, Tamr.
Who are they calling you from?
See their requests for the wedding, get the geeg ready and I’ll sign it
In the name of God, what God wills. After your permission, sir, after your permission.
After Abdulla's divorce
Inshallah the children and inshallah the money
May God bless you, my aunt.
You put it on to keep warm
I just don’t know where my mom booked us.
Oh my god, tell me where you booked us?
My mom says she booked us a right in Malaysia
What’s the problem with Malaysia, God?
Bye
Stop spoiling the honeymoon
Please, mother, tell me
Tell me what’s going on, mom
She is very fond of herself
Why does she think she's so great?
Leave her alone, she is arrogant
Oh, you did a great job by sending her back to her family's house
You broke my heart
Hey ama
What the hell is wrong with you?
What happened in it?
May Allah protect you. Don’t forget to bring us some olive oil from Spain with you.
Oh Spain, where are we going?
Any engine
My mom says she booked us a right in the Maldives
It doesn’t matter, mom, Maldives is beautiful too
And I’ll come and visit you, God willing, God bless.
Now I said you are coming back happy from the trip
What's the point of him taking the kids?
Come on, take the bag.
‏ What’s going on between them
What's wrong with you, you are annoying my eyes
Shut up you and whoever you like, you're teaching me about faces, son.
‏ What's wrong with you, mom, what's bothering you
I didn’t see the scales and I got depressed
‏ Only those who annoy you live, oh mother
Just let her go, but divorce her, divorce her, you don’t need her money, your father has a lot of money and there are a lot of girls.
Shut up you and your father and I know him well, what is the problem, why does he have to live in misery
Wake up, mom, call her and divorce her
God has blessed her
And say it three times
You are divorced, moment by moment, you are not divorced twice more
Divorce, divorce
God, he’s so nervous
But, oh mother, go, I beg you, go and rest, and take the worry out of your mind. The girls are fine, as they say. Go, oh mother.
Ooh, problem
Just because he saw her in the club
Hit it, hit it, let me ask him
Shadq 'alayhi yameh khalas talqani qali antai talq talq
He who doesn’t blush, really has no manners
Now, if you go to the party, you have to dance.
And shake G if necessary, there is nothing wrong with it
It’s nothing. What does it mean that the world has turned upside down?
I went to his house now and washed his sails, and then he doesn’t know that you are a girl from
I am I am, O father Abdullah, my daughter is getting divorced
My daughter is getting divorced
She has feathers on her head
You sell and buy them from Toys "R" Us stores
Like how you are burning now on my daughter and my gang
And they did nothing, poor things
What did you give me, the peeled apple, release her
It's normal for you to call them as you wish.
And he swears that Real is good
This is normal for you, fuck it, let it be.
Drink from the glass you drank from the creation of God
And what you don’t like
Don’t do it to people
Do you know, this was the land of the assembly
In a strategic location
Alright, let’s leave it to God
No and a ridiculous price after
I am standing
I need to get the approval of Bou Sakr
Yes, yes, your father went to his office and didn’t find him
He went to him the week before and they told me yesterday that he is traveling.
But I will only smell him tomorrow, after tomorrow, my situation is standing, the problem is I need the approval of Wasekr, I need
A soul for the mill
No no no no, this is official work
May Allah protect you, the office is not the house.
After he eats
Bou Sakhr returned this with a kick
Listen to everyone and have a key for each of them
Say, Abu Fahad
You are what you know
Tell me about yourself. I only know you from the TV and you didn’t tell me that you are married.
But, you know, we don’t have that kind of knowledge
May God cut your talk
God guide you, and you didn’t even believe, you called in advance and came at least ask about this gathering
‏ After there is an occasion, may God guide you
The month has thirty days and it does fifty times make dinner
I suggest, Your Highness, that they put you in the Guinness Book of World Records
The most one in the world who makes dinner
Hey, who is this guy with you?
Hello, may God bless this hour
It is our honor, Your Highness.
Hey you, you son of a farmer
Do you say that Bou Sakhr every day makes a dinner
This is what I see
But, oh you son of a farmer, tonight’s dinner is a special occasion.
Today, God bless you, your son, Falcon
Masha’Allah he deserves it, may God bless you
Congratulations, my son-in-law, I’m so happy for you, my son.
Peace be upon you
شنهو returned
On this occasion, Saqr and my son Imar will choose the car he wants.
I have been waiting for approval for one and a half years.
My current situation
Just when I arrived there
And بخيته
May Allah guide you, my brother Sa’ad
That's how things should be done
He is dead.
Imr al-ma’ariz and chooses the car he likes
We buy for him three
Odik leh
I am your soul
You said you met him last year during the Umrah?
Today his son, little Shahin
Oh, I played in the evenings
This is your chance
He passed by him and blessed him
May he deserve safety, O long-lived one
My dear Falcon
God keep you safe, you people
Alhamdulillah on his safe return, our son Shahin, long life
May Allah protect you and
Except for the brother
You have lived long
You didn’t recognize me
May God protect you from the attraction
I was with you for a long time in Umrah
Until I mentioned I bought a red snorkel
I am God, may He protect you.
I was in the hospital
My brother-in-law is one of our sons
And I am honored to meet you
Here, Saqr is still hesitating whether to enter the field of trade or not
I want him with you, my friend
Why, يا (ya) mom, Saqer, is trade good?
You never set up a desk and look
Bou Sakhr
Don’t make me wait, just say it.
شنهو returned
I have a gift from Saqr
Full role
And if trade loves you and you have it, you will tell her that you don’t.
Today, someone like you has everything. You got your license, thanks to God, and the world has opened up to you. A free car and the best office on the Corniche.
Yesterday, Bou Abdelaziz said to your father that if Saqr wants to enter the business, he will make him my partner with 50%
Oh my God, how can I reconcile trade and university
Oh my God, don’t force me to do something I don’t like
And ماشالله عليك اتحذف عليك الوكالات والمكاتب والسيايير ابلاش
Opportunity, my son, in these times, now is the time to start trading without capital
You are your people’s love for your father.
Be smart and invest
Believe me, son, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
O God, prepare breakfast quickly.
What God! He has arrived, rent and pepper.
He doesn’t have anything, he doesn’t have anything. Tomorrow I’m afraid he’ll take the agency of the sambos.
Ajouf waldj anfatha nasfih lil baznss
This is what you were hoping for. Do you know what to say to me today?
Tell mom I want to expand more after the investment
He wants to put his hand in the Caribbean Sea and invest in the islands there.
And it is away from the eyes of the envious
Last night you told me that your son just entered the business.
He has twenty agencies, six restaurants and is a shareholder in two banks
And I gave him the elbow grease that he doesn’t deserve a certificate or a name
It seems, God knows, that it has not been opened yet
Oh, that guy from the northern part of our office is such a mess
I just miss it
God bless you, may he bless you. Congratulations Abbas
In the name of God
‏ God bless you
Hain ad ma iveed al-nadam
What dad, what a whole year of hardship and fatigue, set up the supermarket
What's the story, the next day he will come to the deadline
That secretary, Samir, gave me this sugar.
Tell him, Saqr, son of بوسقر (Bousqr), wants to be your partner instead of taking the shop from you.
After he comes, you will have a partner with him
There is no power and no might except with Allah
But I’ll see if you start talking to him
He asked me who my brother is
He killed him with a gun.
Why are you telling him that you have an Iranian baker?
When we were walking past this shop, there wasn't a small sign with what was written on it, what was the name that was written on it
Al-Farij Bakery
No, I want a different name
And the peace be upon you
How is the work with you?
Your Highness, Inshallah tomorrow or the day after tomorrow we will finish the workers’ housing plan for the Future Company.
Miss La La is my wife, Ali. Do you know Mr. Sar, the owner of the company?
Hi, how are you?
Let her take one of the company's cars
‏ Thank you very much, you’re great
Even cooking is a WhatsApp science
Today one of these guys comes to you and says that he works in the business field and has some riyals and wants to invest them
But this between us has no knowledge, nor expertise, nor study in economics or even in trade
One like this
I think he will fail, I think he is wasting his time and he will lose.
I heard, O Bu-Nasser
I heard them say that on Monday.
Such talk
This is you and my Falcon, God bless him.
Juffah, ماشالله عليه
Juffah today
Long life, we are not talking about your son, Falcon
We are talking about Al-Qaeda
Your son, Saqr, ماشالله عليه وعيني عليه بارده, is an exception.
He said, "Talk about Al-Qaeda.
Khara’na, Saqer and my son built himself
Kahoo gave him a car once as a gift
Sell it and invest the money and advise him, he himself
And ماشالله ka ka jaftooh
Ya abu sar, we are talking about normal people
And one of them, that's exactly what they did with him, Abu Nasser took him and put his hand on the trigger.
What a talent, he has a commercial talent
The Economics of Compulsion
We have to ask who his father is.
It is a sin that I am, God, surprised
‏ What God has willed
The Gulf Money Magazine in the Economic Referendum
‏ Please
And peace be upon you, hello hello, safe.
May it not be evil.
God knows, I don’t know what to tell you, Salim
Yes, tell.
I read the whole story
The company says they sent a fax to your father.
And they said to him, “It is enough.”
I can’t stand the pain
Like what you see
He says, "The first thing he did when he heard the news..."
It fell in the office and the fax is broken
And He has a privilege over Him
O, he who taught him archery, when his arm grew strong, he threw me.
What did the doctor say now?
Pray for him, Salem
I am shocked
What a world!
A man gives to the poor with his right hand without his left hand knowing
This association, of course, channels donations to all Muslims in all parts of Asia and Africa
But I would like you to also explain to us, my lord, about your goals and future steps, God willing.
‏ In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Our goal at the Falcon Charity Association is to achieve mutual support in this ummah.
In addition to 60 Bernoots for the victims of the earthquake in Pakistan
This and also, last but not least, we are now helping seven poor families
A monthly salary of only 232 shekels
Lala, we’re not late for you.
And then follow your own beak
You are my life
This is Khalid and his wife, they are inviting us to the hotel tonight
Oh yes, oh yes, any place, any place, as long as it's with you, I'll be happy there.
May God make you my life
You, my love
This is my livelihood

What else?
I need to hear a word from you, I need to hear it, turn it into my ear.
‏ Hi Nora
Alnouda is upset with you
Why did I make you angry?
Inshallah, good
Why are you upset?
Nora Amnaiah fistans amبسيط and simple
Don’t say that, you’ll make Na’oud upset.
Why are Lebanese people so sweet
You still don’t get it and you’re giving and taking a lot with him
And I also want to go
Even the sweetest lips for the sweetest girl
They will call her a name and then say to her, “Noora.”
Free is what’s left for him
My batch is 20,000 and yours is 20,000 rials
Amwaadhin Mabrouk inshallah
God is with you
Hello, your excellency, Mrs. Saleh
Hi Fadi, you look busy, I don’t want to keep you.
My eyes are present
Hello hello
You received the message yesterday
You stink
And I liked the joke
Okay, did you bring the design with you
I didn’t have time to do them, show me your designs and I’ll choose from them
Frankly, your taste is the best
Let us work envy again
The day came when the project went perfectly and he started to enter good.
He says there is a project like mine.
Design and tailoring shop
Women’s clothes
This is Bou Nasser who has nothing to do with trade
Your son is present.
My uncle's son
Of this kind these days
‏ My cousin's son
Do you believe I am sleeping, they kept me awake saying your cousin wants you.
Insha’Allah, a matter of spoiling
Inshallah, it will be good
If only
Whoever wants to do a project, for example, for example
‏ Just be it, yaa, do you want a partner or something
I heard, they say, that you are going to... I said, I will drop by.
Hello
And if you want more of it
Alhamdulillah, the work is excellent
What should I do, Mr. Saleh?
We’re just late, pay him for last week.
Oh yes, God!
God willing, take care
He remains
Are you sure?
And the details and you don’t know the big blue
What next?
It is a shop next to your shop
Oh, the envious, the hater
Before I knew the market was open to everyone
I need to know
Your heart should be open for your cousin's son.
May I ask you
Disguise, attract, and laugh at me and what will you do to me
I want to do my work in silence
You are taking the place of a sticky label in my shop that got ruined on me
God knows it’s true, but they didn’t say come here and sit on my neck towards the wisdom tooth to wait for me
This is envy, this is hatred, God knows, God knows, you are full of hatred, calm down about it.
Come on, you people
Come on, يا بو صالح
I will kill you, I swear I will kill you, you son of a bitch.
I stretched my hand like you did and you kept it, I kept my meal.
Ava ya jam’a
‏Oh my people, pray for the prophet
I didn’t do anything, God, God
Aib advised me, a designer from the Philippines
No one will tell you.
Why, why, why, why Lebanese?
He talks, jokes and chats with them and they relax at the end
See you, my good man, with a Lebanese
He kept telling me and convincing me
He enchanted me with his words
He convinced me and let me pay 12,000 rials
And after two days, God be with you, I’m going to the auction market and I’ll find the twin there, 900 riyals.
And the money?
Get a Lebanese designer
Can I meet the professor? You said it was difficult to meet him, but you said the same about the Nile.
Yes, today is also very difficult.
I think that Abu Saleh has changed in the last two days.
What's it about?
I don't know what's it about.
Abu Saleh is very tired psychologically after his cousin opened a shop and brought a Lebanese designer like him
I’ve been out of business for two weeks.
What is the problem here in Ghatr, there is no Ghatr who opens a shop except for another Ghatr to come and open the same shop next to it, can I enter?
No, with the designer Fadi Hla and he is thinking of a solution
How like this now
We are in heaven, eating.
If we stop eating junk food, I think we won’t even enter the shop to rent it.
A place far from them means
That means sweep the ground for them
Anzein, delivered and how much is the discount
They should be ashamed, God forbid that you give with every wedding dress evening gowns for free
Screwed my people
What happened? I’ll go to the shop where you put down the deposit today. They put an advertisement with two evening gowns for the price of one. And there’s an additional 25% discount.
Oh God, let’s go, let’s go
No and now wait for two weeks, they will be releasing the same dress again, make two dresses for one wedding and get two dresses for free with a 25% discount.
They are fighting us
I’m thinking the same, because tomorrow if we leave them they will destroy our house.
It doesn’t matter.
What next?
This is a challenge and I thank him
I don’t know
Well done, you’re the best thing that’s ever happened to the poor guy. No one else would provide for him.
Oh, you better go to Al Khobar in two or three days, or else go there once.
Well done
‏ Stay, stay, sweet, sweet, I’m coming to you now, coming, God willing, peace.
What's going on
Saad says the shop doesn’t smell good, he says he doesn’t know where it comes from.
The smell has nothing to do with the AC no
I won’t buy it from the shop before at least six days
100%
Ya, valليل
Cut the electricity supply to the shop.
This is fair
Now you sign a pledge or we make a case and open a file
Atsu-i desu ka?
Eradicating it from existence
Hey, Uncle Bonasser, something strange is happening, no one is entering the shop
My uncle Bou Naser is very sweet to me, he's coming to me, I'll tell you something strange
Akoh and he is lying on his bed
I was afraid to tell him that the bank called and wanted the installments.
He was burdened with debts because of his uncle’s son, the miserable one.
What happened to Zain this time?
And so if they entered the store by mistake and saw the designer Saad, scream in his face and run away from him
I ainam and upon him what he ate nodule embqq eyes and look at the ceiling
What did my mother do to me?
Saud is in the shop
What did my mother do to him?
If you see him, the women will make up stories about you.
My mother what did she do
I lost, I lost
Give me a lot, okay?
I’m afraid they will jail me
And I don’t have any documents against him to go and complain about him
I don’t know what they did, I don’t know what they did
Let him deserve it
And whoever delivers it to you, tell him what magic did you do to him, you made the designer turn into a monster and women if they see him will be afraid
A rumor came out about him
I mean, what can I do, guys? Tell them, guys from the photography team, they really need you
Guys, if God wills, tell him they really, really need him
God, they are killing me, they are going to chop me, it's not right, Mr. Abdullah
Ali Ahmed Habibi, don’t get so angry like that, you are a man of heart, this won’t do for you, dad.
And, by God, I called him so many times, he hurt me, but it was of no use. This extra is going to drive me crazy, he is going to drive me crazy.
You don't do anything, you do everything in my brain.
Jauf عاد با با باحط الحره فيك
Halalah, twenty-four scenes, twenty-one, God willing, Ya Ahmed, we want to finish
And then, I mean, I’ll stop the shooting so that the extras don’t
This is a shit production
Medicine, what is my problem, Professor Abdulla, why does he upset me like that
My love, no one will bother you.
What is happening to Abdullah?
A late and floundering extra
Ya Ahmed, I don’t want any one, my love.

They are doing everything in a hasty manner, in God’s will, but they are acting

Are you serious?
I didn’t hear what the director said
I have one, God help you with it, God willing, it will be useful.
SS Saud Aknar
Saud Qawati, it was Saud Aknar who told me
This is how it was, when he was small they used to call him Asaud Aknar, and when he grew up they called him Qowati.
What is this can?
I’m telling you why the poor guy was walking around in the streets picking up cans and selling them by the kilo
My brother, wealth and dignity are not bad.
It has to fit him, you know, he told Amdouh like that, and there’s no height or width.

Medicine, what are you waiting for? I want to talk to him.
I don’t have the number.
But I’ll take أمير with me and go to him
Where is Saud Quti's house
What does that mean?
Shut up, shut up
Saoud Qatati
There is no one by the name of Saud Qotay in our neighborhood
Amble, I’m sure he’s in the neighborhood but I forget which house.
This is one house called Saud living alone with his mother
Okay, right
But this is not Saud Qatati
This is a Saudi laptop
Sure, it’s just evolving with time, it’s not like the laptop is half-full.
He is tall, strong and a little brown
Cancel all the reservations and start to repress the laptops of the earth, oh God, oh God, oh God, oh my
He is going to the green market to buy it for me and the second one
And God knows, I don’t know
This is all a sham
I have a second one, where is my second turban at?
right
This is what I’m looking for, where is it?
Fax and Boufas
Mom will break it if she sees it, so fry it a little bit first.
But these two days are too much for me.
Oh my God, calm down from yesterday, I’m worried about you, take me to the emergency room, take me to the emergency room, don’t you say no.
Oh my God, they told me he would give me
Alhamdulillah, this is what I’ve been waiting for, dad, thank God
Oh God, mom, bye
She kept picking fights with you, acting stupidly, looking up.
‏ Keep moving a little, and take the camera with you, move your feet
Yeah, Ja'far, yeah
Whose laptop is this
Ayoud Al-Rial is a big actor, Abdullah Al-Lma'a
This is how it is for you, for me, my son, Fatou Abdou, how are you?
How are you, the servant?
But just calm down, you’re making a scene, act a little more decent in front of people
Any son of Freijna
‏ Calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down. Oh, my God.
I love acting, God willing, they give me a role.
And God my brother, you don’t know
God damn it, I didn’t sleep last night, man.
Asthma, God heal
God heal her
I’m in my spring
Professor, professor
He has asthma tools, my god, my mother's right.
No doctor
Come on, listen to what he says, you have no case.
Shasm amma thi
F*ck you! What do you think?
I heard what you said about me
You say it’s light, let it get a little heavier
Give me, give me, give me, give me, half a million to fix my car.
And give him three million, get me dinner
I only asked you why are you talking like that
Because I am heavy according to the requests of some people
Juff, you are a stupid, our Freija is producing actors of a high level
Currently excellent, meaning it is suitable for the role
Sweet, and I’ll help you too. I’m not watching, I don’t have anything.
Hey, are you selling your house?
God, I’m in spring
Take Mr. to the make-up room and do his make-up, and Salman, God willing, will get him to pick out your clothes and get you ready.
Walk walk walk, it’s so cool
I I
Listen, brother, leave the car with us until we finish shooting, and I’ll call you when we’re done so you can come and get it.
It doesn't matter, just make sure someone gets to me.
Will you deliver it to me? I’ll let Adriel deliver it to you. Thank you, brother. You’re welcome. In a moment.
Oh God, they called your wake-up call, this extra called him
Guys, call Saud to the make-up room
Come on, man, clean your teeth
It is written in front of me
Oh God, let’s say
I’m done with it
I didn’t think you could do it.
What are we waiting for?
We are not silent about our rights
‏ Just wait
And know my opponent, Bou Abdelaziz
Damn, why did he divorce her, damn
Just divorce her
And we don’t take a thief’s daughter
No, what I need is your opinion.
When you’ve cleaned up, then, the important thing is that you get ready to go into the changing room to change your clothes and we’ll be ready for the photoshoot.
Expensive dental care
You mask, the scene was filmed earlier
Medicine why
What's the point of coming, bro? I'm so bored. My stomach is bloated. What is this? We've been waiting for an hour. When will it be?
‏ Mom, I haven’t seen anything like this before, it’s normal.
God bless you
Inshallah, quickly
May God keep you safe, long life.
A high ladder
They say that بوعبدالعزيز (Bu-Abdul-Aziz) sends you his regards
God willing, long life to you, God willing
‏ Sweeties
Ashuraq Islamun 'alayk, they love your nose
For the first time someone loves me on my nose
How do they love them on their nose
Problems
His nose was like a lollipop. Your lips are so beautiful.
And God, after you didn’t make me laugh
Come on
means the best actor
May God protect you, what’s wrong with your voice
Mom, mom, I’m tired, wait for me.
Come here fast
Hello Sheikh, hello
Hey, man, look here or I’ll look for you on my own
Listen to me
Yes, God!
I send you my regards
What’s wrong, mom?
And peace be upon you. What is it? Long life to you.
Leave me alone
And don’t worry, Inshallah, you’ll be Dr. Hassan, come, come.
Hey Dr. Hani, what’s up?
Let your highness rest in the office
‏ It didn’t happen
‏ Everyone will get up safely, God willing
Please, please, please, my lord, please.
Shut up or I’ll slap your face
I am congratulating my name Bouabdellah
Call me, say uncle.
‏ How are you, uncle?
By God, on this face
Yes, my lord.
Please, sir, take a seat and relax.
‏ May God bless you
With the chef
May his soul rest in peace, Professor Rushod
And God knows, they didn’t do anything to me, tell me and show me.
Hey mate, can I get a doctor fast?
Dr. Amy is sick and
Wait your turn, your turn
Listen to me
‏ Can I help you?
‏ Mom, hurry, I’m tired
Yeah, with all your trips to the hospital, you didn't even see one of them, and they're nice, they'd be happy with the least thing.
مب like country girls
Don’t touch the local girls
Grow up and find one at the hospital
I am in a bad mood.
Just give me a look, ya brother.
Stop, you’re getting close to her, make her laugh, embarrass her, give her your number and your intentions are good.
There is nothing.
‏ Take care of yourself
wala rooh wada maroh broh kalm siورتi 3asan atkalem mak
No, I don’t want anything.
No need for leaks
I am Asan Khatri.
No, thanks.
You can take it and go.
Whoever talks to you, he is good at the roasted meal
Will you marry him?
Lala khala I want the chaste and I want the clothes and I want the car after renting it from you
So that you get your salary
No, just a moment
O God
What is this, a flat, roasted, sun-burnt thing?
Hello and welcome, God bless whoever is speaking to me, hello
O my refuge, what my eyes saw last night
But I wish you would come
I say, be impressed by what I did for them, it was a very classy and special party.
One normal and one diet
Malj is back with an excuse now
What is this?
Oh my god, I’m meeting my quarter at work tomorrow
God willing, you will give this to them
What is this?
Noura come here
What is this
He’s doing this to his friend for no reason
Atudhi btakli nas kolha etklam ana
Give me some money and I’ll go buy you something nice.
But I’ll meet them now
I need to take him to the vet tomorrow.
Now we are opening a shop, change your clothes so we can go and buy something from eBay and get it here in front of people.
What's wrong with you, God?
And its price is suitable and its quality is very good.
Above average means not the best type
And even if it's chocolate for chefs, sorry, I thought you might want the right price
After the eyebrows, the price is high, why? After you took our money for the most expensive
It's not possible to check this artistic touch
This is the chocolate of the royal family
The same chocolate that the Royal Palace in Spain always asks for
Give me this
Congratulations and by the way, it also comes with a warranty certificate.
Come, come, rejoice
Come on, man, give us some of this chocolate, man.
What’s the matter, wolf?
No صالح عبدالقادر who is in the accounts
‏ Congrats, he deserves it, come over after, give me one, come over
And get the coffee fast
My aunt went to their wedding
Oh my love, I went to their wedding, it was a failure and so sad, do you believe my sister
I heard your aunt’s words
For that reason I want to make you a wedding, if it happens or not.
There is nothing left, I have only one and a half months left.
I am arranging everything
But just leave me alone
You live in society, don’t you see people who are getting married put their problems aside.
I saw your soul
When you bought something nice, you saw how they praised you and praised your taste.
They didn’t tell you it’s amazing and sweet
OK, but how much did we pay?
The money we paid for the coffee should buy four sheep for the wedding.
And whoever gives you peace, you don’t interfere. Your mother knows how to do everything. All you have to do is give her the money.
It means they are in agreement with anything we choose.
And you really have no taste
What do you think about the hell-house?
But discrimination costs more money
Zain, why, why did it go? It was beautiful.
What do you think of this?
For the first time in the history of Qatar, someone is thinking of making a computer desk in the shape of a computer
With your permission, cook
See, you talk about everything except the trash and preparations. This is the place where women who have nothing to do but talk sit. Shut up!
The Real is waiting for us
We need this expensive trash can
Strange Yard
Guess the model 2001
We got the luxury car
Take a deep breath for your own good
‏The important thing is that you choose, if you are going to add 20,000 to the Ark of Noah, and if the price of the car is 100,000 and 25,000
Arروا and we are ready
You are not the first one to get married
Think about getting married in the Comoros, because these are the country's cables
No, we’re just at the beginning after
If you want a couch, where will the bride sit in her magic?
Iron, paint and some wood
And people are happy
They exploit us and lie to us, these are swindlers in the first place
And what does that mean now
Amṭanqur wa zعلān
Do you want to get married, for good?
Talk to the bride’s mother and tell her that Saleh has difficult circumstances.
He can’t afford the wedding expenses, so he doesn’t want to get married. I want to talk to her, I will talk to her, for real.
We received today a shipment of roses from Holland
I put them on the tables at the wedding
It's definitely the first time in Doha
The Middle East After
Put it on the bill
means, how much more
Two seventy-two, that is salvation
But here is Samir, I don’t want to see this line-up at any of the weddings
I will know what people say after that
Consider it booked.
You get more salary than me.
The door that you don’t know how to close is opened
God help you, Saleh
But you, God guide you, I tried to put things straight a little
But I, thanks to God, have decided to go and see a decent girl from any Arab country
He says there is a wedding party and it will not cost you more than 1,000 dollars and jump.
God bless you my love
Inshallah next month is his wedding
Just specify a few cards and tell me
It was just that the cards were delayed, the important thing is that people know where and when they are invited.
This is all that concerns you, what people are going to say doesn’t concern you.
People know the level of the wedding from the invitations
I just saw these cards, what do you think people will say?
She went to their wedding, while these are their cards, they didn’t see the cards of Aflan and Aflan.
We didn’t say that, we just ordered it from the internet
Its cover is a panda bear cloth and it has a G-shaped button.
Don’t blame me, I don’t care about you.
I’m not a doctor for women’s problems, we ask for the cards, we ask for them
God, you really break my heart, my brother
Poor, I’m sure they are squeezing him
Real, no one has borrowed from you
What do you say about the fact that he sold his car
I saw him in the morning, twenty years ago, walking and talking to himself.
Don’t blame him, my poor brother, I swear I don’t know when we’ll develop.
Close the door and don’t worry about it
Forgive me, my brother
That means you didn’t even try to convince them that you were having a wedding befitting your status.
What do you mean, like me?
Why am I living alone?
The problem is that our society is sick of appearances, showing off and boasting.
You have to be sick in the same illness
If you want to live in it
‏ Once I saw the bride’s mother’s right
I only want my clothes
Leave it to God
Just say
How did you get married?
And my father wants to marry me to Minon
And then, brother, even if I decided to get married
I’m thinking of taking a foreign language or even an Arabic one
Oh yes, tell me about your country
God, we had decided to get a DJ for the songs
But Mrs. Nasser’s daughter-in-law brought the right thing for her son’s wedding, that singer.
This singer is famous but I forgot his name
Shify madh al-boz
Hell doesn’t even like what I’m doing.
He sold his car and one of his friends picks him up every day.
He entered the room and found him talking to himself.
I see that your words have changed now
So my brother Saleh is tired, that's it.
I don’t care about him or him about me.
I am not inferior to people
Don’t leave us in the park
And the one who gives it to me, oh mother, but my brother spent all he had and didn’t leave anyone who would lend him.
And if he gives it to me, I’ll keep quiet about you
My mother has new requests for my wedding and my brother told her that he will cancel the wedding, I don’t want to get married anymore
Here it is where
Inside Iswon there are first aid kits
He says now it’s better but they will find her a room in the hospital
The shameful couple
You are annoying me, my sister
Dr. Qalj don’t talk and don’t give you an injection so you don’t go to sleep.
And he rests while he lets us suffer for what is worth and what is not worth.
I’ll tell him to bring us Abdullah Arwishd, he’ll say I don’t have any money
And therefore to your mother
He was afraid for her.
A soul has a soul, kiss her on the head
And tell her to do whatever she wants.
Peep for Abdullah Arwishd
Boyoussef, I don’t think he will be short with me
You bastard, you couldn’t find anyone but Boyoussef
Fix it, okay.
You are a joke, Saleh
But Minister Amkhlieh, because Real Shibe and above all that he is disciplined and honest
I think you should tell him what you told me. There's a big chance his heart will stop.
I understood
So that the crappy crisis you went through, you want to ask Boyousouf for money, of course from the ministry’s money
God knows when you will return them
Hey, if they come in, ask the auditing team about the money.
It can go to hell, of course.
No one knows, and if he knows, he knows how to act
God knows how the real you are in your office while you are carrying the responsibility if something happens
In my old age, I steal
My father calls it embezzlement
In the first flight
In the box, there is a blue strip and in the circle there is something like the picture of a dove, he says, he says.
Inshallah my uncle my uncle Boyoussef if it's not my turn it's hard
Return it all
Ismony Boyوسف
You are the last of my life
F*ck you, Khamis
Saleh Saleh
OK, listen to the words, God, if it was someone else, you would be in trouble or something would happen, oh, oh, oh, Khaled
Saleh Saleh
All the roads I tried were of no use, my dear boy, I am drowning already
I can’t back out of the wedding now
And these I know them all bald
What's wrong with you, what's wrong with you
Lala, the second terror
Up the stairs, up the stairs
My uncle Boyousf, the stairs are full of apples, any of them
The Gothic one with the picture of Real on it is scary
We booked two rooms for us but only for make-up and hair
And we’ll be there in the morning
Yabna Abdalla Arishd and his band
You will see, my love.
I didn't tell you that.
The Season's Bomb
We are the first people to use it in the world
Oh my God, oh my God
God be with you, bye
There is no god but God.
Oh my God, don’t forget to read the Fatiha when you enter the hall.
Women, their eyes are hot
I told you that it’s great.
The sweetest groom, ماشالله, I’m so proud of you
Oh my God, the police are knocking on the door
I was wrong to obey you, God.
Today is my wedding day
Oh the audit money yaa
Oh God, let him go to jail
Boyseef boyseef boyseef
It's people now
But it's a shame, man, if this happens
The company presented a contract of three million, two million of which is just the value of the materials.
He wrote a memo to the minister
We said about corruption but it still reaches the level of corruption
You are an idiot, you are not living in this world
Here, the minister said what about عثمان
And our manager, why didn’t he protest, they say he had
I don’t know, God knows.
Where is morality?
What was right is wrong and what was wrong is right
Oh Saad, are you sure that the minister Fancha? Guys, what's happening in the world?
Vانشه وبس
What’s next?
The King Dismissed the Minister
And this girl is in a relationship with the minister
God, the world
What's wrong with you, you don't know it?
This is the new employee that the minister appointed in place of عثمان مسكين
Walk walk walk
Askint if I should do it or not, Saleh, oppose the minister
What are you?
Listen to me, dad
We have children, we want to live
O prophet, let us live
What happened?
There is a poor man standing at the traffic light.
The last of loyalty and honesty, my brother Saleh
Jan Zain we can do something for you, my brother
Alhamdulillah, alhamdulillah, for everything
What’s wrong with you, Saleh
From this strange Halia, our grandfather enjoyed this world
Angoufa shia ma ayssadha al-aql

I want you to go to the supermarket and get us the ingredients for the salad and then go home.
‏ Try God, bye
Who got my sister to the house?
And then Qadeem laughed and told stories and who’s that
This is my colleague with me at the university, what's wrong with her if she arrives normally, that means
And oh my god, you didn’t believe me, what’s wrong with you, you’re like the first one
What do you say?
What do you hear us say
Your thinking is old
There is new and old in right and wrong
Right is right and wrong is wrong
The world has developed, we are living in the era of technology
The Age of Global Variables that Combine the World and Nobody Can Keep Up
We have seen and heard
Don’t blame me, Amna, it’s forced on one if he gets upset and angry.
What he sees in a day
Tell her I’m sorry
The world is not going well
Zain, don’t bother yourself and come have lunch.
Let me go and sleep and rest.
Papa, isn’t Zaleean upset?
Papa, there is no salt
There is no one sad, get up, wash your face and eat breakfast.
Oh my love
I am very keen to meet the deaf person on my first day of work
It is our honor, Your Highness.
Sure, sure.
Of course I know that you don’t need anyone to remind you about the basics of work
But at the same time it is very important
We are restoring some of the values and principles that were lost
In the Public Interest
Presumably, Your Highness
We all need it
The looter is necessary, O Great One.
You are thieves
Thank you, thank you all
And what I want to say after
And beware of my first day at work
There is one employee among you
A loyal, devoted and dedicated person and all this free time stuff
Just a Doubt
There is an honest employee.
So that we can take the 10 necessary legal procedures in our ministry
Don’t cheer up, my lord.
Hamda Allah, we are all thieves
Greetings to my colleagues, in front of them and behind them, I say.
Where is Khaled
Yes, my lord.
Khaled, you’re very good, God bless you
God willing, long life to you
God knows, you chose well
God guide you
Why did you let the devil fool you?
Say, “Alhamdulillah, it came to the administration.”
Oh my God, why is my father in jail?
Shut up, mom
No repentance
Oh my God, why is my father in jail?
Your ugly head
It means he is the secretary
It’s not right to say that about your father Amin
This is a dress
Every body is covered
The World’s Shifty Leaders
And God willing, you will find me a job from anyone who can get me a job like this
In a decent way, she covers her body and charms
And suffocate me in my chest after I am wearing it, it is suffocating her
I want her to fuck me
And then you bring it to her, I want a shirt and pants that show her midriff above the bed
But Mamish no use, you don’t want to walk the straight path
That’s what I’m saying
Don’t blame yourself
We are going to marry our daughter Sara to your son Rashid.
One of us is ashamed of his son-in-law these days, except the straight one
And Rashid Aldai, I have good news for you
You are good real
Take the hero out of his room
24 hours drunk
Drunk, tit and all day amnشم
And the Arabid is not to be asked about
And yes, good upbringing, Abu Rashid
And after that, a hypocrite!
And how is the trumpet
Original, my son, and what about drugs
What is written from the end, I will give you five riyals if you find a black eye for it, make a competition for it
Come on, dad, let’s go to ask for her hand in marriage.
He knows how to brag and brag
A proper girl
May God bless you, my son, may this be the year of life, may God bless you
I am drunk.
And I can’t walk
Oh my God, my father
God, bye bye
Kid, call your father so he can come and pick you up.
Call him to see
So that he can come and take you

Hello my daughter, my love, Mona
Majeed, his name was Abdul Aziz
What justice
My daughter, scratch me.
And you know that since the establishment of the Palestinian state with its capital in Jenin in 1999 after signing the comprehensive peace with the state of Israel
Israel still practices terrorism, pressure and siege on it
The latest allegations by Israelis and their Arab friends against Palestinians
They are smuggling plastic knives through the tunnels
Especially the second paragraph, article f, which states that the Palestinian people must cut their nails every day.
We are now moving to the fateful meeting
Mr. Cheap
When Israel agreed to the establishment of the Israeli state
Dude, what are you saying, dude? How are you going to ruin our reputation? Leave me alone.
Please
Sorry Mr. Nimer, sorry Mr. President
Let me say a word
It fully committed to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement
What is this Israeli delegate talking about
Elakwa about anything stone or plastic as a commitment from us
Even our houses, man
What do you call us, you Gulf people?
Throughout Palestine, made of wood
American companies make wooden cars for us according to agreement
All the doors in our houses are made of heat-treated wood, dude.
We don’t want speeches
Don’t change the subject
Mr. President
This is an important point, please vote on this matter as nail grooming is a violation of the convention
The agree raises his hand
But I had a strange dream
So that I can control the students
I wanted to tell him.
This is the fourth school I’ll be attending tomorrow
I’ve been assuming my strong personality as a teacher from the beginning
The boys were chasing him and tearing his clothes while he was silent.
I came many times without a headscarf
Their manager said
Rashed Tibi We don’t want to separate him
They drew on the children with chalk
Wairon put his hat on in the plain in front of the whole world
And they said this is a teacher with a weak personality, he will ruin us all
I tell them the story of the cat
Maryamعاد
And what is this after the story of the cat, this is new, no one told me
He said to him, "You are a complete ass on the chair.
And he sat
And he doesn’t know about the story
Except for a dry day, the kids will laugh at it in the schoolyard
Stop it already
Your manager who works there called me tomorrow
But we will give him a chance anyway
So that I can wait for my father I will tell you
The time of kindness and weakness is over
Hey, your uncle's son, Abdullah
I will get a different Rashid
And what I need is to remind you of the important educational saying
You are a graduate of education and I am a graduate of education.
We all know the saying
The teacher is the son of his first class
You will be examined, Mr. Rashid the strong
And the one who wants to make a mistake
Oh no!
The first thing he said to me was, shut up, you beautiful bastard, what would you say to him?
Broyj Ashbāqūlā
Who of you is being sarcastic and said shut up well
You told me to shut up nicely
Not me
You bastard!
Go to hell, the manager
And he said, Professor Rashid fired me.
I don’t want to see a patch here, I hear.
You are irritating me
It's supposed to be like this not just the first day but all year long
Oh no!
Whoever hears his voice
And I explain or I talk
Do you know what it means?
Nervous, do you know what nervous means?
means nervous
Did you hear me say something or no?
I heard him after that.
Go out of the class.
The Ghost of the CEO
God take your stuff and leave
Take your stuff
Oh my God, it’s beautiful
Sure, he is still looking for it.
No sir, we didn’t see it.
Ice cream with milk if there are strawberries inside and it is very sweet, you have to try it.
My beloved Abdul Rahman
You see, every human being is prone to error and man.
Gashmare yabe
It just means that the most important thing is the topic, so it doesn’t reach the father.
I want the cocoa in my bag.
Here and there, your here and your there, and where is your bag?
In class
mm from my eyes
Are you saying that God is pleased with you?
You don’t know how to tell the difference between a real man and an ordinary one
How does the goat look? The goats are red.
Come here where are you going
In the bathroom
And you are in the bathroom
Hurry and knock on the door, and tell him that the first class is starting in half an hour, God hurry!
I am one juice and one plaster before them all
I took all their hearts because of their need, my friend Abdulrahman. This is really good for health
Now go to Saud and get the PlayStation tape from him
So what do we learn from this story?
Man
He must be of noble character.
This is the money for the playstation and he said after that he will give me the whole playstation back all at once
Inshallah, Tamr شي after my friend Abdulrahman Rifi
Now no
We learn from the story
Of course you know that I will leave this week because I received the acceptance for the graduate studies
So I said I need to submit the event file before I travel
How did you say that the time Abdul Rahman said to me, I don’t know where he wants to go but he didn’t tell me the time
My dad went on a trip and didn’t say anything, thank God I’m free.
What I gave him this afternoon made him angry and he didn’t say the truth about his father. No, no, no, no.
Hello, my name is Abdul Rahman.
God help you
What shall we do?
So sweet like that
Oh my God, kids, we are going to have a new lesson in science
Peace be upon you
Thank you, thank you.
My father May
I didn’t ask for what I asked for from my eyes
Professor Professor, how do you ask the professor a hundred
In the class, he goes to fetch water for a student, you are his helper, no, no, this matter will not pass easily, I will write it in the report.
You are also sarcastic
Don’t raise your voice and don’t yell at me, hear me or not.

Change your style with me

We didn’t say anything.
What is this?
Listen, things are going well, it’s better for you.
We were not threatened in our home
What's the use and I want to rest
What are you still saying
Instead of what the hell does it mean
You look like you want to
I want to know how are you, OK
Hurry, hurry
Ha ha, like that, fine
It doesn’t matter how.
Fariq Abu Hawwa
We are coming to Uncle Bonayf’s so we can talk, not scream.
Who is Rashid, acting in the neighborhood however he wants
You made me talk
Okay guys, let’s be quiet so we can hear what Uncle Bonayf has to say
Now this shit that's not worth a penny plays with your nerves
Leave me alone
If you give him a slap, he’ll stick it to the umbrella he made
The game is played with its people
That’s beautiful
With the, take care
You haven’t seen anything yet
You know he has a jewelry store.
Ajوفا wearing rings and chains
Khalf Allah ‘Alayna
Just go, I’ll wait for you in the heat.
Rashed didn't believe in his intentions and he didn't have anything, so he became like that
He is the deputy director general of the World Educational Center
He says he will teach you, he is a teacher and you are a teacher, but look where he is now and where you are now.
Come on
Come on, Abdullah
I know what the secret is.
‏ Professor has arrived Professor has arrived
Sir, I didn’t do anything.
Professor, do you know this boy from
My love, I know this is a boy from
IKA I’m telling you, you know, we don’t have a good chance like this
I am looking for a job, that made me laugh, God made me laugh
It's no use, the job is in the pocket
Thank you, you didn’t do anything, you are the best.
He greeted him
IKA sends you his regards after God, may he greet you, God willing, may he greet you.
Any, God willing, bye my love, be safe
After your brother gets into a fight and becomes a minister, just believe me, dad.
OK mom, we’ll work, we’ll work hard
But my father, if they say something about your job
Just like that, he gave it to you
It’s just something normal
Normal automatically these don’t want talk
My dear child, please make my dream come true.
Before Hilmi's dream, I
Reserve me a tower among the Corniche towers
Oh God, I miss them
Thank you, thank you, thank you
You can do it, Abu Saleh
I say, your friend looks like he’s in trouble
God, he doesn’t look like it, my friend
You are up to it, boss Saleh
Give me your phone, I’ll give it to Bouasalah.
See these moves, and he’s definitely carrying Sultan a million percent
In fact, he never had a good relationship with Bouchaal.
No, Boss Sultan, he’s up to something.
Is it really that bad
He will open the car door
In the end, the minister’s car doors will be broken.
Mom, don’t break my heart, don’t break my heart.
I heard what they are saying in the coffee shops about the country
But I can’t believe what I’m hearing
My heart is standing still, my heart is standing still.
I’m afraid the story will fall on the women in need and not even the pot of dishes mother, you embarrassed me among the women
Say something Mr. Sultan, I’m shocked in the daytime
Please, I know what you are doing
Muhad la khass
Amina, I'm working on a slow fire
Since I opened the door for him, this is the beginning of the plan in my head.
I should be the minister, not him
Let me work, I have a plan.
Leave them, I’ll carry them
Any plan
But he has to trust me first.
They told me his eyes are like a minister because he was appointed two months before you
I am sure of his honesty and integrity.
Magic Can Be Nullified
What is that?
What is this after?
And every activity that is forbidden for the photographers, the image of Lin will burn in the newspaper.
And he smells like he’s about to float to the surface
Sure he came
You be patient, let me work on it and I’ll fix it.
On the contrary, my lord
Of course, Minister Sa’ada
Come on, say it.
Thank you for the lamb, it’s really good meat.
The real is at the door, get up for him
Don’t be a fool, people want you to be a fool and you want to be smaller than yourself.
The minister just said, just said...
No, I don’t see myself, no. The minister only wanted a picture, a picture. The minister only wanted a picture.
Slap him in the second give him
And God my brother, I really like your plan
I want you to take him there
Image Image Image
Any minister is needed
Azzain bqulj lahm
Turn to the page before the last
Look at his picture, the biggest one with the groom
Say "لا اله الا الله"
Any day has a picture or two.
According to you, a social activist, God willing, God willing, bye
They all love you, but I don’t know what’s wrong with you
Melas in every wall
These two are jealous of you, do not throw stones except at a fruitful tree
Come to the market with me
I am preparing for the exam.
سلام عليكم
‏ Hello, peace to you, hello
You are very welcome.
Sasseh Abdulhadis Abdullah Sasseh
This is my husband.
I am how many times Mama's talk
Thirty-five
Where is this man?
May God forbid anything bad happen in the house today
God, let me be broken today, my head is aching and my body is broken and my colon is aching
I’m tired, God, I’ve been tired for a month and I’m still looking
Let me relax today
Hello, Mother Sultan
Hey, hey
Just get it to me
I’ll see you analyzed it
Did you see what the famous violet is doing?
I know Allah that you are convinced
It turns out, frankly
Your minister, it seems, liked the story.
Send my brother Sa’ad a deaf.
No, I didn’t follow any activity today and didn’t read any newspapers, I don’t know.
Al-Basir, God willing, bye.
God willing, the ant will disappear if it has wings
سلام عليكم brother, is there a conference at the hotel tonight?
Wedding
Ava means everything means there is no such activity, a birthday party, a wedding
I don't know, but you can see the hotel behind us.
Oh, there is a hotel behind you
Okay, I’ll leave you at the car and go to the hotel to ask.
روح روح روح خذ راحتك روح اسال روح
May everyone agree, God willing
Let us rest, minister
So he didn’t find any party, wedding or any other event to attend.
He destroyed 20 hotels and didn’t find anything, his luck is as bad as his face.
Just shut up
I didn’t find any birthday for him
The right can be caught in the second leg
Every number has 50 images
Or he doesn’t sleep, he doesn’t come, my brother.
Hey, this is the guy who broke my heart. This is the first thing he’s done. Get his picture and then break his heart.
Do you say my children are having a competition on the picture of the minister of religion
One asks the other, and he says to him, today they put many pictures of the minister in the newspaper
Whoever wins will be awarded.
That's not the point, come to the coffee and listen to the comments every day about my picture in the newspaper, they say things that don't stop.
Allah is close to annihilation
It's over, as they say, the butterfly to God's will, its disappearance is near, I approached the light.
People give you and greet him
He became one of the country’s celebrities
Come on, who is this?
I destroyed my reputation
May Allah protect him and her
You say that we all got married except for Aml, the poor single one among us who didn’t get married
This is the share
It is not written for me to argue.
I have completely forgotten the marriage story
God will take revenge on whoever was the cause
Hollo those faggots who are standing over there
‏ What’s the matter with them
Ajoufin li yalعب ieb’asharah
Is this a boy or a daughter?
After my father died, I mean, killed him.
Which pair is bigger?
It's a sin to leave him attached to the maid
Oh my God, go and do it.
I wanted to talk to my mother but she has not only put a maid for him but two.
We told Amie once, it’s none of your business, Kholoud is my daughter, not yours.
You only have a problem with Kholood and the maids, nothing else with the maids.
Oh my God, don’t be so beautiful, Kholoud, 24 hours with the maid and nothing else.
Oh God, get out, let me rest, I want to sleep, how am I?
My brother Saud Kholood, you are becoming like my son
Wait a bit if you don’t tell my father about it
I only say to Kholood, what’s wrong with Kholood
Saoud says that Khalood puts on makeup and acts like a paradise for girls, what's the story?
No, no, no, you, Saud
He put makeup on Kholoud’s face, except for the ant, makeup for kids, and he saw the makeup box and played with it
I saw a big Hulk but he didn’t show up
Good, nice and sweet
I am Hawsha Saud
It’s been a while since I saw you
Here Saad, that time you asked me when I would grow up and I didn’t answer you, now answer me, when I grow up what will happen
And my beloved, my love, Sa'ad will become an officer, and you, what will you become?
We will go to London the same year.
Any word of trembling in Bahrain
Let Sawsan and Fuhud and Kholood come
And give my regards to Samora
‏ God forgive me
Today my father said to me, choose
Now I will build you a land on the sea or the land where our shoes are.
I don’t want to choose
I love you, I want to live with you anywhere
I love you, my dear
Teach me how to fish
Oh God, I wish I could close my eyes and open them and they would tell me, "Amal, you finished university".
Af jannah attar for men
My mother, but he smells so weird
And cure me
The way you talk has become feminine
You forgot that you are a Real one.
And God willing, I’ll talk to people outside like that
I can’t believe it, Khaled
Please get out of my room.
Oh, how sad, Kholoud
You’ve fallen from my eyes
Oh my God, don’t hurt my feelings, I swear I’ll tell my mom.
This is my son and I know him well.
And so, you, Kholoud, my eye’s sight, I wish all the kids were like you and your feelings
And you, may I never see a gentle and quiet one, and you call him my sons
Don’t say such things about your brother.
But just calm down, you’re making a big deal out of nothing.
What's worth it, put some perfume on, it smells good now, what's the difference between men's and women's perfumes
I wouldn’t tell you this in front of your father.
I have
Good job, but shut up so that Mohamed doesn’t feel anything
Oh where are these girls going
It’s a shame to do this, she’s a beautiful girl
Don’t look at them, don’t look at them
God, I’m afraid that he thinks there’s something wrong
Give yourselves a break
I know you all watch the Bluetooth that is spread these days
I’m waiting for Saad but let him come.
How are you, Saad?
God keep you
I’m saying, we’re waiting for you, really, we still haven’t played the game.
Why?
Do you drink something?
The hollow one is lying here in your apartment, it’s been two days
On the Bluetooth issue
Oh brother, I swear by the oud
I’m afraid of him
Don’t try to kill me, okay? Don’t try.
Seek refuge from the devil, my mother, for my sake.
I have already booked.
I am fed up with all these people and their faces.
What the hell is your father's name?
Tell him anything.
Oh, these kids! Oh, these kids!
This is the end, O mother
Why was Kholod Asgar?
Surely this is the result
Shame on you, get up and go outside.
True words always hurt
The vase broke
I can't live in Doha
Mali way
I’ve been stuck with my phone for a while
Watalumini ya aml
And you are my son, and you spend the whole day on your phone.
I say, I’m real, all day I meet people outside
It’s hard, O Hope
I can't live my whole life with my head in the sand.
My father has been acting for a while as if something is happening at home and there is a change.
And when will my father return from the events that take place in the house
My father, sometimes he wakes me up and sometimes he lets me sleep
I blame you, Amal, for remembering his kindness and his dedication to his work so that we can live with dignity among people.
And the latter
When the man left his house and children to his wife
We don’t want to dig up the past now
I know my father or no
But I intend
Send him a Bluetooth.
But I am not going to give it to him
I don’t want to see my father’s accident in my eyes
It hurts a lot
Whatever it is, O Hope
Does he know us through our way
Better than what is known through others
The loss of our house has reached this point
A dirty bomb called Kholood exploded in it
And Customs
They teach them with all impudence
They closed their ears to her
And they hear not even that.
Only one voice
It is the voice of filth and perversion
Wadouson, all good
What came to your mind?
Suddenly I decided to travel for study
We can only say, may God heal you, my son.
God will give you back
The gift that came back, they came from a trip, not from those who are traveling
You are right.
This rule
But for every rule
Oml Qoumey Ta'ali Ma'ahey Abser'a
Here it is dry
I didn’t hear a thing
Bousaïd
Bousaïd
What's wrong with Busaid?
What’s wrong with you, mom?
‏ ybe
Don’t be sad
You are a great person.
Why would a young man wish his wife?
I didn’t divorce you because of anything wrong with you.
I am divorcing you.
It’s impossible
Accept icon father of my children
One queer like your brother
Here is Salah
I feel sad every day
First, nothing is shown
Manchesin under the earth
That's the first one under the earth
God, strong talk. You could say that.
You are rich, I swear, one million and a lot of money
Masha'Allah
Come on, let’s go
You’ve been a pain in my ass for seven months, stop with the henna, God reach me home
A failure and a disgrace
A storyteller to you this driver
Seven months have passed
My ears are ringing
Take him on a trip and get rid of him
Go and bring something else.
Fahmi ولدج ما يدري اشورا هالكلمه ما يدري خساير افلوس وقت
Driving lessons, get us away from it all
You are the first one to come to the house of wealth, I congratulate you before six months.
Zain, after I say something new, I’ll say you
This is oil in Ahin and Ahed, 200 Real in FFL, half a Real is 5 Real, it's too expensive, Papa.
You're just a fool, listen to what I say
It's the first time he comes, I'm going to give him a ride.
70 gives
You are brand new, you are six months old, this is eight hundred.
I need some money
This is an admin driver, you are saying old, old stuff, you are new.
This is seven hundred and eighty.
Roh
This says that he will only come and give 100 Riyals only.
Three thousand is no use
I said your words are very beautiful
Lala Shashi Padin problem in a short time I am in need
No Fear Shashi
Who is the guarantor of the money?
Why are you like that?
This man is the first sponsor of this person
Mosh kam maloom sethe miye sabah miye hain maloom kam hasel hoh
How smart are you
Wool is not you, Kوف
Mafi kof
God is my judge against him
I sat and watched the soul of his heart die
No one
Even the phone I bought for him has a package.
Here it is done
After that
They didn’t do anything wrong, take the passport and keep it with them.
Atiser yal-haji you amrkhis
Tomato everywhere
Here is the problem, here is the problem
After all who are scattered
Oh, please, look at us.
I told you to travel.
But anyway, do you think I’ll leave him?
Wherever he goes up
He is sunbathing.
I'd rather pay for my ticket and travel than stay in the country with all this money.
I wish I could catch him
A friend of mine said that no one buys now.
At the beginning of the match, you seemed very nervous.
But we are afraid of what? We are afraid that our team won’t score goals
We need more than three, we need ten, fifteen, twenty.
You made me feel before the match that you are scared of the opposing team
I'm not scared of the opposing team, I'm scared of our team. I'm afraid they won't score. I'll tell you more than three.
This is the level of our team, I know it, I’m talking about the level of our team.
A big trust from you
Half of the opponent’s team has nothing
Sweet foxes, say now, did you score the first goal?
Where are you?
Roh بيت
In a car
Come, I have a car, I will take you.
Oh, thank you, my friend
Shola, you try, our team will not be defeated
You’ve been watching the beginning of the league matches
You heard what he was going to say
It says a lot of problems
Oh God, Mahmod, get the car
Hey, my friend Egy Roh, come on
Hey, uncle Saked
Please, sir.
What is he doing to himself?
Oh the Indian boy
Yeah, man, that's a football addict
There is no such thing as a team’s word, I am a fox
Sui Lbuko Lbuko
Oh God, oh Sاجد, oh God, oh Sاجد, hurry, the match is about to start, hurry, get one water, with you, the foxes are playing today, hurry
Dear viewers, we have one of the most famous supporters of the Foxes club, nicknamed the Fox
But they say that you defeated them because they are lacking.
This is in the speech, this is in the speech, there is no good.
What is missing from this team? This is a very good team, with a dozen people.
Two minus one is useless, sim sim
This is a devil fox
This is our best supporter
Okay, on the occasion of this half victory, Thaelub, a final word addressed to the foxes
All the talk is nonsense
When this was said by the foxes
This is inside Sema in the high
This is a fair supporter
Look, brother
He received it very enthusiastic
Please, dear.
Where is the Indian boy who kicks the ball?
I can’t see any bee for a while
Hey, this is a big deal, don’t stay here.
I haven’t seen him in a while, I didn’t recognize him, he was waiting at a café like this in Flagio, it’s called a Starbucks, a piece of it like this.
I remember that friend used to come with us to the mosque, but he didn’t have a cup of tea.
This is a tip of 20 riyals while the boy is in front of my eyes
What the hell did he do that for?
My uncle, he’s with the big officials of the club, they’re fixing it, so they don’t talk to him
I say, you fox!
My mother's name
My mother says, do it in your sleep, do it in your get.
You have nothing to do with it, you encourage a bad and tired club like this club
This is the team of rich foxes, heart of Mali, I.
When my heart stops
Jood daakhil wajid thaalib fi
You never heard the poem he wrote in prison
The day of our match with them
Please, please, you jackal, say, say, this is a poem, say, say
My mother, only God knows the secrets of the world I am
This is my own money in Wاجد m
I don’t sleep at all in the night.
Do you know that we are a fan club of the Foxes club?
That means you can’t tell me the name of Al-Faisal so that I can interview him before the journalist.
We have a press conference and God willing we will announce the name of the winner
Say what you will
And this is Thaeloub, the famous supporter who was honored today by the Thaeloub Club in a very kind gesture and a very beautiful initiative.
‏ God
Thaloub, a thousand congratulations on this beautiful honor and the gift is certainly wonderful
He will always say that you said it in a pen or in a bad mood
And Allah is His father
This is a gesture
I say to you he
I have to call the police
Stay where you are, don’t move.
Cheering for all this in fan money
No, no, my father, not him, he looks like him
I say to you he
You are late.
I don’t know when the games’ times are, dude.
How can we fish now?
There is nothing but wait for the Foxes team to play the next match
I saw him, I saw him.
Zain kh anlahqah
Dude, you’re late.
Echo echo echo echo
Hit him, hit him, hit him and then some.
The thing is, we're not sure if this is him or not
I’m telling you, it is, dad.
I say it is wise to go to the two tails and ask them where the driver who is with you comes from, how he comes with you, and when he comes with you.
You need to make the trip two trips.
Go and tell him, I’m sure he is.
And may Allah preserve you, may He reward you for your kindness to me.
Registered in the name of Mali, in my name
This wind is in the second land next to Malh
Say to your father that Abd al-Rahman al-Sabaji’s son will come to you, O Haghak, O peace, O peace, O peace.
‏ Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it. Apparently we’re in the wrong, your father. We’re coming to see one of our friends’s friend and we’ll be similar to you
Allah, may He be exalted, created and guided one person, and He has created and guided forty persons.
Thank you, you are very kind, many thanks.
God bless you, forgive me, forgive me, thank you, thank you.
O God, we are humiliated by your cheapness. We are not your money. O God, we are not safe.
And you’ll tell me after, for sure
What should I do now, my father, God have mercy on you
What did you do, Walid?
And I was walking on the sidewalk when I saw
Oh God, just get rid of them
The people of your room are the people
God be with us
God be with us
Come back, your father will understand now
Before my father knew it
It was broken into a million pieces
Okin, mama, let’s go and buy one like it, fast.
Before my father comes
And the one who will deliver me, oh mother
You know your dad when he gets angry, he becomes like a minon.
You are the soul of your room and don’t come out of it
Nothing else.
By mistake, he hit the vase, his bag fell and broke
Oh my god, I’m scared for him
Madre, ¿dónde se fue?
No, no, no, his father is not right
You're treating the boy like this, what are you doing to him, mother
Amziqen qalbi amxra’inhe tabun atinnun halayahl hada
I say, mom
You are asking, where did the boy go?
Okay, I’ll call you.
God be with us
My aunt, I know where Walid went.
Come here, I’ll put your shoes on.
Oh God oh God
‏ Akah Ahni
I won’t go home even if my aunt converts to Islam.
I'm worried about you
I have never seen the vase.
God knows I don’t know
Just fuck your father, you stupid ass
Come here, mom
I'm not afraid as long as I'm at home, okay dad?
I have the solution.
We didn’t say anything, Mr. Walid
Your client requested you, Mr. Walid
I’ll forgive him this time for you
I didn’t see it at home
Where is he? Where did he go?
Wanhu hu wanhu
Come on, Walid, don’t be afraid, your father didn’t do anything to you
Sure, mom.
Oh my God, oh my mother
I’ll leave it here, I’m afraid someone from the kids will pick it up and break it
He told my father, "She's the one like the one he broke."
Exactly, he went and I found only this last one in the shop, he’s so lucky, oh no, where are the kids
They study in the room
God, protect her
But just these values and I’ll get up
‏ O peace
Come on, let’s study
Mom, just finish this game and we’ll go.
Oh, and don’t tell my uncle.
Dad, don’t say that about your brother, dad, for the last time, I swear to God, dad.
Call him
And you especially made a mistake with your friend in the coffee shop I
Brooke, if you tell my brother about you
I’m not connected to this phone, I’ll keep it in my room, OK?
Oh my god, why don’t you take it to the doctor
God guide you
Amazigh’s heart and his fear of how much he is suffering
Poor boy
Siri antu
Oh my god, where is Umola? I don’t see her with you today
I want to see her
My sister, this one is not satisfied with playing.
Oh my God, mom, I told you the story of Amanira and her son Naif
His son is the age of God’s infant, may He protect him
And the same length
Yesterday you said I don’t know what to do with her son
She took him to the hospital but his leg, يوسف.
Dra, the story yesterday
Wahasha and they started shouting at her
How come you didn’t tell me?
He has a psychological condition.
The boy is forced
He takes his son and ties him to the edge of the yard
Then he’ll tell him to do it again and pee on your bed
You are sitting on ruins
You are stupid, Amnira
I tell her, eat, eat.
Bon appétit
Oh, my luck
Oh my God
Your father never loved you as much as I do.
And I would have killed you for that.
Oh God, take a shower before your father does something bad to you
What do I have to do with me?
It's a shame for the poor
They are sitting and shouting.
I’m afraid something will happen to my children.
I have to take them to their uncle to discipline them.
I am nervous
They did not succeed in defeating them
Why do you take them to their uncle?
Nasour gave me 84 out of 50
Why don’t they make fifty out of fifty
Their uncle warned them
And honestly, I agree with his point of view
Let go of your emotions
My brother, you should behave.
Come on, come on
The last time, the last time
Fifty out of fifty
He will waste our time, I assure them, he is our son.
Why don’t you bring fifty from fifty
جب جب جب I warn you but you don’t listen
You hear the words
Jalil al-Hayya
Give him alone, let me discipline him, I
‏ Ok, ok, uncle
So that you can revise it properly, you will revise it
Oh God
Do you know what I should do?
Your cars are one after the other, I’ll serve you falafel
Be careful, you are going to a public place with Halka.
Ambiguities
Professor Walid, is it?
What’s wrong with you, are you yelling?
This is a great grade
It's strange that you are crying.
You should be happy
You son, everyone went, the buses left, I’m waiting for someone to come and take you
At the school gate, it means the bus is waiting. The bus has arrived and the kids have gotten off, not with them.
Have you heard about the boy who committed suicide today?
God bless you, they gave him the certificate.
His father is threatening him if he doesn’t get the full mark
Waleed, Waleed, come back, Waleed, come back

Seasonal Demand for Oil Falls
In winter it drops below 90.
And all this indicates that speculation has power and control over the market now
It means that when we go back to the traditional market in the old days
The market was affected by supply and demand
LLL the seasonal demand
Today we see that there is economic growth
Today or yesterday General David Petraeus, the head of the Central Command in Afghanistan and Iraq, resigned.
His resignation has caused a huge reaction in relation to the so-called American war.
Political or Geo-political effects

Whoever confirms it will tell you that some of them say that the American war on Iran is coming
Here what will be the market will be optimistic about the market in its way
Question in the shadow of the Vice President, now in the shadow of the White House
And this brought back the atmosphere of tension in the region
This is Qamut.
But perhaps Falun saw this scenario
Very Fast Reflection on Oil Market
Today we prove with numbers that there is no shortage
Let me give you an example, during the last seven weeks
In the US, oil stocks have increased more than the average of the last five years
Today it's not me, I mean, I'm saying
And not even for the next war, because today I am telling you that even the world has stocks of it
Even global consumption today, look for any country in the world, there is a long line or queues in front of petrol stations
This is something else
What is the danger that this represents to
What number do you think could be, I don’t know, could be?
Two hundred may be three hundred dollars, but
It may reach if these tensions reach a boiling point to real tensions
Like you said, the Gulf makes up 60%
In a country that is far from oil-producing countries
See the impact comes in reverse on the oil market
It can reach three hundred dollars.
And they put and moved from stocks and others to the oil market today, see above the two trillion or two trillion dollars
Today we will see the Brent.
It means that there are over 100 barrels of oil being pumped every day.
These tensions in the region and anticipation
April, as has been said before, is to be the month in which this war is launched
God knows, I don’t mean it, my generation
In the region because the Al Al now
Next year is an election year
The current US administration has only a few months left.
George H. W. Bush launched the war on Somalia and sent 30,000 troops in his last days in the White House
We see but do not anticipate events
But I don’t expect that this scenario will be
Because this is a very expensive scenario
It will not cost you anything. You, the Iranians, and the consuming countries will pay for it.
America Today
Now it depends on African oil and has many alternatives
See, let’s talk clearly
You said in your post in your introduction that 60%
The Oil Reserve
But now they import twenty-two.
We get our oil from the west from West Africa
From West Africa and whatever they import from any region in the world
Oil production
Because this is a difficult number and fixed reserves and reserves
On so-called deep water or the production of deep-sea oil
The navy, and therefore the Gulf, will remain a difficult number
Caspian Oil
I consider them as dreams because they are not real and true
They will ruin it and destroy it
Important, you know
Today, Qatar is the largest energy exporter in the world
That is why these countries are a hard nut to crack
It and the energy needs of countries
Certainly emphasizes that there is what is called the security of the secure supply
And despite the internal objections in the United States even at the level of General فالون
But concerns remain
Let President Bush
You noticed that the political risks have not come from the Gulf countries
It means no, no, no, it's not a matter of generosity, because no one here deals in generosity, we
Not very generous
But not in a biased article
We are not part of the charity work
He or the honor of
But the kindness of the Westerners is not with anyone else
With America specifically
Where is the market?
Where is our economic return going?
We will not

You put it for the sake of generosity and
I have the proof
I have the proof

It’s Not the Price
But the Dollar’s Decline You Insist
You are first and foremost as Gulf and OPEC
Export in dollars and you refuse
Changing the currency even though the currency has collapsed
Even if the return is not in your favor
No, I didn’t say 70
But experts’ words are not my words
Okay, the dollar fell by 30% and oil rose above this increase
If we take the base year as 2014
We see that the price of oil is ranging between $35 and $36.
He means, of course, that
The price of oil has increased
‏ But the increase is slight, the deputy strived
That means if we take them
We consider it now.
Even these prices
That means if we compare it to 2004
Even the dollar’s decline has exceeded
The exciting
Reacting to the Dollar’s Decline
The more the dollar falls, the more the price of oil rises
And this is also something the market seems to be giving him a feeling for.
My two interests are to save both.
No, now the situation has changed. Maybe it was at the beginning of the decline two years ago, but the situation has changed now and there is
The dollar seemed to lose value in front of the main currencies such as Euro, Yen and Pound.
The question here is why do you insist on linking your currency to the dollar?
Its currency is weakening and it has no cover
This is a historical era
Oil and its derivatives in dollars, even European production in the North Sea, Russia and Norway
It stipulates that America in the mid-1970s
The gold cover was canceled from the American currency
This is not correct
What is primary healthcare?
The OIC organizes

If you invest in another currency, everyone will
You can’t you as
All oil-exporting countries must agree
I am an adult
Those who have 66% of the global reserve are the big ones

It includes Venezuela, Libya and Iran

Today’s market hours do not exceed 40%.

And this cannot be able to catch the 40% owner
You can’t do it yourself unless
In countries that tried but
It is not a real real attempt
You are rejecting because of ties with America

How many liters are in one barrel
They are the losers when he issues it
And its currency has risen very high
And he sells his nafs (self) for dollars
In the future, the plant will have its own or the receiver will receive it. He will take his money in dollars and then convert it or transfer it to his local currency.
He did it, it’s not related to the dollar
It’s true but...
But your problem is that you sell in dollars and your work is not linked to the dollar. You don’t have a problem.
And this is my important question now
What is the anxiety and effect if your job is related to the dollar while the dollar is decreasing?
has been associated for many years
Especially in the 70s when the dollar was a very strong currency and its value meant it was very strong
This disengagement is not easy
Paint is easy
No, here is no.

From Profit and Loss
Dojn announced in his publication yesterday that there are four countries that there is a Qatar
But there is also a report by the Gulf Cooperation Council saying that there are four Gulf countries, because of course Oman has left the Gulf unified currency.
I read the announcement in Dungeons and I don’t think it’s a real announcement
QNB’s CEO denies the news
He said yes and that you will study it, but also that all the Gulf countries
You have to study profit and loss in a way as I said in a solid, non-emotional way
Let us leave the matter to be studied and until they come.
Jouf after I get you economists to say there is another study
This study reflects
لوبال هاوس is something simple and organized and they issued a report in eight March meaning

The solution is simple and requires a political decision, says Global House Al
Political decision is a two-edged sword
Either or the first need
About her intention or the five and with her Kuwait about her intention in 2010 to issue the currency or study the issue of the Gulf unified currency
The second point is that a decision should be made to break away from the dollar.
First, with regard to the unified currency
In my personal opinion
Let us see the Gulf unified currency
When this currency will be strong
will be
Perhaps one of the strongest currencies in the world as you say
And what is behind it of reserves and what is behind it of huge revenues
So that is what His Excellency the Prime Minister focused on when he said
Oh, the Gulf countries, because no single country can do it alone
But with a stronger economic guarantee
And an economic bloc today, even the Euro today we will see
But you must not forget that the central bank has a very big role
In the assessment
And and and profit and loss account

2008, as observers say. Global House says that inflation will continue
For a long time in the Gulf countries, but the solution is in the hands of governments
Some countries have raised salaries by 70%, such as the UAE
To stop the inflation process
That is my question now, when will you increase the salaries of the poor people in Qatar
‏And I will hear your answer after a short break
On the subject of today’s topic, the oil reserve and the daily production of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
She has a reserve of two hundred forty billion
Two out of ten barrels
And nine out of ten people daily
One million, two hundred and fifty thousand, one hundred and three and a half billion, two hundred and seven from ten million
Qatar 0.25211 billion, 75,050 Omani rials 5.06 from 0.1 billion, 70,007
Bahrain has 25 million and 33 thousand
Eighty-three billion was the total revenue for the year.
From 2003 to 2007
One Hundred Billion in Europe
Sixty billion in the Middle East and forty billion
In Asia and other countries
However, the total GDP of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries was 1,677.7 billion
Total output in 177997 expected
In 1989, 10 out of 10 billion
But the inflation that eats away the salaries of employees and workers who live in this area
In 2018 it will increase to 3.7 out of 10
Kuwait 44.7% expect in 2007, 97.9% of 10, the UAE
It will become ten, but Saudi Arabia was six and a half and will reach six
Eight out of ten
Salaries are swallowed
What are the amounts and percentages by which you will increase the employee of the poor here
If we want to solve the problem
Real processing
Salaries are always increasing
It’s Not the Solution
I am not against the increase in salaries
It is true, this is not true.
We are always
In the nature of faith
The increase in the increase and the lack of control over inflation, inflation will eat all these increases
To deal with inflation, a high committee should be formed that includes all experts and specialists
And now this committee is putting
Because the salary increase in the world
And the golden economic rule says of course
It will have no end
And whatever
Salaries increased and whatever it increases
Inflation Will Rise
It must be processed and must
In a scientific study here, the institution بيت دوت كوم (Bayt.com), which specializes in employment, conducted a study in cooperation with the British YouGov Survey.
They surveyed 15,000 employees working in the Gulf countries in 20 important sectors
Especially the experts and the zoo of the jobs there is no job satisfaction
Inflation is eating
Laath siima zuhdi khubra
They are thinking of moving from these countries where inflation is eating
You are now going to lose
‏ This is the easy idea, so and you put the easy idea and try to apply it
The inflation relationship is the increase in wages
Parallelism in the subject is present
Present and
We are keen and the state and the government are very keen
Let the processor deal with this problem with a real processor
Temporary solutions never solve the problem, they just make it worse.
It means increase it
We hope that there will be more time for this committee to put
All the applications
Here, he was frustrated and you were looking for a deputy
The desert will always be
It worked but the state also tried and raised the 40% increase
No, here is a very important point regarding the increases
In the matter of the increases, you only increase the Qatari ones and the non-Qatari ones would work for Burkina Faso and Zimbabwe
You care about the Qataris, not the expatriates
And it is the high ratio in it
Hey Ahmed, you live in Qatar, not in Germany
She talks about this subject and suffers
Salaries are much higher than in the government sector
And vice versa, we saw
In the Government Sector
And in contrast, the government sector has become
The best elements and competencies have become
Also I read a report while you know in QV the oil sector
‏ For labor
We are like experts when we are doing something
Engineers and workers who come from outside Qatar
And we also interact with the global market
For all these things, what is the percentage of the increase in salaries?
And the hope is with Allah, but we say
There, the government has a plan.
I say that controlling inflation is the most important
From temporary treatment
And we will see, I am sure
There will be a pan.
Positive results
It will be around 150%
Sweet says you have 22.5 billion barrels of oil and 34.5 billion barrels of gas
No comment, we are the client, not his client رش

The Hadith about economic growth also must be reflected on the people
And of course, any economic growth today, Qatar has the highest economic growth in the world
And the reverse
The huge belts in the country are also a part
And if it were not for these huge belts and huge projects
In the country it was also part of the inflation
It also led part of the inflation
And this also led to a lot of liquidity in the market
First, regarding the link between the dollar and oil
Oil for Protection
In the USA, and therefore the stability of the government is something that means
Thank you
Saad Al-Ghamdi from Saudi Arabia, your question Saad
Peace be upon you and God’s mercy and blessings
The truth is that a ring means success and a good title
What I would like to talk about is that the region is now under America's policy
America's policy in its current war in addition to its cultural war against Islam is an economic world war.
China’s New Urbanism
The American deficit was also with Japan and sixty billion dollars
Japan also invested in 2000
With America, it is equivalent to nine
One billion dollars while it is investing now with the European Union more than twenty-seven billion dollars
In line with American politics and making the dollar the inevitable currency for the whole world
My brother, I say that buying now

Thank you, Mr. Saad
Mohammed Al-Waseef from Egypt
Hello to the deputy with you
The deputy's efforts remind me of the Arab rulers in the Middle East region
When there is
When there are surpluses or demands to adjust prices
Adjust the salaries, adjust the salaries in return in proportion to the prices as you preferred, Your Excellency.
He means, in Qatar we consider you as a model
And I'm determined not to preach about this increase, this is an Arabic style
We want Qatar, which for us is considered Abu Adrikh.
He has the right to say what he wants. Do you have a question? He has the right, of course. He is responsible for this policy.
Question 1
The deputy Siya should take into consideration
One Two It is necessary to interact with the public opinion
With the poor, as you have indicated, because they are the people who need to be cared for
Arab rulers who don’t care about the poor
Hello, peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
I will be two for you and one for the husband.
I also want a raise
‏The salaries are great and awesome, good.
May God have mercy on you, as for the subject, we are the ones who need to work on its meaning.
With the poor and always God willing there will be no poor in Qatar and we are sure
And the ruling makes it clear that Qatar, as it said, the money goes to the ruling family and the ruler
That is the important question now
Oh let’s reply to the brothers
He cannot rule
What is happening to wealth?
Now there are whole new cities that are almost like the pearl of لوسيل and other places, meaning even Qatar has started to expand
He is not the issue, the issue is the issue
Proportional urban plan
In short, there are two minutes left, so we’ll start, whatever Qatar will do.
Qatar Now: A Post-Oil and Gas Qatar
There is, of course, a clear state policy

An inexhaustible wealth
Because he is the guardian of wealth
And therefore today the trend in the State of Qatar
The Middle East’s Education Capital
Today we will see the cultural educational city
Today, the City of Education hosts the best universities in the world

It’s not only Al Jazeera, you will make a thousand islands and you can’t bear the small one
Come on, man, these are our countries in the Gulf now
In the 70s, everyone remembers the 70s boom
Today, today, when we see in Qatar the growth
This also calls for a special focus on post-oil Qatar.
Our vision of oil and its future and wealth in the region, especially in Qatar, in conclusion, I convey my regards to the program team.
And this is Ahmed Mansour wishing you a limit-less greeting, peace be upon you and the mercy of God and his blessings.
Peace be upon you and God’s mercy and blessings
Hello, I’m with you live this week from the Qatari capital, Doha.
Welcome to a new episode of "Beyond Borders"
At the time when Qatar includes the largest American military base outside the United States, the Al Udeid Air Base.
With the US enemies in the region
Like Iran and Syria
Its doors are open to leaders
In fact, Hamas leaders enjoy distinguished relations with the Qatari leadership
As the Emir of Qatar was the only Arab leader
Who visited the southern suburb of Beirut, which was destroyed by Israel during its war on Lebanon in the summer of 2006
She still supports unlimited reconstruction of what Israel destroyed in Lebanon
And the time when Qatar reconciled
With her older sister the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia about two years ago
At the same time, skirmishes with the regime in Egypt
Like a File on Lebanon Where I Succeeded Where Others Failed
I gathered the Lebanese leaders in Doha where they signed an agreement that led them to safety
To the last election
As well as the files are difficult
What she wanted was to be the driving force behind these files, not Qatar
The smallest Arab countries
And in today’s episode
We try to understand the foundations and rules of Qatar's foreign policy
For whom
The small geographically and demographically Qatar plays these big roles
And what are the qualifications that enable her
And that in a direct dialogue with the Prime Minister and the Qatari Minister of Foreign Affairs
For our viewers who want to participate, they can call the program's phone numbers which will be shown on the screen.
The visit of the Emir of Qatar
Al Jazeera’s cannons roar in the desire to improve relations with Saudi Arabia
From the past, an attempt by Saudi Arabia to overthrow the Emir of Qatar in cooperation with members of the Al Murrah tribe.
In its issue of last June 20
What is the secret deal?
‏ In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Many of the things that
I don’t think it is accurate.
It is accurate that in more than one interview here in this program I always said
And we consider it the backbone
The Gulf Cooperation Council
There was a misunderstanding
‏ Then
The View from the Other Side
The border agreement is correct and this was a big obstacle
‏ The historical Saudi-Qatari relations are special
If we notice these relationships
M between the two families and the two countries
She resembles a young man, with all the misunderstandings
Neither by us nor by them
Because there are no conditions between the brothers
And now the relations are in a position that I can confirm that it is very excellent.
For the Gulf Cooperation Council’s Benefit
But how was Al Jazeera's status with Saudi Arabia settled? It was the obstacle or the reason that led to the year 2003 and then what?
At an important point
And I repeat to you, if you go back to all the programs, I always said
It is not only the elder sister, but I was saying that we in the Council of Cooperation are dependent on
Saudi Arabia is an important country in the region
And with our relations with them we give importance
There was a media war of words and this was clear to both parties
These countries found themselves
A failure when the Muslim Brotherhood agreed
The Qatari-Saudi House
Rather, they found that they had fallen out
They have neither a horse nor an ass in it
And I don’t think it was a strategy of anyone who entered this dispute
But Sheikh, let me, let me here in this framework so that things or points are above the letters
Many observers believe that Al Jazeera channel in the last two years
At a time when the conditions that were criticized on Al Jazeera screen
Before the situations in Saudi Arabia
Whether people are arrested, opponents or others, it is still ongoing
Al Jazeera stopped talking about these things
Until Al Jazeera's coverage of the Hajj
To praise the system and what the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques does at a time that is contrary
I don’t see why you can’t ask Al Jazeera’s administration about this subject, don’t ask me because I’m
The gathering of the two countries
Regional stability
This strategy continued and strengthened first the stability of the region
The region means the Gulf region
The Gulf Region
Many Issues Loom Over the Gulf Region
Also the call of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques to Kuwait
It had an impact on all the audience and on the whole Arab world
He spoke from the heart about settling and overcoming Arab differences and burying them
It’s not only about the views
No, politics is about policies and policies are about perspectives
In the Arab world, it is considered
A Kind of War
The World’s Missing Middle
You speak about the same interest
Now you are left with a few years
‏ The situation now the situation now
Look first
In complete difference between this subject and that subject
The idea that a small country can hit the big ones and make them feel weak in front of it
‏ Any dispute or misunderstanding
It had its reasons
And its causes have ended
His Rule Ends With Two Leaders
Are there any guarantees for the future relationship?
There are guarantees between the two parties
On the basis of love, brotherhood and the interests that unite the two countries
The leaders’ words are more than a document
Between Qatar and Saudi Arabia to develop this relationship
And as we reflect on this Qatari-Saudi relationship, we hope that it will develop.
For the better and there will be large areas
For this relationship, like we have a model B with other Arab countries, other Gulf countries
Qatar is an important country
OK, Saudi Arabia is an important country
What kind of a country is Egypt for Qatar? Even though it was noticed at the same time that you made peace with Saudi Arabia
And three organizations are Hezbollah
It is Al Jazeera channel
Or on the regime in Egypt, the largest Arab country
First, let me start with the following beginning.
The Egyptian People
We respect the Egyptian nation
and its concerns
On many Arab issues and the sacrifices of the Egyptian people
And this is a case
One thinks that this is a case in which we should enter an opening to understand or not understand the brothers in Egypt
Under this, under the assumption that you respect Egypt and the Egyptian people,
And we believe that Ahoh is a good person.
We disagree with Egypt on two points
He or dot
We prepared for the coup in Gaza and I don’t think
And we don’t enter
In Other People’s Business
Do not believe in interfering in the affairs of any country unless there is a scope for reform.
Did you have any involvement in the coup carried out by Hamas against the authority in Gaza?
Of course, it’s not like we actually knew about it, we only found out like the rest of the media did
Yes, we have relations with Hamas and we have relations with all parties
What made Egypt differ or is there a dispute between you and her on this point
This is where I’m going
The Hezbollah Plot
The Hezbollah conspiracy as well
But I am talking about my country
We were very surprised about this subject.
If it Shakes for Qatar
The Pyramids the A
He arrived, said Al-Ahram
Attacking Egypt and its Status
Can I?
We will return to the conspiracy they talked about
The days will reveal this subject
The beginning of my story is not the Gaza Conference
And I absolve the Egyptian people from it, I absolve President Hosni Mubarak from it
Back to the Mena Conference
After the Madrid Conference, remember the conference in Doha
This was an agreement for when the conference was to be held here
They said that we don’t want to hold the conference
Guys, we know that you have coordination with Israel
I'm from Qatar and this is it
What we want to understand is
We sat and talked and the conversation was always good
It has two parts.
What are they?
In disagreement
The Politics of the Middle East
We came to the conference, what happened in Gaza
His Highness the Prince spoke with all the presidents including his brother His Excellency President Hosni Mubarak
We were informed by a foreign state
The Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt has a point of view on this subject that what complicates
And they kill people while we watch
If you want to meet in Doha, we can meet at any place in the Arab League
It is a shame that on the margins of the Kuwait conference I have to discuss the issue
Before Israel and the Western world stand and see the subject
When we came, we said okay now this is going on and there is nothing we can do, we Arabs cannot stop it, no big country stopped this fight
Egypt announces request to stop fighting in Quseir, after a few hours the fighting stopped
‏ Even we
We should not take the Arab street with this naivety. We disagree with the Muslim Brotherhood on one point.
And this is in the international conventions
Your hospitals are not enough, doctors stopped at the borders
You stood on the border
There was, and no one would enter
The Muslim Brotherhood was very sensitive about this issue
The reason for the sensitivity is that Gaza is adjacent to Egypt and is considered part of national property
When we talk about any human issue in any part of the world, we talk about a human issue.
And we respect the sovereignty of Egypt
And I know the position, but this does not affect the Egyptian position
We hope for a lot in Egypt
It is the largest Arab country
And what we believe you can do is amplify our voices and the voices of others in the Arab world
To all other parties
means even the rescue operation after jump
What the Europeans tried to save
What happened in Gaza at the Conference
Whether it is a donor conference or I consider it a rescue for the government
We were not invited to a conference, we were invited to coordinate between the countries of the Cooperation Council
And we met in the Council of Cooperation
These amounts will not be paid to any party.
But you will spend
To the victims in Gaza
Directly and this was
It is forbidden to enter from all sides
I am happy for Egypt and all the people of Qatar are happy for Egypt because Egypt
Egypt's victory in political matters is important to us
‏ But you are rushing things
Just give me two minutes
One of the ministers boasted about what had been saved.
And whoever exaggerates against Egypt, I will break his leg and break his arm
God knows, I think this official has insulted his country
No, they did not fail and they could only talk about themselves when it comes to the truth
Those who helped them in this and this I said it is right for our brothers in Saudi Arabia, the Saudis intervened because the king has his own opinion on this subject
The Arab World’s Unsettled House
We agree
The king decided that this is in the interest
We accept King Abdullah’s decision and we respect and trust him
But if one of us says that we have prohibited them, that is an insult to those who prohibited them.
As if they were schoolchildren
That means, I think this
The anger has reached its peak
It is believed that Elohim should exert His power
We are sorry, we are sorry about this issue
If they think that a small country has no right to withdraw its right
‏ You are entering Darfur with your nose in it
Arab decision at the Arab League
Africa and a UN Resolution
I think the main problem is
Qatar's Support for Hezbollah's Plot
A conspiracy I don’t know what Qatar
So if he walks, it could be that after swine flu he appears in a place that is caused by Qatar that he spreads the epidemic
Qatar is a peaceful country that knows its size and its capabilities
But Qatar has a point
Qatar has a separate policy
If Qatar can solve any Arab issue, we consider it an honor
The Arab LI-E Conflict
Any Arab conflict we believe that it weakens our position in front of our main issues which are Palestine and the rest of the issues that we face
The Arab world has become a receiver
Even our analyses are the same as theirs
The West’s Analytics
While Shana we know him we know what happened in Pakistan
I swear to God, I want someone to receive me, spread the red carpet for me in Washington.
Has anyone blamed Qatar?
Did Qatar offend any Arab country?
I tried to contribute financially
These contributions are provocative
What is it possible that I go and say “peace be upon you” and you say that you greet me so that you can annoy me
This is a second case, meaning you have a problem or a shortage
This is a case that concerns you, not me
But if you have an internal problem
I always tell him
And especially after the speech of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah
In Kuwait and I know this man that he is honest
A man is what he says.
In his heart la la la this is not this is not the talk I always say
I always say this
I always told him during our conflict with Saudi Arabia that I said this
and go back to all the documents you have at Al Jazeera but
The case is different, no no no
Unilaterally, we said no salvation, we will stick to this position
And we tried as much as possible
I don’t want to enter into this subject
They will see their affairs, they will see their mistakes where.
And we will see that we are wrong, we don’t mean that everything we have is right
His Excellency Sheikh
The internal problems of Egypt
They want to get out of it
Qatar denies any form of conspiracy against Egypt externally or cutting ties with Turkey or any other countries
God has miraculous powers
And they are 70 million, if we are able to do 80
In their case there is also a problem that needs to be solved
You played a role in the Qandi Shliat case even though you knew that this file is an important one for the Egyptian government.
And I worked with the French
We received a call from a friendly country.
In Qadiyah Benchofa we said, "brothers, this is the case of the Egyptians," they said
We want to see this subject by request
Before Israel and other countries, we need to see a second side that sees this subject
When we saw this topic, we told them, "Bro, if the same conditions that the brothers who are talking to the brothers in Egypt
And we announced this, meaning that one official said we are laughing at the whole Arab League.
God, this means, poor thing
How did he pass it to us
President Mahmoud Abbas Stays
And we support this
Is he addressing his branch, is he addressing us, is he addressing the Arab world?
The problem is from you
I think I think this is a healthy phenomenon
I am not the owner of the island as I was accused
And the island needs to enter the media competition as there are many media outlets in the West.
In many media, it is the time of adolescence when they all swear at each other
But after a while they reach the stage of maturity
can can can no
First, we are with Saudi Arabia and our position is different
Even if we concede to Saudi Arabia, we accept this in Qatar.
Important relations
And Egypt is an important country but there is privacy in the Saudi-Egyptian relations
And also Egypt's privacy with any Arab country Egypt is the largest largest country
This is true, this is true, but with Saudi Arabia, in history and in relations, it is different.
It is a personal conflict between officials here and there
We respect the Egyptian President’s dignity
Please narrow it down to a difference in policies and views.
I told you a problem happened when there was an attack on Gaza
The second problem is that they are sensitive to things that we have not yet discovered in Qatar.
Why don't you arrange a meeting between the Egyptian president and the prince now
Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia, intervened in this matter
And as the newspapers said, a secret meeting was held first, and then we found it the day after.
A meeting was held between me and Omar Suleiman
In Saudi Arabia
The Irreversible Divide
And I can’t tell you that we agreed on everything
Let’s say it so that no one will interpret it as no, you compare yourselves
But dignity is dignity for the young and the old
The minister of Egypt got the appropriate satisfaction
Preaching to children
I think that this is a bigger Egypt, a bigger Egypt than this. I think it's a matter of expression.
Do you have a vision for solving problems with Egypt or are you like the Egyptian people waiting for heaven to intervene?
Please, I don’t want to talk about the interference of heaven and others, because God knows who lives and who dies
And this is what I call
He thought there was a style in it.
And our pride is Egypt
There Must Be a Better Way
Either stop with me or stop against me
Why does any Arab citizen suffer?
In the Arab world we suffer for it and this is the policy of His Highness the Emir
States Draw Power from Sources of Strength
The United States has sources of strength. China has sources of strength. France has sources of strength. A small state like Qatar has sources of strength.
In the name of God
What is clear is that there is nothing
That's all nonsense, you're all doing
But we are a small country, in my eyes and on my head
And repeat it a thousand times
So that no one says that we are allergic
None of us will confiscate it
You are now a tickle to Israel
Medicine before I go to Israel
What is your vision for solving the problem with Egypt
The problem is that they weren’t first
And every day they complain about America. If I may ask, which big countries are you talking about?
They deal with us out of interest and we deal with them out of interest
All complaints and
To Sabotage the Relationship
I think it diminishes any major country that does it.
It also diminishes our Arab dignity if we go and complain to each other.
Everything comes and everything we know
Our vision is to be based on Arab interest
And we are with them in anything
Are there any upcoming steps to mend the relationship?
‏ But I know that there are intimate relationships between the president and the emir
If one of them moved any matters
Opposing the rapprochement between the two countries will only result in a loss, as it will in the end
Maybe tomorrow, maybe after ten years. I don’t know, God knows. We, from our side, always attend any conference we are invited to.
Whoever invites us to a conference, we will attend and if we have a point of view, we will say it at the conference.
What we can do
Egypt is our elder sister in every subject but we have our own point of view and we discuss
That's all that is required whenever the time comes, we are of course happy about this subject
It was cancelled because of this policy
And we respect the Egyptian people as you mentioned
Of course, cancelling a contract and adding a contract, you ask about how many contracts are cancelled, ask how many Egyptians came to Qatar at the same time
But the state policy is that we are like you said, the Egyptian people are very close to us in Qatar, from the bottom of our hearts
On June 4 last year, you stirred the emotions of the Arab peoples by closing the Israeli office. On June 4, it was published by Arts.
Why are you saying we tickled them, when if we wanted to tickle them we would have closed it 12 years ago
When Shannen when everyone was carrying the Shannen banner before they reconciled with Israel and before secret meetings were held between some Arab countries and Israel
And and and after and after they made peace most Arabs
Whether under the table or over the table with Israel or speak with it in any of the attributes
If we wanted to tickle the emotions, we would tickle them in the previous Islamic conference
In the United Nations, Nasser's supporter, Belakji, hosted a banquet at the Israeli embassy.
Yes, he was a guest among many guests who attended a banquet for an occasion that the ambassador had held.
Because we sit next to each other with Israel at the UN, no one can deny this issue
And we found a glimmer of hope in lifting the burden from our brothers in Palestine
Now the administration has changed. The matter of Egypt used to take up a small part of my time, but unfortunately
I didn’t make you big, you made yourself big.
My question is about the United States and the new administration and its impact on your relationship with the United States as a Qatari national, given the presence of the largest military base in Qatar.
A Clash of Perspectives
A road in solving many issues in the region
And if they are all serious, we will help them beyond limits
You expect a special interest or a solution to the problems that existed between you and the Bush administration.
Many of these issues have been resolved
The Emir of Qatar yesterday spoke in Paris about what is happening in Iran
Iran has special relations with you, although its relations with the United States are bad.
First of all, it should be put in the context of internal affairs because we have to respect every country and its internal affairs.
Lebanon After the Elections
Before the elections Saad Hariri said in this program that the Doha agreement ends with the holding of elections
Is this your vision as well or do you see the agreement as standing or will you make a new agreement
The Doha agreement was for a stage that would lead them to hold peaceful elections
It has been a year and a half since the Doha elections
We were following it day by day and moment by moment until they reached the elections according to the Doha agreement
If we entered one of the electoral districts recently to correct some misunderstandings that occurred
‏ But you still have a stake in sorting things out in Lebanon
We are always close to Lebanon, you know that Qataris love Lebanon and go to Lebanon from...
That means I’m the first country you can visit after western countries Lebanon
A quick question about what is happening in Yemen
You entered the Houthi issue and there are accusations that you supported the Houthis
Or your intervention at least puts them on an equal footing with the state. Now there is a greater danger, and that is the danger from the south.
And we suffered what we suffered, this soul, why don’t you stop here, and why do you stop here in Qatar
We really had a lot of pressure on this subject, but this was our vision and this is the position of His Highness the Prince on this subject.
The Houthi Issue
And its stability has a positive effect on us, while its instability has a negative effect on us.
We intervene through a neutral mediator between the two parties
And we signed an agreement
But I understand that if this is to be used for other reasons
And I was with them there and we always stood with them in every subject
And and and and it has no basis in health
I think we don’t need it.
Sell it
And I say this and I am sorry, I know that there is a large Arab audience that will be against me
As I thank our esteemed viewers for their good follow-up, we hope that we have clarified to you some of Qatar’s foreign policy.
In conclusion, I bring you the regards of the program team. This is Ahmed Mansour wishing you a boundless welcome.
And peace be upon you and His mercy and blessings.
‏ Respected viewers, peace be upon you. Welcome to this special interview.
Ben Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, Prime Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State of Qatar
Of course, why do I say a special and exceptional interview because
Qatar and this man in particular was the main sponsor
Sir, a simple and direct question
I think I got it because there was a consensus among Arabs at the beginning
And we tried that when we went to the UN
The Arab consensus was important and the Lebanese dialogue from both sides was important
On reaching results
It is very important that the external noise
Many opinions or suggestions from abroad
Lebanese Arabic International if you like
‏ But it went through stages
There is nothing but something that means these stages were there
Does it mean complications in Lebanon?
Since a while ago, the truth
That is when you all came together and got directly involved in the Lebanese issue and the Lebanese file
Did you discover that the Lebanese knot is a major knot?
Lebanese, Arabic, regional, international needs a lot of decoding
Is it a small simple contract but it was exaggerated by external interference
Because we know that Lebanon is a beacon for journalism, a beacon for culture, a beacon for tourism, a beacon for many things
Lebanese must not allow
It affects the security and peace in Lebanon
Problem number one
The External Shocks of Lebanon
You decided suddenly, after twenty-four hours, to take everyone in one plane
Directly from the plane to meet the Emir of Qatar
They didn’t even expect it, meaning they couldn’t rest for a minute except what you are giving them.
It is the secret, secret, secret that we don’t let them rest and think more.
They make many calls. The secret
Let’s think about moving them to Doha, as we need a climate.
Or he will gather them in many various difficulties
In many circumstances
We brought them to these conditions, so that you can come to solve
And if we want to succeed, we must take them out of this atmosphere.
And quickly
‏ God, God, keep us on the right path, the path of the بيان الفينيسي or the بيان بيروت
Then we succeeded in getting them to agree to go to Doha.
Both parties decided to go to Doha
Some people think, for example, that Qatar is biased towards one side against the other.
And from Beirut but
Sayaah means that H.H. the Prince, if we are mediators
‏ In this process
Medicine, to be frank, is the country of the Sheikh
Have you seriously consulted
With at least the two main parties concerned here in Lebanon, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Syria
Especially the brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, I spoke with Prince Saud
He expressed his support for the idea
We took advantage of Prince Saud by saying that we
Everyone wanted a solution
His excuses are weak
If he goes, I will go to reason
His excuses are weak.
It should be removed because there is tension in me in Palestine
There is the Iranian nuclear case
The Arab League must have a mechanism to solve issues
The African Union is better than us in solving issues
He is trying to gather the sides.
And he holds conferences to solve the Arab-Israeli conflict that has been going on for years, but they cannot
That the Arabs come together or gather the parties if there is a dispute or interfere to help the oppressed
He should study
If we want the Arab League to be a real League of the Arab World, the
With him the car is a tool for implementation
One of the officials here is President Nabih Berri
Sin sin
Now it seems that the Lebanese have agreed
And God, see, we
Qatar first
It has never led to a result
In the interest of the Arabs
It’s Arab Power
We tried it in several
In the UN when we went to the Doha agreement
And the agenda is solving the problem and not another agenda
There is no doubt that
And the most important role they have in the Arab world as a whole in particular
‏ in a position
Stop it by our agreement
Come and help us
This is a dangerous topic and this is a dangerous topic but
Why have we reached the stage where everyone is playing in the arena here
In our yard
It is very important that the interests of our people and people prevail
Now we need an Arab summit after this agreement to see what we will do among the Palestinian brothers
What to do in Somalia
What will we do in Somalia, not a member of the Arab League
Why doesn't Sudan try to become a member of the Arab League? Iraq is not a member of the Arab League
We are part of the Arab world and a small part of the Arab world
We wish that this is not a suggestion, but an idea.
Can Qatar have good relations with Syria and Saudi Arabia?
I think that we, if asked to do something, do our best.
But I am sure that His Majesty King Abdullah
King of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
and his brother President Bashar
Historically, Saudi Arabia and Syria have been in agreement
It can be a passing phase
We will find it, God willing.
However, I insist on the question, if you don’t mind, can you play a role in this regard?
Even if it’s not public, you now have some kind of trust.
We seek any rapprochement between the Arab countries
And this is His Highness’s policy from the beginning but this subject means
Can what happened in Lebanon indicate that the region is heading for serious settlements?
Am, what happened in Lebanon is a Lebanese affair, the affairs of the region are still
Not very attached to this situation
I wish the opposite, I wish this
The beginning of a new state in the Arab world is a wish
We can create
It will happen somewhere else
In other words, does the Sheikh’s state fear that the escalation that was ongoing for a while
At Least From Here to the End of President George W. Bush
There is no doubt that I still have obsessions, whether it is about the subject of Palestine, meaning now the subject of Gaza
‏That means we, I mean I want to ask
I don’t want anything else.
He orders me to care about this human side in Palestine
We cannot reach them with medicine
and food
Electricity for the patient in the hospital
Who dies when the electricity is cut off
That means I wish
If the Arab League agrees on an amount for this subject of medicine and food, I call it medicine and food
Ya kii ma nabi al hilal al ahmar ayoوصلe
Let the Red Cross deliver it.
But excuse me, the Arabic side is committed to this Israeli siege
I don't want to get into the details of this subject, I'm just saying that we Arabs should deliver the medicine and the poison even if we disagree with Hamas.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia made an effort and undertook a commitment to the FVFV of the Holy Kaaba
This is a conflict that will only benefit the other party
Don’t deal with this party because we will solve your problem, this is not true.
And I
To this day, I still see no signs of a solution.
Do you fear an American-Iranian confrontation in the near future or do you see it as likely?
This is possible, of course we
At least talk about the State of Qatar
Iran is an important neighbor for us
We may not agree with all of your policies or they may not agree with all of Qatar's policies.
They say, for example, that they do not want us to have relations with Israel or contact
Maybe some people consider you as a party through the American rules that are there
We know how to deal with this subject
Some said that after the visit of the Emir of Qatar to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
As if he met, consulted or talked with the Saudi sponsor
In Istanbul negotiations between Syria and Israel
And I can say with a stroke of luck
The second subject, the Kingdom was keen to find a solution and I was in contact with Prince Saud
What happened in the last few hours
Change of tactics in the talks
Before you or before the parties
We are responsible for this
And from you from all sides and we locked ourselves in the room
And finally we found ourselves that and then His Highness the Prince intervened which was important
And from it the invention went
The without mentioning it now are over
And the message was clear when he said, “We know our size, our location, our role, etc.”
He wanted to play the role of Monon without provoking any other party
Whether Arab, regional or international
But still
It has become his responsibility
Whether you want it or not
It means a lot of envy, a lot of we want to avoid envy because we are a country
These are the countries
You can work or
I think this is the B icon combination.
Maybe a last or before last question about your current relationship with Washington, is it a cold, extended, distinguished relationship?
That means our relationship with Washington is a good one, let me say
There are different points of view on the issues
But this is our right, and if they talk about democracy, this is democracy.
How is it good, I mean how do you translate it on the ground as good relationship with
So if you talk about economics, she’s great, if you talk about education, she’s great.
If you talk about health, if you talk about politics, I can tell you that it is fine.
In my opinion, and very clearly during the next stage
In my opinion, we should leave the subject of confronting Israel.
And if we want to stop the game in the Arab arena
Mending Fences Between Palestinians
We agree on an opinion so that we can be a respected power
I don’t think we have that here
If we can be effective
Thank you, our esteemed viewers, for your good follow-up and until another meeting, God willing, with my appreciation to you
Welcome our viewers to this dialogue with the Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani
In this dialogue
We try to glimpse the Arab political reality and Arab efforts
Saada Sheikh, welcome
To Investigate What is Happening in Gaza
And I hope that through this dialogue we can
Let's shed some light on some of your questions
Entry of Israelis into Gaza in the form of a land invasion
And our goal was that there should be an Arab position
Its dealing with friendly countries
And the sisterly countries
And how to try to find a clear and strong Arab position that the Arab countries
And then we find areas for reconciliation.
We know that more than one Arab country has violated
In an arbitrary way
And no one was held accountable while
We find that we are being held accountable for everything, whether intentionally or unintentionally.
We are the specialists
The Only People We Ever Target
We always discipline in a style
I think what
To the degree that we will not be able
Let’s Hear It from the Leaders
To stop the disciplinary attack, we are
We did not want to create a rift in the Arab world
And there were five other verbal approvals
With two-thirds majority
But the aim of the meeting was not
We hope that it is correct and that our view is wrong because the goal
Solving the problem now is the goal of the summit, not the work
But does it solve the problem of the Palestinian bloodshed?
What we asked for now is that the ministerial does not cancel Qatar’s request
And also His Highness confirmed
In his speech, he said that we are not Egyptians if it is embarrassing for it to be in Qatar, we are not Egyptians if it is in Qatar, the summit will be wherever it is.
An Arab position that respects others
Yes, but as for the ministerial
We just want to say that the Security Council’s decision has been issued.
And Israel
She was not concerned about the decision and went on killing and shelling in Gaza
And we need to ask the Arabs what are we going to do
What are we going to do
After Israel
Implementing the Rest of the UN Security Council Resolution
Is there a position since Israel has not stopped
Shooting to Compel Brothers
On the decision, it is considered that...
From a few days
We will talk about the ministerial meeting
You support this approach in the end
We support an Arab summit, of course, and this is our idea and the idea of several Arab countries as well. Syria and Yemen requested it as well.
Orيدي in an Arab crack
Or all of us to the moderate camp
The Camp of the Unbalanced
And what do they mean by moderation?
The West that separated us
The Arabs who are called moderates and the Arabs who are not
We do not find that there is a moderate nation and an extremist nation
And then we need to know what moderation and non-moderation are. Is moderation walking according to Israel's plans?
and ending the case in a humiliating way
Or we just need to keep the issue alive
This is an important question
The subject means, do the countries
She goes along with Israel's plans and wants to solve issues in ways
I do not say that they follow Israel's plans and I do not want to accuse anyone
But I say
If we name the moderate camp
What Moderation Means to the West
Do we agree to slaughter a certain group of Palestinians
Of course, there have been elections
I am neither a supporter nor an opponent of Hamas, but I am talking about reality.
The reality is that there is
‏ Idea
Some of them call themselves the "re-decent movement"
But we have to ask ourselves, what does this radical movement want?
Something is wrong, or is she just demanding her rights
Or are we going to separate them?
And we also create other blocks
Opposite Lan we
Arabic Intellectual Interior
And this seemed to happen
‏That's why we don't want to fight a war on behalf of others
Yes, Mr. Sheikh, in short.
Who prevented the Arab Summit?
I can’t say prohibited, there are exceptions and the subject is well known.
The Issue of Prohibition
But just as I told you, we could have
We will take the vote and get two-thirds
But what was it, this goal, because it is not so much a challenge as it is an urgent need, we think we
I don’t think it is an urgent matter
OK, we went to the Security Council
Or in a Security Council resolution
But the Security Council’s decision, Israel said, will be implemented and then the subject will be considered.
All I want to focus on again
What I mean is, aren’t we applying the decision to the weaker party?
How will it be different from the first meeting
The topic of the arguments usually means there are differences in opinions and views
As important as it is
Are we ready to have a clear Arab position?
From humanitarian aid
I clearly support my brothers
And also addressing the Israeli Palestinian party that is said
This assumes that we should look for it, but I don’t think everyone is ready
Why Not Freeze the Arab Initiative
84 and we were committed, we were committed to the truce, 84 and the Israelis did not comply
In meetings, things get heated, but in reality, those heated arguments
expressing positions that express the contents of certain souls means
One of the scuffles that I know is
There is someone who described Hamas movement as a splinter group
And not even the minority
This is a situation that happened and we responded to it in I am a brother of one of the ministers
And I think this means what the West is saying.
But these are radical movements and these are a group of people and one says these are so and so
And I don’t want to be someone else’s man
And therefore always means and I don’t mean anyone
Any foreigner who finds
Or a western country or western countries you find
Among the Arabs
Yes, okay, Sheikh Sa'ada now
Call for a second ministerial meeting
And God, his schedule is one thing
Where are you, Arabs, with what is happening and what is the position of the three hundred and something nations?
One Million Soft Israel
which was followed by the decision of one thousand eight hundred and sixty
The issued decision
Israel has not yet applied it after it completed the task
And there is no doubt that the Arab delegation made an effort
Thanks for it in this decision
If we ask for chapter 7 because Israel is above the law, then Israel
And if you ask them again, they will say to them, we are understanding.
It is not the Arabs’ fault if they
If so, then Israel is not to be questioned
Above International Law
This is a fact
Why did you go to the Security Council and why did you link the holding of an Arab summit to what the Security Council will issue
In the summit, the Security Council will seek for us
It needs a difficult decision
To a decision
A minister may lose his post
We, the West, are afraid
And we are the ones who will testify that after they decide, for example
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
They did this aggression to rebuild Iraq completely at their own expense because they destroyed it
‏ Let’s not ask the Iraqi government or the people who died
No compensation
It's exactly the same in Sudan, as soon as they started talking about the trial of Bashir
Saada Al Sheikh
Saada Al Sheikh
A Great Arab Diplomatic Victory in the Security Council
He saw that there were difficulties for them in the Security Council because at first the talk was about a presidential statement
The consequences
Israel did not comply with it
I will commit after two days after a week after you finish the task
Because they did not comply with the decision
Sorry, people should comply
Because Israel accepted after the mission was completed
You have an alternative to this decision now
Everything we have done
We unfortunately executed some of the brothers based on their own initiative
Gaza Siege
I am a friend of the West and I do not mind if we have relations with the West and I am not
Anti-West, Not Anti-America
But they know the language of interests
Your friends if you are strong
Or if you have a point of view
In the end, our view is taken one hundredth and we say that we have won
‏ What is victory?
What it contains
I cannot say anything about any reservations because the decision has not
The Council Will Rule Itself
You participated in the drafting
We shared with you to some extent. Yes, we shared.
But you didn’t call for a meeting of the Arab ministers with the American foreign minister
‏But I’m sure the brothers who went will be satisfied with us
I referred to Arab sides for a certain benefit
‏ In this field, Sheikh Sa'adah
Two years ago until now
See, I don’t want to talk about accusations
I can claim that we have seen everything
Are they people
Israeli rejection is an international rejection and we also contributed to this rejection
And from here the dispute began and the siege started
And in the last month, Israel killed 28 Palestinians during the truce.
And they prefer to be hungry until they are exhausted because we don’t want them to be in power
Those, those, parties, happiness, Sheikh
It clearly says that the Palestinian-Palestinian dispute
means if there was
‏ Who created the Palestinian conflict? Maybe there was a Palestinian-Palestinian conflict
If I say to a side, "You are right a hundred percent",
I am not saying that Hamas is 100% right
I am not saying that
But May the mediator is usually a mediator at one remove from everyone
And I don’t mean only the mediator, I mean we Arabs to be on the same distance from everyone.
And we don’t want it to be there, so we have to end it in any way possible.
Training forces left and right
And once by besieging them and not giving them money or salaries
And one day we will create a positive model in the western region
The people in Gaza see how people are living
A comfortable life
‏ In contrast to the opposite in Gaza
You are invited to the second Arab Ministerial Meeting, but at this time
The talk about it is still going on between Hamas through Turkish mediation
This meeting that you invited to seems like an attempt to circumvent
Let’s go around if we start another initiative
We don’t have any initiatives
On this subject
Because Egypt is an important Arab country
And it is required from her to play a role and we support any Egyptian effort that leads to reaching an understanding
But it is important
We don’t come.
Tomorrow, on the side it will seem like it has won on the side
The Road to Discord
A Balanced Egyptian Initiative
Between international, Arab and human needs
And the requirements of Egypt’s role, which is an important role
It is a leading Arab country that we respect and appreciate.
This is what is required in your opinion regarding Egypt
The current proposals, does the current initiative not meet those requirements, Sheikh?
I have an idea about the initiative
We hear about it here and there, we get information about it here and there
I can’t comment on something I don’t know.
With respect to the government or the Palestinian presidency, it should be present and we all recognize the Palestinian presidency
But also there are people
Those who are affected on one side, we should take their point of view.
So that this mediation can succeed
By the way, take the point of view
The position of Hamas was clear that this decision was not taken, our opinion means how can it be issued
A decision in which the Arabs participate in drafting without contacting or taking the opinion of the main party concerned with the subject
I just want to say that, of course, we deal with the Palestinian state as a state
And the authority deals with it, let’s say K K K one-sided party
But now in discord one side is in one place and the other side is in another
This does not mean that if we deal with the people in Gaza we should drop our treatment of the group that exists in the West Bank or the Palestinian presidency
We deal with the Palestinians as a people and as a single government
If they ask for a limit on the Al-Gaza, they should be with them
And now we have a net to coordinate together
What was announced about it
First, the decision did not say to him, he welcomed the Egyptian initiative and any other initiatives
Some considered it as a reference
This is an interpretation, but what I understood from my reading of the decision is that he welcomed the Egyptian initiative
We hope that the Egyptian initiative will succeed in achieving
Stop the fighting
I don’t doubt our brothers in Egypt
Israel did not accept the Security Council's decision
And you consider this decision to be non-existent since Israel did not accept it
Even if you accept it later, things on the ground have changed
Yes, Sheikh, about the Egyptian efforts... Egyptian efforts
It also shares efforts with Turkey at the same time
Arab Incompetence
And about Arab differences that cannot be solved, so he came to occupy a place
It means that it was supposed to be occupied by the Arab parties
Welcome to Turkey’s Stand
A position that should be appreciated in the Arab and Islamic world
Turkey is an Islamic state
And therefore this is a natural role
And it is necessary for people to walk behind me
There is no Arab consensus on how to deal with the situation
One says let them finish the mission
A clear Arab position is needed against this aggression and its continuation and procrastination
Is Icon in an opposite Arab position
Israel is able to read in the book that I am not talking about an Arab-Israeli war and we are the people who always call for peace
No, we are a country, meaning that you would like to live in safety
But I don’t ask for an Arab war, I ask for a stand
Clear Arabic
In the context of talking about initiatives and proposals, you are following what is happening
And the proposals and conditions set by Hamas
Do you think
As an observer now, the field reality
‏ And the politician who emerged from the military process now allows Hamas to impose its conditions
It is necessary that it is right
This is where we agree on the point, this is where we don’t agree with you on the point.
The second thing
They are not present now, they are negotiating. I don’t know anything about these negotiations, as I told you.
The second thing
In the case of the Arab positions
This Arab Reality
What we have seen is the effect of the beginning of those operations
I doubt that the situation in the Arab street is much, much ahead of
About us, we as governments
Of course, I am sorry that some describe this popular wave
They told me about this subject before
Representing our peoples
Presidents now
‏ means if they want
At least they see what
Of course, there is a high ceiling and a modest ceiling
Stop normalization, stop diplomatic relations with Israel
Qatar Bank
The Israeli embassy in Doha is closed
Qatar Takes This Stand
She considers that the Arab side should be radical and take radical positions
‏ Whatever the Arabs agree on, we agree on it collectively
Let’s start if there is an Arab agreement
The treaty is one thing and relations are another.
We are ready
We Keep Up with Our Arab Brothers
But there should be a clear Arab decision and credibility
And they deal with others, not just countries that have relations
Even countries without relations
Very important
We are not clients of others
He says why doesn’t Qatar be a model in this field
If this is the only model we are ready to be in it
But we also want
An Arab Model, Qatar is Committed to Part of its Arab Obligations
‏ Like
And no one goes to sell anyone
In our problem, trust between Arab countries is lost.
And I just want to say that unfortunately we didn’t want to say that the brokers
And therefore it is very important
A formal invitation anywhere because we should rise above this
Some of them summoned the ambassador, some presented protests, some expelled the ambassador, like Schweissl.
And this is part of the dispute
But some of them summoned the ambassador, and those who summoned him are permanent members of the five. All of this is just a movie for our people.
We talked about the modest ceiling of the popular demand
There are many who call for opening more fronts, many who call for Syria to open a front with Israel.
See, I told you that we call for peace and not for fighting with Israel.
We do not ask for a fight with Israel
To fight with Israel
And how will we agree
What are the problems as well
What made us talk to each other to overcome our differences
I was surprised by what Sheikh Sa’ad said
On condition that countries do not sell some to others
What do you mean
means now
The street will not spare us
Saada Al Sheikh
Is what is happening today a continuation of the project that started with the 1982 Lebanon War?
Do you think there is a difference
No, I don’t think there is any difference in the objectives
‏ meaning Lebanon had its own land liberated
The other parts are, of course, under the UN deposit.
Or the like
Lebanon means we dealt with the Lebanese issue in a big way
Israel of course needs weak countries around it
So that you are the boss and you have the upper hand
And of course there are countries that are supported by foreigners
And therefore she wants to remain the only power in the region
And now they want
Change this example in Gaza
In Lebanon you speak with many communities
And how many parties
While Lebanon is sleeping, Palestine is speaking about one thing only
But I will confirm to you that the Palestinian problem listened to the Arabs more and to foreigners
Two sides and from here the gap and each one thinks he is in control of the other
In your opinion, as an observer and follower
As planned, it ends with a broken bone
As Arabs, do we accept this? Because this example may be repeated for those who are resistant
He says his opinion
For Israelis or others in the future
And we set an example
The highest in obedience and in helping to break the backbone
I mean, in our proverb, I and my cousin are on the stranger, and I and my brother are on my cousin.
We suppose now there is a conflict with Hamas and I do not say that Hamas or others are free from error or the authority
They all have mistakes
Now we should pass this subject
To humiliate a party
Here failure will not be a failure of the class
Saada Al Sheikh Qatar has been initiating proposals for a while
Resolving That Which Has Been in Lebanon
That happened in Darfur. We will discuss this subject, even if briefly, after a short while.
If we
I don’t want to put pressure on our brothers because there is sometimes sensitivity
I have no objection to all these initiatives, the important thing is that the issue is resolved.
We are not aiming to put Qatar on the top headline any more
It means that it was not one of the goals of His Highness the Prince
These were his objectives, how do we stop this bleeding
Stop the Tyranny
What happened means beyond imagination
And we are in Qatar
Do we know something they don’t know, I don’t think
But the most important thing is that we have the intention.
Sincerity to reach an honorable solution
Talking about the initiatives it is useful to know where the initiative is in relation to Darfur, the solution of the Justice and Equality Movement
And the Sudanese government in Khartoum
And it is special for any solution of the Darfur problem because the Darfur problem started
The Arabs helped
But when the case was brought to the international level
According to which we will take revenge on the system and now we want to solve the problem and we don’t know how to solve it
And we always apply the decisions like I mentioned at the beginning, meaning we are the best people to apply the decisions
The dimensions of the issue of competition, is there also competition in the subject of Darfur
‏ What I don’t want to do in this subject
Before we end this talk, سعاده الشيخ, there is an economic summit
Will this summit be held? Will you attend this summit?
No, we will ban the summit
We hope that it will be held in a different atmosphere than the Arab one, but it is programmed.
It's a flaw
Well, if the Arab leaders had come to this summit
When the blood of Palestinians was spilled in Gaza, and now they are being arrested for financial and economic reasons
I helped to ignite
‏But it seems that no one is afraid of this street
What you know about the circumstances, I mean, of course, we don’t wish anything but safety for all of us
And be safe
But what does it mean, no one takes anyone with their small one
The Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani, thank you very much
Dear viewers wherever you are, peace be upon you.
What is the point of this celebration and how sincere are the statements of the High Commissioner for Human Rights
The disabled are the most neglected group in the world
And what about our Arab region and its interest in this issue
These questions and more we ask our guest for today's episode.
former UN Special Rapporteur on Disability
She holds a bachelor's degree in arts, social service and sociology from Qatar University
And also a master's degree in social planning and social policies from the Egyptian Helwan University
and occupied many positions in the field of disability
Among others, he is a founding member and the general coordinator of the National Committee for Persons with Disabilities.
The year two thousand and ninety-eight
and Vice-President of the National Committee for the Disabled of One Thousand Nine Hundred and Ninety-Nine
Until 2013
It also contributed to the establishment of the Center for People with Cerebral Palsy
With people with disabilities in Qatar
Our guest has overseen the launch of many programs, projects and media campaigns.
Disability-related activities in the Arab world
I also contributed by giving lectures and participating in meetings, conferences and forums
Welcome, Mrs. Hessa, to this episode.
The approved term is people with disabilities
In the beginning, we called them disabled people. In the 80s and before.
More educational when
Part of those who provide that education
An important document appeared at the United Nations in 1993
‏ Before we go into the details, let’s mention this term
As for the other provinces, although there are provinces that are not or are classified as developing and are classified as poor
And Latin America, especially the real Latin America, this trend is stronger than in any other region
But statistics prove otherwise
The trend towards the legal path is found in the Arab world in many countries
Maybe the resources are there and the political will is there
‏ Fine, let me tell you some statistics, you are probably aware of them anyway
Eighty percent of them are from poor countries
UNESCO says that about 90% of disabled children in poor countries do not go to school
Ms. Hessa, how do you comment on these statistics?
It is true to a large degree
I saw it first in Darfur and Gaza and in areas that are exposed to such events, which are wars and conflicts
There, do not differentiate between a disabled person or a non-disabled person, the numbers are big.
Divide the illiteracy rate among children by the mother’s illiteracy rate, for example, about 53 or 52.
And in other countries
There are many obstacles that prevent these children from going to school even if they are not disabled
The city does not have any infrastructure, even if this child found that school
He can access it
For the children and for the other inhabitants as
Something like this means these projects and agendas are great but we don’t hear about them in reality very often
Except when we talk about the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, which the world celebrated a few days ago, what is the point of this celebration?
The Arab World’s Position in the World
Better off than people who don’t have a disability at all
There are organizations that have arrived and established many projects
It applies a very important health strategy
Through this strategy
There is an overlap between human rights and working with specific marginalized groups such as people with disabilities.
In a degree of awareness now the Arab world is better
At the point of awareness we stop to receive calls and complete our dialogue
Thank you
I have two questions I would like to ask her since she was a member of the UN
What is the second point?
UN laws that call for, for example, fighting systems that cause disability to the child's society, for example, Syria's intelligence system
Is there a law that allows me to file a lawsuit against the regime as there are many in Syria?
Yes, Suleiman, your idea is clear. Suleiman Kroe, tell us from Syria, thank you very much for being with us. We have Naif Al-Saad from Kuwait. Please, Naif.
Peace be upon you and God’s mercy and blessings
And the peace be upon you
Good evening
Good evening, please.
I have a mental disability, please.
So listen, Arabs say that the hot one understands by signs
What is the verse in the Quran that says: In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Most Merciful. Praise be to the One who has given us the ability to speak and has given the ability to speak to everything.
So I’ve been sitting for more than thirty years, maybe I won’t speak, maybe one or two words a day.
سبحان الله الله انطقني
So he was talking about the gran in and I found
It means an attack on me that I am exploiting the Quran and that I am a hypocrite and I mean people and so on.
They point at me and target me, and they are in the lowest level of hell.
I only got slander
And they don’t even know what the hell they are talking about
He who lives in glass houses should not throw stones.
And of course psychological disabilities
It falls within this definition. Question. Question by Mr. Suleiman regarding
United Nations programs or its reactions to the causes of disability such as political or other goals
Approaching different organizations and agencies
To discuss, convince and know, pardon, to what degree
Disability is on their agendas and meaning
UNESCO, ILO and UNICEF, these organizations actually put disability
It is one of the programs that tries not to overlook children who have disabilities
The Right Schools
From different environmental and aspects
UNICEF as well
‏ But there is a shortcoming that we must admit that there is a shortcoming of the UN as well
‏ What are the most prominent weaknesses and shortcomings you talked about?
Regarding the United Nations
The issue of routine and bureaucracy
Directly, I was present in my country in the state of Qatar.
But there was routine and bureaucracy that hindered
My work, in particular, I have seen it also during the limitations or shortcomings
He struggles or tries and fights for the recognition of people with disabilities
Until it reached a satisfactory level for her, she did not put it in a separate material as the World Movement for Disability wanted
But it occupies a rather suitable part
Unfortunately, there is no coordination between them
This is one of its major shortcomings
The survey applied by the Special Rapporteur and applied to States
Part of the staff or part of the workers in those programs
Unfortunately, we only received three replies from forty-eight organizations and agencies, only three of which came to us.
Don’t put
The issue of disability has been addressed in a stable and continuous manner for many years, although this issue is primarily a human rights issue.
In the last period, yes, thank God, for two or three years
The disability issue is at least being discussed through events such as seminars and others
Hi, peace be upon you
Dear lady, why are there no laws and decisions that are binding for the Arab countries, and who is responsible for activating these international laws?
For Arab countries and allocating salaries for example allocating a salary for the disabled
Are there any funds allocated by the United Nations?
Are these funds going to governments or to UN offices? And do these aids really reach the disabled?
And by the way, if there are no binding decisions for Arab countries
Thank you very much Ahmed Al Halabi, you talked to us from Greece
With us is Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia. Please, Ibrahim.
سلام عليكم
And the peace be upon you
Pan adopt this proposal
And that is to write directly to the Secretary-General of the United Nations
Transform this box
He or a producing factory
1% only of the annual net profit
Back to our guest to answer the questions of the callers
And he says that doctors advised him to undergo surgery but
It costs a lot and he cannot afford it. Where can he turn?
He is from Algeria
I think it is important to meet the needs of brother Naje.
Like any other rights, for example, the rights of people with disabilities
All these are his rights and duties that this citizen must get
To accede to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities this is a binding and legal agreement
Fulfilling the rights and needs of individuals within their national scope
Or even at the level of NGOs
It is binding on all countries and there should be a control to ensure the implementation of these laws
At least at the level of the first-line managers, there must be awareness
At least we must work on these documents in this way
Even if there is no significant commitment
There was a response to the reports of the monitoring that you were doing and was there any interest
But don’t forget that the normative rules are a morally binding document, not legally.
to be committed and ratified
And understanding that these issues will be solved or discussed or raised within a community that suffers from many problems and issues
Naji Zakarné, Director of the Qatari Center for the Deaf, Sign Language Expert on Al Jazeera
‏ In the beginning, Mr. Ali extends his deep thanks to Al Jazeera channel
Thank you very much for broadcasting this special episode.
Now Ali is talking and saying that I am very proud
It was and still is a servant for all with special needs in the place where it is.
And we support her and stand by her forever and ever
And I also say that there are many with special needs.
Some of them do not know this agreement, because there were no training courses
Regarding it and especially if it is in schools or hospitals or in government and private institutions
It is necessary that this agreement be published
It is as if a law concerned with people with special needs in all countries of the world
And this is more strongly emphasized that countries
Adopting and signing this agreement
Like Qatar and some other countries, we have also signed this document, the aim of which is to serve people with special needs and us.
Thank you very much, my colleague Naji. You reminded me. I spoke on behalf of Ali.
Thank you very much.
Your opinion may make a decision
The former UN Special Rapporteur on disability, we could start with the suggestion made by one of the callers, Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia
On the establishment of a support fund
It is a voluntary fund and accepts any contributions from countries.
This means that the fund is supposed to be spent on the activities that the Special Rapporteur will carry out when he is
Even the Arab countries did not offer donations except for one country, Syria.
‏Therefore, fulfilling those obligations is a problem that exists in the United Nations.
The box that
Unfortunately, non-compliance by member states and lack of interest
And many unfortunately say it with every meaning, that we do not care about the situation now
It is a question of obligations
Human Rights
Man in its broad general form
‏ The marginalized
But that is why those pacts exist
So these countries die but the idea that the brother launched is good
It is necessary that there is not only an independent fund in its independent form, but also the organizations that are already present in the region
From what she has in her budgets
Step for projects for the disabled in Gaza
Assistance for the disabled
It’s always the case, it means political factors interfere
His state or government has provided significant support
Unfortunately, the number has shrunk
‏ by symbolic amounts
‏ My father is disabled
Of course, I withdrew my nationality from it.
The girl withdrew, she has a daughter of her age
Sometimes I
Troubles in Teaching
We travel or go out, and we get confused
Peace be upon you and God’s mercy and blessings
And the peace be upon you
And we can
Reconstructing themselves with knowledge
I wish that the Arab countries would allocate part of their budget
Thank you very much Behjat, Kروان Behjat from Kuwait
Aisha Mohammed from Qatar, please
سلام عليكم
And the peace be upon you
Good evening to you and good evening to Sheikhah بنت خليفه
‏ I just want to send her a message of thanks and appreciation.
In the past years
With our best wishes we are the parents of the with special needs
In support of continuous Sheikh Hessa for them
A flag-bearer of honor from Tunisia, welcome
And there is another level, the genetic one.
I think that the care of the genetic level reduces the rate of the disabled.
There, in our Arab customs, the nephew always takes the son of his uncle, his aunt, his cousin, his niece, his cousin’s daughter, and so on.
This means at this level, which is the level of disability, thank you
Comment and response to what was said in the viewers’ calls
There is a truth as you said on the national level
I know that there are guidance and support programs
It is among the health services
Which also falls under the umbrella of Hamad Al-Thakhkhaba
Within the psychological clinic, I also believe that there are programs in education, the LLL council, and the higher education council.
I am not sure if the special education department is still there
But it is certainly part of health services. Yes, there is support and medical services.
And rehabilitation for these cases
Prevention is better than cure. He referred to the genetic factor. Marrying a relative. Are there any campaigns?
e.g. for awareness
In this field
Sure, this is a very important and dangerous point
And it is one of the things that I and others have talked about in many words and many posts
Yes, there are awareness campaigns that are not only directed
It was implemented by the World Health Organization
‏ Also for UNICEF
Now in many Arab countries, including Qatar
And Tunisia is certain
Now there are mandatory early detection decisions
And which was applied in many countries
All this on the preventive side
And have such campaigns been responded to?
Positivity, especially as it clashes with customs and traditions
Of course, that’s the difficulty, that it clashes with societal culture
It is a decision in the strategies to face that and commit to it.
The issue of early detection, for example, is a very important issue before marriage
I ask you if there are any statistics about the disabled.
Especially the handicapped in the Arabic region
Qais on the Arab region in the sense that
And especially
With the latest events in the region
In the regions and in the conflict zones, in the wars in relation to wars, conflicts and others
Every dead person corresponds to three disabled people
Events in Lebanon in Darfur in many areas
No, never, it is not enough. First of all, the problem is...
With Human Rights Principles
There must be a position for people with disabilities and their programs and plans
Within the existing agendas of the ministries, institutions, governmental and non-governmental organizations
In cases such as wars or unrest
‏ Just for your information, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay
In the world and even more strange is what the International Committee for the Monitoring of Human Rights for the Disabled said that the statistics of the population
That's why people with disabilities are not included in general population statistics
It is not always announced
For example, in the state of Qatar when the census was conducted, I think more than five years ago
But honestly
In cooperation with the device with the planning council and the
The Council prepared it as a fact and with our participation as the office of the Special Rapporteur
More disability classification
The needs that are supposed to be there
What kind of all these important details that must lead you to the result
Is there a disabled person or not?
Exactly, but at least
Statistics are somewhat advancing in this regard
سلام عليكم
Madam, thank you for this program and thank you Sheikh Hessa
But thank and praise God that I am a Qatari and receive this attention from my country, which means
And my daughter is now a student in independent schools and receives good education, thanks to God.
And I would like to thank Mrs. Hessa
And its role as a motivator and its role that makes us not to be afraid and not to worry about our children
And praise be to God and thanks and many thanks to her, and to whom and to whom does this category feed
Thank you, thank you very much, Fatima Al Dosari. You told us from Qatar. We will stay in Qatar with Latifa.
Peace be upon you
And the peace be upon you
Dear Lady, the reality and the hoped-for, which we are waiting for, is that you solve the problem of our stateless children
Where are our Qatari sheikhs among our children?
I hope she will respond to it, respond to this question
Hello, peace be upon you
And I bear witness to what the State of Qatar was providing in particular for the hearing impaired.
We had an early detection program for hearing impairment
‏ There is the Supreme Council for Disabled Persons
For people with disabilities regardless of the type of disability
Even the MGOs or other communities
It is the reality and the expected that if compared during five years
What is provided for the disabled five years ago and now
‏ Thank you very much for Karem Nasim who talked to us from Jordan and I return to our guest
Of course the
The community as a whole with its individuals, especially families who have
Children with disabilities have ambitions and high expectations from
Whether at the planning level or at the implementation level
But with regard to one of the points you mentioned, which is a very important point
Children who do not have documents or anything whether in Qatar or elsewhere
The International Convention, like many other international documents
And a commitment to translate them into plans and strategies
That these services are provided automatically
From the Universal Declaration of Human Rights regardless of religion, race, color, sex or nationality
Okay, Sheikhah Hessa, so you used to be a former special rapporteur at the UN on disability after six years of work
You wished, didn’t you?
Maybe time didn’t help, maybe the financial aid wasn’t enough.
That means there are many achievements that I am proud of
Through my participation or through the existing organizations and through the L governmental institutions in many countries
In the Arabic region in particular, I focus
More research and studies
We started from a global survey that appeared from us more than a report
Awareness raising is a continuous process that must be worked on continuously and significantly.
Coordination among Arab countries
And among the people themselves, people with disabilities and their organizations, because they are
But they have a duty that must
They Fight for It
Thank you very much
Thank you.
Dear viewers, at the end of this episode, I would like to thank everyone who participated with their opinion and comment.
Tomorrow, God willing, we will meet with a new guest.
Stay with us with your calls and messages in a new episode of Live with. See you
Good morning
I am very happy to have you with us
At first before we start and ask the different questions and discuss this morning
Shimaa, I congratulated you, maybe I was too late
The whole Middle East deserves this global achievement
Qatar has really put us on the world map
Thank you, Qatar
Also, Ali, please eat.
First of all, good morning to all the viewers
And I say congratulations on the hosting and to the people of Qatar as a whole
And God willing, like what Sheikh Mohammed said, that is
Before it was a dream, and now God willing it will be a reality and work will start from today or during the announcement period
You expected that Qatar would host the 2022 World Cup
Despite the existence of strong files, like America, Japan, Australia, I was not afraid in this field in this subject specifically
No, see, I mean, I’m being honest with you, 70% of the time I’m the Qatar that doesn’t want
Our file is very heavy
Fio plans are really global and competitive
We were the best competitors
‏ Why are we afraid
But thanks to God, the file on Qatar was really strong and deserved it
It is true that the 22nd file and the World Cup hosting in Qatar
What does it mean to you, F in the math department?
In this field, for them, the joy will certainly be big, very big, God willing
That means I like it, we used to talk about it before the show but I liked to hear it on the air like that
At the moment of announcement
Where were you? How did you receive the news? How was the shock? I don’t know, say, say, you tell us and tell the viewers.
In the radio
The whole world is behind us
They rolled up the advertisement and there it is.
How did you see global media
At the level of sports channels as a whole, no one insisted, especially Arab countries. Thank God, everyone has supported it
It is just an announcement that Qatar has the right to host.
All Arab countries and it is not strange for them to do this kind gesture, as they announced that they are ready to advance to Qatar whatever it takes
Media-wise, as human resources, as volunteers in the future
Even on the external media level, Chimaa
‏That means I went to celebrate Waeef's bad luck
He included them within the A, the French news agency was also included, I think.
We also have meetings
No one insisted, and now Qatar is like this, let me tell you, it's been reminding me every day
Hundreds of times a day on the smallest spot on earth to the largest spot on earth
I expect that everyone will know about Qatar. If you don’t know about Qatar, the earth is round, and now the Internet exists.
Owner of the 2022 World Cup
Any football player dreams of serving his country, so he should be included in the national team
Of course, any player in the Qatari league would wish to represent the national team.
Is it positive that one kills himself even in the games?
Even if he wins and the team enters, he will put everything he has.
It means whether in exercises or in matches because the team’s logo on his chest he has to put all he has
God, the officials didn’t slack off, whether in terms of interest in the players, especially the young ones, that is, they teach them professionalism from when they are young.
food sleep
Tell me about your experience, you have played in more than different stages, how was your experience and where is the most important for you?
And God knows, of course
I was included in the stages of the national team from the seedlings to the first team.
Do you camp with the clubs, with the club, with the national team?
So each stage has its own character
Yes, Allah knows, so you were just moving around
We are used to you now, as a sportswoman.
Every time we see you, you’re always like that, a sports fan. We wanted to get some information from you and know the sports news through Lana, what’s the sports news with you?
I mean, to be honest, I don’t watch it much, I read about the variety, meaning by variety we used to host stars but in their fields and we also host stars in sports
Like Ali and others too in their sport field
On the contrary, sports activity
‏ What’s wrong with us, we used to be the capital of sports
Qatar, let us become the capital of sports and world football
Instead of being in variety shows, present social, economic and cultural programs
You have different fields, you have a basketball, different championships
But then sports
Great sweet
I wished it was true
I wish that if now I was 24, I was 10.
In fact, the young players got a big chance
And they hold it, meaning like what they say with their hands
What is sweet to me, God willing, is the word I want to address to the players
Inshallah, that is, the young people who will have a bright future inshallah in the coming days God willing
Of course, I told them that this is a great opportunity and they should take advantage of it.
And this is a once in a lifetime opportunity, they say.
They should be used extensively.
What’s new with you? How are you? What’s new now? I know that we are a bit scared of the holiday.
Tell us about your news, God willing.
In constant contact with the event. Inshallah we will attend the Asian Cup in one month.
We finished two days ago with the Gulf Cup, by the way, congratulations to the Kuwaiti team
News publishing is also available, meaning we are keeping up with intuition
Of course, I am essential to the idea of Qatar TV, which was the first appearance for viewers through the Qatari screen
He never initiated this favor to anyone at all
And may Allah transfer the media message through all channels
Whether they are private channels or sports channels or other channels
Qatari TV, keep up the good work
We certainly wish you success, God willing, and we are still on this subject
First of all, I would like to thank the Al-Wakra Club administration for
And the masses of Al-Wakra Club believe that
My childhood in Al-Wakra
Sheikh was with us yesterday, Sheikh Nasser was with us
From the club
I am the son of Wakerah and the grandson of Wakerah
But just like I told you before, these are professional programs
Belongs to every individual on the land of Qatar
Youth, we know that youth love sports and addiction like you
How do we make a sports star enter the social arena?
Media awareness in the first place means media that plays a very important role in spreading sports in different fields. Let’s say life.
You have youth addiction but currently sports are starting to enter schools, sports awareness in schools.
When there are occasions to celebrate, any sports occasion they make no celebrations
When you are in the Qatari street, we will see the son walking past the street signs, and this is also considered a sports awareness.
The female element for what it is specialized for is not a place in the stands or anywhere
Hey, let's talk about women's awareness or let's say sports for women's participation in the sports field
And then we have the Qatar Women’s National Team
Imagine that sports are expanding, thanks to God
And I also expect that the time period
To work on many projects and raise awareness about sports. I expect this is a sufficient period.
If it is studied correctly and done correctly
Hey, it's enough and the same thing that we have to use it properly like the cat
Then in Nua’tah I was going to take advantage of how the small generations can take advantage of the national team
means the capabilities of the experience of all available devices
Also, in his important work, we in Qatar, thanks to God, are known in a big way in the Gulf and Arab societies for our great love of sports.
How can I attract this audience to follow me permanently for sports news on the on the matches that take place in Qatar
And be present at the same time
But you know, most of the Qatari street loves sports, loves football, but the problem is in the attendance
If you enter forums you will find that the interest is great especially in the forums of some clubs or most of the clubs
Big interest in the football league
As a player, as a Qatari citizen, what is the solution you feel could be used to attract you to come, even if you are an athlete, even if you are a player?
What is the way that they can follow the matches, my friends, my guys?
He depends on the person himself rather than thinking generally or something
Some of them like to watch him on television or in meetings they gather
For example, Japan has developed a big plan to attract a large audience to attend
When you attend the matches, I collect points I don't know what they are worth, now Lilaouwa has solutions, God willing.
And the Arab
The most important point is that all players will be present in Qatar, God willing, especially in file number 22. What do you think we need?
Besides material support, what else is the job that I really need?
And provide the means that would enable them to really deserve the name of the Qatari national team and participate in the big World Cup
The time when he said that now it is about to end, I thought when, I was saying when, ماشالله the time passed so fast with the sweet ones
We make the impossible possible and make dreams that we thought were impossible come true, but thanks to God we are living in reality now
Just like Sheikh Mohammed, these are moments of celebration, but work has begun
God willing, 2022 is an event befitting the name of Qatar
I congratulate every person on the earth of Qatar and tell him frankly that Qatar has now become a landmark of the world
Hosting 2,222
And thank you to the elegant media lady Lana Al-Adai, we wish you all the best, God willing, and we will always follow you so we can benefit from sports.
Thank you very much, the joy is in the eyes of the Emir.
Young Qatari talents
And they are sitting and singing a new kind of songs that appeared during this period
But in the form of a quick music and rhythm
And also a rap fan, God willing.
Be with us, our viewers, and our journey starts from this moment, good morning.
We are trying to cast so many looks on him
In short, rap can be defined as fast singing music.
Its performer hesitates and doesn't sing a rhythmic, fast pace of the song's lyrics
It is composed of a large number of rhymes that deal with a number of different topics and issues
And which may be a character sometimes
A political emotional meeting
‏And it is often controversial
And quite liberal
And our rap performer, our viewers, does not sing the lyrics of the song.
But he repeats it
And the voice is a secondary factor
In general, the voice is not important in rap songs
That’s why the singer is not called a singer but a rapper or raba.
And the rapper is concerned with the following racism in the songs
For example, the flow of breath, synchronization, for example, or throwing.
Oh my, dear followers, oh my, dear audience, oh my, dear lovers
They have a special rap style
And I expect they will give you a more and better idea than I personally.
Good morning, hello
And, you know, it was a period when we loved doing something new
We are distinguished by something
‏ Why can’t we rap?
Then rap is an art that exists in every country in the world
Why aren’t you in طر
So we said, meaning we’ll invent something new
That means we give him an idea of it in a message
In it we will talk about the negatives and positives that happen in our society
It means we deliver a message first, second, that it means it is an art, means
This is one of the different arts, and by the way, for the viewer, this information may have solved many social and psychological problems for young people to a large extent.
I expect that every time it changes and this with the change of time I expect
And God, the blubber was a little weaker
We sing from 2005, the beginning of the Taghib was weaker
In the announcement about ourselves we say that we are the new beginning of 2010.
In Tagboul and more popular
She loves, for example, trying to sing and perform rap in the same style during this period. I noticed this.
Sure, a big percentage of people
Also, we should talk about his work in which he founded several bands
A beautiful band, you've had so many parties, can we talk about this band
How was it established and how was the idea that one can really make a difference and how many of you are in this?
And God, in the beginning, we, that is, before the band was established
Rap has reached Doha, meaning it started in the 1950s
means every one means love the idea of ​​rap that he sings rap he sings he goes down the website
I go down, Salman goes down, فلان goes down, so there is a competition
‏We got to know some people
We are competing with each other
After a while, after a long time, we arrived in 2010.
But there was a system of groups, so this is a group by itself, meaning three or four together
‏ So, we said it, we’re all one group, called Rappers Group
O Balin Lizi Qiyapers
‏ We agreed on this, so let’s say we are all in the same boat together
And we came out, meaning we were representing this and saying the idea is the same
It is about five and twenty units.
25 O, Allah! What a big collection!
Okay, is there anyone who plays or plays or plays, everyone performs rap songs
And he is the one who coordinates and he is the one who composes
Can you say something personal?
‏ The numbers are how are they arranged by the group Excellent how are the twenty-two arranged
He is every one for himself and can do as he likes.
‏That means every member of the band can make a whole song
‏ without involving any other person
But in it the abilities can differ, for example like if Salman, that is better than me
He hears it and says no, the words here are not something else
Can everyone adjust for the second?
Help a little
So that there is actually an official body that supports these works or even a company that supports them
And there will be a distribution of health
So that the work appears like that, in a sophisticated style, and is really something official
And God, we really wish for honesty, meaning we wish for support so that they tell us that a company is going to build and say, let’s go, we’ll produce the album for you
We don’t have any problem, you know.
Some things are difficult.
So why don’t you think of it as the first initiative coming from you
‏ Just get to know the first CD
And then you can attract other partners
2007, I did a CD
I distributed it to the youth, God willing.
How was the turnout
‏ And Allah
Text text because 2017 maybe I’ll try rap, it’s not possible to make it big in the Gulf
But not now
We were preparing to take Insolf out for a walk, but we didn’t go out because... for example, you hear that there is a big group of young people between Valencia and Keasto, for example.
Let’s talk about it
They told us that we are arranging a party for you
It means they covered all the costs and all the procedures and the coordination meant and work meant and frankly meant we didn’t expect it to be at this level
It was really blown up and it was amazing work
And there was a bit of pressure, so there were no ads, there was nothing, in fact, the party
What was in the advertisements, there was nothing, meaning before the party two days ago
‏ We said that no one wanted a party two days before the announcement of no one wanted a party
We are inside, before the party starts.
So this means a point for us
Any fahna means that our voice reaches the families, not the youth
Our view is that we expected the idea is just that, it’s the right of the youth
‏In this stage, we discovered that there is a category, more than one category, that listens to us
In a song called "Conna" there was a big interaction with the audience and the band
And most of the songs had interaction
Most of the songs are not Arabic, but since there were many songs and we were a large number.
The group means almost the whole group
What are these words, how do they address different issues
We talk about the situation we are in, but what are we in so quickly?
At least bake it even if it is just a little
Even if they spoke before I am not I
You need to pull the LLLL random camels
If means means the rhyme comes out
It means that we thought to criticize, no, to write this word is better.
Okay, so we have a song here, let’s see it.
From one of the songs you made
And I will follow her and I will also see the public's opinion on this subject
And God willing, they also enjoy such words
Thank you for loving the introduction because it has the name of my program.
With you now, K.D. and DJ Mr. Bubu on the Doha Morning Show
Good morning, good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This is Mr. Bubu and this is his cat, One Hot To Brew.
And don’t forget the program starts at 9:30 in the morning, meaning that every one is sitting in front of the television.
We have with us in the preparation Hassan Naama and we have with us in the presentation شيما الحمادي
With us in the directing, Nasser Al-Maliki, episode rappers Qatar for sure
It really has the name of Al-Al. Thank you, guys. May God bless you. I am.
I applaud you and the youth above in the control room
It was recorded last night.
And who wrote the words in you or who
‏ Let everyone write his/her own words
If only I had come, I would have written some words for يوسف
Not only does he write these words in love of singing in love of emotion
I expect you have to write about the 2022 World Cup and the Asian Cup, is it right or wrong?
We are definitely releasing a song, so we’re definitely going to talk about this subject
But just be a little formal or something
I expect there should be Qatari songs, songs about the homeland and the love of the homeland.
Through rap art, which is rap art, indeed
Yes, I expect that today everyone is waiting for
We are seeing it live on air now
And of course this cup adorned the streets of Doha
If our viewers, as we saw Doha getting ready to host the Asian Cup
And the concerned devices have completed all arrangements to be in reception
The glass and metal are expected to be definitely more than what we saw
Before a while I expect the length of the corniche from the beginning to the end
They are definitely interested in receiving this important sporting event
In upcoming parties, God willing, I will follow them in the coming days, God willing
It means, on the other side, they said they will arrange a party for us
But until now, things are a little complicated
Actions and this is not definite
So I tried to mean, for example, I saw يوسف and I saw فلان
And I saw a few people, I want them to sing a song for me, and I saw the three of them
The right to sing
The possibility that we can sing
I wish I was sitting at home
And then send it to Yousef on email on the Internet
You, Joseph, this is part of the song
‏ Also, he works as a travel agent.
Those who entered this field have millions of audiences
We are not trying to imitate, but one should listen to what is better.
But he means a strong competitor with his style
So what if I take ideas from them and imitate them in things
But just reverse it, take the idea, change it and apply it to my song, I’ll shape it in a different way
They made a special unit and they had more than one CD on individuals
He talked about a man named Abdullah Al-Dail.
He has experience and is able to detect groundwater.
Their ability to detect the locations of groundwater
One of the inhabitants of the city of Marat
There are many experienced people
To determine the locations of water before digging wells
And he may need to dig many wells and there is no water
with help of copper rods or pomegranate branches
Or the fig from which one can deduce the locations of water
What tools does he use?
The water well discoverer
This is old
But now they have been replaced with copper tubes.
Now place the two rods parallel to each other
And now we walk at a slow pace, not in a hurry
We watch when we pass by a watercourse
The beams will open
Now now we are passing this shape now we are passing a watercourse
It is now open in this format
When we cross, it begins
This is in the middle of the watercourse.
And and from and from here it will be the middle
So we can now define the width of the watercourse or the watercourse below the ground
And the process is repeated more than once in more than one site so as to find the strongest site
Abu Ibrahim emphasizes
reaching an advanced stage in this profession
To make his discoveries very accurate
In Vi region, sometimes in Shqara and sometimes in Ahriمله and in Ethioia
More than a hundred and fifty wells were discovered
The percentage of error was 5% not exceeding 5%
You need training, experience and a gift from God, سبحانه وتعالى.
Outperforming modern devices and laboratories
In a record short time
Abdulrahman Al-Murshid
For the Doha Morning Show
Marta City, located northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh
We followed this report and promise you, God willing, other reports from Arab and global countries
And Gulfie God willing
We have now arrived with you, our viewers, to different locations and addresses, but they have their meaning
The big and first title and
I expect there is a large group of young people from the GCC in the GCC itself
In certain people you should look up to
However, for example, don’t just imitate them but feel that it is necessary to follow their works first
God knows, the Gulf rappers in general have a connection
F, so Mo doesn’t compete in competitions, I mean I released a song
And talk about the subject
Does it mean that there is a competition like you say, with a goal?
F I think there is a connection and it means only one specific person
In Saudi Arabia, Qasi, ماشالله, is making the atmosphere
He became very famous, he has a CD and he has a fan base.
And he has more than one company that could adopt it
I hope you reach this stage, maybe even surpass it more and more, God willing.
God willing, we wish you all the best through this team, God willing.
It is there of course and the reception of this important sport cup, the Asia Cup, let’s see the clips that are available on the Corniche.
In addition to a group of young Qataris
Whoever moves, even if it is from the West but with a Gulf style
Also emotional songs, rap songs and a distinguished band of twenty-five people
It is necessary that one follows your news first
So you must have an email, you must have a specific website or forum.
How can one reach you?
And God, there was a time when we had a special website
But there were some problems with the hosting company
So it means sometimes he drinks, sometimes I don't know what.
F, we had problems with it and in the end we just closed it
It’s closed, it’s closed, the site is closed.
Okay, and what is the alternative now until this problem is solved, because as a band
In the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, or even in Morocco or Egypt
One has to communicate with you and know your news and see the songs you produce from time to time
What is the alternative now?
Currently, alternatives rely on private pages, for example
By what exactly in the name of?
It is a fake video of Atwin Serge in Google
In the name of Qatar rap or Qatar rappers
You make videos of your own clips
The program worked on it yesterday
We have posted more than one video on YouTube
Song and video
A song and in the same shape in the form of a video but I shoot behind some of them
I expect that we will see you develop more.
You need a place where everyone has their own room at home
and the nut and the computer and the piano and the guitar
God, honestly, I just hope we get some support
means like a company means
We produce for you CD
I will make a special place for you
From our soul
But in the end we are we are just people, so do your job
We don’t want it to be a personal job
God, my words are no different from those of Joseph
We need a music video, don't we?
‏ The owl
The video clip of PP spread is very important, I expect.
So that I can give you more information
And if there is support, everything will be with it
Your sweet voices reach everywhere
It means one of the different arts that deals with problems and issues
Thank you to Yousif Al Naemi and Salman Al Abdullah for being with us
And we wish them all the best with our program, Good for Youth.
These projects were yes
In the Eytza Eytza project, which is almost ready, but needs some technical development.
Expiration date Price
You deserve the cashier’s right, you have the total, you have all the details and you are ready
And the recognition of the goods while holding each part and seeing the components and their effects
He is walking on the trolley
He could have put himself in the position where one can choose the material he wants with the utmost accuracy
Of course, most of the projects reflect the child’s feeling of having a problem
He also has different activities and goals.
The center now means in its set of programs that it designs and events are based on a key idea
We have ten objectives set by H.H. Sheikha Moza when she established the center
Maybe maybe it can also
He goes straight down to the train under the earth from his house and goes down to the train under the earth
But its main idea is that it is clothes
Tell me all the stores that exist in Qatar that have black t-shirts
There is also the key to the house, the key to the car, I have a button to press
Let me know if you are awake, I lost my way, will you take me to the key
Yes, we will go back once again to the projects that you will carry out, God willing, through the Cultural Center
And the early education of children
Developing his skills and building talents
We move between, meaning a set of children's skills, whether media or research
If the Al Al personal skills in speaking to the audience in convincing the audience
With the diversity of all these skills, we make a special program for them that serves them
We were inspired by the future media and we achieved a great achievement in it. Now we have reached the graduation projects and their end.
‏We also reached a large number of young child preachers
and their creativity
Do you have such young broadcasters as well
It means that he is back on TV and it is necessary that they present children’s programs
We are sitting, we promised them TV
Through their television Qatar Television
We will finish with them by 24 years
Hello and welcome wherever they are Yes
This also means national television
And our need to attract, acquire and discover these talents and develop them
From a declarative to a research-oriented
to to special issues of F thinking
to reading to many diverse fields
In so many collaborations between you take ideas
In every field, for example, the program of a promising preacher with the Ministry of Awqaf
Our exhibition is for the generations
The Scientific Club, which played a great role in developing projects and also in providing technical support for these projects.
The Supreme Council of Education also plays a major role and supports the schools as well as partners
Professor Abdullah, your move to Katara, this great establishment
It also gathers a large collection of wonderful events and wonderful places.
Is this considered a push forward for the Imam of the center itself?
However, you take a certain building separately
Far from this great monument
And he gave us a face to deal with the public more easily
And also pioneer and good projects
And in many of the reception of guests and get acquainted with the nature of the programs that are cultural programs presented to the child
Because our main project during these three years
It is the national project for the development of children's reading
Under the patronage of Sheikha Hessa بنت Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani
She adopted this project and provided it with great support
This is a major project, which is to develop reading and writing stories for children and develop their skills.
the different cultures that concern reading in particular
‏ There are of course many programs
So now we have recently moved
And now, meaning rearranging the means the activities
Its design and development is in accordance with the nature of visitors, meaning Katara
We certainly wish you all the best through this center
It contains very important ideas
Of course, first of all, we thank you for this kind hospitality
The most important thing is, the more we deal with children, the more we discover that our children
Today’s children are not yesterday’s children, their childhood is not our childhood
They need us to give them more attention, focus and time
Give him enough listening to his interest and his imagination
And I communicate with him intellectually
They work, meaning their way of dealing with their children is like a hotel that provides accommodation
Or it is a bank that saves him money
It is a child who misses someone who will listen to these thoughts, listen to this imagination.
We actually moved, they transferred us during the past few days to Al-Maareed, they transferred us to twenty, thirty.
Through this exhibition
We wish success insha’Allah for the projects that won awards
Thank you for joining us, Mr. Abdullah Al-Jamili, Director of the Cultural Center for Children. We wish you all the best, God willing.
So that these projects are actually realized and exist in reality and not a dream all the time
Hello and welcome to our viewers. The Cultural Center for Children concluded its evening last Monday at the Diplomatic Club
National Exhibition of Generations’ Dreams under the slogan “Generations’ Dreams, Facts of Tomorrow’s Country”
which was organized on the occasion of the country's national day with the participation of more than seventy children from Qatar
Our audience witnessed various activities and competitions
Innovative projects for children
On behalf of all of us, we are pleased to welcome Mr. Abdullah Alجميلي, Director of the Cultural Center for Children. Welcome and good morning.
Good morning, may God welcome you, my dear sister
First, thank you for giving the center the opportunity.
To talk about this special exhibition

This National Museum of Generations’ Dreams
In the name of God, the Merciful, the Merciful. This is a presentation
Contribution of the Cultural Center for Children
National Day celebrations
And he had a very special stop. He had a very important touch with every child.
With the aim of empowering children
I live with a dream
And with the project
This project or dream
In children’s dreams, the sky is wide
Its fields are wide, we have defined it within the frame which is Qatar, twenty, thirty.
And other major areas for the vision of Qatar 2030
‏ We have four stages of training for children
How do brainstorming and mind mapping mechanisms expand the field of thinking in children
What do you mean by this sentence specifically
The Facts of Tomorrow’s Country
meaning that what our children dream of today
This project is growing with this project
So this is the truth, meaning that this is an interpretation of this vision that children will start living from this day
With a Big Dream
If it is an environmental field or a field, for example, in health and human development and other fields
which serves the Al-Watan
I expect that when we know that there are children in a certain place
Or in a certain exhibition
Was all this there through
There were some special guests at the party.
Honored guests are those until children learn from them as role models
The Arab fall yesterday before two or three weeks
And there were also winners of awards in various awards in the Arab world
There was a schedule for the display of their projects
Yes, and the pictures are for sure, meaning they are a witness to your talk, Mr. Abdullah
This is a collection of pictures that were present at the exhibition and different events
This is also the owner of the last project, the owner of the forest
The Innovator or Creativity
This is one of the children’s inventions, God is great, it is a very beautiful idea, we can make it more entertaining for the audience.
And tell it a little, what is this topic exactly the colored ball
Then came almost four or five projects that talked about this subject, including the colored ball.
He also called the Smart Stadium
This ball if you go outside the field
It changes its color
I expect that we will return to the matches in a big way in the future, God willing
Okay, what after these dreams, means
It also concerns need, meaning his interests.
And I expect that especially when there are officials who take into consideration these small projects from small minds
But we don’t know if these projects will actually serve us well. The president of the football association is here in Qatar.
What is your opinion on the idea of a colored ball?
Do you love the idea?
Very much and the price of his visit, of course, and stopped at the projects that were allocated to the ball
Road stop and adoption of these projects at the moment
Big for the exhibition at that time and adopted these projects
The public also voted for a large group of projects submitted by our children
And our dear ones, what are the projects that we can say that there was a lot of emphasis on them and voted on
Of course, we have an evaluation method in the evaluation committee, which has a main evaluation method.
These are the projects that won the awards, the first, second and third projects.
He was from the forest and won the first prize
He has very detailed information about the project and the project was ready to start.
Beside the administrative side, of course, you need many administrative sides
I went into very detailed specifics and distributed visitor brochures as well, meaning she was ready for her project.
These are definitely the pictures we are seeing
This is a collection, yes, this is also a collection of many projects I participated in.
Maybe they feel that way, they mean that it is not important that they are watching movies or cartoons
No, it is not an actual link, but it may be partially achieved by institutions
For example, we give project names, what are these projects
How can this benefit the household, how can it be spent, collected and returned?
470 students

I am a fan of the series of classifications by artist Abdel الحميد الشرشني
Which he confirmed his presence by many works, including the series "Hearts for Rent"
And they tired of proving themselves in the artistic arena
Especially since the art field does not know about compliments
What this means
Hello and welcome, good morning, and I love to wake up to the viewers
On the contrary, the program is very secure and safe.
I will see something very simple from one of your works and start a conversation with you

Marat is also famous for the Mountain
Akmet, which poets have sung about through time
When History is a Witness and a Memory of Cities
and refers to its past عراقه (Iraqah)
which is 170 kilometers north of the capital Riyadh
It was also said that it belonged to Al-Mughira ibn Shuayb, the Tamimi.
It is distinguished by its beautiful monuments, the sweetness of its water and the pleasantness of its air.
Poets sang about it, were fascinated by it and its fame is associated with its famous mountain, Kmit
Ghadir-e-Kamit
Of course, my wife's city, an ancient city
And before the advent of Islam
There were old things without a known date such as the well of Khaled ibn al-Walid
In which we now exist
When passing by the War of Ridda, the great companion Khalid ibn al-Walid, may God be pleased with him, ordered this well to be dug.
And it has remained until today
The saying goes, "If you make a promise to me, I will make a promise to you.
If you see a quantity, you see it many times
Of course, another of the effects is Ghadir Kamit.

Many proverbs, poems and verses have been said about this mountain.
Wherever he comes from all over the kingdom
Among its most prominent monuments is the Well of Al-Walid
And that he descended in the days of the wars of Ridda and was heading to Yamama
He camped there and ordered men to dig this well.
the water of which is still drawn for drinking and they still use it for ablution
Yaqut al-Hamawi mentioned in the Dictionary of Countries that Khalid passed by Marat
It is an old clay house that has been restored to its original condition
It contains many sections highlighting the region’s architectural character and its heritage and monuments
Who said about him, when we arrived at the water, the water of his mare.
Ghadir Kamet, not Ghadir al-Anajel

It was explained to Mr. Ayman and Ms. Nسمه that the program is specifically designed to benefit our children.
It is a program for mental mathematics
By clickz and by abax
To achieve some specific goals, we tried to clarify a small part of them
I felt, Professor, I felt, Professor Ibrahim, that there is a real difference. The student, on the first two days
‏And after he finishes with you for months, perhaps three or four months
If he was studying in government, private or even independent schools
In principle, the program is scientifically going in certain ways
After passing the first level of the program
‏What clarifies where the capabilities that the child lost or wanted to develop, will reach him
It has reached a certain level or what developments have occurred with the child?
We are driving in a scientific way with a scientific program
It’s not just some of the roads or mechanisms that are being applied normally
No in a scientific, organized way
Before the start of the program and after taking this course or the levels that it went through
Professor Ibrahim is with us now, as you can see, our viewers. A student is making a request from the students who have joined this center
We loved this thing to happen on air so we can show our viewers the importance of this

Greetings, Professor Abdul-Aziz. I thank you for this good meeting. Of course, thank you to our guest who is present with us.
May God give you health, success and good luck.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al-Thani, Director of the Public Health Department at the Supreme Council of Health, will talk to us in more detail.
Good morning, Sheikh
Let's start directly with a look at these events
The truth is a healthy steps program towards Qatar
It means is it a program if it is one of the parts of the national strategy for the treatment of obesity
It means four of the top ten richest countries in the world are from the Gulf countries
In the Supreme Council of Health we have started a strategy, of course in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and other bodies, to combat obesity.
Fearing that it will spread more and more, soon FFL
F. One of the programs to protect against obesity is healthy steps towards Qatar
‏ Make this competition international
Of course, the program is a six-week program
Every week is different from the next week
To raise the awareness of seventh and eighth grade students about the importance of health at this age
Because it is the first time in their lives that they have to take care of themselves
‏In the first week, as you may remember, it was about what is your favorite fruit
Week 2 walking
You have to go, of course, every time one goes he gets points
It is a map of Qatar and all you have to do is collect points and you will apply, and your school will take steps forward and your class will take steps forward, meaning
So there is a nice competition between the students
‏In the third week he drinks only soda water
So he says he gets used to drinking unnecessary carbonated water. Every time he gets thirsty, he takes carbonated water. Don’t drink water.
‏ Then we have the fourth week, your favorite sport
Some of the games in school is what he loves
‏ We’re looking for a sport he likes to play
So that we force him to practice sports
The boy is eating a healthy meal
And his family knows that he has to pay attention to his son and give him a healthy meal.
And the Island Academy is a boys’ and girls’ academy so that we can take
Of course, this is a sample of its success, God willing, we will add more experience in the coming years
Of course, the students are happy. I don't know how to express their feeling, but our activity is more.
We played more games, we enjoyed more with our colleagues
The girls say our skin has improved, and the acne has faded.
It is absolutely true, he is becoming aware.
Parents know about their children
And their colleagues in the second grade, what’s up with you guys, and learn from them and their colleagues and brothers
And, thanks to God, it started spreading that there are many schools that are enthusiastic about participating in the next year, from now on, of course.
God willing
Of course, the official sponsor was Qtel in supporting this
We had Aspire Zone which provided sports competitions for students and awareness
Cluck cluck cluck on the dining table means
In, alhamdu lillah, there are several places, some of which I mentioned and some I may have missed.
But thanks to God, everyone contributed from what they had.
Some of the brothers used to hold competitions on Saturday
‏ There was a variety
We tried to make several types and include the largest number of people
He is the future generation, meaning
So that this experience can be generalized or spread to the largest possible extent, for example in Qatar
You are the first to live there and it needs a few things, things that need to be adjusted
‏After its spread, thank God now it is widespread and the results are satisfactory
God willing, we will publish it because there are people now demanding to know why we didn’t include them.
You eat healthy food and you will reach this thing, you have no problem
So at this age when it starts from a young age, it will get what it wants when it is twenty or twenty-five years old
You mentioned a set of titles every week, there was a title
If we go back, we will try in our paragraph today to be about the end of the events
And also if we go back to the people's closeness, in our program there was more than hosting.
‏ We go back and we go back every week, what was the information we wanted to reach the students
God willing, of course, my sister, for example, the first week, the favorite fruit
Of course, fruits as a whole fruit, what are the benefits?
What is the use of fruits that contain vitamin C?
So he himself starts to know what he likes in fruits, not all fruits are his enemies, you know.
So he can be allergic to one or two types, but why don’t the rest not eat them?
Week 2 People think that walking is only for small old people, why do they walk
‏ So when I grow up I walk
On the contrary, you walk because it calms the mind and the brain
And it calms the human mind, so in walking the clarity of the mind improves
You were taking them to walk the students
No, they all have to walk, whether at school or at home.
They score points through classroom schools
Because they are so many, it doesn’t mean daily, does it?
‏ There was an event where some people made a march for the girls’ school.
You know, we want them to be creative, meaning they have innovative ideas.
The spirit of competition and teachers can come up with new ideas. We don’t want to give them ideas that take them out of bounds.
‏ Everyone had his own skills in this point
Of course, during the third week, drink water, of course, all the time we try to make them drink water so they don’t get thirsty and want to take soda water
Of course, the fourth week is your favorite sport
‏If we can reach his favorite sport and support him in it
He is passionate about sports
‏ Their love of sport is that he is playing it, he is playing sport without knowing it
Since we talked about it before, we are going to talk about the Qatari League of MS patients
Let me welcome our guest for today's episode who has brightened up the studio
Welcome
May God keep you with us in this program

At first, as the Egyptians say, straight to the point
It is a chronic disease
It affects the nervous system in the human body
Intervals affect people from twenty to forty years
This disease also has no cure until now and no known cause for this disease and its infection.
It usually affects the active class in society, which is the youth class.
Treatments used for cancer patients keep away evil and other diseases
This disease is an inflammation of the brain nerves and spinal cord nerves.
It is the central nervous system in the human body.
The body senses that there is a close object to it
The nervous cell is a

which leads to the non-arrival, weakness or malfunction of the nerve signal
‏ leads to paralysis far from you
Up to now, with the development of medicine and the advancement of medicine, Prof. Abdul Aziz, we still haven’t found a cure for this disease.
Okay, but we need to know how we’re going to get the solution, you know
One should also be cautious about this subject.
‏means the direct cause means the nature of life nature of food circular processes of the life
And what is the exact reason that makes a person susceptible to this disease
Everything that exists now is theories
Even by marriage
They are trying to solve the health problems that humans face
Yes yes
All these topics probably mean that it is somewhat controversial for society
‏So far we don’t know the reasons
OK, the age group that can get this disease is the nerve hardening disease, of course.

Of course, the disease starts to calm down after reaching 40 years old with the person.
‏ But we still haven’t found a cure for this disease

In Saudi Arabia statistics say there are 25,000 cases
And so is Qatar
I personally know of three to four very specific cases that have been diagnosed recently in the last week only
Currently we have 255 infected. This is recorded in the files.
‏ And there are many people who, when diagnosed with this disease, go to seek treatment in other countries, for example.
Okay, Mr. Abdul-Aziz, does this disease have some effects, for example, on a person?
Are there some signs that give the person who is suffering from this or himself that I am suffering from neuropathies?
And this virus seems to destroy
Let’s be honest, it’s not a virus
Because it is a nervous disease, the nerves control the whole body.
It's a bit far or we give a certain reason for a certain place that God, the nature of food and the nature of the
