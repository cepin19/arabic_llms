Jesus called a little child to him. He made him stand among them.
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."

Anyone who welcomes a little child like this in my name welcomes me.
But what if someone were to lead one of these little ones who believe in me astray? It would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.

If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or one foot than to be thrown into hell with two hands and two feet. In hell, the fire never goes out.
If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. The Parable of the Lost Sheep
Look, don't underestimate any of these little ones. I tell you, their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.
The
What do you think? Suppose a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them gets lost, won't he leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go and look for the one that is lost?
What I am about to tell you is true. If that sheep is found, it brings more joy than the ninety-nine that did not wander off.
So it is with your Father in heaven. He does not want any of these little ones to be lost. When one of them sins against you
If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother.
"But what if they do not listen to you? Then take one or two others with you. For every word to be established, it must be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses." (Deuteronomy 19:15)
But what if he refuses to listen even to the church? Then treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. What you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and what you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
I tell you again, this is what I am commanding you. Imagine if two of you agree on earth about anything you ask for, my Father in heaven will answer your request.
The merciless servant
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
And as the king began, a man who owed him millions of dollars was brought to him.
The man was unable to pay. So his master gave an order. The man, his wife, his children, and all that he had were to be sold to pay off his debt.
The servant knelt before his master, pleading, "Give me some time." He promised, "I will pay everything back."
His master took pity on him, forgave what was owed, and released him.
"But then that servant went out and found one of the other servants who owed him a few dollars. He grabbed him and started choking him. 'Pay me what you owe!' he said."
The other servant knelt down. "Give me some time," he pleaded. "I'll pay you back later."
But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and ordered the man to be thrown into prison until he could pay back what he owed.
The other servants saw what happened. It disturbed them greatly. They went and told their master everything that had occurred.
Then the master called the first servant. Then he said to him, "Where are you, evil servant?" "I have forgiven you all your debt."
Shouldn't you have mercy on the other sinner as I had mercy on myself?
In his anger, his master turned him over to the jailers to be punished until he paid back everything he owed.
This is how my Father in heaven will treat each one of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.
Jesus teaches about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Large crowds followed him. He healed their sick there.
And some Pharisees came up to him and tested him, saying, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator made them 'male and female'?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
They are no longer two, but one. Therefore, a man must not separate what God has joined.
They asked, "Why then did Moses command to give a wife a bill of divorce and send her away?"
Jesus answered, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But from the beginning it was not so."
Here is what I tell you. Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery. A man can divorce his wife only if she has been unfaithful to him.
The disciples said to him, "If that's the way it is between a husband and wife, it is better not to get married."
Jesus answered, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining single. Only those who are helped to live without marriage can accept it."

Some people brought little children to Jesus. They wanted him to lay his hands on the children and pray for them. But the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he departed from there. Jesus and the rich young man.
A man came to Jesus and asked him, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to have eternal life?"
Why do you ask me about what is good? Jesus answered. "There is only one who is good. If you want to enter the kingdom, obey the commandments."
"Which one?" the man asked. Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness."
Honor your parents and obey them in every matter that brings benefit and not harm. And love for your neighbor what you love for yourself.
"I have obeyed all those commandments," the young man said. "What more do I need to do?"
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell all you have, and give the money to the poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me."
When the young man heard this, he went away sorrowful, for he was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."
When the disciples heard this, they were astonished. They asked, "Then who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter answered and said to him, "We have left everything and followed you. What then will there be for us?"
"What I am about to tell you is the truth," Jesus said to them. "When all things are made new, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. Then you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, and you will judge the twelve tribes of Israel."
"Everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life."
But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.
The Story of the Workers in the Vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a man who owned a vineyard. He went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
He agreed to pay them the usual wage for a day's work. Then he sent them to his garden.
Around nine o'clock in the morning, he went out again. He saw others standing in the market square doing nothing.
Tell them, 'Go you also into my vineyard; and I will pay you what is right.'
So they went. "He went out again around noon and at three o'clock, and did the same thing."
Around five o'clock, he ventured outside and encountered more idle figures loitering about. Inquiry was made: "Why do you remain idle, having accomplished nothing throughout the day?"
They said, "We have not found anyone who will hire us to work in this remote place." He said to them, "You also go and work in my vineyard."
The owner of the vineyard watched as the evening approached, and he spoke to those who worked in the vineyard, indicating that the owner of the vineyard spoke to them, emphasizing that the owner of the vineyard spoke to them, repeatedly pointing out that the owner of the vineyard addressed them.
The workers who were hired around five o'clock arrived. Each received their usual daily wage.
When those who were hired first came, they expected to receive more. But each of them also received the usual daily wage.
When they received it, they started complaining about the owner.
These people who were recently converted have only worked for one hour, as they said: "You have fulfilled their time, equal to that of those people. You have completed the greatest amount of work, and you have exposed yourselves to the most intense heat of the sun."
The owner answered one of them. He said, "My friend, I am dealing with you fairly. Didn't you agree to work for the usual daily wage?"
Take your money and go. I want to give those I've recently hired the same pay I gave you.
Don't I have the right to do as I please with my own money? Do you feel I was cheated because I gave generously to others?
"So those who are last will be first, and those who are first will be last." Jesus speaks again of his coming and his death.
Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. On the way, he took the twelve disciples aside to speak to them.
He said, "We are going to Jerusalem." And he said, "The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of the chief priests and the teachers of the law. And they will condemn him to death."
"Then they hand him over to a people who are not Jews. And they deal with him with mockery and torture. And they hold him on a cross. And on the third day, he rises from the dead!" A mother asks of the Messiah.
A woman came to Jesus, a wife and a mother of children. Her children were with her. She knelt down on her knees and asked him for a favor.
"What do you want?" asked Jesus. She said, "Promise me that one of my two-year-old sons will sit at your right hand in your kingdom. Promise me that the other son will sit at your left hand."
"You do not know what you are asking," Jesus said to them. "Can you drink the cup I am about to drink?" "We can," they answered.
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The remaining tithing men heard of it. They were angry with the two sisters.
And He resolved for them to gather. He said, "You know about the rulers of the nations. They have authority over their peoples. And their high-ranking emirs guide them."
Do not be like that. Rather, whoever wants to be important among you must be your servant.
And let every man first consider himself a servant to his master.
"Be like the Son of Man, who did not come to be served, but to serve others and give his life as a ransom for many." And twelve kings and a man wore fine linen and God sent down light upon them. The people said, "This is a bright light!" But the hypocrites will say, "They bear witness against themselves, that they are Muslims, that they speak the truth, and that they reject falsehood and disunity." The hypocrite and the denier of disunity will say, "They speak the truth, and reject falsehood, and deny disunity."
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, and a large crowd followed them.
A blind man and a man with no sight were sitting by the roadside. They heard that Jesus was passing by. So they shouted, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy!"
The crowd ordered them to cease. They instructed them to be silent. Yet the two men cried out all the more, "Master! Son of David! Show us compassion!"
Jesus stopped his steps and called out to them. "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked them.
In response, they said, "Sir, we would like to be able to see."
Jesus felt deep compassion for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately they could see. And they followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem.
And as they approached Jerusalem, they came to Bethphage, on the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two of his disciples ahead.
He said to them, "Go into the village ahead of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt by her. Untie them and bring them to me."
If someone tells you something, say that the Lord needs them. The owner of the place will send them right away.
This happened so that what was spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled. He said,
I say to the city of Zebulun, "See, your king comes to you, humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey." (Zechariah 9:9)
The disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them.
They brought the donkey and the colt. They placed their cloaks on them. Then Jesus mounted the cloaks.
A very large crowd gathered, so they spread their coats on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
Some people went ahead of him, and some followed him. All of them shouted: "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest heaven!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was moved. The people asked, "Who is this?"
The crowd shouted, "This is Jesus. He is the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Then Jesus clarified the matter in the temple.
Jesus entered the temple area and began to drive out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer' (Isaiah 56:7); but you have made it 'a den of robbers' (Jeremiah 7:11)."
Blind and lame people came to Jesus in the temple courts. There he healed them.
The chief priests and the scribes saw the wonders that he did. They also saw the children in the temple area shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" But when they saw all this, they were indignant.
"Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," answered Jesus. "Haven't you ever read in the Scriptures? 'From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise.'" (Psalm 8:2)
Then Jesus left the people and went out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there. The fig tree withered away.
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the roadside. He went to it, but found nothing on it but leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" And at once the fig tree withered.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?" they asked.
Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, if you believe, you will do the works that I do, and greater works than these will you do, because I go to the Father."
"If you believe, you will be given what you ask for when you pray." The authority of Christ is questioned.
Jesus entered the temple courts, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. "By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked. "And who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered, "I will ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
"Where did Imad Yohanna come from? Was he from heaven? Or did he come from men?" They discussed this among themselves. They said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why did you not believe in him?'"
But what if we say, "of men"? We fear people. Everyone thought John was a prophet.
So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." And Jesus said to them, "Then I will not tell you by what authority I do these things." (End of the parable of the two sons)
What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first son and said, 'My son, go and work today in the vineyard.'
" 'I won't do it,' the son replied. But later he changed his mind and went."
Then the father went to the other son. He said the same thing to him. The son answered, "I will, sir." But he did not go.
"Which of the two sons did what his father wanted?" "The first," they answered. Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John came to show you the right way to live, and you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. You saw this, yet even then, you did not turn away from your sins and believe in him. The parable of the tenants.
Listen to another story. There was a man who owned some land, so he planted a vineyard. He put a fence around it and dug a winepress in it. He also built a watchtower. Then he leased the vineyard to some farmers and went away on a journey.
The time of harvest had come, so he sent his servants to the tenants. And he said to the servants, "Gather my share of the fruit."
But the tenants seized his slaves. They beat one of them. They killed another. They stoned the third to death.
Then the man sent other servants to the tenants, and he sent more than he had sent the first time. But they treated him the same way.
Finally, he sent his son to them. He said, "They will respect my son."
But the tenants saw the son coming. They said to each other, "This is the heir; come, let's kill him, and everything will be ours."
So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
And when the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do to these tenants?
He will destroy those wicked men, says the Lord. He will hire laborers to bring in the harvest. They will give him his share of the harvest at the proper time.
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures, 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
"Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a people who will bear its fruit."
"Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, and when it falls on anyone, it will crush them. But the stone will crush whatever falls on it."
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables, and they realized that he was speaking about them.
So they looked for a way to arrest him. But they feared the crowd. The people believed that Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Story
Jesus told them more parables. He said: "The kingdom of heaven is like..."
"Behold, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man who sowed good seed in his field."
His servants sent to those who were invited to the feast. The servants told them to come, but they refused.
Then he sent another servant, saying, 'Tell the invited guests, "I have prepared my dinner; my ox and fattened calf are killed and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet."'
But people didn't show any interest. One went to his field, and another to his work.
The rest of the men seized his slaves. They treated them cruelly and then killed them.
The king was furious. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed the murderers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants, "The wedding feast is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come."
Head to the street corners. Invite anyone you find to dinner.
So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.
The king came to see the guests. He noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.
"My friend," he asked, "How did you get in here without your wedding clothes?" The man couldn't think of anything to say.
Then the king said to his ministers, "Bind his hands and feet. Then take him out into the darkness. There people will weep and gnash their teeth."
Many are called, but few are chosen. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went out. And the chief priests held a council against Jesus, how to ensnare him in his words.
They sent their disciples to him, and with them the Herodians. "Teacher," they said, "we know that you are a man of integrity and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't swayed by others, because you pay no attention to who they are. And you teach a way of God that is genuine. All of us have heard for ourselves how everything you do is impressive. So tell us what you think. Is it right to pay taxes to the Roman emperor or not?"
So tell us, what do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
But Jesus knew their wicked plans. He said, "Hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the currency that people use to pay taxes." They brought him a silver coin.
He asked them, "Whose is this picture? And whose are these words?"
"To Caesar," they answered. Then he said to them, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away. The marriage when the dead are raised.
On that very day, the Pharisees came to Jesus with a question. They did not believe that people rise from the dead.
Professor, they told us, this is what Moses told us. If a man dies and has no sons, his brother must marry the widow. He must father children to carry on his family name.
There were seven brothers among us. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened to the second, third, and subsequent brothers down to the seventh.
Finally, the woman died.
Now, when the dead rise, which wife will it be? They were all seven married to her.
Jesus answered, "You are wrong, because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God."
When the dead rise, they will not marry, nor will they be given in marriage. They will be like the angels in heaven.
"What about the dead who are raised? Have you not read what God has told you?"
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." (Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
"At a time when God hears more."
The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees did not believe in the resurrection of the dead, so the Pharisees gathered together.
Someone was an authority in the law. So they tested Jesus with a question.
Teacher, he asked, "What is the most important commandment in the law?"
Jesus answered, " 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Love him with all your mind.' (Deuteronomy 6:5)"
This is the first and most important commandment.
And the second is like it: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
Everything that was or is, is the result of the past tense verb coupled with its mentioned object that follows it.
And the Pharisees gathered together. Jesus asked them,
"What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?" "The son of David," they said.
Then why does David call him 'Lord'? The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. David said,
"The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.'" (Psalm 110:1)
"If David is referred to as 'Lord', how can David's son be referred to?"
No one could answer him with a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him any more questions.
John judges the Pharisees and the teachers of the law.
Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples.
He said, "People among them, including 'the scholars' and 'the experts in religious rulings', will sit in the place of Moses."
Obey them. Do everything they ask of you. But don't do what they do. They don't practice what they preach.
They document heavy burdens and place them on others' shoulders. But they themselves are not willing to lift a single finger to remove them.
"Everything they do is done for others to see. On their foreheads and arms they wear small boxes containing verses from the Scripture. They make the boxes very wide. And they make the fringes on their coats very long."
They love to sit in places of honor at dinner tables. They also love to occupy the most important seats in places of worship.
They love to be greeted in the markets. And they love it when people call them 'Lord'.
"But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers."
Do not call anyone on earth 'father,' for you have one Father, and he is in heaven.
You should not be called 'teacher'. You have one teacher, and that is Christ.
The highest rank with God is for those who are closest to me.
Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
How terrible it will be for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. You yourselves do not enter, and you hinder those who are trying to enter.
The
"How terrible it is for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win one person to your way of thinking, and when you have succeeded, you make him twice as much a child of hell as you are."
How wretched is your condition, O misguided ones! You say, "If anyone swears by the temple, that oath is worthless. But, if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he must fulfill his oath."
You are blind and foolish! Which is more important? Is it the gold? Or is it the temple that sanctifies the gold?
It is also said: "If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing. But anyone who swears by the gift bestowed, must fulfill that oath."
O blind ones! Which is more important? Is it the gift? Or is it the altar that makes the gift sacred?
For everyone who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.
And whoever swears by the name of the temple, swears by His name and by Him who dwells in it.
And whoever swears by the name of the sky, has sworn by the name of the throne of Allah and by the name of He who sits upon it.
What a terrible thing it is for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin—and have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faith. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former.
O you who are blind! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!
How blind you teachers of the law and Pharisees! Hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and self-indulgence.
You blind hypocrite! First clean what is inside the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean.
What a livelihood! O teachers of the law and ordinances! O pretenders! You are like graves that are whitewashed on the outside. They look beautiful on the surface, but inside they are full of the bones of the dead. They are also full of other things that are not pure or clean.
Indeed, the matter is yours. The appearance of the matter is that you do what is right, but within you are filled with what is wrong. You pretend to be what you are not.
"How can you, the inheritors of the law and the Pharisees, inherit the earth? You are hypocrites! You build the tombs of the prophets. You decorate the graves of the righteous."
And when you say: "If only we had been in the days of those who came before us, we would not have done to them what they did. We would not have participated in the killing of the prophets."
"So that you may bear witness against yourselves, and you may say, 'Indeed, we are the descendants of those who killed the prophets.'"
"So complete what the earlier ones completed!"
O nest of vipers, how can you escape being sentenced to hell?
I will send you prophets, wise men, and teachers. You will kill some of them. You will crucify some of them on a cross. Others you will flog in your temples. You will pursue them from city to city.
You will pay the price for the blood of all the righteous people who have been spilled on the earth. I mean by the blood of the righteous first: the blood of the righteous first, Zakkiya, son of Murara. Zakkiya.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. All of this will happen to those who are alive now.
"Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!"
Look, your house is left empty.
"I testify to you, you will not see my face again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.' (Psalm 118:26)"
Signs of the Hour
Jesus left the temple. As he was walking away, his disciples came to him and pointed out the temple buildings.
"Do you see all these things?" asked Jesus. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. There his disciples came to him privately and said, "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end?"
Jesus answered, "Be on your guard! Beware of being deceived."
Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ!' and they will deceive many.
You will hear of wars. You will also hear people talking about future wars. Do not be terrified. These things must happen. But the end is not yet.
Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines in many places. There will be earthquakes in various places.
All this is the beginning of labor pains.
Then they will hand you over to be tortured and killed, and you will be hated by all nations because of me.
At that time, many of them will turn away from their faith. They will hate each other. They will hand each other over to their enemies.
Many false prophets will arise. They will deceive many people.
For evil will grow, and the love of most people for cold will grow.
But those who endure to the end will be saved.
This good news for the kingdom will be published throughout the world. It will be a witness to all nations. Then the end will come.
The prophet Daniel spoke of the "abomination that desolates" (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11). One day you will see it standing in the holy place. Let the reader understand this.
Then those in Judah must flee to the mountains.
No one goes up to the roof, then down to his house to get something.
No one on the site should go back to get their coat.
What a terrible thing it would be in those days for pregnant women! What a terrible thing for nursing mothers!
Pray that you may not have to flee in winter or on the Sabbath.
There will be great tribulation in those days, such as has not been since the beginning of creation until now, no, nor ever will be again.
Were it not that time is short, no one would exist. But because of a people whom God has chosen, it will be brief.
"At that time, someone may say to you, 'Look! Here is the Christ!' or 'There he is!' Do not believe it."
False Christs and false prophets will appear. They will do great signs and miracles. They will try to deceive God's elect, if possible.
See, I told you so.
"So if anyone tells you, 'He is far out in the desert,' do not go. Or if anyone tells you, 'He is deep inside the house,' do not believe it."
The thunder that comes from the east can be seen in the west. So will it be when the Son of Man comes.
Starving vultures will gather wherever there is a dead carcass.
"After the terrible suffering of those days, 'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light. The stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will be shaken.' (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)"
"At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory."
He will send His angels with a blast in the trumpet. They will gather them from all sides of their earth. They will drive them to the appointed place.
Learn a lesson from the fig tree. As soon as its branches become tender and its leaves sprout, you know that summer is near.
In the same way, when you see all those things happening, you know the end is near. It's about to come in.
That which I am about to tell you is true. The people of that time were alive as long as all these things were happening.
Verily, heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away. A day and an hour no one knows. Explanation: The translation aims to convey the meaning of the original text in Modern Standard Arabic accurately.
No one knows the Day and the Hour except Allah. No one knows it, not even the angels near Him, nor the Prophet, nor anyone else among the creatures of Allah.
"It will be just like it was in the days of Noah. That's how it will be when the Son of Man comes."
In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking. They were getting married. They were giving their daughters in marriage. They were doing all those things until the day Noah entered the ark.
They knew nothing about what was going to happen until the flood came and took them all. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
"Two men will be in the field. One will be taken and the other left."
Two women will grind with a hand mill. One will be taken and the other will be left.
"So remain conscious (and mindful) of (the fact that) you do not know on which day your Lord will come."
You must understand something. Suppose the homeowner knew at what time of night the thief was coming. Then he would have kept watch. He wouldn't have let his house be robbed.
Therefore you also must be ready; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
Let's assume that a master puts one of his servants in charge of the other servants in his house. The servant's task is to give them their food at the right time. The master wants a faithful and wise servant for this purpose.
It would be in the servant's interest to be found by his master doing his work upon the master's return.
Here is what I will say to you is true. The master will give that servant responsibility for all that he owns.
But suppose that servant is wicked. Suppose he says to himself, 'My master is staying away a long time.'
Let's assume he started beating other servants. Let's assume he eats and drinks with those who drink excessively.
The master of that servant will come on a day when the servant does not expect him. He will return at an hour the servant does not know.
Then the master cuts it into pieces and sends it to the place where the claimants go. There they will groan and gnash their teeth.
Tales of Ten Maidens.
"This is how the kingdom of heaven will be at that time. Ten virgins took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom."
Five of them were fools. Five were wise.
The foolish took their lamps, but they did not take oil with them.
The wise ones took oil in jars along with their lamps.
The groom hadn't come for a long time. Therefore, all the bridesmaids felt bored and dozed off.
At midnight a voice cried out, "Here comes the bridegroom! Go out to meet him!"
Then all the bridesmaids awoke and prepared their lamps.
The foolish ones said to the wise ones, "Give us some of your oil. Our lamps are going out."
"No," they replied. "There might not be enough for all of us. Instead, go to those who sell oil. Buy some for yourselves."
So they went to buy oil. But while they were on their way, the bridegroom arrived. And the maids who were ready with him entered the wedding feast. Then the door was shut.
Later, the rest of the bridesmaids came. "Oh, sir! Oh, sir!" they said. "Open the door for us!"
But he replied, "What I am about to tell you is the truth. I do not know you."
"Watch therefore, for you do not know the day or the hour when the bridegroom will come. A parable of three servants."
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man who is going on a journey. He called his servants and entrusted his property to them."
He gave ten thousand dollars to one. He gave four thousand dollars to another. And he gave two thousand dollars to the third. The man gave each servant the amount he knew the servant could handle. Then he set out on his journey.
The servant who had received the $10,000 went at once and put his money to work. He earned $10,000 more.
The one with the $4,000 earned $4,000 more.
But the man who had received $2000 went and dug a hole in the ground. He hid his master's money in that hole.
After a long time, the master of those servants returned. He wanted to gather all the money they had earned.
The man who had received $10,000 brought the other $10,000. 'Master,' he said, 'you trusted me with $10,000. See, I have made $10,000 more.'
His master answered, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master!"
And the man who had received the four thousand dollars also came and said, "Master, I received four thousand dollars from you. See, I have made four thousand more."
His master answered, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master!"
Then the man who had received the two thousand dollars came and said, "Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not scatter seed.
I was even afraid. So I went out and hid your two thousand dollars in the ground. Look, this is what belonged to you.
His master answered, "You wicked and lazy servant! So you knew that I sow where I did not sow? You knew that I reap where I did not sow?"
Alright then, you should have put my money in the bank. When I returned, I would have taken it back with interest.
Then his master commanded the other servants, 'Take the $2000 from him. Give it to the one who has $20,000.'
Every man who is obedient to God, God will reward him best. And whoever has not obeyed God, even what he has will be taken away from him.
'Drive that wretched servant outside. Out there in the dark, people will weep and gnash their teeth.' The Sheep and the Lambs
"The Son of Man will come in all his glory. All the angels will be with him. Then he will sit on his glorious throne."
All the nations will be gathered before Him. He will separate people into two groups. It will be like the shepherd who separates the sheep from the goats.
He will set the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right, "My father has blessed you, so come and take your inheritance, for it is the kingdom that has been prepared for you since the creation of the world."
You made me hungry, so you brought me food. You made me thirsty, so you brought me drink. You made me homeless, so you brought me shelter.
I wanted clothes. You gave them to me. I was sick. You took care of me. I was in prison. You came to visit me.
Then the righteous will answer him, saying: "Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you? Or thirsty and give you drink?"
When we saw you as a stranger, did we invite you? When we saw you in need of clothes, did we clothe you?
When we saw you sick or in prison, and went to visit you?
The king will answer, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.'
Then he will say to those on his left, "You are cursed! Depart from me into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels."
You made me hungry, but you didn't give me anything to eat. You made me thirsty, but you didn't give me anything to drink.
I was a stranger. But you did not invite me. I needed clothes. But you did not give me any. I was sick and in prison. But you did not take care of me.
And they will also say, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty and not help you? When did we see you as a stranger or in need of clothes or sick or in prison and not help you?'
He will reply: "What I am about to tell you is true. Anything you haven't done for one of these less important reasons, you haven't done for me."
Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but those who have done right will have eternal life.
Plan to kill Jesus
Jesus finished saying these things, and then he said to his disciples:
As you know, the Jewish Passover is two days away. The Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, Caiaphas.
They made plans to arrest Jesus by stealth. They wanted to kill him.
"But not during the feast," they said. "It might stir up trouble among the people." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in the house of Simon the leper at Bethany.
A woman came to Jesus, peace be upon him, with an expensive, sealed flask of perfume. She poured the perfume on his head while he was at the table.
When the students saw this, they got angry. "Why this waste?" they asked.
The perfume might've been sold at a high price. The money might've been given to poor people.
Jesus was aware of this. So he said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a good thing for me."
You will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.
She poured her perfume on my body to prepare me for burial.
"My friends, hurry, for the news I will tell you is true. What has been done will be proclaimed in every place where this good news is proclaimed throughout the world. It will be proclaimed in their memories." "Take my covenant and oath to the great son of Isaac, to all the sons of Isaac, and to all the sons of Nahor, and to all the sons of Aner, and to all the sons of Merari, and to all the sons of Michol, and to all the sons of Nero, and to all the sons of Ander, and to all the sons of Phares, and to all the sons of Andalusia, and to all the sons of Gerolya, and to all the sons of Migra, and to all the sons of Nyropa, and to all the sons of Uganda, and to all the sons of Computer, and to all the sons of Europe, and to all the sons of Method, and to all the sons of On, who cannot be understood."
One of the twelve went to the chief priests. His name was Judas Iscariot.
He asked, "What will you give me if I deliver Jesus to you?" So they counted out for him thirty pieces of silver.
From then on, Judas watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. The Last Supper.
This was the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover meal?"
He replied, "Go into the city to a certain man, and tell him, 'The Teacher says, 'My time is near. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.' "
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them. They prepared the Passover meal.
As evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve.
As they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."
The disciples became very sad. One by one, they began to say to him, "It is not me, Lord, is it?"
Jesus answered, "The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me.
"The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. Woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born."
Judas' betrayal was the one who would hand him over. He said, "Not me, Lord, is it?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is you."
While they were eating, Jesus took bread. He gave thanks and broke it. He handed it to his disciples and said, "Take this and eat it. This is my body."
Then he took the cup, gave thanks, and offered it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you."
This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
Here is what I tell you. From now on, I will not drink wine with you until the day I drink it with you in my Father's kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said he would be betrayed.
Jesus told them, "This very night all of you will fall away on account of me. For it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)"
But after I am raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."
Peter answered, "Everyone else may leave because of you. But I never will."
"What I am about to tell you is the truth," Jesus answered. "This very night, before the cock crows, you will deny me three times that you know me."
But Peter said, "I may have to die with you. But I will never say that I don't know you." All the other disciples said the same thing. Jesus prayed in his anguish.
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
He took Peter and the sons of Zebedee with him. He began to be sorrowful and very troubled.
Then he said to them, "My spirit is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and keep watch with me."
He went a little farther. Then he fell on his face and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Could you not watch with me for one hour?" asked Peter.
Watch and pray. Then you will not fall into sin when tempted. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Jesus went back to the same place. He prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned. And again he found them sleeping. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
So he left them and went away repeatedly. He called out three times.
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand. The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of sinners."
"Get up! Let's go! There is the man who is handing me over to them!" Jesus is arrested.
While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. A large crowd was with him, carrying swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
John, who had wanted to deliver Jesus, signaled to them. "The man I kiss is the one," he said. "Arrest him."
Jesus went immediately. He said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you have come to do." Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
And at that moment, one of Jesus' companions drew his sword and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
"Put your sword back in its place," Jesus said to him. "For all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you think I can't ask my father for help? He would immediately send an army of over 70,000 angels.
But then, how can the scriptures be fulfilled? They say it must happen this way.
At that time, Jesus spoke to the crowd. "Am I leading a band of armed men against you?" he asked. "Do you have to come out with swords and clubs to seize me? Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me."
"But all this has happened that the words of the prophets might be fulfilled." "Then all the disciples left Jesus and fled. Jesus was taken to the Sanhedrin."
Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had assembled.
Not long after, Peter followed Jesus. He went directly to the high priest's courtyard. He entered and sat down with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.
But they found no evidence, although many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two other witnesses stepped up.
They said, "This one claims that he can destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days."
Then the high priest stood up. He asked Jesus, "Will you not answer? What is this testimony that these men bring against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. Then the high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."
"Yes," Jesus answered, "it is just as you say. But I tell you that in the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? You have heard the blasphemy with your own ears."
"What do you think?" "He must die!" they answered.
Then they spat in his face. They struck him with their fists. Others slapped him.
They said, "Give us good news, O Jesus! Who struck you?" He said to Peter, "I do not know the Jew."
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A female servant came to him. "You also were with Jesus of Nazareth," she said to him.
But Peter, before them all, said, "I do not know what you are talking about." "I do not know the man," said Peter.
Then he went out to the gate that leads to the courtyard. And another man saw him there and said to the people, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
He returned and said that it was not so. And he swore, saying, "I do not know the man!"
A little later, those who stood by came to Peter and said, "Surely you are one of them, for your accent betrays you."
Then Peter began to curse and swear, "I do not know this man!" And immediately a rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.
Judas hangs himself.
The morning came early. The chief priests and the elders of the people came together and decided to put Jesus to death.
They bound him and took him by force. Then they handed him over to Pallas, who was the governor.
Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned to death. He felt deep shame and remorse for what he had done. So he went and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priest and the elders.
"I have sinned," he said. "I have delivered an innocent man." "And what is that to us?" they answered. "That is your concern."
Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.
Representation: The high priest holds the coin. He says: "Doing so is against the law regarding the placement of this coin in the temple's treasury. It is blood money. It has paid for a man's murder."
They decided to use the money to buy a ceramic field. People from other countries will be buried there.
That is why it is still called "Field of Blood" to this day.
Then the prophecy of Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, when he said, "They have taken the thirty pieces of silver. They valued him at that amount, the price set by the people of Israel."
"So they took the money and did as they were instructed by the Lord. They bought the potter's field with it as a burial place for strangers." (Zechariah 11:12,13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) Jesus Is Brought to Pilate
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus answered.
But when the chief priests and elders brought charges against him, he made no reply.
Then Pilate asked him, "Do you not hear the charges they are bringing against you?"
But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge. The governor was quite amazed.
It was the governor's custom at the festival to release a prisoner chosen by the people.
At that time, they had a famous prisoner named Barqa.
So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Whom do you want me to release for you? Barabbas? Or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Pilate knew that the chief priests were jealous. He knew that was why they had delivered Jesus to him.
While Pilate was sitting on the judge's bench, his wife sent him a message. The message said, "Don't get involved in anything concerning that man. He is innocent. I have suffered much in a dream today because of him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas' release and to have Jesus condemned and executed.
"Which of the two do you want me to release?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered.
"What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" asked Pilate. And they all answered, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What evil has he done?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere with them. Rather, the crowd began to get angry. So he took water and washed his hands before the crowd. "I am innocent of this man's blood," declared Pilate. "You are responsible!"
All the people answered, "We and our children will bear the guilt of his death!"
He released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and then handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
Jesus was taken to the governor's palace, which was called the Praetorium. All the other soldiers gathered around him.
They bound him and wrapped him in a blue cloak.
Then they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!"
They spit on him. They hit him on the head with a stick again and again.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him of his robe. They put his own clothes back on him. Then they led him away to be crucified. Jesus Christ is crucified.
On their way out of the city, they met a man from Cyrene named Simon. They forced Simon to carry the cross.
They came to a place called Golgotha, which means the place of the skull.
They mixed wine with bitter spices and offered it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it.
When they nailed his hands and feet, they divided his clothes by casting lots.
They sat and raised him there.
On his head they placed a sign that read, "This is Jesus, King of the Jews."
And two robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
Those who passed by shouted at Jesus, mocking him. They shook their heads.
And he said, "I see you will cross this sea, and then return!" Then he said, "You will be killed by this tree, and then not return!" Then he said, "You will..."
Likewise, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders mocked him.
"Save others," they said, "but he cannot save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
And indeed, he trusts in Allah. Let Allah be his helper now, if He wills. He is the One who said, "Indeed, I am a good companion. Indeed, I am a good companion, and My word is a word of grace from Me to the people."
Likewise, the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him. The death of Jesus.
From noon until three o'clock, the whole earth was covered in darkness.
Around three o'clock, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of the bystanders there heard Jesus crying out. They said, "He is calling Elijah."
Immediately, someone ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine and vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
So the rest of the people said to him, "Leave him alone. Let us see if any truth will come from him to bring him out."
After Jesus cried out loudly again, he died.
At that moment, the temple's curtain was torn in two from top to bottom, the earth shook, and the rocks split.
The graves were opened. And the bodies of noble people who had died were raised to life.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus was taken up into heaven, they went to the holy city. There, they appeared to many people.
The Roman commander and those guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened. They were terrified. They exclaimed, "He was surely the Son of God!"
Not very far away, many women were watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to take care of his needs.
Mary Magdalene was among them. And Mary, the mother of James and Joseph, was also there. The mother of Zebed's sons was also there. And Jesus was buried.
As evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came. He had become a disciple of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Yusuf took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
He threw him into his new grave that he had carved into the rock. He rolled a large stone in front of the tomb's entrance. Then he left.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. And the guards who were at the tomb...
The next day was the day after the Preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
Sir, they said: We remember something that liar said while he was still alive. He claimed, "In three days I will rise again from the dead."
So I will have my soldier guard the body until the third day. If you don't do this, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that Jesus has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first."
"Take some guards with you," replied Belat. "Go. Make the tomb as secure as you can."
So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting guards.
Jesus rises from the dead.
The Sabbath had ended. It was dawn on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
**There was a powerful earthquake.** **The angel of the Lord came down from heaven.** **The angel went to the tomb.** **He rolled away the stone and sat on it.**
His body shone like a flash of lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so frightened of him that they trembled and looked like corpses.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.
Not here! He has risen, just as he said he would! Come and see the place where he lay.
Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you."
Then the women fled from the tomb. They were terrified but filled with great joy. They ran to tell the disciples.
Suddenly Jesus met them. "Greetings!" he said. They came to him, seized his feet, and worshiped him.
Then he said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me." So the guards went and told the chief priests everything that Jesus had said.
As the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
When the chief priests met with the elders, they came up with a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
Tell the soldiers: "We want you to say, 'His disciples came at night. They stole his body while we were sleeping.'"
If this news reaches the governor, we will pay him and do him a favor. That way, your safety will be ensured.
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus' last commands to his disciples.
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they worshiped him. Yet some others remained doubtful.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And know that I am with you always, to the end.”
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
"Behold, I will send My messenger, and he will prepare the way before you." (Malachi 3:1)
"A voice cries out: 'In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.' (Isaiah 40:3)"
And to that Allah has commanded. And it has come. And it has been proclaimed, saying: "Upon the people is the resurrection. Then the place of the resurrection will be established. And the people will be proclaimed that they will be proclaimed. And that they will be proclaimed. And that they will be proclaimed. And that they will be proclaimed. And that they will be proclaimed. And that they will be proclaimed. And that they will be proclaimed. And that they will be proclaimed. And that they will be proclaimed. And that they will be proclaimed. And that they will be proclaimed. And that they will be proclaimed. And that they will be proclaimed. And that they will be proclaimed. And that they will be proclaimed. And that they will be proclaimed. And that they will be proclaimed."
All the people from the Judean countryside went out to him, and also the people of Jerusalem. And when they acknowledged their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John wore clothes made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
"After me, one who is stronger than I comes. I am not good enough to bend down and untie his shoes."
"I baptize you with water. But he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." Jesus is baptized and tested.
At that time, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee. He was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
Jesus was coming up out of the water. Suddenly, he saw the heavens torn open. He saw the Holy Spirit descending on him like a dove.
A voice from heaven said to him, "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."
So he sent Moses back to the desert.
He was in the desert for 40 days. There, the devil tempted him. Wild animals did not hurt Jesus. Angels took care of him. Jesus chooses his first disciples.
After John was imprisoned, Jesus went to Galilee. He preached the good news of God's kingdom.
"The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God is near. Repent of your sins and believe in the gospel!"
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting their nets into the lake; they were fishermen.
"Come after me," said Jesus, "and I will make you fishers of men."
Immediately they left their nets and followed him.
Then Jesus walked a little further. And when he did, he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and another. They were in a boat mending their nets.
Immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after Jesus. And Jesus cast out the demon.
Jesus and those with him went to Capernaum. And when the Sabbath came, he went into the synagogue and began to teach.
People were impressed by his teaching. He taught them as if he had authority. He did not speak like a professor of law.
Suddenly, a man in their group began to shout. He was possessed by an evil spirit. He said:
"What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!"
"Be silent!" Jesus said sternly. "Come out of him!"
Then Satan threw him with a violent throw, and he came out of it with a great cry.
Everyone was amazed. Some asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching! With such authority! Even the demons obey him and his commands."
The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left the temple and went immediately with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed with a fever. They told Jesus about her.
So he went to her. He took her hand and helped her up. The fever had left her. Then she began to serve them.
That evening, after sunset, they brought to Jesus all who were sick and those possessed by demons.
A large crowd of townsfolk gathered at the entrance.
Jesus healed many of them. They were suffering from all kinds of diseases. He also cast out many demons. But he did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prays in a quiet place.
The morning began very early, and it was still dark. Jesus got up and left the house. He went to a place where he could be alone. There he prayed.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they shouted at the top of their voices, "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus replied, "Let us go somewhere else. I want to go to the nearby towns so that I can preach there as well. That is why I have come."
So he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons. And he healed every disease and every affliction among the people.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus and knelt down before him, saying, "Lord, if you choose, you can make me clean."
Jesus was filled with deep compassion. He reached out his hand and touched the man. He said, "I am willing to do this." "Be made clean!"
The disease immediately left him. He recovered.
Jesus sent him immediately. He gave the man a severe warning.
"Don't tell this to anyone," he said. "Go and show yourself to the priest. Offer the sacrifices commanded by Moses. You will be a witness to the priest and the people that you are 'clean.'"
But the man went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer enter a town openly. He remained in secluded places, but people kept coming to him from all quarters.
Jesus healed a man who could not walk.
After several days, Jesus returned to Capernaum. The people heard that he had come back to his home.
A large crowd gathered, until there was no longer any room. There wasn't even room outside the door. And Jesus spoke the word to them.
Four of those who came were carrying a man who could not walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after digging out the tiles, they lowered the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying.
Jesus saw their faith, and he said to the man, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
Some law teachers were sitting there. They were thinking,
Why is this person talking like this? He's saying something very evil! Only God can forgive sins!
Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that they were contemplating this in their hearts, and he said to them, "Why are you thinking about these things in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say to this man, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Get up, take your mat and walk"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus spoke to the man who could not walk.
"I tell you," he said, "Get up. Take your mat and go home."
The man rose and took his mat. Then he walked away, while everyone watched. All the people were amazed. They praised God and said, "We have never seen anything like this before!" The choice of Jesus for the Pharisee.
Once again Jesus went out beside the Sea of Galilee. A large crowd followed him, and he began to teach them.
وَبَيْنَمَا كَانَ يَسُوعُ يَمْشِي، رَأَى لِيفِي ابْنَ آلِفَى جَالِسًا عِنْدَ مَكَانِ الْجِبَايَةِ، فَقَالَ لَهُ: «اتْبَعْنِي».
Later Jesus was at a dinner in Levi's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples. They were part of the large crowd that was following Jesus.
Some Pharisees who were teachers of the law were there. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. So they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this. So he said to them, "Those who are well do not need a doctor, but the sick do. I did not come to call those who think they are right with God, but sinners." Jesus is asked about fasting.
The disciples of John and the Pharisees often fasted and prayed. Some people came to Jesus and said to him, "The disciples of John fast often, and the disciples of the Pharisees fast often, but yours do not. Why not?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? They cannot fast as long as he is with them.
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them. On that day they will fast.
People do not sew a patch of new cloth onto old clothes. If they did, the new piece would pull away from the old garment. That would make the tear worse.
O people, I am the Messenger of Allah. Will you follow me or will you follow Yahya, Jesus son of Mary? O people, I am the Messenger of Allah. Will you follow me or will you follow Yahya, Jesus son of Mary? O people, I am the Messenger of Allah. Will you follow me or will you follow Yahya, Jesus son of Mary? O people, I am the Messenger of Allah. Will you follow me or will you follow Yahya, Jesus son of Mary? O people, I am the Messenger of Allah. Will you follow me or will you follow Yahya, Jesus son of Mary? O people, I am the Messenger of Allah. Will you follow me or will you follow Yahya, Jesus son of Mary?
On one of the Sabbath days, Jesus was walking through the grainfields with his disciples. The disciples began to pluck and eat some of the heads of grain.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! It is not lawful to do this on the Sabbath. Why are your disciples doing it?"
He replied, "Haven't you ever read about what David did? He and his men were hungry. They needed food."
When Abiathar was high priest, David entered the house of God and ate the sacred bread. Only the priests were allowed to eat it. David also gave some of the bread to his men.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
"So the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath."
Healing on Saturday
Jesus entered the synagogue again, and there was a man with a withered hand.
Some Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They were watching him closely. They wanted to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus spoke to the man with the weak and distorted hand. He said to him, "Stand up before everyone."
Then Jesus asked them, "What does the law say about what we should do on the Sabbath? Is it right to do good or to do evil? Is it right to save a life or to kill?" But no one answered.
Jesus looked at them with anger. He was greatly disturbed because their hearts were hard. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as good as new.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians against Jesus, seeking to kill him. And the multitudes followed Jesus.
Jesus and his disciples went to the Sea of Galilee. A large crowd from Galilee followed them.
Word of all that Jesus did reached the whole region. People came to him from all over Judea, from Jerusalem, and from the areas across the Jordan, as well as from the region around Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowd, Jesus told his disciples to prepare a small boat for him, in order to prevent the people from crowding around him.
Jesus healed many people. Therefore, the sick rushed to reach him and touch him.
When the evil spirits saw him, they fell down before him. Crying out, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone who he was. Jesus appointed the twelve messengers.
Jesus went to the top of a mountain. He called a group of people to come to him, and they came.
He appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles, that they might be with him and he might send them out to preach.
They had the power to cast out demons.
So Jesus appointed twelve. Simon was one of them. Jesus gave him the name Peter.
There were James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. Jesus gave them the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder.
And there were with him Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot. And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, was treasurer.
Judas Iscariot's betrayal was also among them. He was the one who would later hand Jesus over to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebub
Jesus entered a house. Again a crowd gathered, so large that Jesus and his disciples could not even eat.
His family heard about this. So they came to take charge of him. And they said, "He is insane."
Some of the scribes were there. They had come from Jerusalem. They said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul! He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons."
So He invited them to inform them of His parables. He said, "How can Satan drive out Satan?"
If a kingdom fights against itself, it cannot stand.
If a family is separated, he won't bear it.
