Jacob was the father of Joseph. Joseph was the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Christ.
From Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations. So all the generations from Abraham to Jesus Christ were forty and six.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: Mary and Joseph were pledged to be married. Before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Yusuf's husband was a good man. He didn't want to shame her in front of people. So, he intended to divorce her secretly.
Okay, as Joseph was thinking about this, an angel from the Lord appeared to him in a dream. The angel said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
She will give birth to a daughter. You must name her Aisha. That is because she will save her people from their mistakes.
All this happened so that what the Lord had spoken through the prophets would be fulfilled. He had spoken through the messengers.
"The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel" (which means "God with us"). (Isaiah 7:14)
Joseph awoke. There was the angel of the Lord standing beside him. Mary, his wife, was with child.
But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son, and he gave him the name Jesus.
Understanding rulers publish Jesus.
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time when Herod was king of Judea. After the birth of Jesus, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
They asked, "Where is the child who has been born to be the king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was very troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
Good, he called all the leaders of the people. He also called the teachers of the law. He asked them where Christ would be born.
They answered: "In Bethlehem in Judea."
"Truly, you are the least among the rulers of Judah, but you will have a ruler coming from you; and he will be a shepherd of my people Israel."
After that, Herod secretly summoned the wise men of Rome and inquired of them exactly when the star had appeared.
"Send them to Bethlehem." He said, "Go! Investigate the child. When you find him, bring me a report. Then I'll go and worship him too."
After the wise men heard the king's decree, they set out on their journey. A star appeared to them when they had eaten and it led them on until it came to a stop over the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, their hearts rejoiced.
The wise men went to the house. They saw the child with his mother Mary. They bowed down and worshiped him. Then he opened his treasures. He gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But an angel of the Lord appeared to them in a dream, warning them not to go back to Herod. So they returned to their country by a different route.
When the magi had departed, Joseph had a dream. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him. "Get up!" the angel said. "Take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you to return, because Herod is going to search for the child in order to kill him."
Joseph arose. In the night, he walked to Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.
They stayed there until the death of King Herod. Thus was fulfilled what the Lord had spoken through the prophet: "I called my son out of Egypt" (Hosea 11:1).
They understood that the wise men had played him. So he became very angry. He gave orders concerning Bethlehem and the region. But all the boys of two years old and under were to be killed. That was the time when the wise men saw the star.
Thus, the words of the prophet Jeremiah will be fulfilled. He said,
Her voice reached Ramada. It was the sound of crying and deep sorrow. Richard was weeping for her children. You couldn't console her, because they were gone.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child's life are dead."
Joseph stirred and rose. He took the child and his mother Mary and returned to the land once more.
In truth, after Jericho Shalom became king over Judah. Jericho Shalom reigned in place of his father Herod. That made Joseph afraid to go there. Warned in a dream, Joseph returned to the land of Galilee, to Beth-el.
"He lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets, 'He shall be called a Nazarene.'"
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said: "Stay away from troubles! Hell is very near."
John is the one about whom the prophet Isaiah spoke. He said, "A voice cries out in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes are made of camel hair. He has a leather belt around his waist. His food is locusts and wild honey.
They came to him from Jerusalem and all the lands of Judah, and from the region beyond the Jordan.
When they confessed their mistakes, John baptized them in the Jordan.
John saw the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the place where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Reap what you sow from your sins.
Don't delude yourself into saying, "Abraham is our father." Rather, what you should say is, "Abraham is our ancestor." God can raise up children for Abraham from these stones.
The axe is idle from calculating the roots of speech. Any speech that does not bear much fruit is cut off. It is thrown into the fire.
He will baptize you with water, and call you to repent of your sins. After me comes one who is stronger than I, and I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
He held it in his hand to scoop grain from the threshing floor. He will gather his kittens in the barn. But he won't burn hay with a shovel that can't be lifted. "Christ is baptized."
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. He wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to prevent him. He said to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you. Why do you come to me?"
Jesus answered, "Let it be so now; it is what you want. But truly I tell you, this must fulfill all that is written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets." Then John agreed.
"He was baptized, and at once the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him."
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Jesus is tempted.
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert. You will face the trial that awaits you.
After forty days and forty nights of fasting, Jesus was hungry.
She came to him. He said, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.' " (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Then Satan took Jesus to the holy city and set him on the highest point of the temple.
"For He will command His angels concerning you," he said, "to guard you in all your ways. They will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone." (Psalm 91:11-12)
Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
Lucifer shook Jesus to the top of a very high mountain. Behind him were the kingdoms of the whole world and their greatness.
"When you are kneeling and worshipping Me," He said, "I will give you all these."
Jesus said, "Get away from me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.' " (Deuteronomy 6:13)
And afterward the devil left him, and behold, angels came and ministered to him. Jesus began to preach.
John was put in prison. When Jesus heard of it, he withdrew to the region of Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth. He went to live in the town of Capernaum, which was on the lake in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
"Behold, the words of the prophet Jesus, which were spoken, have come to pass. He said,"
Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where people who are not Jews live! Land along the Mediterranean Sea! Land east of the Jordan River!
"The people who walk in darkness will see a great light. Those who live in a dark land, the light will shine on them." (Isaiah 9:1,2)
"From then on, our Lord Jesus began to preach. 'Repent of your sins!' he said. 'The kingdom of my Lord is near.' Our Lord Jesus chooses the first disciples."
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. He saw two brothers, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake; they were fishermen.
"Come. Follow me," said Jesus. "I will make you fishers of men."
At that moment, they cast their nets and followed him.
Moving away from there, he saw two other brothers, James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. When they heard Jesus calling them,
So they left the boat and their father, and followed Jesus. Jesus healed the sick.
Jesus went throughout all the land of Galilee. There he taught in their synagogues and preached the good news of the kingdom of God. He healed every disease and every affliction among the people.
News about him spread throughout Syria. People brought to him all who were sick with various diseases. Some were in great pain. Others were possessed by demons. Some were convulsing and others were completely paralyzed. Jesus healed them all.
The leaders played a game behind him. People came from Gilead, from the land called Ten Towns, and from Jerusalem and Judea. Others came from the land along the Jordan River.
Jesus gives blessings.
Jesus saw the crowds. He went up on a mountain and sat down. His disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them, saying:
"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled. The kingdom of heaven is theirs."
The blessed ones are those who are reading. So that they may be reassured.
The blessed ones are those without children. If they were sold, the country would be bought.
"Health to those who feel hungry and thirsty for what is lawful. And they are fulfilled."
The blessed are those who show mercy. And they are shown mercy.
Blessed is my pure heart, long live God.
**Praise be to God** for those who seek reconciliation. **God** calls him **the son of the Lord**.
Blessed is He who has sent down the distinction to the people, so that they may all be warned.
Oh Mubarak, it's because of me that people mock you and harm you. And Mubarak, it's also because of me that they tell all kinds of evil lies about you.
Rejoice and be glad. Your reward in Paradise is great. How much more so for the servants who hurt the prophets who lived long ago. Salt and light.
You've wasted the land. Don't you see the salt losing its saltiness? How can it become salt again? It's completely useless. It's gathered and thrown away. People trample on it.
You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden.
Many people don't realize the value of money and spend it carelessly. They should put it in its place. That way, it will benefit everyone in the house.
Make yourself a light before others. You will see the servants whom you will make. And through them, they will remove the rights of their Father who is in heaven. Jesus understood the law completely.
I did not come to abolish the law or the prophets. I did not come to do away with them. On the contrary, I came to fulfill what is written with clarity.
What I'm about to tell you is true. Heaven and earth will disappear before the smallest letter disappears from the law. Not even the slightest touch of a pen will disappear from the law until everything is fulfilled.
Do not break even the least of these commands and do not teach people to break them. If you do, you will be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. Instead, practice and teach these commands. Then you will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
This is what I'm saying. You need to be tougher than the jurists and religious scholars. If you're not, there's no way you're entering Paradise. Killing.
I heard what was said about the people who lived long ago. They were told: "You shall not kill. (Exodus 20:13) Whoever does not kill will not be held accountable for it."
This is what I'm telling you. Don't deceive your brother. Whoever deceives his brother should be brought to trial. And certainly, whoever says to his brother "Raka" must be tried in the Sanhedrin. But whoever says "You fool!" remains in danger of the fire of Hell.
"So what gift shall you bring to the altar, to remind you of your brother who has something against you?"
"Leave your gift there before the altar. First go and be reconciled with your brother; then come and present your gift."
Someone has a claim against you and is coming to sue you. Settle this matter quickly. Do it while we're still on good terms with him. If we don't, he might hand you over to the judge. The judge might hand you over to the officers. And you might end up in jail.

"I heard what he said, 'You shall not commit adultery.' (Exodus 20:14)"
Okay, that's what I'm telling you. Don't even look at a woman with desire. If you do, your heart might stray towards her and commit adultery.
"The right eyelid of your eye is leading you to sin; pluck it out and throw it away. Your eye is just one part of your body. Better to lose it than to have your whole body thrown into hell."
"Your left hand was the cause of your sin, cut it off and throw it away. This left hand of yours is just a part of your body. It is better for you to lose it than to have your whole body enter the fire. Divorce her."
"Then someone said, 'Suppose a man divorces his wife. If he divorces her, he must give her a certificate of divorce.'" (Deuteronomy 24:1)
Here's what I'm saying. A man who divorces his wife should forbid her from remarrying. And if he marries a divorcee from him, he commits adultery. A man can divorce his wife only if she is unfaithful to him. Oaths.
Once again, I heard what was said about your people long ago. They were told, "Do not follow what the Lord has commanded you. Keep the oath you have sworn."
Okay, that's what I'm telling you. Don't do that at all. Don't use the names of the Lord of the Worlds. This is the throne of the Lord of the Worlds.
Don't name them after the Earth. That's the shit of the Lord's two legs. Don't name them after Jerusalem. That's the city of the great king.
Do not swear by your name. A hair cannot turn white unless it's alone.
Be honest: let your "yes" mean "yes," and your "no" mean "no." Anything more than this comes from the devil. Be kind to people.
Here I have heard it said, "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth." (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
"Good, this is what I'm telling you. Don't fight with an evil servant. 'If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek to them as well.'"
"He would pull you before the judge to take your shirt. Now he's giving you another one for free."
If someone forces you to walk a mile, walk two miles with him.
Give to those who ask. Do not expose your wealth. Love your enemies.
I heard it said: "Love your neighbor." (Leviticus 19:18) and "Die for your enemy."
This is what I am telling you. Love your enemies. Pray for those who harm you.
"Then you will be children of your Father in heaven. He makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous."
What do you gain by loving those who love you? Even fools can do that.
"If You were to seize (them) for their wrong-doing, then indeed, none of Your creatures would remain (unpunished)." "But they are Your servants, so what more could You do against Your servants? Even those who are merciless will not be seized."
Good, good, just like your father in heaven is good.
Giving to those in need.
"Do not give to the needy in front of people, to be seen by them. Otherwise, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven."
"Acil was giving to the needy, not calling them beggars or even a little bit of scorn. He was not like those who did it in temples and on the streets, whose only concern was that people should honor them and see good in them. But the words I am going to tell you are true. They received all their rewards."
"When you give to those in need, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing."
After you pay your zakat, it becomes secret. Your Lord meets you. He sees what you do in secret. Supplication.
"When you pray, don't be like the hypocrites who love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners. They want people to see them. What I'm telling you now is true. They have received their reward in full."
"When you pray, go into your room. Close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret."
"When you pray, don't chatter like those who are not named. They think they will be heard because they talk a lot."
Don't be like them. Your dad knows what you need even before you ask him.
This is how you should pray: 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
Your kingdom come, Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our trespass, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
Keep us from falling into sin when we are tempted. Save us from the evil one.
Forgive those who wrong you. Your Heavenly Father will forgive you as well.
"If you do not forgive the servants of God for their mistakes, then God will not forgive you for your mistakes." - Fasting
"When you graduate, don't eat in public, don't act like those who pretend to be holy. They make sad faces to show they're fasting. They love to display their piety to others. That's the truth I'm telling you. They've gotten their full reward."
But to get out without paying, put olive oil on your head. Wash your face.
Many people don't know that you are fasting. If there were no God, no one would know. He will reward you. Your father sees things that happen in secret. Hold your money up to the sky.
Do not store up your wealth on earth, where moths and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
He who hides his wealth in heaven, here, in a mountain and in a tree, neither decay nor thief can destroy it.
Your heart will be where your riches are.
The eye is like a lantern for the body. If your eyes are beautiful, your whole body will be illuminated.
But if your eyes are weak, the embodiment of your entire body will be dark. If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. He will hate one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not be anxious.
Let me tell you, don't worry. Don't worry about your life and what you eat and drink. And don't worry about your body and what you wear. Isn't it true that there's more to life than food? Of course, there are many things more important for your body than clothes.
Prove to me that you can see a bird that solves problems. What is not planted cannot be harvested. What is not hidden in a granary cannot be stored. But your Lord in the sky provides for them. Don't they deserve more than their worth?
Do you add an hour to your life by worrying?
"And what do you care about clothes? Go out and see how wildflowers bloom. They don't work or make clothes."
This is what I'm telling you. Solomon was not sitting on his throne all the time like a rose.
If God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
Okay, don't worry. Don't say, "What should we eat?" or "What should we drink?" or "What should we wear?"
People who don't let go of everything. Your book in Heaven knows what you need.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
"Don't worry about tomorrow. Tomorrow will worry about itself. Every day has enough trouble of its own."
Be fair in judging people.
Don't judge people. They don't judge you either.
You will be judged as you judge others. You will be measured as you measure others.
"You see a bit of dirt in your friend's eye, but you don't notice the splinter in your own."
How can you tell your friend, "Let me get some dirt out of your eye," when there's a bit of dirt in your own eye?
"You pretender! First take the piece of wood out of your own eye. Then you will be able to see clearly to take the bit of sawdust out of your friend's eye."
Don't worship dogs. Don't blink at liars. If you work, they walk on their own. Still, they try and tear you apart piece by piece. Ask, knock, seek.
Ask, and what you seek will be brought to you. Search, and what is written for you, you will find. Knock, and whoever awaits at your door will let you in.
Everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. The door opens for him who knocks.
Why are you standing in the way of your children and putting a stone in their path?
And no one asks about a whale. Who among you will give it a breath?
Even if you are evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask Him!
So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets. The big doors and the small doors.
Enter the kingdom of my Lord through a small gate. The gate is wide and the road is broad, leading to death and fire. Many people walk that way.
The rickshaw is small, the alley is narrow, and it leads to life. Few find it. A tree and its fruit.
Beware of those who make false promises. They come to deceive you, saying they are as innocent as sheep, but inside they are hungry wolves.
"You can't really say what they're doing. 'Do people pick grapes from trees? Do they pluck thorns from thistles?'"
Above all, every good inch bears beautiful fruit. But what is not good bears bad fruit.
A good tree does not bear bad fruit. And a bad tree does not bear good fruit.
Every tree that doesn't produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You can know a tree by its fruit.
Not everyone who says, "Lord, Lord," will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father in heaven.
"Oh Lord! Oh Lord! Were we not the ones who proclaimed Your name? Were we not the ones who cast out demons in Your name? Were we not the ones who performed many miracles in Your name?"
Let's speak the truth, I never knew you. Stay away from me, or they'll say I'm evil! The wise and ignorant builder.
"No, whoever listens to me and puts my words into practice is like a wise man who builds his house on the rock."
The rain falls. Water rises. The wind strengthens and beats against that house. But it does not fall. It is built on rock.
"Anyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a fool, building their house on sand."
The rain is falling. Water is rising. The wind is howling and pounding at that house. Creating a loud crash.
Jesus finished all this discourse. The crowds were amazed at his teaching.
Learn how someone with authority speaks. Don't speak like the legal scholars do.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountains. Large crowds followed him.
A man with a skin disease came and knelt down before Jesus, saying, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."
Jesus stretched out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!" Immediately the man was cured of his disease.
So Jesus said to him, "Do not tell anyone. Go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." And the centurion went his way in faith.
When Jesus entered the city of Capernaum, a Roman centurion came to him. He asked for his help.
"My lord," he said, "my servant lies at home, unable to move. He is in great distress."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
The leader replied, "Sir, I am not very well for you to come to my house. But if you give the word, this slave will be set free."
I am a man of authority in my own right. I have subordinates who obey my orders. I say to this one, 'Go', and he goes. I say to that one, 'Come', and he comes. I say to the servant, 'Do this', and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those who followed him, "Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith."
"I tell you, many will come from east and west and sit at the table in the kingdom of heaven, with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."
As for those who think they are from the kingdom, they will be driven out into the darkness. There, they will inherit and lend throughout their lives.
Then Jesus said to the Roman centurion, "Go! As you have believed, so it will be done." And his servant was healed at that very hour. Jesus healed many people.
When Jesus came to the house of Peter, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Isa rubbed her hand and ran a heating pad over it. She got up and started waiting for him.
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him. He drove out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick.
They did this to fulfill the words of Prophet Jesus, peace be upon him. He said, "He bore the punishment that was due to us, the diseases that should have been ours." (Isaiah 53:4) Following Jesus means carrying a heavy burden.
Jesus saw the large crowd that was following him. So, he told his disciples to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
Then a law professor came to him. He said, "Professor, we will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
And one of the people said to him, "O Pasha, let me go first and bury my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead." "Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction."
Jesus walked in the boat. His sons followed him.
Suddenly a storm came down upon the lake. The waves were crashing against the boats. But Jesus was sleeping.
The pupils were walking and woke him up. They said to him, "Teacher! Save us! We're going to drown!"
"You of little faith, why are you so afraid?" Then Jesus got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm.
The pupils woke up. They said, "Who is this man? The wind and water were struggling against him!" "Jesus heals two men possessed by demons."
Jesus reached the other side of the lake in the region of the Gerasenes. Two men possessed by demons met him. They came out of the tombs. The men were so violent that no one could pass by.
Oh son of God, what do You want with us? They cried, "Did You bring us here to punish us before the Day of Judgment?"
Not far away, a large herd of pigs was eating.
"If he had resigned among us, he would have instilled in us the behavior of a herd of boars."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" So the demons came out of the man and went into the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake and drowned.
Those who used to tend the pigs were possessed by the wind. They went to the city and spread everything. They told the people what happened to the men who were touched by the jinn.
The whole city came out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they fled from him and begged him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk.
Jesus walked on the sea. He walked to the other side of the lake and went to their city.
Some men brought him a man who could not walk. He was lying on a mat. Jesus saw their faith. So he said to the woman, "Do not be afraid, my daughter. Your sins are forgiven."
Then some of the lawyers said to themselves, "This man is blaspheming!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to them, "Why do you have such evil thoughts in your hearts?"
My brother, is it easy to say, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or how do you say, "Get up and walk"?
I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he spoke to the man who could not walk. "Get up," he said. "Take your mat and go home.
The man got up and went home.
When the crowd saw this, they were amazed. They praised the Almighty who had granted such power to his disciples. Jesus chooses when.
And so our Lord Jesus came out of there, and saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax collection post. "Follow me," our Lord Jesus said to him. Matthew got up and followed him.
At the dinner, Lord Iswors was at the table of Marcus' supper. Many "mercenaries" and "sinners" came to him, and they all spoke with Lord Iswors and his disciples.
The parents saw this. So they asked the students, "Why is your teacher eating with the bosses, the unemployed, and the 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this and said, "Those who are well don't need a doctor, but those who are sick do."
"Go and learn what this means, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' (Hosea 6:6) I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners." (Mark 2:17, NIV)
In one day, the disciples of John came to Jesus and said, "We and the Jewish scribes fast often and pray, but your disciples eat and drink. Why do your disciples not fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast."
People don't sew a patch of new material onto old clothes. The new patch will shrink and start to pull away from the old fabric. This will make the tear worse.
"People don't pour new wine into old bottles. If they do, the bottles will burst. The wine will spill, and the old bottles will be ruined. No, people pour new wine into new bottles. That way, both will expand." "A dead tree and a tortured woman"
While Jesus was saying this, a ruler came. He knelt before Jesus and said, "My daughter has just died. But come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
Jesus rose and went with him. So did his disciples.
At that very moment, a woman came up behind Jesus. She had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years. She touched the fringe of his garment.
She thought to herself, "I should have touched his things. Oh well, too late now."
Jesus turned and saw her. "Daughter," he said, "your faith has healed you. Do not be afraid any longer." At that very moment, the woman was healed.
When Adam entered the house, he saw the children playing with their toys. He saw the people full of noise.
He said, "Go. The girl is not dead. She's alive." But they laughed at him.
After they had made the bed, Jesus came and sat down on it. He took the girl by the hand and she got up.
A new rumor about what Jesus had done spread throughout the region. Jesus healed two blind men.
But Jesus went on from there, and two blind men followed him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus entered, the blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" "Yes, Lord," they answered.
He stepped back, looking into their eyes. He said, "This is what will happen to you if you don't believe."
"Let's keep this among ourselves. Jesus sternly warned them, 'You must tell no one about this.'"
They have already gone and spread the news. They told about him in all those countries.
And they brought another man to Jesus who was possessed by a demon. He was unable to speak.
When the witch fell, the man's words came true. The people were amazed. They said, "Nothing like this has happened or been seen in Israel."
Fine, but the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons." But others said, "He casts out demons with the finger of God."
Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness.
When he saw the crowd, he felt great anxiety for them. They were crushed and scattered like sheep without a shepherd.
And Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
Okay, ask the master of the dairy to send workers to the dairy for the harvest. Okay, ask the master of the harvest to send workers for the harvest.
Jesus sent out twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (Peter) and his brother Andrew. Then James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
After them come Philip and Bartholomew, even Thomas and Matthew the publican. After them are two Jameses, the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddeus.
The others are Saint Simon and Judas Iscariot. Judas was the one who was going to betray Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent out these twelve, instructing them, "Do not go into any town of the Samaritans, and do not enter any house of the Jews who do not welcome you."
"Go, shepherd the flock of Israel, you scattered sheep."
As you go, proclaim, "The kingdom of God is near."
He healed the sick. He brought the living. He made their skins clean. He drove out the evil from them. You took a sea. Give a sea.
Don't carry any gold, silver, or coins in your donkeys.
Don't bring a big bag for the trip. Don't bring extra clothes, shoes, or walking sticks. You need to provide for the one who serves what is needed.
When you enter a city or a village, look for someone who is willing to host you. Stay in their home until you leave.
How do you enter a house? Greet the people living there.
If this house shelters you, give it a blessing of peace. If not, do not bless it.
"So what use are they to you, those who do not believe in you and do not listen to your words? If that is the case, take the dust from the feet of your followers when they leave this house and town."
I'll tell you something true. The day the world ends, it will be easy for the people of Lot and the people of Aad in this town.
I'll let you go, like a bird, like the rain, like children.
Be careful! They might hand you over to the local security. They'll beat you in their custody.
You brought them to the rulers and kings because of me. You testified against them, and you testified against those who are not Jews.
"The way they sway you, don't worry about what to say or how to say it. At that moment, you'll find the right words to say."
He no longer speaks to you. It's your father's spirit that speaks through you.
"Brotherhood gives birth to murder. Fathers give birth to their children. Children rise up against their fathers and bring them to murder."
Everyone hates you because of me. But whoever proves the other the end will be saved.
When people oppress you in one place, flee to another. What I am about to tell you is true. You will not stir up trouble in all the land of Israel before the coming of the human being.
A disciple was no better than his teacher. A slave was no better than his master.
Enough for the student to be like his teacher. And enough for the servant to be like his master. If the head of the house is called a fig, who will the rest of the people living there be called?
"Don't be afraid of your enemy. Every secret will come to light. Everything hidden will be revealed."
What you whisper to me in the dark, speak in the daylight. What you murmur in my ear, shout it from the rooftops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Two starlings were sold for a dirham? If one of them hadn't fallen to the ground, I wouldn't have known about it.
Even every hair on the head is counted!
Okay, don't be afraid. You're worth more than a lot of starlings.
What do you think of someone who says in front of everyone that they know me? I also say in front of my father in heaven that I know him.
But who said it in front of people who don't know me? I say it in front of our Father in heaven, whom we don't know.
I didn't come to bring peace to the world. I came to bring a sword.
And I came to turn the boys against each other. And the girls to refuse to listen to the word of the men. And the men's daughters to be against the men's wives.
The man's enemies are usually members of his own family.
"No one loved their father or mother more than me, they were not worth me. No one loved their son or daughter more than me, they were not worth me."
"Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me."
If a servant meets his lifespan, he wastes it. If he wastes his lifespan because of me, he will meet me.
"He who replaces you in your house, replace his house with your house, and he who replaces me in my house, replace his house with the house of my master."
Assume someone welcomes a prophet as a prophet. That person will receive the reward of the prophet. And assume someone welcomes a righteous person as a righteous person. That person will receive the reward of the righteous individual.
"This person was so kind as to offer even a single glass of cold water to the little one who followed me. What I'm about to tell you is true. That person will definitely be rewarded."
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus completed his teaching for his twelve disciples. Then he went to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked Jesus, "Are you the one who is supposed to come? Or should we look for someone else?"
Jesus answered, "Go back to John and tell him what you have heard and seen."
The blind will see. The disabled will walk. The sick will be healed. The deaf will hear. The dead will live. And good will be sold to the poor.
"Oh, the blessing of those who do not lose their faith because of me."
As John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John. He said, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
If not, why did you go to watch? A man wearing nice clothes? No. People who wear nice clothes are in the palaces of kings.
Okay, when you go out, what do you see? A prophet? Oh, I'll tell you, more than a prophet.
That's what is written in the Holy Book. It says: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you." (Malachi 3:1)
How then shall we describe the kingdom of God? It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his garden. Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it becomes the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches.
In the days of John the Baptist, the kingdom of heaven was forcefully advancing, and the violent were taking it by force.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you accept him, John is the one who should come.
Dreamers abstain. Hearers abstain. Dreamers abstain.
How can we compare these people to anyone else? They're like children sitting in the markets, calling out to people. They say,
"We played the flute for you. But you didn't dance. We sang at a funeral. But you didn't feel the sadness."
"Just as John came, he neither ate nor drank as you do, and people say, 'He has a demon.'"
I have food and drink like other people. And people say, 'This man always eats and drinks a lot. He is a friend of gluttons and "sinners." 'Those who use their minds prove that wisdom is right.' Cities that are not read from sin.
Jesus began to speak against the cities where he had performed most of his miracles. The people were no longer welcoming him into their homes. So he said,
How terrible it will be for you, Chorazin! How terrible it will be for you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
Fine, but I'll tell you this. The last day will be easier for Taher and Sedin than it will be for you.
And you, Caperitha, what will be your fate, to rise to the sky? No! You will descend to the place of the dead. Imagine the miracle that happened to you, if it had happened in Sodom. It would still be here today.
"But Hāni tells you this. The Day of Resurrection will be easier for the people of Lot than it is for you." Comfort for all the weary.
At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants."
Yes, Dad. This is what you hoped for.
"My father tells me everything. He is the only one who knows me. And the only one I know from my father is my child, and I chose my child to know him."
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Be angels and spare me. Hani is tender and has no malice in his heart. So that you can be at peace with yourselves.
It's easy to work with me, and my load is light.
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
One Saturday morning, Jesus was walking through the marshes. His disciples were hungry. So, they started breaking off the heads of wheat and eating them.
The Pharisees saw this. They said to him, "Look, it is not lawful to do this on the Sabbath. But your friends do it too!"
Jesus answered, "Haven't you read what David did when he and his men were hungry?
Okay, here's the translation in Tunisian Arabic: "إذن دخل للجامع. هو ورجالو كلوا الخبز المقدس. كان مسموح بس للكهنة يكلوه." (In English: "So he entered the mosque. He and his men ate the holy bread. It was only allowed to be eaten by priests.")
So what is the meaning of the law? It tells how on every Sabbath the priests in the temple must serve on that day without being considered guilty.
"They say that what's most important from the temple is right here."
In English: This word comes from the Lord: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' (Hosea 6:6) You do not know what this means. If you did, you would not accuse innocent people.
"The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
After leaving this place, Jesus went to their synagogue.
Now there was a man there with a withered hand. The Pharisees watched Jesus closely, looking for a reason to accuse him, and they asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "Even if one of your geese fell into a well on a Saturday, wouldn't you pull it out and save it?"
A man has more worth than a sheep! That's why the law makes us do good on Saturday.
Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out. It was completely restored, just like the other hand.
The Pharisees went out and began to plot how they could kill Jesus.
Jesus knew all about their plot. So, he left that place. Many people followed him, and he healed many who were sick.
But I warned them not to say who he is.
This is what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah through the Holy Spirit. He says,
My servant will be vindicated. He whom I have chosen will be justified. I delight greatly in him. I will put my Spirit on him and he will bring justice to the nations.
He won't argue or shout. No one will hear his voice in the market.
What breaks was already broken. What is extinguished was a weak flame that you were blowing on. Everything happens in due measure.
"Behold, My servant, whom I uphold, My chosen one in whom My soul
A man possessed by rats was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not read. Jesus healed him. Then He spoke to him.
All the passengers were surprised. They said, "My brother, how is this David's son?"
The crowd heard this. Malla said, "This man is spewing misfortune with the power of Belzebub, the prince of misfortune."
Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand."
If the devil drives out the devil, he is fighting himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
You say we cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. But by what power do those who cast them out cast them out? Therefore, they will be your judges.
Don't you imagine I'm going crazy at the sight of God's creation. That's when God's kingdom reaches you.
There's no shame in this. How can you enter a strong man's house and take only what belongs to this man? You have to get along with him first. Otherwise, you can't steal from his house.
"He who is not with me is against me. And whoever does not gather with me scatters."
This is what I tell you. Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But whoever speaks evil against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either now or in the future."
If your tree is good, its fruit will be good. If your tree is bad, its fruit will be bad. So, how do you know a tree by its fruit.
"O den of vicious snakes! How can you, being evil, speak good? What your mouth speaks reveals what is in your hearts."
Mazyan says good things. This comes from the good in his heart. Khayib says bad things. This comes from the evil in his heart.
This is what I'm telling you. On the last day, people will be held accountable for every careless word they've spoken.
"By your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned." - "The Sign of Jonah"
Some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus and said, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
"Wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign! But no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
John was in the belly of a great fish for three days and three nights. Something like this must happen to the Son of Man. He will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.
Several women stand on the day of the judges with the present people. And the Neheans prove that those people are guilty. The men of Nehef turned away from their sins when Yunus preached to them by revelation. And there is one greater in bondage than Yunus.
The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, one greater than Solomon is here.
What happens when a woman leaves a bad marriage? She goes from place to place, looking for a place to rest. But she can't find one.
They say, 'I'll return to the house I left.' When he gets there, he'll find the house empty. The house will be cleaned and renovated.
"And after the unclean spirit has gone out, it takes with it seven other spirits more evil than itself. They enter and make a home there, and the man becomes worse than before. That is how it will be with this evil generation." - Mary Ajweis
While Jesus was still speaking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.
They told him, "Your mother and all your siblings are outside. They want to talk to you."
Jesus answered, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus pointed to his disciples and said, "Behold, my mother! Behold, my brothers!"
"Whoever does what my father in heaven does, is my brother or my sister or my mother."
The Farmer's Tale
On the same day, Jesus left the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
The pilgrims gathered around him. He got on a boat and sat in it. All the pilgrims stopped on the shore.
ثم روى لهم العديد من القصص، مستخدماً فن السرد. فقال: "ذهب فلاح إلى حقلِه لزرع بذورِه."
They sowed in the ground. Some of it fell on the path. Birds came and ate it.
Some grains fell in rocky places, where there wasn't much soil. The plants grew slowly, because the soil wasn't deep enough.
When the sun rose, the plants withered. They wilted because they had no roots.
The last button fell among the thorns. The thorns grew and crowded the plants.
Two mice sown on good land yield 100, 60, or 30 times more than what is sown.
Children of the idle, listen.
The disciples came to him and said, "Why do you use parables when you speak to the people?"
"You are given the opportunity to understand the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven. It is not given to everyone."
Everyone has this kind of knowledge to take more. In fact, to have a lot. If anyone doesn't have this kind of knowledge, even the little they have will be taken from them.
Hani, why do we use stories when we talk to people? I mean, they look, but they don't really see. They listen, but they don't really hear or understand.
For it is these who have been spoken of through the prophet Isaiah: "You will indeed hear but never understand, and you will indeed see but never perceive."
The hearts of these people have become hardened. They start by hearing little with their ears. Then they close their eyes, otherwise they would see with their sight, and hear with their hearing, and understand with their hearts, and turn to the Lord, and the Lord would heal them.
Blessed are your eyes, for they see. And blessed are your ears, for they hear.
What I'm going to tell you is true. Many prophets and righteous people wished to see what you see, but they didn't. They wished to hear what you hear, but they didn't.
Listen! What does this farmer story mean?
Humans hear the message about the kingdom but do not understand it. Then the evil one comes and steals what is sown in their hearts. These people are like the seed sown on the path.
Other Tunisians had the seed that fell on rocky places. They are the ones who hear the message and come to it at that very moment with joy.
They have no roots. Therefore, they will not last long. They will quickly turn away from the faith when tribulation or hardship comes because of the message.
The last ones got the seed that fell among the thorns. They are the ones who hear the word. But then the worries of the world and the deception of wealth's promises choke it.
Good, then there are some servants who have crops, then there are some kings, then there are a hundred, then sixty, then thirty of those who cultivate the land.
Jesus told the crowd another parable. "This is how the kingdom of heaven is," he said. "A man sowed good seed in his field."
While everyone was fast asleep, his enemy came. The enemy planted weeds among the wheat stalks and then left.
The wheat began to sprout and form grains. At the same time, several types of weeds appeared.
The workers came to Michael. They said, "Sir, have you been doubling your crops? Otherwise, where did all these crows come from?"
"This is the work of an enemy," he replied. "The servants asked him, 'Shall we go back and pull up the weeds?'"
"No," the owner replied. "Even if you're looking at the ears of wheat, with these ears of wheat, you can look at the wheat.
"We'll work together until harvest time. Then I'll tell the workers what to do. Here's what I'll say. First, gather the weeds. Tie them in bundles to be burned. Then, collect the wheat. Bring it to my house, to the storage room."
Jesus told the crowd another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field."
Here is the smallest seed you have. But when it grows, it becomes the largest plant in the garden. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest on its branches.
Jesus told them another parable. "The kingdom of my Father is like yeast," he said. "A woman mixed it with fifty pounds of flour. The yeast worked its way through all the dough."
Jesus spoke all these things to the people in parables; he said nothing to them without using a parable.
Thus the words spoken by the prophet were fulfilled. He had said, "I will open my mouth and utter dark sayings; I will proclaim things hidden since the creation of the world." (Psalm 78:2) Jesus Explains the Parable of the Weeds
Then Jesus left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
Answer: "It is the son of man who planted the good seed."
The fields are the world. The good crop represents the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to evil.
The enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the day of reckoning. And the workers are the angels.
"Much will be burned and thrown into the fire. That will be your fate on Judgment Day."
Ibn Adami, with his deep understanding, his vast knowledge, his sharp intellect, his profound wisdom, his keen insight, his comprehensive awareness, his deep contemplation, his thoughtful reflection, his insightful analysis, his profound understanding, his vast knowledge, his sharp intellect, his profound wisdom.
To throw them into the blazing fire. Here people will cry and gnash their teeth.
And after, my Lord adorns with religion and character those whom He loves. If only there were ears to hear. Tales of the hidden treasure and the pearl.
The kingdoms of heaven are like a treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again. He was very happy. So he went and sold everything he had. And he bought that field.
"Space, the kingdom of heaven, is a merchant seeking a pearl."
He found a pearl of great price. So he went and sold all he had and bought it. Parable of the pearl.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net which was thrown into the sea, and gathered together all kinds of fish.
When it was full, they shook it for the catch. They sat down and picked out the good fish into the bags. But they threw away the bad ones.
This is how the Day of Reckoning will be. The angels will come to separate those who did wrong from those who did right.
They throw the bad people into the oven with fire. The bad ones go in there crying and gnashing their teeth.
"Did you understand all that?" said Jesus. "Yes," they answered.
He said to them, "Every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure both new and old." - Matthew 13:52 (NRSV)
Jesus continued to tell them these parables. Then he left.
They brought him to his hometown, Nazareth. There he began teaching in their synagogue, and many were astonished. "Where did this man get such wisdom? Where did he get such power to do miracles?" they asked.
"Isn't he the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary? Aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?"
Aren't all his sisters with us? Where did this man get all these things?
They liked nothing at all. But Jesus said to them, "No prophet is honored in his own country. He deserves no honor in his own home."
Perform a few miracles for them, even if they have no faith.
John the Baptist's head severed
At that time Herod the ruler heard about Jesus and all the things that were being said about him by the people.
He said to his disciples, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do such miracles."
Herod was joyful that day. He bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, the wife of Philip, his brother.
John was saying to Herod, "It is against the law to take her."
Herod was about to kill John. But he feared the people, for they regarded John as a prophet.
At Herod's birthday feast, Herodias' daughter danced before Herod and his guests. He was delighted with her.
Alright, he promised by oath to give her anything she asks for.
Her mother told her what to say. So the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
Salt was indeed deceived. He thought about his promise and the importance of his guests. So, he told one of his men to give them what they asked for.
Howard cut off John's head in prison.
They brought a rat on a large plate and gave it to the girl. She took it and went to her mother with it.
"A Tunisian wedding: "A Tunisian wedding: "A Tunisian wedding: "A Tunisian wedding: "A Tunisian wedding: "A Tunisian wedding: "A Tunisian wedding: "A Tunisian wedding: "A Tunisian wedding: "A Tunisian wedding
Jesus heard what had happened to John. He wanted to be alone. So he got into a boat and went off to a solitary place. When the people heard about it, they followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus came to the shore, he found a large crowd. He felt great compassion for them. He healed their sick.
When the time was nearly up, the pupil came to him. "There's nothing here," he said. "The time is nearly up. Send the assembly away. Let them go and buy some food in the villages."
Jesus answered, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat."
"We have five loaves of bread and two fish, answer them."
"Keep them here with me," he said.
Jesus said to the people, "Sit down on the grass." He took the five loaves and two fish, looked up to heaven, and gave thanks. He broke the loaves into pieces and gave them to the disciples. The disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. The students collected 12 bags of leftover food.
Many men were fed, those were nearly 5,000 slaves. Women and children also ate. Jesus walks on water.
Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, while he dismissed the crowd.
One day, he shook them off and went up a mountain by himself to pray. At dusk, he returned, still immersed in prayer.
The submarine was very far from the shore. It was being tossed by the waves because the wind was blowing against it.
It was early morning, and Issa went out to the pupils. He walked to the water basin.
The witness saw him walking on the lake and it occurred to them. "It's raining!" they said. And they called out to them in their hearts.
"Keep going!" Ziryab shouted to them. "I'm here. Don't be afraid."
"Oh Lord, are you?" asked Peter. "If it is, tell me to come to you on the water."
"Come," said Jesus. "Taking no thought, Peter got out of the boat. He walked on the water to meet Jesus."
No problem, but when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid, started to sink, and shouted, "Oh God, help me!"
On the spot, Jesus stretched out His hand and grabbed her. "Your faith is very small!" He said. "Why didn't you trust Me?"
When they set out in the boat, the wind died down.
And those in the boat professed faith in Christ, saying, "You are truly the Son of God."
They crossed the lake and landed in Genser.
The man who lived there will know Jesus. So send a message to all the nearby houses. People should bring all their sick to Jesus.
They asked him to allow those who were sick to come near his garment. And everyone who touched it was healed of their disease.
What makes people "dirty"?
Some religious scholars and some Pharisees from Jerusalem came to visit Jesus. They asked,
"Why don't your children listen to your elders? They don't wash their hands before eating!"
Jesus answered, "Why do you not keep the commandment of God? You hypocrites! You value the traditions of men more than the commandment of God.
My father said, "Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) He also said, "Anyone who curses his father or mother is to be put to death." (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9)
Will you not allow the servants to say to their people, 'Any help you receive from us is a gift and a special favor from God.'
They don't need to rent each other with a gift. You've made God's word cheap in order to follow your teachings.
"You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you. He said,
"These people honored me with their words, but their hearts are far from me."
"Their worship doesn't concern me. They teach only human laws." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus called to the crowds, saying, "Listen and understand."
What goes into your mouth doesn't make you 'unclean'; it's what comes out of your mouth that makes you 'unclean'.
Then the disciples came to him and asked, "Is it true what the Pharisees are saying?"
Jesus answered, "What man is there among you who, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent instead?"
Leave them. The Pharisees are blind guides. If someone blinds a blind person and both fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Don't you understand now?" said Isa.
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes to the stomach. Then it leaves the body.
But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart. These are what defile you.
Foolish thoughts come from the heart. Also murder, adultery, and other sexual immorality. Also theft, bearing false witness, and slandering people.
These are the things that make you "impure". But eating with dirty hands doesn't make you "impure". "The faith of a Canaanite woman"
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A Canaanite woman from that region came to him, crying out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is tormented by a demon."
Jesus didn't say a word. Then his disciples came to him. They pleaded, "Send her away, for she keeps crying after us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
"Oh no! I've fallen on my knees in front of him. 'Oh God! Help me!' she said."
He said, "It's not right to take the bread from your children's mouths and save it for your dogs."
"Oh, sir," she said. "Not even the dogs eat from the scraps that fall from the table of the full."
Then Jesus answered, "Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted." And her daughter was healed at that very moment. Jesus feeds the four thousand.
Jesus went on. He walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he walked along the edge of a mountain and sat down.
The elders became numerous and they followed him. They brought the blind and those who couldn't walk. They also brought the disabled who couldn't come or walk. Then they brought those who couldn't sit or speak, and they named them countless. They placed them at his feet and he healed them.
Everyone was amazed. Those who couldn't speak started talking. The disabled began to heal. Those who couldn't walk started walking. Even the blind, anyone who was blind or couldn't see, could see. That's why the people praised the Lord God of Israel.
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have great compassion on this crowd, for they have been with me for three days now and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."
His disciples answered him, "Where could we get enough bread in this desolate place to feed so large a crowd?"
"How many loaves do you have?" asked Jesus. "Seven," he answered, "and a few small fish."
Jesus told those present to sit on the ground.
He took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks, he broke them and distributed them to the disciples, and the disciples distributed them to the people.
The crowd ate and were satisfied. Afterward, the disciples gathered seven baskets of the remaining fragments.
The number of men who ate was four thousand. The women and children also ate.
After Jesus had sent the multitude away, He went into the boat. He went to the region of Magadan.
Jesus was asked for a sign from heaven.
The Pharisee and the Sadducee came to observe our Lord Jesus. They said, "We need to see a miracle from heaven."
Answer, "In the evening, you contemplate the sky. You say, 'The weather will be nice. The sky is red.'"
In the morning she says, 'Today there will be a storm. The sky is red and cloudy.' She knows the meaning of what she sees in the sky. But she doesn't understand the signs of what's happening now.
**English Translation:** "They are evil and untrustworthy people, seeking for a sign from heaven. But none will be given them except the sign of Jonah." "Then he left them and went away. The yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The pupils went to the other side of the lake. They forgot the bread.
"Beware," Jesus said to them, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The pupils talked about this among themselves. They said, "He must be saying this because we didn't bring any bread."
Jesus knew what they were discussing. So he said to them, "You of little faith! Why are you discussing among yourselves that you have no bread?"
Don't you understand? Don't you remember the five principles for saving five thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets you collected?
Don't you remember the seven enemies of 4000? Don't you remember how many legions you have?
"How could you not understand? I wasn't talking about bread. But be careful of the yeast of opportunists and sycophants."
By the way, brother, we understand by now. Jesus doesn't want us to think about the yeast in the bread. No, he wants us to think about those who were preparing the people and hearing strange words. And here Peter says that Jesus is the Messiah.
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They said, "Some people speak about John the Baptist. Some people speak about Elijah. Some people speak about Jeremiah, or any of the prophets."
"What about you? What do you say?" he said. "What do I need to become in your opinion?"
Spontaneously Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
This is what I say to you: You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.
"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."
Then Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Jesus spoke about his coming and his death.
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples what would happen to him. He told them that he must go to Jerusalem, where he would suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and teachers of the law. He would be killed, and on the third day he would rise again.
Peter shook Jesus and led him to a corner, beginning to taunt him. "Not possible, my Lord!" he said. "This cannot happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
And here came our Lord Jesus, and said to those who followed him, "If anyone wishes to come with me, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me."
If he wants to save his soul, he will lose it. But if he loses his soul for my sake, he will find it.
What's the point of someone grabbing the whole world and losing themselves? Or who can sell their soul in exchange?
May Allah come like a father. His angels come with Him. And He rewards every servant according to what they have done.
"So I will tell you the truth. There is someone standing here who will not die before he sees the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."
Jesus' personality changed.
Six days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and John—the brother of James—with him. He led them up a high mountain, where they were alone.
How quickly they changed. They shone like the sun. Their things whitened like light.
At that moment, Moses and Elijah appeared before them. Moses and Elijah were speaking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, let us make three booths: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
"While Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them. A voice from the cloud said, 'This is my Son, whom I love. I am very pleased with him. Listen to him!'"
When the students heard it, they were very afraid. They fell down and prostrated themselves on the ground.
But Jesus came and touched them. He said to them, "Arise. Do not be afraid."
When they looked up, they saw Jesus.
He came down from the mountain. In the boat, Jesus told them what to do. "Don't tell anyone what you saw," he said. "Wait until the Son of Man is raised from the dead."
The students asked him, "Why do the lawmakers say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus replied, "That is true. He should come to me and make all things new.
"We've been telling you, Elias Bakri has arrived. People didn't recognize him. They did everything they wanted to him. In the same way, they will wake up cursing the son of man."
And then the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus healed a boy who had a demon.
As they approached the crowd, a man went up to Jesus, knelt down before him,
"Oh teacher, have mercy on my son. He is very confused and suffering greatly. He has likely fallen into the fire or the water."
"I brought it for you to sell. But they couldn't fix it."
"Oh people, you infidels and evildoers!" said Jesus. "How long must I bear with you? How long must I be patient with you? Bring me this child, for all that I have is yours."
Jesus commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it did. He was healed instantly.
The disciples secretly followed Lord Jesus. They asked, "Why didn't we drive out the demon earlier?"
He said, "Because you have so little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."

They came together in a valley. Then Jesus said to them, "The son of man came to give his life as a ransom for many."
"My friend, let him be killed. It doesn't matter if he doesn't get up after death." So the disciples became very sad. Jesus pays the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. When they reached the house, the collectors came to Peter and asked, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
"Ah, he did it," they answered. When Peter came home, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he said. "Who do the kings of the earth collect taxes and revenue from? From their sons or from strangers?"
"Who else," Peter replied. "The children don't need to be paid," Jesus told him.
"We don't want them to get worried. So go to the lake and hide your spear. Catch the first fish you see. Cut its throat. You'll find exactly the money you need. Take it and give it to the tax collector for our taxes and yours."
