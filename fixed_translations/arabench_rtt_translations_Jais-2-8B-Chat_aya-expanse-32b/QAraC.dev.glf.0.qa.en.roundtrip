I say what you refuse to understand, hey! Saleh
environmental issues? Come on, open your eyes, open your mind, look around you, see what people are doing.
If my brother is blind.
And he does not seek to adorn and improve himself for those around him.
Come on! Saleh... Don't be stubborn.
No, no, no, no, I don't care what you say.
Walking in the street
And a few dates, two soaked dates.
And you are exhausted.
Are you eating or not?
No, I'm eating.
Tell me, did he agree to this?
Your husband is old, he can't accept this.
Enough of him.
Our lifetime opportunity, our cars are embarrassingly old.
Please try to talk to him.
These things are normal and expected.
Stupid! He has no confidence in himself.
Yeah, scared?
What really annoys me
Is this the one responsible for the budget?
What is this project that he is responsible for?
It's a big government burden.
Submerged underneath.
I have the right to take the money.
Are you going to another ministry?
Mom, how could you forget!
And the day in the garage.
It means I have to.
Consider me in!
It's not fair that I don't get anything from him.
Is anything wrong?
This means I'm still part of them.
We are all supposed to take.
This is a government project.
But your stupid son doesn't understand.
Brother
The good you do comes back to you.
This is a government project.
It's your turn.
Exactly like the others.
The fat carnival is ahead of you.
Take your share.
He only has one riyal in his pocket.
I heard him myself.
It is known that the government projects are...
And the third one was looted.
Son of Solm
Went to Souq Waqif
The bill is eighty-five riyals.
Equalized in the budget
One hundred and eighty riyals per piece.
They said they didn't do anything wrong.
He's bullying him.
Happy is he who tries.
Yeah, but I think he'll change his mind.
Inshallah! Oh my God!
He is the president and everything is in his hands...
Most importantly, don't forget about us.
We are your quarter.
We need to be together.
A project like this government initiative is an opportunity.
Sure, Oh! Ali
We can't do it without you.
Don't be afraid, oh! Ali.
And if God wills, everyone covered by the project.
Sure.
Yesterday, I was sitting and chatting with my friends.
From your side
We're not worried as long as you're members of the project committee.
I'm worried about Saleh, the project manager.
They say that
Don't be afraid, oh! Ali.
And tell your companions that they should not be anxious.
Really? Oh! Abu Fahd?
Oh, that's the best news.
Just oh! Ya Saud, don't forget.
No No
Oh God, let everything be fine.
Get this seller to agree first.
Taking care of him.
Do you think anyone would give me preference?
Possible?
And then, you're involved in the project because you work with me in the same department.
But the most important thing remains a secret between us.
And I found him in front of you serving meat and rice.
Sure, sure.
Careless
Network?
If you keep being so absent-minded,
Not good
What he's going to do won't work.
This question
We'd be happy to help.
How do we get our share?
"Or what's the matter?"
What shall we call it!
And some of us are not just takers.
Every participant is asking about their share.
Why not!
Don't be afraid, Saleh.
We're the ones who set the budget.
What do you think of the land he bought today?
Has he found it yet?
No one is buying it, and he can't afford to pay for it.
Where did you get this information?
He called me today.
Because my brother's phone was turned off.
I said, "What's wrong with you?"
Inform your brother.
That is because there is another Earth.
The one next to the land he bought yesterday.
Tawa muwaffiqin aysoona sayl.
If you don't mind, let him contact you to see if he still wants it. I'll pass it on to him.
He doesn't want to leave these amounts with us.
What about our money?
We count him among the participants.
Even if we weren't involved!
You're taking a big bite by yourself.
At least give your brother and mother a little.
I'm not coming to beg you.
We are partners in the project too, so we have the right to ask for our share.
Tell her, say it.
He was right when the sultan came and asked for his share from him, he responded.
I don't agree with him.
You need to give him a share of the project.
Phase one.
You are no less than anyone.
Project Committee Members
I heard his stories with them.
They leave their brother and friends to enter.
I know that government projects are free for everyone.
We don't just want a limited amount of money.
I'm from the capital.
His brother Sultan can attend committee meetings if he wants.
...as it appears that the members of the committee
Project budget
but we want to / but we like to
Thank you
Ah, Abu Saleh
My brother's wife is my sister-in-law.
You like it.
Benefit the project.
Let's remind ourselves.
We divided the work, right?
You, oh! Saleh
As the person in charge of cement, bricks, and concrete.
And from My Linh electricity, it's on him.
Hey! People!
Take your share.
I swear to God.
Sometimes I decide to take some money.
And I often say
Let me take a percentage.
No problem, Saleh, no problem.
Take what you want in any way you see fit.
The most important thing,
We are the same.
For this week.
Everyone decides how much money they want.
Alright, I understand.
And after a few days, they change their minds.
And add another fifty thousand?
Okay, but why is it like this, huh?
What do you think?
I agree.
Even the participants,
Focus on your looting job, ignore him.
There are also the orphans' funds.
No, no, no, or or or, and increase the budget.
Oh people, we want to have dinner.
Who does he think he is?
What's this! Your father's project!
Ah, he is a sultan.
Hey! My brother, hey! Sultan
It means he is participating.
Is this the last name?
Saud is your friend among many names.
He adds names and says, "Let's benefit from them."
So, if I want to see him, is it by appointment or by cash payment?
No, put it with the question marks.
How much do you give him? Give him twenty thousand riyals.
Yes, okay.
They're even putting a note here that says:
This is our neighbor.
Okay, Saud's list is longer than Abdulaziz's list.
All of this will be considered part of the first phase budget.
In this case, no one will notice.
Yes, here it is, here it is, and here is the list that my mother sent.
Every two hours, you call and add people without asking.
Hey, may she live long.
Oh light of my eye, my son.
Good health to you, she is sick and poor.
But the woman doesn't have money.
God bless you, I told you it's a gift for you.
This is a liver transplant operation.
Yow! What's wrong, wrong... What's enough for you?
Enough of the liver, housing, and hospital!
Around one hundred and eighty thousand riyals.
How many livers are you transplanting!
First of all, my dear sister, you are precious.
Yes, God bless you, put her name in the register.
Hassina, yes Hassina, the daughter of Hilal.
Give her some of your money!
Reassure him and tell him that I won't take anything from phase two.
Okay, one hundred and sixty thousand rials.
Wow, he got a new liver.
He said, "It's two thousand more." I want to buy gifts for my daughters.
Alvin
Write for me.
Yes, Hessa bint Hllal
Get lost from in front of my house!
No mother.
I have a lot of work.
Then, I'll call you later.
He who eats from youth will increase.
The infrastructure can handle the load.
Don't forget me.
Write the number you want.
I don't know.
It's up to you.
I am the chairman of the board.
And this good thing, I say you deserve a million.
The project will be completed tomorrow.
And they give us installments continuously.
Come on! We want to know!
They give us everything at once or in installments.
Why does she get more than us?
"Neither an electric shock nor looting, it doesn't matter, the most important thing is silence, we're waiting for them to come."
If you agree with him, be silent; if you disagree, be silent.
Nonsense
If I hear any of you speaking
I'm sorry, but your
We've kept them waiting too long.
You know this is about money, not a matter of right and wrong.
How long ago was it?
Fifty million
It's evident that you're taking a big bite.
You are a leader after all.
We don't need a head.
Let's agree on the budget.
Mr. Saleh, from your talk about the project, we noticed that it is a very important and spiritual one.
And it's not just for this generation.
Ah, ah
Tomorrow will mark the inauguration of the first phase of the project.
We would like to thank you for your presence and congratulations once again.
"I made it wider."
On this occasion
Video by the United Nations.
Where to? To the project.
Where are we now!
I don't know where we are.
I'm bored.
Don't you see the officials speaking and the people applauding them?
We're at the official opening, what's wrong with you?
Okay, now they are talking, that means we are in the project.
Yes, we are in the project.
And the people were astonished.
And these divisions, I don't know what they've put inside.
What's up, bro?
These partitions are the infrastructure.
The official opening of %pw for the official opening of International Beaches
What's wrong with the third thousand?
To be honest, I don't know.
Yes, praise be to God, pride is a disease. Shepherd: Yes, praise be to God, pride is a disease.
I wish I knew why they isolated me.
Qareeb is driving his car.
I found this visit strange.
But when she told me
No one told me anything.
I saw it myself, there's a big farm over there.
Alhamdulillah, you are comfortable.
The checks will reach you while you're comfortably at home.
Why are you tiring yourself out, oh! Dear, don't let anyone get into your head, Munira.
Oh my God, what luck! Mira, thank God you have brothers like Rashid, Saad, and Sakr.
He who is afraid of his arrow, let him leave it.
See my friend Hessa,
Her brothers don't give her a single riyal from her father's inheritance.
We don't do it this way.
This is your legitimate right.
This matter is about trust... Don't trust us!
I don't know.
I didn't feel satisfied with my brother Rashid's words.
He keeps reminding me about the check they give me every three months.
So I can get what's rightfully mine.
He always tells me.
Don't trust us.
Financial and inheritance matters need to be clear.
If you, my dear, are upset
Do you know anything about people?
And the peaceful doves are an example for you, the poor.
Who could believe that she inherited millions?
For her brothers' sake.
Money corrupts people.
But business is business and your legitimate right.
"And after that, what?"
And we run the company.
Investment in land, real estate, and money
No problems, no head.
She said she was passing through the land, in the wilderness.
This is very suitable for her.
She's afraid her husband Nasser is behind this.
What's the problem?
Your sister started spinning.
This is the problem.
She plans to get us into trouble.
As if we're the ones giving her money.
Calm down, Falcon.
We should find a solution to this matter, oh! Rashid
On my head
What is this?
My share of my parents' inheritance.
The allowance they give me every three months. The allowance they give me every three months.
Everything is clear.
Forty thousand, no more.
As if they aren't investing the money.
I testify, I testify, I testify, I testify
Clear
Clear.
They said, "Give her more so she feels happy and stops asking."
Correct, everything you said was right.
They give it to me little by little.
If only I could see their campus.
There are many different diamond cuts.
"And I don't have even half of what they have."
They don't think I deserve my father's inheritance.
If you asked about her.
This is your right.
Legal and legitimate right
I feel like they're stealing and throwing things at me.
I'm not comfortable with their style.
The world gives no promises! Oh, my eyes!
They exhaust me, they make me sick! Oh, my love!
I'm unaware that there is an account and punishment.
And that God will punish them for taking others' property by force.
My dear, be careful and don't mention anything about the court to them.
They will be happy.
Is it due to our overpopulation?
That's why I'm telling you, oh! My dear.
Calmness
Everyone has an apartment like Maicon's tower.
My right and nothing else
My father wanted to build a mosque before he died.
...and give Zakat to the poor, and to the needy, and to those who collect it.
Mother of Salmeen
Calm down, dear!
And don't mention anything to them about the court.
"Or what you see."
Know why!
This moment
Her rights are being violated.
You were asking about accounting.
Who are you!! To ask him that.
Push them!
I am here for your sister.
The door through which I entered.
"Matbuj" is
Do you know the door you entered from?
What happens
No falcon.
That's unfortunate, Saad.
Mauner, don't stick your nose where it doesn't belong.
If you want your share of the company and properties, we have no objection.
Seven hundred thousand
She was content her whole life.
I'm sure it's her malicious husband.
She is kind.
As if I'm the one who's suffering because of them.
This is a well-known and criminalized legal provision. Explanation: Th
He tells me, "Either you take six hundred thousand, or nothing."
Not good
Expect anything Oh! Munira
"Shared parenthood"
Eight buildings
Without mentioning lands and houses
He says six hundred thousand, only.
I am signing a waiver of rights document.
No oh! Mineira
Don't let anyone deceive you and sign the paper. Be careful, I'm warning you.
It's your right to know everything about the lands, the money, and everything, it's not their right.
. . . but the company,
You are a partner.
They just fired you from the company.
No one can stop me.
Why?
It's my father's company.
What's shown is screaming.
Let me in, I'll tell you.
Leave it, it's useless.
He has a paper, I don't know what it is.
He's shouting at us, let him be quiet.
We're sorry.
My brother Saad went to the office and explained to them, they don't know.
Come in.
Check if Mr. Nasser wants something to drink or not.
Please go ahead.
Sure! Sure!
Entangling us
He discovers how old she is.
He'll discover that we have four hundred thousand, not forty thousand.
Let's do the calculation for her.
In sixty-six months
Prefer the required number, three hundred and sixty times the original number.
Eleven million, five hundred twenty thousand.
Okay, then what?
Let him do what he can do.
Regarding his saying it to him frankly.
It's our money.
Everyone who inherited inherited the same thing.
Welcome to your company, don't worry about what happened.
May God bless you.
Here is the accountant, Samir.
Answers any questions Mr. Nasser wants to know.
The whole company is under your command.
If you want to come in, please do, don't ask for permission.
Thank you
Rely on me.
Go to him, take his face.
Let him see all the files.
You should take more than ten million.
They didn't even mention it.
Ya Makyweh used to say
Her father traveled.
Four buildings,
I expected them to have three lands.
Every land is larger than the second one.
"Allah sustains us from all things, and He is the best Disposer of affairs, O my son."
It's not fair what they're doing.
Don't leave them alone.
What can I do, Umm Salmeem?
I have to sue them; there's no other option.
He'll just see how many papers there are.
The case was adjourned.
Pay attention, Yay! Nasser
Don't trust anything about the court.
Oh! Madam, you are here and the doctor is looking for you.
Wake up, Umm Salmin.
Clean your room.
All the Muslim patients
He didn't tell me anything.
Sorry, who's speaking?
Oh, now I remember you, yeah, I remember you.
AAAH
Why, my friend!
No problem, thank you.
Now that he knows we have money, he's flying high with enthusiasm.
You think this is Abdullah, the one he sold to them, can?
Who is Rashid's closest friend?
He knows him well, for years.
Can you trust Mona?
Even Abdullah gave me some advice.
"Lacking them" / "Lacking in them"
Don't leave them alone.
Try to take as much as you can from them.
Do you know what Abdullah is doing to me?
It's not right for people to live seventy or eighty years.
For people who will live for at least two hundred years.
O Mother of Salmin, may God have mercy on her.
May God have mercy on her, she used to say.
The number we have does not reach four hundred thousand.
And the case takes ten years or even more.
Does it mean they have to *deceive* us to consult the court?
This is it.
Oh, darling, sitting with them.
Better luck next time.
By the way, he's an old friend.
Life is short.
And I strive for your benefit.
And you come from a large and well-known family.
And abundant in roots.
Oh Rashid! We are friends.
Go ahead, I'm still calm.
Or you'll get a beating.
Go away, forget about the friend.
Are you going to leave or what?
I paid a hundred million for a night with thousands on a diamond for a jewelry set from the Jewelry Exhibition.
Where did you get all this money from?
He spends money on his wives.
And they give their sisters from her money.
I'm afraid hope will fade away, Nasser.
They conspired against you.
When I spoke to him yesterday at the mosque.
Listen, boy, just do as I told you.
How happy and excited we are!
Possible, why not?
Okay, I also suggest
May God bless these words from these beautiful faces.
Oh Lord, enlighten our hearts with that which is good for us in this life and the hereafter.
You, listen
If you have something to say, except for the issue of my sister's share.
Correct
It's better to go or you'll get beaten.
What matters to me is what you say.
I begged you for months, and you refused.
I don't have to explain.
Tomorrow morning I'll go.
Give it to me.
Hello, hello.
Don't listen to her.
She went to the court.
After tomorrow
I'll give you a chance to see what you do.
Goodbye
The beating they received was useless.
And they felt that their reputation was at risk.
We'll see what they decide.
Saud, are you busy tomorrow?
She decided to take legal action against them.
I asked her to postpone it until tomorrow so we can go to her tomorrow.
What is this?
Your words are correct.
Why did you salute him?
You want to go to court and sue us.
To get your share of the inheritance.
Yes, she did.
I hope you are well.
May you be safe / May you be safe (feminine)
Why, I told you we want to go the day after tomorrow.
When you get there, first park your car in the parking lot.
You see the security guards.
You go to the eighth floor.
Judges in this role
Business cards of all the lawyers in the country
I guarantee you'll need them.
Hani is welcome to mock us.
We've been served with a legal notice.
Go to court.
Listen to the *manoor*.
And we have a waiver of the document.
Oh, how beautiful!
Learn the way.
We have shown you the way.
Come on, brother.
I forgot to give Mira something important.
This is Al Raya daily newspaper.
In an article this long
"Her writing is elegant, I expect her to be a doctor."
Go ahead, it's a gift from me to you.
His living conditions need to change.
Alas!
He has four children, but his home is unhappy.
Surely he will be, at the risk of all his wealth.
Invest in this project.
The one I never expected to start a business is Bu Waleed.
Cooli cooli, the new merchant's sons, Bou and Walid
My life, shall I get you something to eat?
No, I'm fine.
Sit down and relax, get yourself some fruits.
Mom, I want Hamad's toy.
Lazybones, lazybones
My son, Walid, give your uncle some sweets.
Congratulations on the project, Abu Waleed! You deserve it.
My tribe found me a good lawyer.
Good health to you, my son.
Dad, if we become big merchants, I want to have my own room.
I see what you're doing, he has no ambition, my son, my dear.
Okay, I'll get you a large-sized BlackBerry.
Forget about her now, what do you want with her?
Milio is like everyone else.
Your pathetic little house
First, let's pay off all our debts. Then we'll see.
You look very happy, Abu Waleed.
He eats more than before.
He is a merchant. Our luck, we explained: This.
"O Mir, merchant of my father, shave my entire head."
God bless the project.
Save some for my friends.
God willing, God bless you.
I met a Japanese person, I was with them.
While we were sitting, I switched places with him, and he gave me a gift catalog.
Then, one of my friends saw it.
He said, "This is an opportunity."
Multi-purpose halls?
"I'm always dealing with this stuff."
It's a computer hall.
Press the cinema.
Pay weekly.
This is magic.
They were impressed, they all said yes.
I took a loan from the bank, something from my relatives, sold something of my property, praise be to God.
Now that the committee has approved,
Why didn't you ask him when the ministry approved it?
And then he sends an email to the factory.
He'll talk to you when he arrives.
Sweet tea
None, I'm still waiting at Ali's office.
The secretary didn't call, brother.
And he's been out for ten days.
Oh, how sweet / Oh, how sweet she is
The paper is blank.
And the committee approved it.
Why don't you sign it?
Are you a fully authorized manager?
Why don't you go with him to sign for your package?
I told you he can't.
Not just him, all the staff there do the same thing.
Sometimes the apparent can be deceiving.
You deserve thanks to God.
I was there trying to get the signature, and I was anxious.
Will I finish?
And how do I send it now since Fahad doesn't show up?
What can I do?
Behind his back, I'm losing my money.
I'll let him talk to me as soon as possible so we can finish. I don't know what to do.
I'm afraid the manager will ask you about me.
Tell him I'm sick, anything.
I myself am waiting.
You're saying that while you were his secretary, what about our situation?
"And put your phone number."
Until my beard is white, drop by drop, until my beard is white, drop by drop,
You call, scare people, they think it's the secretary.
No, we're still waiting for Abu Fahad.
My money that I use to fix the toilet.
Expensive
Oh people, here, here
Hadia, Hadia,
He told you to be quiet, enough, silence.
Bu Fahad had to go to the airport.
How did he leave?
Let's see him at the garage before he leaves.
What's his problem?
God helps you.
Wait for Bu Fahad.
Don't blame your father, oh! My dear
He's just doing something strange.
And when he receives the goods,
He doesn't get his money back.
And now she needs him.
Where is he now?
What are you looking for?
Here, in front of you.
You're calling me in the middle of the night.
Brother, I told you.
I told you.
It's out of my hands, my daughter.
I know, but it's not fair.
The class starts next week at the university.
And if I don't register, they will pile up the courses on me for the next semester.
Three months will be wasted.
Oh! My darling, I'm trying.
Don't you see me going to the ministry every day?
Okay, then Bu Fahad will come, Bu Fahad.
And I'll be sitting at home.
Don't you understand?
Don't give me a speaker at lunchtime.
This is the fourth time you've called me.
Are you stupid?
I know you want the money.
But, God willing, Abu Fahad might sign the papers this week.
And they give him the first installment.
I don't know what to tell you, my sister.
Judge: **He is guilty of the crime.**
He sleeps, walks, and talks to himself all night long.
If it weren't for Fahd's fall,
God bless him.
For that,
Bu Fahad needs to sign this certificate this week.
What is he waiting for?
He always receives it once.
And you travel for a year.
... and neglecting the welfare of the people ...
Oh oh oh oh oh, why like this?
Is everything okay now?
Fracture
This strange hallucination is pulling me, pulling it.
What does he want?
I heard I'm going to the ministry.
To prepare my documents.
He told the employees that he would take care of me.
The time period is about to end.
Give me the phone, give me the phone.
Buraida's secretary
I'd like to tell you that...
Bu Fahad is leaving tomorrow, for sure.
I'll try to call you.
Type directly
Good B
You were never that kind of person.
"I'm talking to you."
And your eyes on your phone screen
I said something unfortunate.
To feel responsible
"...and if you commit yourself"
I'll send you back to your department.
Fifteen cardboard boxes
Fifteen boxes of printer paper
Oh, what a pity!
The manager punishes him.
By bringing him with us
Have you heard about the factory?
He'll lose his money if they don't sign his papers today.
If he goes and tells the manager.
Oh, please let me know.
What if the manager asks about him?
We'll manage, just let him go.
Bu Waleed
I'm leaving, but I'm happy with the phone.
Cool
God bless him.
Wait, people, wait.
How do I know where he's going?
Wait for Bu Fahad
Do not move.
Don't sit.
Wait for Bu Fahad
Don't go to work.
Wait for Bu Fahad.
Wait for Bu Fahad
Wait for Bu Fahad
Let's go look for him in Uzbekistan.
Room by room
Alley after alley
**T
Call the hospital, quickly.
Don't call the hospital.
Wait for Bu Fahad
I have spent my entire life as a messenger, for many years, until today.
"Oh, it's been so long! Oh, Abu Saeed!"
What were you thinking?
Around 16 years old
As a messenger
So many heads
And sweat without air conditioning in the past years.
Did you used to find riding a bike easy?
With a yellow sign.
Oh my, Abu Saeed, it was a very tough time.
Grief, my son.
And what can we do, son of Adam?
Bu Saad
Okay, sorry guys, the manager arrived as he said. Let's go finish our work.
The manager has arrived. Oh! Great, let's go.
Congratulations, Bou Said.
"It was the first time, Khalid, that I had ever seen him angry."
What did I tell you?
I told you, if God wills.
O bathroom thief
I told you when my last child graduated, I'd quit.
Graduated, and a job he got.
Alhamdulillah, tomorrow I will finish my work.
The service was provided correctly.
God bless you.
Change your mind, oh! Bou Said
And you'll deserve it.
Thank you very much, A.A.B.
Thank you, brother Bouabdellaziz.
My eye
We did the homework well.
Let them finish the journey.
This is your right.
After all this time and work
Everything goes both ways.
The rest is necessary, oh! Happy New Year!
After he leaves here, my wife is determined.
Successful in occupations
A coffee pot and some dates, oh my!
When will we finish, my son?
You're in a hurry with seven errands, oh! Bou Saada
Don't worry.
Ready-made carpet
I'm coming, for sure, goodbye.
I told you the caviar is ready, waiting for me.
In short, I'll give you all his answers now.
A good opportunity for you to introduce him today.
He told me that their manager was traveling.
Mo Joy
I don't even want to investigate.
Pass it on to someone else.
Now, you are officially free.
Thank you
Now, you are free to rest.
"Thank you very much, oh! Abu Abdulaziz, goodbye."
Congratulations to me!
Don't worry.
That means you're free, boy.
"At your service, father."
What are human resources?
Thank you, goodbye.
Zahro is throwing a party to celebrate her son's success in the exams.
She brings a cake.
I can't.
I originally asked my father to bring me a few documents to finalize.
Zahara is feeling confused.
Alright, Mother.
The father left the workplace.
God damn it now.
Work enough, let him rest.
Let him rest.
Ask me to cook some of the khunafrash.
I prepared it.
And I carried him...
Fear God and have mercy on your father.
Your turn now.
He will eat it tomorrow.
He wants to rest.
I'm tired, old man.
As soon as he returned,
I was tired.
Don't make me sing in front of them.
Don't make me sing in front of them.
I was going to pick up these bank papers on my way home from work.
He said he punishes anyone who's late.
Sure, my love.
Head to your shift.
With this nose, and those small Chinese eyes, goodbye.
Bu Sa'id
It takes you every day to the place.
As you wish, Mother of Saeed.
It smells.
This is inside my nose.
Khanafresh Khanafresh
Why did you go to the central bank?
Oh boy, she wants to go to the market branch.
And don't go there.
Are you sure? I don't want to go there and they tell me it's not here.
Okay, bye.
I'm tired of the sun.
The sun hit.
I entered our neighbor's house.
The maid recognized me.
She asked me what was going on.
What compels you to do this?
No, Mother Saeed, I can't eat beetles now.
Mom, where's Dad?
I am among those who return and those who rejoice.
What did the bank she goes to tell him?
They told him that there were missing papers.
She asked him to take a taxi.
Mom, we met with the director.
How's your father now? Is he feeling better?
I dozed off a bit, the headache is gone now.
I tell you in front of him.
Leave your father alone, let him rest.
Their children are miserable, Mother of Saeed.
What are they required to do in their jobs, how will they be evaluated, and what can they do?
As you like it
Bo Shahin
You could say I've retired, but I haven't retired.
How do you mean?
Before, time
My fate is written on my forehead.
Your children are grown up.
I need to help them.
They were asking me.
It contradicts the truth.
Do all the young people without a penis fail to accomplish their personal tasks?
Alaa according to the job
In some jobs, they allow you to go and finish your personal work.
May Allah reward you with good.
I'm close to you, the cafe behind your back.
Where are you going, oh! Bo Shahin?
I'm going to finish a few papers for my son, Saeed.
In this ministry, next to this coffee.
Taking them to the land offices
Goodbye
"Was it fun? Okay, I'll see you later, bye."
This won't do anything for you.
I am your enemy.
I heard you say that to Saeed.
Your father is sick.
He doesn't care about you.
If your father didn't complain.
He is silent.
And that's what he needs.
I'm tired of him, fear God.
Your loud screaming in the middle of the night woke me up.
Dad, I was a government employee, and you know very well what stockings mean.
And they write it first thing.
And now they are %pw, they do this too.
Tomorrow is the last day for loan repayment at the Development Bank.
No, no, who said that?
All right, my son.
I believed a lie.
He says he has an inventory committee tomorrow.
Ew, gross!
Sure, whatever suits you.
Go easy so you can finish your work.
None, none
He has been silent since he returned home.
What comes back to me.
I couldn't find any excuse.
I don't blame your father for being upset with you.
If you agree on this **Are you okay with this?**
"Many thanks to you, and may we be rewarded together."
He should've called you.
Why does he call me his servant?
You're the biggest monster to us, dad!
I am grateful to you.
Please forgive him.
Let it be a punishment for him.
And from today onwards, oh! Boy.
"And be content and at peace."
"Sell me a balloon (singing)"
Thank you, ... Shukran, ...
Your wish, my father!
May God reward you with good.
We have decided, God willing, from today onwards...
We're doing our paperwork ourselves.
May God give you all good health, may He reward you with good, thank God.
For your sake, dad!
Tighten it, this is the last one.
but I can't
Call me now.
Dad, I'm not going to the meeting. I hate going to meet the minister.
The minister is upset with you.
No, no, no, this can't happen. The minister can't get angry. You have to leave, even before him.
I'm going right, what should I say, I don't want to bother you.
You can't say that.
Your paper is with me, and as for the valley, it has become mine.
On your way, finish Saeed's papers.
O my father!
Consider it the last straw.
Ana mabsoot eni fi khedmetak, oh! baba. I am happy to be in your service, oh! father.
But your son should sign this paper.
I have to give it back to you tomorrow.
I advise you to get it by noon today.
Even if they didn't see the newspapers.
You need to wait two months.
I don't want you to give it to me so that he can sign it and I'll give it back to you.
What he needs, no, no, no
Call him and tell him to come over in just two minutes.
Tendril
Do you know Saeed?
No, he's on vacation.
And after the sun set, he returned.
All my friends are there.
So every time I talk to someone and ask them, "Where have you been?"
He answers that he and Saeed are coming.
I'm waiting until the working hours are over.
Present, my man.
Why did you come to finish your paperwork yourself?
Why don't you teach your children?
And you have no children.
Are you okay, brother?
Brother, take them, my lord.
Many thanks
This is
Please leave me alone.
And go to the seniors' wardrobe.
I don't want to tell them where I'm going.
What are you going to tell them, Abu Saeed?
I'm writing something else.
Yes, praise be to God.
He came down from the wadi yesterday.
It's not mine, sister.
Why are you exhausting yourself?
I told him he'd never appear on TV or radio.
These talks of "stopping corruption" got us into trouble.
May God guide him to the straight path.
Okay, bye, take care.
Go to prison?
Tony's coming / You're coming
Ugh, I can't tell you.
Call the program that is named Maylas, I think.
"Qali al-Saeh" does not translate
Khaled Jassem
He told him to stop the corruption.
His colleagues heard.
He began to talk about the government.
Even oil, even money.
I don't know what happened to him.
Not one of his friends.
Those who encouraged him to do that,
Leave him.
May God show him the right path.
Please now, only because I have to go cook.
Welcome anytime, God bless you.
Come on, son.
Stay here.
Stop corruption, my son.
Tired and fed up with this.
In the hospital for two days.
You don't deserve this, Mother.
Sorry, I know this happened.
I told you about this.
What is it, Mom?
And he shouted.
This engagement
God willed your survival this time.
I am your advisor.
Don't be afraid, my mother.
Let's not talk about it.
Stop corruption.
Why did the manager fire him?
That's unfortunate, after all these years, you're firing me.
What are you hearing?
Stop corruption.
Again, please.
Hello
You are a reasonable man.
Those who engage with public affairs, criticize.
Dawn
We just sent a little bit.
And you are included among them.
Nothing personal.
OK, goodbye.
My brother Saleh
I hope your uncle, Abu Munira, didn't find out that
He's really mad at you.
Who are they to know?
If he asks you
Tell him I'm working.
I told you they were going to fire him, didn't I?
I asked his mother and she said he's still working.
Bravo
My mother has to say today.
What's his condition now? What should we do with him?
We can't let our daughter suffer with him.
Whatever you see.
In two weeks.
"If he doesn't find a job, I'll take him to court to get my daughter divorced."
Drink your coffee.
They only hover around you when they have something on their mind.
"From the outset"
Let's go up.
You are suspended.
I know you're dying to...
Walk to the café.
So you can speak crap.
Go to your room and sleep.
And tomorrow morning, look for a job.
If God wills, I will get up in the morning.
Mom, I told you I quit this habit.
I swear by God.
Mom, to be honest, I'm feeling a bit bored.
Or else stay away from his money.
Act like a deaf person.
Changed
What's going on, man? Where's your voice? Why aren't you speaking like before?
We want to hear a little about your efforts in stopping corruption.
Stop corruption.
Stop corruption.
Not available, Saleh!
He's surely sleeping.
Did my son do something wrong?
This is all we saw in the shop.
How did he say?
Confirmed as correct
Because there were a lot of people around him.
Call him.
Don't waste your time.
If I see you here, I'll cut off your leg.
If it was your mistake,
It's not my fault that he didn't stop.
I know you well.
You're like someone who has just quit smoking.
Whether you speak or not, it's time to stop the corruption and the nonsense, or let it continue.
I warn you.
If I heard you speaking on a radio program.
"The righteous put an end to corruption."
Mr. Saleh, you are a good citizen, you have a very high sense of patriotism.
I can't help you.
What can I do?
We allowed you / Go ahead.
Hello Saleh, how are you?
I hope your head isn't bothering you with the noise, we understand.
Not up to you.
I want to hear it every day, Stop corruption.
You are a very brave man, you're not afraid of anything.
I wish you'd say that, just once.
Blessings of Allah upon you, O
"A cigarette? Just say 'stop corruption,' please."
He's begging you, just once, come to him.
This is amazing.
Now, my dear
About the job.
You are a loyal citizen, and very dear to us.
I'll call you to let you know.
He was making a scene about you in public.
Are you important?
Everyone said there were no vacancies.
They were honest and wanted to hire me, but there were no vacancies.
And from time to time, from time to time, from time to time, from time to time, from time to time, from time to time, from time to time, from time to time, from time to time, from time to time, from time to time.
And we won't forget you.
And she has four children.
May God make it easy for you.
What despairs.
Don't lose hope.
Don't stop.
You need to look for a job every day.
So my father won't get upset.
Wholeheartedly I accept any job.
I won't give orders to corrupt again.
Stop corruption.
Do you know what he's up to these days?
I told you.
Just you, you never listen to me.
May God guide you.
I can't go to the minister and tell him about this man's actions.
The minister is thinking.
He surely thinks about her this way.
Your words are correct.
Just, a serious matter.
We need to do something.
They say it'll make your eyes pop, you know an rumor like this is strong.
Oh God, I'm trying to find a way to stop him.
I don't want anyone to feel like I'm falling behind or lagging on the matter.
I agree with you.
What do you think about him?
The only way to keep him from influencing our interests.
Have you heard about Saleh? He stopped these shenanigans.
He lives in my neighborhood.
He's the one who's in charge of that.
We need your voice.
No good.
I am one of your biggest fans.
Salih is a brave man.
Where is hope soon?
He'll be back, and we'll enjoy hearing his voice.
Bu Fahd himself asks about you.
Cool it, Saleh.
Why did you resign?
I had some issues, some health and psychological problems.
Frankly,
You are cunning.
Oh long-absent one, we haven't heard from you.
How are you, my dear Saleh, please?
Just once, do it for me.
I want you to make me enthusiastic about it.
Salih says he agrees.
No, people, the situation is very difficult.
Network?
The man is begging you.
Abdulrahman, I was originally resigned.
You didn't tell us you were looking for a job?
OK, this is your chance.
Encourage him and make him hear your voice, and go ask him about a job from the next day.
Surely coming.
I want you to benefit.
"Know and do"
Forget about it and go home.
No, no, no, we don't want your help anymore.
Okay, bro, wait up, let's discuss the matter.
No, we don't want to.
Okay okay
Okay, if I spoke for the last time now, I would retire, but I'll do it one last time.
What did Fahd want to hear?
What's the biggest problem bothering you? You know there are many problems here, a lot, a lot.
What does he like to listen to? Not the riot, I don't know, tell me the explanation.
According to the contract that was concluded.
Use his authority.
10.8 = 10.8 meters
Ruins
Don't interrupt me.
Why did the employee do that?
Where is the seventh edition of the spectrum? The seventh spectrum.
Don't interrupt me.
Seventh, number, minister
Why the employee?
When the ministry moved to its new headquarters.
Take your brother's car.
People, stop corruption.
Since you're back, we want you to stay in touch with the program.
I'm at a dear friend's place, meaning, this is the last time.
For indeed, I had retired.
Mom, you didn't tell me that he was the one who resigned, and that you stood up to him?
What's up, my daughter?
What's up, my daughter?
The man who is called the corruption stopper, spoke about him on the radio.
I didn't know about it, but some people told me that...
God willing, someone from the ministry will leak it.
He called him.
It is empty.
Alright, Minister
Don't worry.
The whole day is dedicated to serving the ministry, God bless you.
Heard?
I said yes just for you.
Dry my face.
You didn't talk to me.
Abdulrahman told me he is proposing to me.
You didn't talk to me.
Oh my, Saleh, you're so poor.
I feel sorry for you.
I am Bu Fahd's secretary.
And I know the problem.
They exploit you to achieve their goals.
And unfortunately, they reached it.
Do you know who arranged all of this?
Your neighbor, Abdurrahman
He was behind all that.
Bu Fahad will never employ you.
You're doing the same thing to him.
As long as you're known.
No one will hire you.
I'll take you to court tomorrow so we can get divorced.
I found a solution.
We are the best community in the world.
Free of any problems
No, we're not.
We never have problems.
We are satisfied.
What is love?
Everyone is standing in line.
For this system
Gives him more rights than a foreigner.
We rely on foreigners.
We don't have
Your hard work and dedication make you the best. We don't have any problems.
Or an important officer
And he expelled you.
We don't have any of this here.
With my best regards
Saleh Rashid Saad Rashid Al-Bahahiry
Confronting corruption
I didn't want to have dinner.
I ran, and Shoul pulled my shirt and hit me.
He's jealous because you're wearing a new shirt.
He saw Walid wearing the shirt that we bought from the mall.
He pulled it jealously and tore it.
He is kind-hearted, he can't bear to scold.
I think
"O Lord, I saw my son was handsome and became jealous of him."
It's not up to him.
Why did you take off Walid's shirt?
I saw him wearing a new dishdasha and I became jealous. Ask your father to buy you a new one.
What do you say about yourself?
Why did you throw away Dad's shirt?
I'm telling you.
You scare me.
Sultan, my friend
Why don't you slap him in the face and disfigure him?
He's a little kid, not your age, be ashamed a little.
Is this a boy?
Yes, indeed, boy.
People need to raise and fix it.
Not just that.
Be careful with your words, Sultan.
You think I'm a child, because of my upbringing.
Do you see yourself?
Raise your children properly.
And you can't do this.
I respect him.
I don't want to upset him in front of his wife.
and the brothers
If Lou Ald hits Waleed again,
With consequences
I'm the one wasting my time arguing with you.
Act correctly.
Let me go and show her.
Argue with fools.
Where have the days gone?
The intentions were clear.
Excuse us
Do you have a larger one than this?
No one, no one, this is the biggest thing.
How and water
Come and see the mess we're in.
Oh, my dear, tell me what happened.
Brother Ahmed, please, I need to go home. There's an emergency and I have to leave.
Ald's pants are lost.
One who is jealous and choked with hatred.
Sultan
And how can a child finish all these clothes?
. . . God is sufficient, I didn't use them, God is sufficient.
Buried
"Make up your mind, listen to me."
If I go and confront him, he won't admit it. He won't say that the child is his.
How are you, what's up?
Walid, do you know how to ride a bike?
What do I know?
Walid, my soul.
Yes, I'm telling the truth.
Just to tell you.
Where did you put the scissors, my dear?
That's right.
He destroyed it, may his lord afflict his life.
But I'll make him see.
My silence will be.
Insane, crazy
Until now
And who else?
But the computer is something else, I'll show him.
My silence will be.
Do you think our son Adel is the one who broke their device?
"Let him come, let's see who's behind this."
Don't do it.
Go and tell stories to someone other than me, maybe your friends are not me.
I told you this is Advil.
He pointed at someone else, oh! Panthers, not me.
Live, come please.
Our hearts and souls are pure.
The intentions were clear.
Is there a lot of sea?
I'm going to look for a husband.
"To laugh at, not me, Oh! Sultano"
Fabricate charges against me.
Hold the scissors.
Act your age.
Hello, Abdel Rahman, come quickly, oh my son!
Please go see your brother, Fahad and Sultan.
Every day they fight, oh! My sons.
I don't know.
In this meeting,
Answers in English: fulfills, meets, satisfies
Think fairly about our sciences.
And the deeds of those before us.
We see it.
It will be a lesson for us.
We need to learn from them.
You're not acting like kids.
As big as a camel.
Do you have any children?
With zero knowledge
You are his role model, not them.
His role model is his father.
You, oh! My sultan
And you, oh! Fahd
And I am your older brother.
The translation
I want to pay for the computer.
I held his hand.
You forgive each other.
No, I only greeted him to escape.
From Abdulrahman's endless tales
Where are you going?
I swear I won't let him go.
Did you make this tea?
Get lost, don't hide.
Open the door, if you're a man.
Didn't I say that Abdurrahman mediated between you and him?
Well, by God, if he doesn't calm down, I'll destroy his room.
Your brother
hash
Your brother is crazy.
In Arabic, "بأوريه، امسك الشاي" translates to "Show him, hold the tea."
On his head
Skate, skate, stop her! Oh! You kids, they have no shame, they're hitting each other.
You're acting like little children, stop it, oh! My son.
By God, I will show you.
Hit, hit, oh! Boy or big boom
Blood, mother!
You scared me with your screaming.
Oh God
Leave us alone.
Something unfortunate
Even though I reconciled you with each other.
It never leaves you.
When he came at night to reconcile them
He didn't have time, oh! My daughter.
Oh, what a pity!
Inshallah
He speaks eloquently.
Sorry, ladies!
May God guide you.
Calm them down.
Don't incite them to fight each other, girls!
What happened? I hope it's good.
You criticized me, oh Abdulrahman!
This is what we expect from you, we want you to help, not act like him.
You are the wise brother, my son. May God guide you.
Two hits in a row.
Farid the boss
You're hurting us, may God guide you.
Our neighbor Saeed is laughing at you.
Hey! Officer, we told him a lot.
Don't believe him, officer.
They were throwing stones, all three of them together.
Please
Don't do it.
Believe me, officer, I saw him from the window.
Did you hear anything from him?
Means very far away.
My brother was right when he said he was strong.
Unfortunately, you can't guarantee that the kids won't go back to their old ways.
Thank you, thank you
May God bless you, my brother, may God bless you.
Officer, how are you releasing them, I'm sure, believe me.
Listen to me.
You shouldn't say that in their presence.
Abdulrahman, the eldest brother
He is the assistant undersecretary.
The second one is the head of a public body.
Take two Panadol tablets and rest.
Panadol! Officer.
Do you have two Panadol tablets here?
God is enough for the enemy.
God is enough for the enemy.
By God, you are enough to tire the enemy.
What is this? * What is the percentage?
Kids were throwing to that distance!
This is the hand of an adult, it looks like his father's hand.
Endure with you.
He comes from a respectable family, he's kind and calm.
And this is because I come from a poor family.
So what (As if, who cares)
Necessity / Need
He never takes his eyes off you.
He hehehe he hehehe
And you say you didn't find the opportunity.
When you passed by, she smiled. What does that mean?
Coincidence, you think!
You spun your head, and she spun hers, at the same moment.
No, but there must be something.
I notice when you enter.
You feel she's happy, genuinely.
Go ask her for a pen.
Give her your notebook.
I don't know her name, can you believe it?
Romantic, more than it should be.
Dude, we're in the 21st century.
He's really, truly, sincerely missing her.
Speak with absolute candor.
He gave it to me as a gift.
No, this is the good news.
From now on, I'll have more time to spend with you.
But you need to go rest now.
Especially after the outdoor shooting rehearsal.
We're tired, long hours, I told the secretary I don't want any press or TV interviews, and no contracts.
I want to go home and be with my family.
God be with you.
Even when you're busy,
The first thing that came to my mind
I have the owner's number, I'll call him today.
Late for what?
The villa is sold now, and the buyers moved in a few days ago.
I was busy with the series and filming.
Umm Abdul Aziz says they are poor and *
This is what Allah has decreed for them, and we cannot change it.
Good morning, Uncle.
What's the matter?
This car, my son, stops every few minutes.
Yabbah, it's the butcher.
No problem, don't worry, I have a charger and I'll charge it for you.
May Allah reward you with good.
Now the uncle.
Peace be upon you
Walid is right.
Alright, from tomorrow, I'll start looking for a villa nearby so I can visit you every day.
What do you want now?
Present, okay guys.
Take it.
What's your full name?
Rashed Abdullah
"The Soul of the Name?"
I said that word to your father.
Your mother is right.
I was so happy when I found out that Rachid Abdellah, my favorite actor, is our neighbor.
Everyone loves him.
They say he is kind and modest.
The neighbor comes before the house.
I want to take a picture with my father.
So that my colleagues believe me.
I couldn't believe our house was next to the actor's, Rashid Abdullah's house.
Talk to him so he believes.
Oh life
What we're used to seeing on TV.
And hopefully we'll see him.
Our neighbor became a doctor, praise be to God. Thank you! Oh, praise be to God.
If they need a sailboat, I have one.
Okay, I'm ready to help, but oh! Guys, go easy on me, I'm still not fully adjusted.
I heard about him.
That was very kind of him, may God reward him well.
Peace be upon you
This thing, it has been confirmed that some employees are moving to the new branch of the ministry, in Dakhla.
They told you who's going?
I didn't hear the names.
Okay, what I heard and am sure of.
This is Bou Ali and he's with them.
!My name
We just don't know exactly who we're rescuing.
I can't go, God bless you, the smoke is too far away from me, I can't.
Are you in or out, this is business, man.
The committee is still studying the subject.
"If only they had chosen you."
Thank you for the visit, oh! Abu Walid, please come in.
Good health to you, good health to you, Abu Ali.
You're welcome, the furniture has become old.
We are neighbours today.
We are like breath.
These are not welcome, oh Abu Waleed.
Good health to you, Abu Waleed.
I've heard a lot about your kindness.
God bless that love.
Enough, oh! My daughter
I'm ready to go to the market for you until you find the sweetest and most valuable furniture that suits your taste.
When? / Where? / Who? (Franckly, our furniture is very old) -> Frankly, our furniture is very old.
We need to change it.
Inshallah
I've told you this before.
If you need anything
Consider me like your sister.
O Lord, don't make me cry over you (a popular proverb).
Where did you go, my son?
I forgot to scold her when she called me yesterday.
Not because it's your tiredness.
Oh, okay.
I'll talk to you later, goodbye.
In fact, I was talking to her.
These people are different from us.
They are rich, we are not even close.
Don't be afraid, my mother.
Just a little bit...
Just a little bit...
And I'll give you the green light to propose to her on my behalf.
I told you.
No, Mother, there's no need.
"You come to me and ask for my suggestion."
I put the dinner in the living room.
If you want to have dinner.
The driver is taking her to university now, God willing.
We agreed that we're family, right?
Whose car is this, then?
And soon, God willing.
I called to thank her.
Good is in people, and love is in doing good.
Oh yes, yes! Yay!
Even our relatives don't do this to us.
Sure! Is my name on the list?
Are you sure?
Oh brother, what's this problem? Why are we followed by problems?
I don't know, I'm confused now, after hearing this news, what are we going to do, I don't know.
Oh my God, oh God, oh God, come on now, okay, okay, thank you, may God reward you well, may God reward you well.
What happened, oh! Abu Ali
The committee met today.
And a list of the names of the people who will be transferred to Dukhan.
My name is listed.
Talk to the manager to get your name registered.
I don't think it will be useful, oh! Oh, Mother Ali, I don't think it will be useful.
I spoke to him, he said it's impossible.
Famous actor
Forget your name, it's not on the list.
Good health to you, many thanks, oh! Abu Salem
If you don't mind.
I'd like to take a picture with you to show my son.
My children will be happy.
God bless them.
Can you take a picture with Joel, the actor?
May Allah compensate you.
Please, go ahead.
Sure, happy to help.
You and whom you love
Let me know a day or two in advance.
Oh Mother, get ready.
Ready? Ready for what?
I say you're crazy, what's wrong with you?
She said, "I have no objection."
Let his mother do it.
Go to them.
Perhaps, he builds.
I don't want them to feel that we are poor people.
You have to be chic.
I don't have tasteful dresses.
You've put me in a difficult situation.
Why are you taking all these jewelry pieces? I've never seen you do this before.
Not mine
Mother of Ali
Um Ali is looking for a bride for her son.
She wants elegant clothes and jewelry.
She wants to show them that they are rich and live in luxury.
Oh, how wonderful! God willing.
How lucky she is!
Inshallah, is this my wife? Taller and *more radiant*.
Inshallah, you will hear.
You are a queen, God willing, a queen.
You have to be ready.
They ask you to meet her father.
I'm not going in these clothes.
The day I bathed with my new dress.
Mom, she has her belongings with her.
"Use the things that your mother gave you carefully."
Ah, ah
So we have to be with them.
Why didn't his mother go to arrange his marriage?
That was for the kids.
I have to go and meet the men.
As you can see, God bless you.
"Just the bisht that's left, God bless you."
"They are kind, help me."
They were useful, but only the Pashmina remained.
I want to borrow it from you to complete the look.
Everyone stands up for you.
"Well, my brother Rashid, I have to loosen it, something like that, or I'll keep it."
No, look, first of all
You have to squeeze this.
The clock is ticking.
The dress is loose, but
God bless you.
The left hand has to be
The right hand relaxes, Shadi.
Wear the base bisht underneath.
Oh, my goodness!
How wonderful.
You need to slow down your steps a bit.
Alright! Yes, sir.
Now you look like a millionaire.
What did they give you, okay, seconds
Put your left hand, like this, your left hand, like this.
Do you know my friend Aisha?
What's her situation?
Do you know what she was telling me a moment ago?
She told me, "Because you are my friend, and I don't want us to be apart."
At his friend's request, he proposes to marry from your family.
Tell your friend not to ask her about her brother, shame her, and shame himself.
I feel like there are many suitors interested in you these days. A few days ago, you told me that Saud wanted you for her uncle, and today, this other woman wants you for her brother.
They want to take my beloved.
My heart is in my hands as I look on.
Do they know about our relationship?
No, they just know we're colleagues.
Okay, later.
They need to know by tomorrow.
Why did Waleed refuse?
I am screaming.
Repent, O my child.
Actors are more honest than you, oh! two-faced.
May you be well.
You're lying all your life.
What doesn't reflect you.
To serve people
Save the margin.
Wear the clothes of life, in front of everyone.
I wore a dishdash while acting on television.
It's me, not you!
You wore accessories, gold, and jewelry.
Little lab
The one you marry
Which scene?
"Men, either march, march, or don't march, men."
Wearing his ghutra over the sides of his face.
What the dead/forgotten/right/left mind revolves around
He reminds me of your friend, the one you were talking about, who works in the same office as you.
Are they a girl and a boy?
Why is he walking like that?
What they said.
"And God heals him, oh! Man."
Walk straight, don't stop.
He has no personality at all.
He laughs, he's happy!
Show us the (city center) filter.
No, no, no, no, it doesn't look good when you're sitting like that.
You look better, and you haven't slept yet. Get up, stand up.
I beg you, Thursday.
What's up? Are you going to the city center?
Please, I'd like to talk to you.
Where are you going? Stay with us for a while.
His wife is bothering him.
You're happy about this!
Oh! Thursday
Give it to her.
I love the beautiful one because I am afraid she will involve me in troubles.
I swear by God that I'm at work.
I'm sitting with Salem, my husband is at work.
Speak to her.
She was cutting the phone cord, slowly, slowly.
I hung up the phone, now I'm going to bother you.
Now you're saying I let her talk to you because there was a woman with us.
God adorns her, but I don't know, God exalt us.
Rowing bra!
I'm not the first one to get divorced.
No, no, no, I can't, oh! Brother!
I don't want to torment my mother in her grave.
Recommended to me
She said, "Don't shoot."
No, no, no, I can't, it's impossible.
هَلْ أَنْتَ
No, no, no, stay, stay.
Oh, my madness!
Don't drive my crazy car.
Tell me, I want to know what's happening.
No, no, no, Mother, don't say such things about him.
Salem is particularly one of the best men in our town.
You are asked to divorce.
Even if he asked me to leave, I'm so stupid I'd leave, I can't believe it...
Thursday, I officially went crazy.
Leave me alone, please.
I was talking to him, alone.
May God guide you.
Oh my God, this situation breaks my heart.
I want to show him an important message from the minister's office.
"Who do you want to send him to, may God guide you."
Nothing, nothing at all.
Give it to me, I'll take it to him.
Imagination with understanding is creativity.
...
What's wrong? Why didn't you sleep today?
Hello, Salem
I am your brother, Khamis.
No, I'm really consciously talking to you.
Oh! Brother!
Stay away from my name so I don't attend.
How can we delete your name?
The only person authorized to remove your name is His Excellency, the Minister.
Meeting at the ministry
**Officially**
Who are you talking to?
Healthy, healthy, healthy
Tell the truth.
Who is that old lady you were talking to?
"Hello, hello, he is healthy, by God, he was healthy."
If you're talking to Salem
Are you going to speak?
This translation is not accurate.
Don't talk about five.
And I didn't tell the truth!
Wearing casual clothes.
You made me talk to a woman.
Oh, the bitterness of this life.
Blessings of Allah upon you, may He grant you recovery and well-being.
I wish, so she would believe.
He asked you to call.
None of your business.
Don't stick your nose into other people's business, or something unpleasant will happen to you.
He complains about you.
Hello!?! Hi, yeah!
How can you live with a woman whose tongue is so sharp?
Let's start the meeting now.
Hasan is going to call Khamis.
Okay, let's discuss the real estate budget first.
Let's start
Oh God, I hope he finds it.
His condition changed when he saw the women.
I searched the whole ministry and you're hiding here.
Come on, come on, people are waiting in the conference room.
I can't sit with the women.
Oh! Thursday, how do you know your wife?
I'm afraid to call.
OMG, you want her to suspect me, don't you understand?
If I don't answer her call, how will I get home?
Turn off your wife's alarm!
Sure, since your company is large.
This project, which will be implemented by your company for us at the ministry.
One of the largest projects in the history of our ministry.
Oh! Why is the table shaking?
No, Your Highness, not the table, not me.
I can return your call.
Who is this?
Sorry, who do you want to talk to?
This is my phone, %pw
I'll explain to you, just a moment, a moment.
Dignity betrayed, homeward he goes.
Her brother came.
Tell him that Haram said you can't come, until your job changes and you're no longer able to come.
That's why he went to the ministry to have him transferred from our department.
Exactly, the minister himself told me that he approved it. What does he want?
Why is his wife like that?
This is nonsense.
He is a good speaker.
I told you he's crazy.
What are you doing! Your wife and kids are coming back tomorrow.
I don't know what to do.
As long as you did what she wanted, why are you afraid to go home and see your children?
She wants official proof.
Let the paper fly.
Okay, that's what I did. I sent the paper with her brother.
To see the minister's signature and confirm it.
And if God wills, they will agree. If they agree, I might wish to go back home tonight.
Oh sister, this is the minister's signature.
What do you want now?
Starting tomorrow in the new department.
It means an office and a job, not this thing he used to do.
Where is this office, please?
Yes, God bless you, please, here is the minister's approval.
Nothing, nothing, over there, to your right.
Yes, of course, God bless you.
Here you are, your office is ready.
Saud, and Abdulqadir, God willing, a big office, yes.
Goodbye
Why are you asking about conversion?
The whole department is women.
My wife
No one can make a second decision except the minister himself.
You have to work until the minister returns.
Hey! Buddy, just do it with your gang.
And speak to them in a manly manner, so that your wife may not find out.
I added two more for the new employee.
The new employee, officer.
A few days ago, the minister's office sent someone to work with us.
You're kidding!
green rare, poor men, green rare, green rare
They say his wife is very jealous of other women around him.
Blind jealousy
Oh, poor thing, he's in need.
He just asked us to be quiet when his wife calls, so we kept silent and didn't say anything.
Yeah, Abdelkader who's with you in the office.
See if it fits you.
My son called, he told me my wife is coming to the office.
What are you doing?
Straight ahead, the first turn on your left.
This is for buying books.
With them ***
These are six employees.
And from here, I'm sure he came for work.
This lie doesn't help me.
My wife is jealous of the men around me.
Because I'm kind.
Oh God, guide you, Sultan.
But we want to know what stage we've reached.
Oh man, Sager and I were at the bank yesterday.
The project
Peace be upon you
Brother, I have an important meeting at work today.
Clean the kitchen quickly.
Dressed and fully ready.
In fact, your place is the kitchen.
Women must obey men.
And scorpions have a painful sting.
This is important for rain, see see.
Look, uncle.
Aisha, call the secretary and tell her to inform the staff.
The meeting has been rescheduled for tomorrow.
Oh God, I hope it's not too serious.
"They are hastening each other towards it [disbelief], and they are [themselves] averse to it."
And we must execute.
They need to realize that you are an important person in theory.
He has many responsibilities and obligations.
They consider a woman a weapon.
I've never seen people hate women this way.
At what age do they feel they are alive?
They told me not to go to work today, go to the kitchen and make tea instead.
Where are the servants?
And the second one walked, a week ago.
Even the servants couldn't bear their mistake.
I understand them.
God be with you.
There is little cash.
The cup
Oh man, that's what they meant.
In fact, the Phall complex is nothing without the Ark.
The garden.
Sister, before you go, I want to talk to you about something.
Oh my beauty, Fatimeh, I must go, I'm late.
Come, talk to me, tell me what you have.
Speak, or sit down.
He is bored at school.
A committee from the Women's Union came today.
And the school nominated me because I'm in the league.
Am I stupid?
And you want to go to the league.
You know if you talk to your uncle and brother about this matter, you won't see any good.
You are the one who made the mistake.
homeland
Why don't you come and visit me? I haven't seen you in a long time.
"I want nine, nine more until I reach you."
Are you married yet?
Oh God, may He guide you.
Who would agree to marry an illiterate woman with no certificate?
No, no, no, it's not important that he's my mother, he's a man.
And even Thursday, son of Scopelius
His scorpion sting hurts.
And after that, he'll marry someone from his social class.
A scorpion like this
God helps you.
What can I do, O Aisha!
After the minister traveled, all the documents were transferred to me.
And tell Mustafa, the head of the administration, that I want to tell him that I want to tell him that I want to tell him that I want to tell him that I want to tell him.
The ministry's guests arrived today.
Do you have the schedule?
"And now I'm free to talk to you, Oh! Aisha"
What's up, Mary?
Fine, I'm coming, fine, I'm coming now.
What can I say, Aisha!
My brothers are the cause of all these problems.
I don't know what happened.
Zayn, my love, snow is necessary so your cheeks don't swell.
Didn't we tell her not to talk to them about the subject?
She went to them, and they beat her.
You know if I told them it's football.
They've been beating you for a long time.
How embarrassing, you play football!
Next time, we'll break your neck.
I know who's talking to you.
The big scorpion is the one with forty-four legs.
That little one
Oh, come on, Uncle, I didn't hit him, it was Sultan who did.
Did you hear something?
I chose Economics and Political Science.
I chose graphics because it's in demand these days.
Architecture!
It's your turn.
You had your chance.
Don't worry.
Well done, scorpion.
Break it, break the teeth in her mouth.
Let me hit her.
She is here with me.
Visit the Scholarship Office
And scratch architecture.
Take your time.
To make sure
I greeted Sultan and Saqer.
They don't mind you marrying Munira.
And then?
Yes, our son Thursday deserves all good.
I'll arrange a meeting with them and let you know.
Your nomination to be part of the delegation.
I understand your personal circumstances.
But give yourself a chance to think about it until tomorrow.
To tell you the truth,
They care about you a lot.
Who is your candidate for the minister?
He's right.
I know my neighborhood well.
You won't agree.
I'm surprised.
Their car, which they took loans for, the money comes from my salary.
And he was wasteful towards his family.
And you want me to travel with her.
I'm not marrying her this week.
Come on!
Thursday is a fool, he doesn't even have a school certificate.
Marry and travel with him.
Okay, let's go.
These are kids!!
They'll kill her if she doesn't agree.
Hey! I've told you how many times, my son.
Why don't you go?
Tomorrow, I will go tomorrow.
No traffic since he's a son of a **whore**.
Appearance is what matters.
I don't want to marry Khamis.
Rooster
And put it in the living room.
Real Madrid and Barcelona have a match tonight.
Oh God, don't let them do anything to us.
My source is reliable.
She is diligent and hardworking in her job.
What do you think about this thing?
What do you want me to do?
We have to go.
Please proceed to your offices.
Good health to you, may God grant you a long life.
Long life
There's coffee over there.
Her sovereignty.
May God grant her a long life.
Hello, may God grant you a long life.
Good evening, Your Honor.
Yes, may God grant you a long life.
Did you wash the coffee cups?
Go pour Captain Emad some coffee.
And also
We're going to play in China after tomorrow.
Oh captain, I forgot to introduce you to my sister Mary.
I'm going to the official engagement party.
Are you stupid?
You don't know anything about life, and you want to marry a minister.
Say hello to %pw.
Okay, madam.
Pour it and leave it fresh.
The actors are calling.
You know, after I picked it up, I called you a few minutes ago.
What can I tell her?
Underestimate, Nova's role is not suitable for Misha'il.
Nouf is a sixteen-year-old girl.
And the torches that appear in the twenties
Okay, why don't you take Mary's role?
Let it last forever.
Nouf is thirty.
We need to remove the complicated person from the committee.
It's a problem, and he's sure it won't let things go smoothly.
"Mo tafsilah" translates to "More details" in English.
He talks about art, family values, value art, content, etc.
Who chose him for this committee?
The minister is the one who formed the committee.
You, me, and Hamed can influence him.
"No no no, that's not possible."
What indicates that it is true?
Even if he went and asked at the Ministry of Economy,
Won't find our names
The company released it under Hamed's wife's name, God bless you.
Don't worry.
Who do you think, honestly, is the head of the committee?
The last word is mine.
No, no, guys, everything is fine, come in.
Oh God, I just talked to them at this exact moment, and we've agreed on everything.
Peace be upon you
"May you be safe, welcome Rashid, please come in."
كما تعلمون، هذا الاجتماع هو تحديداً لاتخاذ قرار بشأن ما إذا كنا سنقوم بالموافقة على مسلسل "ابتزاز الضمير" أم لا.
And this is produced by the Modern Arts Institute for them.
A nice, strange, and bold action series.
I am with Hamed.
The storyline of the series is really great.
I agree with you.
I liked it when she took the weapon and killed her neighbors.
And she wanted to hide the gun, so she put it in the car.
And I didn't know he was her son, it was thrilling, and when the police came...
And her children are coming from school.
And I will imprison you in a box.
For how long has she been working as a nurse in the hospital?
The surprise is calling you.
This part of the box enters the mother's room.
How wonderful it is that there's a local company producing such advanced products.
We need to encourage and support them.
Mr. Rashid, you didn't tell us your opinion.
Oh no, you've left me nothing to say.
With all due respect to your opinions and involvement in the series, this is "blackmail of the conscience."
... and slavery in the name of human values...
Disgusting surprises
1.5 people per episode
The second half will be in the next episode.
This serial was written without any social awareness.
Not everyone carries a moral message that helps society to develop.
The pouring rain, why must it make the audience cry?
Sorry, Rashid.
Give us your opinion, Ali, and let Mr. Rashid express his.
It's clear from the meeting.
Insha'Allah there will be an agreement between you.
Organized it.
Some people understand and this is their field, while others have nothing to do with this field.
I don't agree with this serial.
I'm afraid he'll lead us into trouble.
How does he ignore him?
What can he do? He can't do anything.
"I refuse."
He gave me the bag and said, "From Madame Samira."
I don't know what to do.
I can't believe it, Nasser!
This is for the new serial we will produce soon.
The one where the driver rapes the girl.
For the blessings we have because of her.
The first signs, the decorative ring in your hand.
I'll tell you how.
They present it in the name of Huda Hamid, who left you the ring.
And your husband's position was to cover their backs.
He has a five percent share of the production.
"Sweet circle"
"What about the role, didn't you think of 'Lost Dreams'?"
By the way
It's called The Extortion of something, I can't recall.
Ah, extortion dreams.
Why are all the names similar?
All the series from last year were about girls.
You think every series has more than eight or even ten girls.
Your role is secured.
You are precious.
Good morning, happiness.
What's up, Omar?
Yes, okay, okay.
Sorry, my love, I have to go to work. I don't know what happened there.
Eat and be quiet.
Qal wants to see me on an important matter.
I have to go.
I heard that Rashid met with the minister.
He spent half an hour with him.
He told him that he was going to tire him out.
I told you he complained about us to the minister.
What happened? The minister's office called and said he wants to see me.
I'm afraid the minister might believe it himself.
I will meet the minister.
Sender.
This is all.
This is true, may you live long.
But first, Your Honor, I would like to say that it is not acceptable to talk about a colleague behind their back.
Everyone knows that Rashid is
He envies everyone around him.
He only cares about financial gain.
That's just his major.
"Okay, take care. Not every educated person can handle these technical matters."
Dedicated TV.
Conscience is the chain we work on.
Let's produce on a large scale.
We will have a media initiative at the Gulf level.
Strong distribution
Sure, in your field, you know more about this subject than I do.
after you on the great series
This makes us proud.
Look and see what the journalist, Abdel Hamid, is writing. Listen, listen.
. . . . . .
The series promotes unethical ideas.
This is limited to the fall of modesty.
This is indeed bold and strong criticism.
They will be in big trouble if journalist Abdel Hamid continues writing about them.
And if the people I pay find out about this?
They're just blacksmiths, they know how to free themselves.
They are sharks.
We need to improve our website.
And we put all our company's activities on it.
What's the name of the company again?
From this moment, you are the media advisor.
The serial "Conscience Exortion" overseen by the Mercury Media Production Company is considered as...
A Quantum Leap in Arabic Drama
Because it carries ideas and moral values.
A series aimed at developing society.
He's the same journalist who criticized them a few days ago.
It is possible that he might change his mind to the opposite.
How could he accept this?
Al-Junahi Abdul Hamid and those like him and him.
Don't worry, Mr. Hamed.
I told him that you would be the best actor in the Arab world.
God willing.
I feel like the serial killer is going to be something terrible.
I don't know where he is.
The second one is refilled and ready to go.
Not an interesting beginning.
Your stories are always unrealistic, and the events never actually happened.
Love at first sight.
Your book is boring.
*Mumkin yusir* (Possible to happen)
Your question is stupid, stupid.
What do you think?
The situation is very tragic.
No more bad excuses.
You can understand this production at first sight.
These are lines and hidden dimensions, they need someone to focus to discover them.
By the way, political drama.
It seems like a play for children.
What's happening?
I was really upset yesterday.
I was at the souq yesterday standing with Ali.
We were at a cafe.
Ignore me.
Nasser, what do you think about what happened? The minister is upset; this is a big problem.
In a week, we'll all be expelled.
Oh no, the terrible serial, everyone who saw it called it a disaster.
I heard that Rashid intends to visit him.
And tell him that the serial failed and it has no use.
This is a disaster.
Leave it to me.
Let's see what Nasser will do.
Listen up! Ellie
From this moment, I don't want any criticism of the narrative on your page.
Oh, Elijah, please.
A few days ago, I saw an article that not only criticized the production, but also insulted it.
It's on your mind.
I apologize.
I was absent that day.
I swear I won't let them write it.
But honestly, I didn't receive any praise messages.
Once again, great success.
Goodbye
Oh brother Rashid,
Should I believe you or the newspapers?
Your conscience tormented you, the best series.
Good health to you, they have an agreement.
Listen to what the other newspapers are writing.
Do they have an agreement even with the viewers' page?
I feel a tightness in my chest.
At another time, they told me.
Lucky you, the minister is happy.
Frankly, Nasser,
Get ready to watch **Conscience Exortion II**
No, no, no, no, stop! Oh! Brother!
Oh series, he said he wouldn't write again.
He prefers to stay in his miserable job.
Part Two, After All These Problems
Third and fourth are the remaining ones.
What's wrong with you? Don't you want to benefit?
One of his friends told me.
Here I am
What can a magician do?
I wish you more success.
Please tell us what you liked about that success.
I thank you, God, for this success.
Our quarter that envies us and our elders.
He found her strange.
This series wins awards and is a failure.
But they are the experts.
They give awards for it, they must see what we don't see.
Prepare the second part of the series.
Long-lived
Oh, my magic, believe.
You see, "conscience disability" is turning into...
I saw you chatting with the minister at the beginning of the event.
TV festivals lie too!
I heard him say, "Ready for part two."
The same thing
They are taken to the bank for laundering and cleaning.
All the weak, absurd, and perverse series you watch.
They nominate him in Arab and Gulf festivals.
To clean it, give it awards, so people see it as high class.
Yes, that's right.
As long as the rulers are the producers themselves.
Peace be upon you
I hope you're well. Praise be to God for your arrival.
True, we signed a contract with them, but they want to lower the prices.
Come to my office.
A small bakery or bread shop
We are one of the largest bakery companies in the world.
I won't download it.
Otherwise, we'll terminate the contract.
We signed the contract yesterday.
With the British company.
K Cup W Up
As you like it
His stories are strange.
He will be the first one in the world to produce this product.
Not only is he the best baker of bread in the world.
I will fight you.
How is the bread with the sauce?
Take it in your hand or go to the kitchen and get a knife to cut it, and it might cut your hand.
Sew, sew your bread sewed (buttons)
He puts the cheese down and locks it up again.
This is not bread, this is a pair of pants.
So, what do you think? I mean, it's basically like a bag of bread.
How do we remove this zipper?
If so, one can tell their friends, "I ate two buttons."
Why didn't the hospital's pastries arrive yesterday?
I know, but why didn't you deliver it yesterday?
The bakers who make it.
Once again, use the bakers.
That's what happened, brother.
Why are you shouting at him?
You're wasting your time with soccer and delaying my work.
Do you know your son loves football?
What's the problem as long as he takes a few employees from the company to help him out?
You have four hundred employees in the company.
Eleven starting players
Four substitute players, two administrative assistants, that's all, just seventeen.
And the team's spokesperson
Why are you upset with him?
Just wait until then. Please, fans, the most important thing is the player. Number 12.
I let you have fun with them.
And here we have signed the contract with the people.
When he first told you he wanted to play football.
Forged for you
Didn't do anything.
No, you're only upset with him because he had some employees play soccer in front of him and have fun.
How many employees can it take?
Even if some of your neighbors needed a few employees, you could lend them some.
Important professionals in baking
Hey boy, why are you taking the important tasks from the bakers? This is unbearable.
Next time, teach me before you hire any employee.
No, no, let Hamdi do this paperwork.
He is in the hospital.
Why, didn't they inform you?
I finished my work, and I'm going to the car.
Nasser spoke to me.
I went to him.
He said, "They didn't find a goalkeeper, and they have an important match today."
He said, "Get us a goalkeeper," and then we reached the stadium.
Wear the goalkeeper's suit.
I've never played soccer, I've never touched the ball.
That situation
Ghawiy (C
I lost my job, so I couldn't fulfill my promise to take you to the park.
Let me explain.
Dad, do you want me to cancel and withdraw the team, huh?
Yes, that's right.
Oh father, I beg you, I beg you!
I can't split the team, tomorrow's the final match.
No, no, no, he's right.
Do you agree?
Congratulations on your win.
Congratulations, Abu Nasser, on winning the cup.
We just want to know how you planned to win?
See, I prepared the team mentally, physically, and psychologically, and the coach worked hard.
At the hotel
Congratulations to you all, and there will be a party, as we promised.
Your father seems to be happy.
I'm just afraid he might be kind and respectful.
Uncle Bu Nasser, firstly, we'd like to congratulate you on your victory with your great team, the Global Bakers Team.
With this immense success
Good health to you, no, no, no.
No picture without a thobe (traditional Arab men's dishdasha), patience, wait, stand.
What happens
Wearing the bisht
Your attention, concern, and creativity played a significant role in this success, undoubtedly.
And the plan that the coach has.
Okay, they played five-five-three-two in the final.
And as an athlete, you know that changing the game plan confuses players, but the Bakers' team didn't get confused and did a great job.
And the plan that the coach has.
Bo Nasser, as one of the first players on the International Bakers Team, what advice do you have for the players?
Forever
May God bless you
Long life
Welcome! Is Hammoud Sultan with them?
Welcome them to come, but they must have dinner with us first.
Coffee, okay!
Good health to you, oh! Abu Abdulaziz
And how much is considered a contribution to the private sector?
The team is still small.
Don't envy me.
No, who?
Bu Abdulaziz
The vice grips we use in the factory.
I see.
I've wanted to meet him for a long time.
Cora introduced me to him, I reminded him.
I said to him, "Oh! Abu Abdulaziz!"
You've never cared about football your whole life.
What does he have to do with you?
The ball was always close to me, but there were 50 cm between us.
Has Abu Nasser not arrived yet?
No, I'm not coming today either.
At a seminar on football injuries, as a platinum sponsor, he has to be present.
You see more.
I saw the building behind the bakery and wanted to turn it into worker housing?
He is obsessed with football.
Usually, we meet and arrange an interview with one of the figures in the field of sports.
This man inspires the bakery team with his great ideas.
Regarding the International Bakery Team, we heard that you are undergoing comprehensive development.
Compared to offices, all efforts.
A little money, but a million dollars for all this trouble.
Guys, heat it up.
It's not my fault, brother Shahin.
My flaw
So, what was my mistake?
What you told me was that you need players for the Gulf countries.
Prices for the Gulf are higher in dollars.
That means if the player costs two thousand.
For the gelat to cost approximately three or four million dollars
I didn't understand, explain to me.
Send me a fax from here.
And read it to me while you're at it.
My father bought four new players for the team, in addition to the new shipment that arrived with four players.
You know, he's promising, he can be easily defeated by Bille and Randolino.
But 800,000 is written on it.
Yes, indeed, God bless you, but a Turkish club has set this price.
In the UAE, they sell it for one million and two hundred thousand.
Do not argue with me.
Let's examine the goods.
Here
Calf muscle
Fine, okay.
Yes, yes, yes. I guarantee you.
He is fat, God willing, it's good that he is fat.
This one is slim, perfect for the text.
The connecting muscle
The most important muscle, there is no flaw in the player without it.
Thank you
Tell the driver to take them to the Automobile Club, automatically, what did I say! Automatically.
How are you?
Hamdi, let's go.
Congratulations, congratulations
These, God bless you, are young players.
Yeah, let's bring them from the jungles of Africa.
We feed them and raise them, then We release them in the open spaces.
Go ahead, take it. Do you have a place for it or should I carry it in my van?
When he saw them putting pressure on us
The attacking player dribbles the ball.
Kakakano makalali danḍāḥ, lā.
Let the center back play.
Kagumakakani Lololo was supposed to play.
He is a beginner coach.
Even if it were on Mars
Spain! Even if it's a coach on Mars.
What I like is how he runs the game.
This has to be on the north road.
There are rules to the game.
Even if it's just two days.
What's happening? Why are you shouting?
Your stupid son
I'm not convinced the coach is an expert in football.
Listen to her, she speaks like Mitsu.
It is known that central player Selolo Tekawaw is a good central player as Ahmed Al-Ateeq said.
No one is going to give you dinner.
Good.
I know how to deal with him.
Why is the team losing?
The team should think about changing the plan.
So the players aren't playing in their positions.
And the player talks to you, the player's place is not where it should be, it's the place he's used to.
Ask the coach to change the...
To rid us of
Okay, okay, okay
No, no, no, no, what happened at the stadium?
This shouldn't be happening.
The coach shouldn't do that.
Please postpone these problems until the game is over.
How can people see this, this is happening right in front of the camera.
A fourth goal for Nasib, the ball entered the goal area.
He scored the fourth goal, he is the star of the match today.
This coach is wrong.
He said, "Auntie Bu Nasser and her sons no longer want you as their team's coach."
And you shut your mouth.
I'm watching the game on TV and you're sitting on the bench, do as I tell you.
Don't do that, it's not good.
Tomorrow is a game, how are we going to play without a coach?
What does your father do?
Enough, oh! Rashid
What's wrong? You scared me, tell me what's wrong?
Handle me, O sea, handle me. Explanation: This requires caution.
You're absolutely right! How is that possible?
Oh my, I don't know.
Why did he divorce you? You were only married for less than a month.
May God bless you, my mother. I don't know, I don't know.
Meng is fired for any reason!
Yes, mother, yes.
I swear to God, Yaya, I don't know, he suddenly appeared and told me, "Go to your family's house."
I asked him what was wrong. He said, "You're divorced."
I swear, I don't know what's happening?
They were only married for a month. What will people say about us?
I agree with you.
I don't know what to say.
I know, he divorced her, from this moment on.
Sit. Just a minute, I'll be right back.
Because of her high morals.
Go to Portugal.
Oh light of my eyes, Abdullah.
He came to me crying.
He said she swore at Barcelona, and he was upset because that club is one of his favorite clubs here, and he respects it.
Insulted him and hurt his feelings.
Tell him his mother who insulted Barcelona and I said to him, "Divorce her and you will find me a wife for you."
You want to impose a condition on him that your daughter is divorced because she insulted Barcelona FC.
That's why he divorced her, are you serious?
It's none of my business.
It's easy to hurt someone's feelings?
I married him while he was still a minor.
I can't believe what I'm hearing!
There's no respect between us and the global teams, girls who don't respect us.
This is the time I've started to learn English.
Problems between a couple are inevitable and necessary.
One store has a thousand girls.
Many girls wish to marry him.
Listen to me.
I don't want to hear anything.
And I know my son's nature well.
I told you, this is none of your business.
I'm wasting your time.
Don't bother, boy, and don't think about it.
One of them replaces thousands of girls.
Why are you upset!
But when I remember her words
You Real Madrid is better than Barcelona.
Alright, my love.
What's wrong with it!
Her name is Mona.
She was married for one month?
If I told you her story and why she got divorced, you wouldn't stop laughing.
Regarding you and yours, we seek your attention.
What's the use of such a person, he divorced his wife for a football team.
The hairdresser knows them and told me the whole story. Mother, don't get me involved in this, I don't want to get into trouble with this gang.
This is it, you're hearing hairdressers' nonsense.
Tell them I didn't agree.
Let her say her nonsense and say what she wants.
Wealth is coming her way.
I told her, "Hey! Girl, don't stop your luck."
If it's just money, I really don't care.
But she stopped inheriting and we inherited with her.
This building
He never said no to me.
"I put my trust in God, the best of protectors, against this evil, shameless person."
They hear a rumor and spread it.
Don't listen to her.
Say it and let her understand, don't close the door of provision that is opening for us.
He knows how to convince her.
You must be joking. He divorced his wife because of Barcelona?
Sing about your knowledge and don't go crazy.
Don't miss the opportunity.
And it could be the reason or something wrong with her that made him divorce her.
Listen, oh! Girl, don't let Father Burgoyne slip through your fingers.
What is this, Bouregreg?
But when they get closer, they realize they're twin towers.
This is why his father was called Shahin Abu Burjain.
May God bless you (proverb)
Oh, no, no, no. Sweet. Thank you. Thank you.
Yes, thank you. Please.

Hello, Mom.
Okay, this is good.
So you can come with us and buy as well.
Malaysia, Malaysia.
Malaysia, take the fur with you.
Goodbye, my mother.
What's in it?
I don't know.
I greet her and I have no idea what's happening.
Tell me, my daughter, what's happening?
I did my best by ignoring her.
Okay.
On the honeymoon, she is supposed to take care of you by all means.
Listen, do you understand what I mean? Do you want me to tell you something?
And the glass is next to you, don't pick it up and keep drinking.
He brought her up well.
You should have told me from the moment I was born, I only drink water from my mother's hands.
What's in it?
Her hair was disheveled and sad.
And who is this lady with her?
Her name is Michaela.
Alas for her, she divorced in the honeymoon month.
Won't you believe me if I tell you her story?
God bless you! Oh! Thank you, auntie.
Your aunt asked, and so did your aunts.
Yeah, but I don't know where my mom booked us?
Hello, Mom.
Where did you book us?
Because she wants to go there with us.
There is no power or might except from God.
Why did he do it at the airport and why did he take the kids?
What happened between them?
Either you're asking me, I have no idea what happened between them!
This is really nonsense.
So, where is Moneera?
She's in her room talking to that crazy guy.
Now she says she's been calling him for two days and his phone has been off.
I finally found it.
We're waiting to see what he has.
How do you know he's upset? The boy is coming from outside, tired and wanting to rest.
Every day I tell my mother to peel the apples, but she doesn't listen. Every day she upsets me.
And you know I don't like apples with their skin on.
Peel the apples.
Hello, let me tell you
You are divorced.
Even just one more is necessary.
Yawi! Noor aynaa
Yawi! Noor aynaa
Munaira, what did he say?
Why are you still upset!
Call him three times and tell him you're divorced.
Shut up, may God give you health.
I don't know, mom, about what he saw in me at the disco in Spain and told me.
He has nothing to say.
Okay, he has nothing to say.
You dance twice or three times.
And the one who divorces my daughter will die.
How did he divorce you?
Where are you going?
Where am I going? I'm going to pour my anger on this shameless man.
It has a tail like a peacock.
Inlaid with gold, rubies, coral, and diamonds.
And the other girls are your game and your children's.
They don't have any daughters or mothers who can protect them from the burning heat in their throats.
Who's making fun of him/her?
And divorce them in the manner that is pleasing to you.
"Whatever she did to you regarding drinking water, insulting Barcelona, divorce her and forget her."
Who went to the plaza?
Without shame or embarrassment
Below the Under Secretary, Arab and Muslim.
He cares about the reputation of his children and grandchildren.
Stay still and don't move.
Absu is a side of humanity.
It was my father's money.
Where is the one who sells land like it?
Abu Saqr took it from my father by force.
Why is he selling it?
"O Allah, guide him. When Abu Saqr wants something, can anyone say no to him?"
Put your trust in God, man.
Oh God, oh God, come in.
Come on, come on.
What happened to your project, Abu Saad?
As you know.
Okay, last week you said you were going to the library?
I told you, if you want to start your project, you need to start paying for it.
Abu Sakr, this great millionaire
Who doesn't eat? Anyone in this world doesn't eat?
This is not the problem, brother. We'll make him eat and feel full, and fill his stomach. The problem is how we'll get him there.
And you need to know the key to Abu Sakr's house so that all the doors will open for you.
I met him in Umrah and greeted him more than once.
You don't need to know him as long as you're paying him and managing your project; you just need to know the right time.
When the secretary told me that Abu Saqr was waiting for you at dinner.
As soon as I arrived.
"Abo Saqr, oh protector, every day is a feast. May God protect them."
Hey! Who is it, anyone?
She loves social gatherings and cooperating with men.
It's really nice to spend the night at this farm.
Yes, Your Highness, this is Abu Nasser, the owner of the car dealership behind the mall.
He wants to know your honor.
I got the license.
It's as if my son got the license.
Good health to you, may God bless you.
Congratulations on your license, Saqr.
God bless you.
Abu Sakr
I asked you not to let me down, say yes.
Yes, your honor.
As a gift for him.
Also, don't say no.
My business is not bad.
This means you found him easily and talked to him.
Don't be stupid.
Yes, Zain bin Nasser.
Tell me what the technique is, what did you do?
Circumstances were in my favor.
When we were sitting with him.
He just got his license.
I have Saqer's gift. And I have what Saqer gave me.
If the topic is about cars,
Yay, easy.
Come on, take me to him.
Yes, it's done.
Tony just got out of the hospital.
Had his tonsils removed.
He will surely give a feast.
"His son is not worth the trouble, damn it! He's a disgrace."
We wish him well, we wish him well if God wills it, may he not see harm if God wills it.
We met at the pioneer's place.
I think.
Oh! We started to forget and grow up.
They told me your son Shahin was in the room next to yours, and he's already left.
I said I needed to visit you.
And I congratulate you on the health of the cheetah.
Listen, Azouz, you can't leave without having dinner with us.
I have no interest in it.
Yes
Because our dear son Shahin was discharged from the hospital,
In my tower by the corniche.
Yes.
Come on! My son, don't be stubborn.
Mom, don't even try, I don't like business and I have no interest in it.
Who can start a project without capital these days?
Controlling cars and bulldozers, he said, "Just let him wave."
Love is from God, and people love you because of their love for your father.
Until university,
All the doctors love and respect your father.
Most of them are in his office every night.
"Whoever Allah Almighty wills, everyone loves your father, you just consult him."
Oh! People's children are taking loans from banks to establish a company or business.
Am I sitting in the assembly?
Did you open a pickle shop?
And something new.
This is a falcon, the apple of my eye. He brought them to me yesterday and said, "These are samples. Try them."
He just took their agency yesterday.
I see.
He also told me that all businessmen like me, may God make everyone like you.
Yes, your majesty.
When I was on my way to the office,
I saw a new supermarket.
They were preparing him.
Indeed, I like it.
I don't know who the owner is.
Congratulations, congratulations! Oh! Uncle Saqr, congratulations!
God bless you.
In the name of God, in the name of God
Who is he to come and take it so easily (Adam).
You, you can say no now.
Oh uncle, what's wrong with you?
What do I need to say?
Be her partner.
Do you know who his father is?
Who doesn't know his father!
"I noticed that you're close to Assab, did you ask me if I have experience in business?"
I said, "I have a bakery, praise be to God, from which I earn my livelihood."
No, no, I don't like the name.
I didn't notice.
No, oh! Brother, the name is not good.
This means a suitable name for Iranian bread.
Yes, sweet bread.
Partition, and we call it the big bread bakery.
Be patient with me for a while.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Peace and mercy be upon you, oh honorable one.
Excellent, excellent. Good. Do you need anything or any help?
No, thank God, everything is fine.
Ayd, she's a new employee here with us!
She drove the car herself to the client, and she had to drive it back as she is an advertising agent in a marketing company and wouldn't know how to do anything with the car.
You might still need your car later.
No, I don't need the car today.
Okay, no problem.
This is the age of science, knowledge, and study.
I agree with Dr. Rashid, everyone should have sufficient knowledge in their field, regardless of what that field is.
"Very good! Dr. Sami"
Yes, your majesty.
Read and read.
You are repeating what is in the books.
He knows nothing about studying, business, or economics.
He has never read a book in his life, not even a newspaper. I have never seen a newspaper in anyone's hands, throughout his life.
You all know who Falcon is today.
I didn't want my father to enter this business, but...
His uncle Abu Nasser is still alive and living right in front of you.
Whoever likes it.
But some people are born for trade and naturally love it.
Your words are true, oh! Doctor
Oh God, if it's His will, O Shahin, you will be like your brother.
Identifier, God willing.
It's still early.
This depends on upbringing.
No one can be like you (a saying) Oh! Doctor.
Diversity is good.
How did the hawk who hates trade easily reach this great economic awareness?
If they count a hundred billion in the world today, they will count it with them.
Do you know, ya! Abu Saqr?
If Sakr chose the knight's right to the market.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
How are you, Nasser!
Mohammed knocked on my door and told me that Abu Nasser was in the hospital.
Remember when you told me once that you heard that Saqr, Abu Saqr's son, wants to take over the car dealership from my father.
You no longer own the agency.
People are never satisfied.
My father helped him enter the market.
He opened his eyes to the world of business.
To be honest, the doctor said his condition is critical.
This doesn't work.
Nothing works.
Shocked or terrified, not my problem, I say you'll divorce her, you'll divorce her, and you'll divorce her.
There are people like that in the twenty-first century.
We are joined by one of the kindest and most giving men in this country, dear viewers.
A man who knows the way of the poor and the deprived.
Yes, we have the founder and we have the chairman of the Falcon Charity Association.
Sure, if we're talking about this organization, oh! Your Highness.
We know you all have good intentions and are trying to convey them to the world, and of course to everyone.
Without hypocrisy or a desire for fame, God forbid.
Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds. Recently, thirty sacrificial animals were delivered to our brothers in Africa.
And now, thank God, we are ready to surrender.
Seven boxes of sweets for our children in Gaza.
"Whatever God wills, oh! Oh, God bless you, may there be more like you."
My wife and I were just leaving the house.
But my wife takes half an hour just to open her new project.
And prepare for it.
Beautiful.
I really love their atmosphere and enjoy sitting with them. It's very pleasant.
"In my country, the interior is beautiful."
This is all my life.
I think you want to waste my time.
And stay away from trouble.
"All right, hot bread, hot bread."
Let's go! Oh, people!
There are people like that in the 21st century.
There are people like that in the 21st century.
If someone wants to dive, diving requires effort.
Needs brave men.
Welcome to Souq Waqif.
You deserve it, you deserve it, congratulations, congratulations.
Good health to you.
"Masha'Allah, everyone loves you! Oh, Shahin, love from Zain."
I want to say something, but please say yes.
On the occasion of the license, my son Shahin has to go to the exhibition and get the best and most expensive car as a gift from me to him.
The breeze is gentle upon us from Qassam Al-Dahila.
Oh breeze, oh love, take me home.
Hello, Fadi.
How are you, Anaad?
No, no, no, no, no.
Chanty chanty cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha cha
And you want your dress with crystals and all, which takes more time.
And if God wills, will you start speaking to Anood and ignore me?
How many lights do we have?
No, no, no, no, no, let everyone be angry from their heart, but Annoud doesn't get angry.
What else do you want, Fadi? They've started envying each other.
Oh my god, I love the way they speak, I'm jealous of them, it's not like our people.
Don't remind me.
Is my dress ready?
Go ahead, Fadi.
Good health to you, my brother Fadi.
Brother Fadi, I'll come next week to get the document, okay. Goodbye.
How can I help you?
Just send the dress to my house.
No, I didn't like it.
Whatever God wills, today I went to Fadi at the shop, he's doing unbelievable work and the girls are also coming and going.
Alhamdulillah, we succeeded greatly in this project.
What's the matter?
Abu Nasser, my cousin.
What's wrong with her?
Take your jealous eyes off!
And how often have we heard that he started a business through which this bankrupt makes money.
They open their mouths, they devour!
And when he starts his business,
Are you sure?
I felt bored.
And if God wills, won't you do anything?
7 a.m.
Do you want them to bring you breakfast?
No, thank you, I've already had breakfast.
I just want to talk to you about something.
I heard that you...
You want to start a business.
I don't know anything about these things, may God guide you, my cousin.
Design, women's clothing design, etc., something similar?
Who lied to you?
I am a businessman!
No, no, no, no, no, no, but I ...
You need an appointment, you need a percentage of me ready if you need any help.
Thank you, thank you oh! Cousin, thank you.
In order to give it to me, I have to go.
Go ahead, Director!
First time to tell me if you need a raise.
Yay, are you free? I need to arrange the store, are you busy, or what?
The shop is no longer spacious.
I said you should rent the shop in front of you, trust in God and take it.
God willing
Rent the shop next door?
Is there anyone named Khalaf Sultan Al-Seifi other than your cousin Abo Nasser?
No, what's up?
I'm from the Ministry of Economy. I saw his name on a transaction with my friend. His name is Essam, and he is responsible for the documents of his transaction.
Women's fashion design
Are you sure?
I saw the ring and his name was written on it.
What's in it? What's in it? What's in it?
What's wrong with it? What's wrong with it? What's wrong with... It has a defect.
Your ailing heart didn't stop you.
The day I saw that my project was successful,
I said I had to destroy him.
This is an open market for everyone.
Abu Nasser has
Is he a shepherd? What does he say?
And I was testing you, I told you, "Do you intend to start a business?"
I didn't lie to you, men.
Secrecy is the best policy.
I don't give a damn about you or your demands.
And what won't take you there.
Oh men, these are the providers, and each one takes his provision.
You beat me.
Come on, you're relatives.
No, no, no, Abu Saleh crossed the painting.
Captive in my own home!
Open to everyone!
You are brothers.
My friend Ibrahim advised me.
A Lebanese designer bag.
I am a woman, ask me.
I know some people, they love Lebanese food.
Oh! Madam, this looks amazing on you, no, no, no, this, this has no equal in all of Doha.
Oh, these suit you, madam, and with such kind words and a piece worth a thousand, they sell it for thirty or forty thousand.
Yes, do it just like that.
As you know, the disaster that happened last year when the Lebanese painter came.
Oh! Madam, I will design for you a wardrobe unparalleled anywhere in Doha.
Look, if you want to be successful
What's wrong with him exactly?
Why don't you know?
This means he had stolen from the clients.
What do you think about moving to another place? Oh! The manager.
No, no, Fadi.
And at this time, they will be playing by themselves.
It means that it, it, it, it, it, it, it.
We must face them!
And to get back our clients, whether they like it or not.
Do you have money to pay?
For one dirham.
I'm ready to do anything.
But the most important thing is that he doesn't beat me.
This dress you chose costs sixty thousand riyals.
Of course, without the ties in the middle.
It's a gift from the designer, from me.
I put it aside for you, there are only fifty pieces of this crystal in the whole world, and this piece is very special.
Of course there's no discount, our prices are globally known.
No, definitely not, who would do that?
Madam, slow down, slow down, what's wrong? What happened?
Hurting us! Oh, Saad, you're hurting us.
Is this something they do?
They killed us; we have no more customers.
This is called a war, Oh! Abu Nasser.
We're not stopping to watch!
We need to fight them the way they fight us and respond to them as well.
Tomorrow I'll take a loan from the bank.
"I will start a war against them and see what they will do."
Abu Nasser can't be deterred from it.
Make sure to advertise!
Make sure of the ad you've placed!
We offer two free evening dresses with every wedding dress.
He made four evening dresses with each wedding dress.
We'll place a quarter-page ad.
See, he posts a page and a half ad.
I don't know what he intends to do!
Do you trust me, Umm Nasser?
For 6 days, not a single customer entered their store.
No, and today in the afternoon they didn't open, they closed.
And you hear that he put his shop up for sale.
I'll kill him, I'll kill him.
Even if they couldn't sit there, he sat outside.
Alright, drink your tea and go to him.
What is this tea, may God guide you, I can't drink it, this is a problem.
Is there someone who holds hostility towards *laah*?
"May God reward you, please spray the whole place with this scent."
And these are chemicals.
Are you sure someone sprayed perfume in the store?
You're both adults, not kids, so don't fight like children.
He came at night and sprayed a bad smell in the shop, is that fair?
I didn't spray anything, but I can smell you.
Do not cross the boundaries.
You signed an undertaking at the police station.
Don't worry.
This time,
I've prepared a hellish plane for him.
Without anyone knowing that I am the one at fault.
No, everything is fine.
This is what confuses me.
I swear I don't know what's happening, this is the fourth day and not a single customer has come into the shop.
Oh my god, the place is crowded, we need to go to another place, I saw something, oh god, I'm shocked.
What did the doctor tell you?
The shop is empty and no customers enter the store.
I don't know, it's as if they bewitched him.
Children and girls should not come near the shop.
The essence of magic is transforming Saad into a beast.
Anything is possible these days.
Magic exists and it is evil.
Okay, is he asleep or awake?
Go see him, oh! Brother, go, I'm afraid the roof will collapse.
Did you understand? Oh, Sultan, I understood.
I don't know, he turned into a dog!
Leave him alone, monster!
Calm down, bro, don't get angry.
I don't know what I've done.
Oh my age, what did you do to him? They say after his friends started collecting money, she began paying off his debts.
His design
I'm Lebanese, not Ladin.
You told him, gave him the news?
Where is he? Where is he?
The stars are here and we're desperately searching for those extras.
Call the man again, he might have an emergency.
"What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you? Oh! Uncle Ahmed."
"You're useless, Ahmed! Here you are while the manager is yelling at me! What should I do? Where are those guys you said would come today?"
You'd better leave me alone. I called him and my head hurts even to ask Mr. Abdullah.
First of all, don't shout. We're actors and we want to be comfortable. We need to focus on our roles. Secondly, the man called more than once in front of me, but calm down.
What do you say, Mr. Abdullah? What do you say?
Oh! Mr. Abdullah, what should I do now? The director is about to finish the scene and he's going to yell at me.
Oh man! Oh guys, oh man! Oh guys.
We just want to finish, but these extras who are supposed to be in the scene haven't arrived yet.
You don't want someone to shout at you, do you?
Do your job quietly and without complaining.
This is always our situation, screaming from morning, we need to focus.
I found a solution for you.
What do you think about organizing yourself in a scene until, God willing, I'll bring you an actor who will do the role properly.
He's right, he only appears in one scene.
But this scene is the most important scene in the series.
But, brother, please go now.
But if you're not ready today, I'm leaving.
Guys, let's split up.
Tell me something, there's a Filipino, is that okay?
You don't know Abu Walid, he's a real tough guy. He needs someone who's elite, someone who's a top-notch Al-Kharitiyath fan.
Oh! Man, he's wearing a keffiyeh and a headrope, no one will notice.
Are you serious, Alaa? You just want the easiest way out. That's not how you produce something respectable. Respect people's feelings and intelligence.
Alaa gave you all the responsibilities, distributed the tasks, and you'll be comfortable.
Calm down, so we can think. Try to recall with me, maybe you'll remember someone from your circle.
Who is he?
Ahmad, do you remember anyone in the Sultana area named Saud Bukenthun?
Saud Bukharsan's breath.
Saudi say yeah!
The director said he needs a man with a degree, and you're just sitting there chatting.
Dear, by the end of the day as an add-on, you will bring in a wealthy and distinguished person as an addition to the role.
But with a little makeup, Reem, and only wearing a bisht and a clean thobe, and a luxurious car.
Insha'Allah, it will be suitable.
How do we reach him?
I know their house.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Happy cat?
Who is he?
Aah, that's it, that's it.
Yes, that's it, God bless you.
And now, how is my mother supposed to work? There's no other option but this trio that my uncle brings from abroad.
Oh my son, you only have one to wear.
Son, here he is in the closet under my clothes.
Mom, people outside are sending iron. What should we do?
May God give you health, my son.
Today I'll see you and you'll be on TV.
I went to see my mother and they told me I would be on TV as one of the prominent figures.
Sit down, damn it! Idiot.
Come on, guys. What's this? He spat on you.
Spray, spray.
Go ahead, mother.
Quickly, Mama, is Hassan better?
God willing, son!
God willing, they won't care; hopefully, they'll just give you some money.
May God make it easy for you.
Pray for me.
I'll bring you Saud Qanous, Saud Leetob.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Is this Aboud, Fatima's son, Aboud?
Hello, hello.
Hello, Saud?
Will it make the scene?
Yes, yes, God willing, God willing he'll do a good job, calm down and stay quiet, so they'll give you a complex role.
What did you eat for lunch?
She is still the same as she was when she used to collect mushrooms.
Shame on you, shame on you, be quiet.
You are now wearing glasses.
You are an old man now.
You don't change, I regret nominating you.
The actor who played the role of Abu Abdulaziz's father.
He is here, they brought him, welcome, welcome, welcome.
Do your best, this is our manager, Mr. Javil Fadil.
The most important thing is not to be afraid of the camera.
Brother, I just fear God.
Don't be afraid, just be quiet and listen to what happens and say anything the director says.
Hey! Brother, hey! Brother, please. You're going to play the role of one of the elders, one of the wealthy, got it?
Come here, dad! Come here, dad!
I'm talking to you.
He's really stupid, the role needs someone awake.
Anything goes for some people.
Ask me why I speak this way.
Brother, we bought this bike for target practice. Listen to me, I'll take you to the makeup room now and show you the routine.
Bad luck, bad luck, bad luck.
Please go ahead, Honi.
Introduce me to her.
Stop, stop, stop here, here!
Thank God you're here, come in, come in.
Director, the car you need for the scene is ready.
Saud, he cleans everything, organizes it.
Let's repeat it one more time, and the assistant director is here to see you and to reassure the director.
Imagine yourself being known among merchants.
Are you saying this?
Yes, yes, I'm telling you, wait, wait, don't rush. I didn't expect this from you. Oh! (Abu Abdulaziz), say you're Abu Abdulaziz.
We caught up.
Sweet, and you need to know!
Let him brush my teeth, come on! Brother.
Cleaning and completing the full name: Abu Abdul Aziz Falah Al-Marzook, nice.
Sweet, go ahead, go ahead and make yourself at home.
Consider your daughter divorced.
Don't worry about the reason for her divorce.
Is your daughter divorced, beautiful? Beautiful?
She's sweet, go ahead and consider yourself, we're not getting married.
Why don't I spit on him?
Awesome, you're awesome and he memorized everything, awesome.
Let him/her clean my teeth for me.
How? Why?
Hey! Man, the angels surprised us and they need the hall, and the director decided to finish the hall scenes and then shoot the outdoor scenes.
How so? They don't want %PW!
Yes, they want to, they want to, but it's postponed until later. They'll film another scene, and we'll follow them if God wills.
I'll tell them to get you some tea.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Peace be upon you too.
Good morning, Sir.
Hello, which tribe are you from? Oh! Boy.
My full name is Salem Abu Shwei Al Shwei.
Al-shoui are famous.
You deserve it.
It tickles, my nose is big and lips can also be placed here.
Say, oh my brother, oh people with thin noses, now.
I hold myself.
If it were anyone else, they wouldn't stop laughing.
Keep it precise.
Hello, Mum.
Mom is very sick, I need to go quickly! Oh! My friend!
You go take these clothes.
I don't have time, I told you my mother is sick, she's very sick, he says!
Call me Ali, you can walk like this, but when I call you, you must come immediately.
He and I, we can't get out of the place.
Okay, okay, I'll try to find a taxi. Oh, brother!
"What's a taxi? If you look for a taxi for a year, you won't find one."
You know, we're renting the car for the scene.
While she's standing, take her.
Oh! Brother, please give me the key. My mother is sick, give me the key, give it to me.
They're putting it in the car.
I need a wheelchair.
Knock, knock, knock. I'll get him in a minute, in a minute. Oh, come on!
You can tell me something, can't you?
Mom is very sick in the car and I need a wheelchair, please.
Where are the patients? In the car?
Hey! Hey, what happened?
Scott, if you see it, keep quiet about it.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
It's nothing, but your mother-in-law has asthma, quickly.
I'm telling them to make the bed.
Okay, okay.
Don't bother.
God protect you from his evil. What have you done?
Zayn oh! Rashid.
Watch out for our son Rashid.
Oh, how handsome you are, come with me, Father of Rashid.
Oh God and oh Sheikh Rashid, with us.
**And Mr. Rashid takes care of him and provides him with what is necessary.**
This is expected from you.
By telling the nurse to come and see what you're drinking, Your Highness.
Yay and yay, oh Mr. Rashid.
Please.
I go to these people a lot, but be patient!
The problem is that no one cares about us.
Brother, what would you like to drink? Tea, coffee, cappuccino?
I'm not the first one, Naser, the hospital security guard, married a Filipino woman.
Who told you I was rejected?
Not even one of the women gives me attention.
They are philosophizing and they are demanding.
He doesn't have a certificate, I don't want your mother, what's this? I don't want your mother! Go find your friends.
Oh brother, there's a girl in the hospital, I like her.
If I ignore you, find someone else.
I can't believe it! Oh brother, the heart is connected.
Your brother has fallen in love, believe it, when I see her.
Take this gift to Dr. Mohammed.
Network?
Yahl.
May God's curse be upon you.
Your Honor, our witness is now in full health.
Oh, professional star! Oh! Saud, oh! Guys, next!
Bravo, see how they applauded you and praised you.
Come on, go change your clothes and remove your makeup.
Hey! Stop talking about this, come here and finish it with me first.
Okay, from today, my name is Falah Al-Marzouk.
Forget it and write Saud.
Saud is dead.
From now on, my name is Falah Al-Marshed, Abu Abdulaziz.
May God keep you safe, dear.
One buffet!
I made two.
Even I heard one of the bride's relatives say, "Wow, they are so stylish. I don't think anyone can do something similar to what they did at the wedding."
Okay, my love, bye bye.
Check this thing, Mom.
I need to get them something for the occasion of my wedding contract signing.
What's the matter, mom?
Look at your brother who is leaving and making us proud!
This, the record, in reality, kilos, kilos, kilos, kilos.
Just within our budget, okay.
Leave it for the servants to eat.
He wants to cause trouble for us.
Good that I saw him.
This type is the free category, it's for the sophisticated community.
And around above average.
No, we want something extraordinary, something no one else can do or manage.
My bad, sister, you can't blame someone who doesn't know your capabilities. (Like)
Shut up, just shut up, you don't know anything.
I'm afraid to sleep, the amount I have isn't enough.
Don't embarrass us, pay with the credit card.
What a fortune, such good taste.
Yesterday, Saleh signed his marriage contract.
Salih Nasser!
I'm at your service, I'm at your service.
It's coming for you. **It's inevitable.**
They booked the small ballroom and the food was disgusting.
Yaobi.
What you said about a happy marriage.
Sure, everyone says the same thing.
That's what scares me!
Our dear sister,
He's all about the money.
He didn't care what people said.
He wants to cause trouble for us.
But we should bring something within our budget and circumstances.
Know someone who takes a loan, sells their house and car, just to attend a lavish wedding and to spite their critics.
Keep it with us, and the cheap chocolate is enough to make you almost embarrass us.
I said the director liked the stairs and took them home.
Fine, if the bride's family says they'll choose the hall, the stage, and prepare everything themselves.
And you're thinking we'll choose anything!
No, not really, but the store we used to go to had very reasonable prices.
By the way, this shop designed Abu Thahab's wedding ceremony.
Has anyone used it before?
"From too much noise, all at once."
At the wedding of her cousin, Mubarak.
No, no, no, we don't need anyone who has been used.
I want a stage. We are the first in the world to use it.
"Blabbering means you want to excel."
Show me what you've got.
This stage is being used for the first time in Qatar.
Inspired by the information revolution, like Facebook and Twitter.
Very modern and up-to-date.
How does this angle compare to the rest of the arrangement?
I'll calculate it for you now, but it won't be less than one hundred and twenty-five thousand.
Oh my, oh my, when they do things like this, money isn't enough. Everything is so luxurious. The best things and exclusivity, all of this costs money.
Everyone does this.
Oh God, be quiet.
What's the decision?
So, did you like this?
This is Noah's Ark.
Both of them have short hands, but Noah's ship is more precious, containing twenty thousand.
No, and yes and yes and yes and yes, God bless you, parents. I think the mouse stage is much better.
Shut up, no, I need Noah's Ark.
These are wedding and its costs. By the way, we are considered middle class.
How do I reserve a table for a party of five to five hundred in the Royal Ballroom?
I didn't say box, but why this display, what is it, and why does everyone want to look at each other, and why does everyone want to do better than what the others have done.
A celebration of boasting, and only wedding shop owners benefit.
Who knows that everyone who wants to be special takes advantage of us and lies to us.
I swear I know one of my friends who says his brother has a wedding shop.
He says the wood doesn't cost more than two thousand riyals.
I'm just waiting for the moment when his father says yes.
Okay, do something.
Just like the rest who get married and take care of themselves.
Oh my lady, your honor.
How are you?
I know you love to stand out.
That's why I called you.
First time in Qatar, designed by the world artist Peter Salmon.
A collection inspired by the nine planets.
I am from the Solar System.
Noah's ark appeared at one point, and its shape was awesome.
There's nothing like this cohesion, you'll be the first one in Qatar to use the nine planets.
Okay.
It was one hundred and fifty thousand, and now?
Okay.
God have mercy on you.
As you like.
Expenses are high, brother.
Generally, I couldn't collect all eighty thousand.
Everything I could gather is sixty thousand, and I took twenty thousand from my brother.
Thank you, thank you very much. Oh! Brother Oh! Fahad.
How can I calm things down? Oh, Fahd! Since we're arguing at the wedding, we're in trouble.
Without any review.
You'll definitely get the invitations you want.
Yeah, this week, God willing, we'll start sending out the invitations.
Our marriage will be better than theirs.
Mother, please look at the invitations that your son has chosen for the wedding.
Where does your brother live?
People now travel to countries just to design their invitations.
**, unlike Amina's family, they went to Italy to design their invitation, they printed it and then came back. Also Moneera's family,**
They went to France; even people who are not rich go to Lebanon to get their invitations.
The system operates as it pleases in the state; do you want us to be different?
Okay, which country do you want to travel to?
We saw some really nice invitations.
Indeed, it's expensive, though.
But he's special and no one has done it before.
Wow, I like it.
Gold will be much better, shiny.
Oh brother! If he can't afford the wedding expenses,
Why did he involve himself in it?
What's with all the showing off and boasting about the grooms, and all these unnecessary expenses?
Only hotels and wedding planners benefit from our madness.
That's it, he's walking, poor thing.
Let me take it, it might not find someone to take it.
Come on, I'll give you a ski.
Good health to you, Abu Nasser.
Hey! My brother, the bride's family has to stand with you.
I tried once, just once.
I said there's no need for a dance hall in a very famous hotel.
Why, you found our daughter on the street, but they are no better than her.
That's the problem, everyone is watching each other.
Who told you I got married?
At least they don't have that arrogance.
It's just a simple party and some pocket money.
These days, they're having weddings on Facebook, guys.
Cheaper and less expensive.
This means you're not marrying from your country.
In your dreams, do you want me to be crazy?
"You'll see"
If I don't bring Abdullah or Nawal to my son's wedding.
Damn it, she won't be better than me.
Father, I want to ask you a precious question.
If your son has the Roaya ID, please give it to us so we can contact him.
Okay dear, thank you very much, goodbye.
Mom, we agreed on the DJ. Why did you change your mind?
Is Muntazir's mother better than me?
"Have you forgotten who she is and who we are?"
Those who are wiser than us, let them remain wiser than us.
Not like this mother, but look at my brother Saleh, he breaks my heart and we don't put a lot of pressure on him.
Really, you broke my heart.
Really!
In the hospital! When and which hospital?
I don't know, but it suddenly fell.
I heard the word and fell flat.
He had no flaws and no one could blame him. After he had arranged everything and people found out, he simply said he didn't want a wedding.
He wants to embarrass us.
What did the doctor say?
He's trying to call off the wedding.
And I hope everything will be easy.
Don't break her heart.
Hey! My son, you are a man and you are a provider.
Go, go and calm her down.
I swear to God, if I told Abu Yusuf, his heart would stop beating.
Do you know why the minister is still keeping Abu Youssef?
By the way, he should have retired three or four years ago.
Nothing is wrong with it, he will help me.
By God, you're crazy.
Do you understand what I want from him now?
And you make him hide the newspapers and quotes until the money is returned.
They call it amount cooling postponement.
I'm speaking, and I don't know why, why are you afraid?
There's nothing to worry about, and in the end, I'll bring you the amount.
Do you know what they call me? Do you know what they call me?
Disciplined, disciplined.
Oh my uncle, oh my uncle, I tried, but there's no other way.
If I give you and keep checking on people,
And they are harsh in scrutiny, they will disappoint me, quickly, quickly.
Quickly, the tablet, the tablet, the tablet.
Quality, quality of the catch.
No, no, God willing, from thirty-seven we'll be in the balloons welcoming guests.
No, we won't be there for sure.
If I want to marry off my son, this is the daughter of so-and-so, from one of the most famous neighborhoods.
Surprise!
See you later, Umm Fatima.
Oh my son, if you enter upon them tomorrow like this, with the shawl.
Oh mother, is the length of the bisht okay?
The police are here!
I hope there's nothing wrong.
"Just stay here, I'll call the police and be right back."
"God is sufficient for you, O happiness."
Forget your marriage.
Marriage cage, now you're entering the prison cage.
They discovered the document that I hid for your loan and now all of a sudden, they discovered me.
Why are you upset!
You hear more about disasters than this.
And what are you saying now!
A respectful and honest employee
Whoever loves their job, the ministry contracted a company to do maintenance.
The employee, being diligent, went to inquire about the materials.
He discovered that it cost four hundred thousand.
He saves one million six hundred thousand for the ministry.
The minister is paralyzed! No, no, no, I can't believe it.
Why can't you believe!
Go ahead, Saad.
Surely he has all the news.
He fired him from his job.
What has happened to the world? Where are the values?
They say he called his office manager.
And he let her work instead of Osman.
And who is she?
She is the daughter of the manager of the same company that submitted the maintenance offer.
I am Uthman, who was discovered.
No, no, no, no, this is not it.
Ouchi is always surprised Oh! Salihi!
Who does this company belong to?
For whom?
We've become like this!
What do you say!
It's not fair to say that the poor employee Osman is to blame!
His mistake is that he is honest and believes it!
Do you think the boss is in his office?
Yes, he left before them.
He cured the world!
We started seeing strange people.
I agree with you, Uthman, he doesn't deserve it, but we can't do anything (a popular saying).
It's not fair, Your Highness, he has seven children and doesn't have a passport.
He makes a living from this job! What will he do now and where will he go?
Do you know what happened?
The new employee hired by the minister
She entered Uthman's office and started working. Poor Uthman came to collect his belongings, but she stopped him and said, "Go, and I will send your things with the tea boy."
Where is he now?
Things have flipped, oh! Uthman?
This is it!!
This is God's will.
Praise be to Allah, the Most High.
. . . . . . . . . . .
What's wrong? You don't look good!
I know, I know you're very sensitive.
What a mess! I can't do anything, I'm leaving now.
It's a good opportunity for me to visit my mother and bring you the items.
I don't want you to stay sad like this.
Why are you yelling at me? I'm your mother.
I'm not shouting at you, I'm asking you.
How is it normal, and why do you have the right to go with him? Is he your husband, father, or brother?
The world has changed, where have you been living?
I don't know, mom!
You're crazy.
"The rise of education and victory, and the whole world is a small village, so let's work together!"
But what are you saying!
Be modern, live in the present, and don't be backward.
Get the stuff out of the car quickly! Come on, don't let me see you and close it.
"Is anything wrong, Saleh? What's the matter with you?"
No, you're not right today.
Oh, how handsome you are and how strong your heart is! You sighed over that poor maid, she was never wrong.
You know I didn't mean that.
No, no, no, I don't feel like eating.
So I can forget the disasters I've seen.
Dear, don't cry.
The big one is a little angry.
It's our duty to honor you.
Good health to you, a lot of good health to you.
Effort, fatigue, and perseverance.
Alright, Yael!
The most important thing,
The most important thing for me in this ministry
That's right. Yes! Your honor.
I say, what's the use of an employee who doesn't take bribes?
It's useless.
That's why I'm all of your father.
There is no place for true men and those with power and influence in this world.
If you ever discover
He only blames himself.
To be only is the principle, whatever the reaction!
That's why I want you to cooperate with me.
If you have doubt
Just tell me.
We are thieves and sons of thieves, and no one can compete with our sisters.
If Nora doesn't bribe someone, she steals government tea before going home.
Excellent, excellent, bravo. This is what is expected of everyone, I don't want it to just be like this, but I want all of you to be like her.
God bless you.
That's why I want you to leave the purchasing department and become my office manager.
To be honest, you know how to choose. You've chosen the right thief for the right place.
Enough, oh Mother Saud! Enough, don't torment me any more.
I don't want to live in a prison.
"But God is enough to ward off the evil of those who envy; He is the One who truly knows what is within me."
He told us to be honest.
You are a father.
Why did you tire yourself with honesty and purity?
All your life, you've been a thief and a layabout.
Good thing I didn't agree.
Let me talk to your father.
Don't do it again.
You have to be on the straight path, bribe, steal, and be hypocritical to live comfortably.
His father is in prison because all his money is ill-gotten.
His palm is the palm of this game.
This is something to wear!
We are a beautiful family.
Break your shame.
Where is your stomach?
Why isn't it discovered?
You don't feel lazy, you are lazy to the first degree.
I'm ashamed to wear clothes.
Are there any girls with a sense of modesty these days?
Why are you shouting?
Look at what your daughter is wearing!
Would a decent woman wear such a thing?
And you're walking in the street and not showing any part of your body?
I'm tired of it, you don't listen to what I say.
I've never been imprisoned or retreated here.
I bought her see-through clothes, which are useless.
I warn you, if I ever see you with anything below the knee.
Since you know the situation, never blame me for the results.
We are here, God bless you.
I hope he's stoned and evil.
He is his father.
How do you see what's in front of you?
He's a really good man, how can I find someone like him.
Don't worry, Uncle, I'm very spoiled.
I hope for the best. To be honest, I love my daughter Sarah very much and I care about her future.
But after we heard about it.
Praise be to God, she has a very bad reputation.
I returned home at 3:30 a.m.
I left the house at five in the morning.
Hello, hello, what! Hello.
Please come and take me from the club.
Start your engine and run me over.
This is the first time I've seen a father not obey his son.
Enough, Dad. Start your car, I'm waiting for you.
I love you, Mary.
I'm still in love with you, you disappeared, you disappeared, you disappeared.
In the truest sense, in the truest sense, the father, the father is present here.
Where is he?
He is brave, unlike my father who makes a big deal out of everything.
Let me introduce you to my best friend, Majid.
No, my boy, Abdulaziz was my past lover.
God bless you, come in, a chance for the weeds.
And when the Arabs and the Israelis...
I discovered that many Palestinians don't cut their nails.
And as committed by the State of Palestine in the comprehensive peace agreement,
In any case, the United Nations is meeting today to discuss Israel's request to send special inspection committees to inspect Palestinian fingers.
To see if their nails are long or not.
There was one condition, which was that nothing should happen to him unless he himself broke, was wounded, or anything that caused him to bleed.
State of Palestine
I call on the entire international community to visit Palestine.
From the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.
Made of cork.
"And olives, oh! Man."
We dip the olives like this, like this we dip the olives.
We and our Arab brothers are calling the international community.
You're forming a committee to inspect Palestinian nails.
And now, let's start the voting.
No, no, no, no, I'm not that desperate, no.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Salih, Salih, what's wrong with you?
What did you dream about?
I dreamed of the upside-down world.
Oh Rashid, you need to have a strong personality.
Yikes! Brother, how many classes do you have tomorrow at the school where you work?
I am a teacher like you.
Why didn't I change my school, since I started teaching?
What's your personality, brother?
But the problem is his weak personality.
By the way, the teachers who were with him were the ones who used to complain about him.
Let me go, brother!
That's why you see him silent.
Later, he started to teach.
Neither ketchup nor mayonnaise is my favorite.
Hey! Brother, we're not talking to you to break your heart.
We're telling you this because it's your last chance.
He told me he accepted Rashid, even though his personality is weak.
And he doesn't want it, and it's something cool.
Whatever the case, he is a citizen.
Why is your brother so quiet?
Because everything you say is true.
Everything you say is true.
From tomorrow,
New Mr. Rashid. (This phrase seems to be already in English, no change needed)
Mr. Rashid,
Your words are the height of reason.
Okay, enough, don't think about it.
And tomorrow,
Yes, fine. And now, what's next?
Here I am telling you,
I am a teacher who does not like mistakes.
Oh man, imagine a boy jumping up and saying to you, "Just like what the second boy said at your old school." And the inspector is present.
Take your bag!
Gently, gently, you'll break the door.
Okay, one learns from one's mistakes.
From the first minute,
Here I am telling you,
I'm nervous.
It's up to me!
Just shut up!
It seems he said, "Okay, be quiet!"
Have you heard about him?
Mr. Rashid told me to leave.
As if he said, "It's none of my business, but I notice, I don't want to see your face here in class."
Doctor, do you know who this is?
Who is his father?
Here comes Bou Rashid.
Saw it?
Oh professor, the problem is that if he tells his father the truth.
In, where, usually, do you see him, sitting, sitting, during, break time, for example?
You can find him sitting in the chairs.
Above the chairs.
The translation is: The cross is a cross.
The world is a soft man who sleeps.
But you got angry at me!
They're joking around, but they're joking with me.
My father is a traveler, and next week I will receive him, and if he returns, I will receive him too, let me know.
No, no, no, no, Abdulrahman, may God preserve you.
We're friends. By the way, the strawberry ice cream is delicious, you should try it. It has a slight tang, but it's amazing.
Okay, go and get them quickly.
The only thing I'm afraid of is him telling his friends.
I said his father is traveling.
Yes, he's out, won't his father come back? I mean, they took his father's belongings and threw him out!
Oh God, let there not be dire consequences.
I picked up his suitcase and carried it for him. He gave me his phone number and said, "If you need anything, call me. I'm your friend."
Yeah, just.
Yes, but what?
You taught me everything.
Scream and pretend you're strong.
Laundry, laundry, laundry. Bathroom, bathroom, bathroom.
Hey! Rashid!
Go to sleep, you can sleep, you can sleep, don't worry about yourself, sleep.
Bo Nasser, Rashid is in the toilet.
One juice and.
Come here, come here, come here, come here, give it to me.
Walk quickly.
Put them on the table.
All are equal.
That's why I gathered you, to hear your ideas for the evening.
And how can anyone guarantee a child?
This will get us into trouble, this is it, this calls.
It's three o'clock.
And you, hello. I guess the line is cut off, I seem to be rambling.
Faster, faster.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Stand up for the inspector and sit down.
Yes, I'm at your service.
Hey! Professor, come here, come here! Hey! Professor.
Are you done crying yet?
I'm not mad, I'm just asking if you're done.
Is it over yet or not? Where is the teacher's authority? Your actions are an insult to yourselves and a disgrace to the teaching profession.
Okay, okay, fine, fine.
And you're raising your voice too?
Why are you raising your voice? First, you need to know who this boy is.
Faster, faster.
Just two cars.
Two cars, no, no, I want four or five cars. Move over, move over, we have plenty of space. Go, go, go.
He thinks he owns the place!
Abu Nasser used to do this and not do that.
God helps him.
I am the manager here.
It is known that Abo Nasser
They used to give all the teachers extra lessons.
Except me.
Who's the boss here?
You're the manager, God guide you, what's wrong with you?
Put your foot down.
I didn't put them on your head, they are on the table, brother!
What do you mean?
No need to be right, I just wanted to disagree with you.
What's his name? What do you call him?
How are you now?
Improve your situation, it's better for you, and you'll take extra lessons whether you like it or not.
What's wrong with you? Go, go, go, come on, get out!
Okay, I'll try to leave.
Oh man!
We need to keep him in check.
Wait, my friends, wait.
Do not blame us, oh! Abu Salmin.
Hey! Abu Naif, you're the main instigator in the area and we have to put you in your place.
He is my father's brother.
I'll see what I do with it.
Faster, faster.
Goodbye, Aziz.
Wow, who bought this car?
I told you, but you didn't believe me.
His mustache twitched and his face turned red.
Do you believe it? I can tell when he's lying, when he's making something up, I know it from his voice.
Did you know he got promoted last week?
He is responsible for eight schools for boys and girls.
What's this magic secret? Ask him, what's the secret that drew him from beneath!
I've been telling you since day one,
When I study, I don't want to hear any noise.
And he doesn't even breathe.
I made a story.
And you too, reply to me, you argue with me. Get away from my face, go away, go away, go away.
When you are appointed a minister, look for a good staff to work with you.
I mean, don't tell me to come and take this job.
And the second job, brother, no one gives me options, different jobs and choose the most suitable for the job.
Traitor minister!
I swear to God, I'm not feeling comfortable about the call I received.
Everybody congratulates me.
What will they say, oh Mother, God guide you.
This is very widespread. Every minister hires their friends and relatives, and people automatically get used to it.
From this side, don't worry. Happy to meet you.
We know you'll become a minister.
So, so they're spraying me, this is just a snack.
The manna that comes to us, a treasure, a treasure that scents for us.
The big vine.
Come on, everyone, go congratulate the new minister.
Ya, ya, ya.
Congratulations, Minister.
With your best regards, congratulations.
Congratulations, Your Honor. You deserve it.
"You deserve it, oh! Your Excellency the Minister."
Oh brothers, the responsibility is great, may God help us bear it.
"The right man for the job," "You're the right man for this job."
I left, followed by a phone ring from Abu Saleh.
Stay away from him.
Don't see it.
I'm surprised to see how he loves him now?
"And how many Sultan's are there who aren't crazy?"
Yeah, I opened the car door for him.
Bravo, well done!
We're waiting for our brother to become a minister.
I told you, oh my god, don't be vulgar.
I said, "Cafe stories, cafe stories."
After she died, she said I envied her husband.
God willing, God willing.
Ah, you have nothing to say, you have nothing.
Mom, let's go, I've had enough of this place (proverb).
What do you mean it's none of your business?
Just relax.
I cut them because they made me angry.
Yeah, they're right.
But I didn't like to say that in front of my mother, you know how mothers tell everyone.
Don't say anything you haven't heard, they call it a filter, we don't want any stories.
So, what guarantees do you have that if he steps down from power, he will put you in his place?
That's why I asked.
If he's absent from the office, you'll be the first candidate.
What guarantees do you have that they will fire him?
No, I'm very sure about this.
"What's your response? I saw him leaving the office, and now I see you in front of me."
You're going to bewitch him.
But the plan in my mind is guaranteed and effective.
Burn it and assemble the plan.
I'll make him attend every event in the country.
In this moment, he will burn. When he burns, he will be outside the office. When he is outside the office, he will be fired.
By God!! Brother, I don't know how and I don't know what to tell you!!
Your visit is called a participation that reflects how much you love your country.
Do you think so?
Today you are a statesman, you must always be present.
You have to participate in everything, sorry for your honor, sorry, sorry.
Before I forget, thank you for the sheep you sent me yesterday.
Come on, tongue, this is just a simple task, not your glory. What is your glory, O tongue, that you bring today?
The man wants to show you outside!
From the heart of the heart,
I don't want to go.
Groan, groan from the wilderness, groan from him.
You are the minister today, his words are correct. Since he told you that you are a real social person, do something straight so that people will appreciate you and recognize your value.
And God sends you this kind man.
Good health to you, good health to you, good health to you.
You don't understand me.
Take, take.
Today I'm taking him to a poetry night and a wedding, and they took at least a hundred pictures of him.
And I'll go tell him about something very nice to take to him.
Listen, I've also arranged a really cool educational activity for you.
Yes, like that. Let it shine, I want the shine, I want the shine until it sparkles. I love that shine.
Sales representative, thank you. Congratulations, congratulations, blessed bicycle. Picture, picture, Your Highness. Take a picture, take a picture. Don't take my picture, I'm far away, take hers.
This is the wardrobe.
"We started with good and congratulations, Azza's welcome."
Picture, picture like that. You are my flesh, my flesh is your honor.
Go ahead, God bless you.
Go to the second page.
No, he doesn't know that.
National participation.
Say, "With God's will."
This is the fourth friend who talked to me today.
Everyone praises your actions; Um Khaled calls you the vital social activist.
Early on, I heard a word that hurt me.
The farm that Abu Sultan took me to yesterday.
The group of little kids who won the swimming race.
One man was chatting with his friend.
Think I didn't hear them.
Gal Hadsar
I want to buy my nephew a birthday present.
Hello, hello.
I see you, my brother, in the newspaper every day.
Correct, correct
You brought light when you came to this place, I'll give you a discount on everything you want.
Whether you want to pay or not, it's no problem.
This means you won't be strolling and walking around with your minister.
I, I am Abu Saleh, the minister.
Abu Sultan isn't coming to get anything; I'll wait for him.
And he sat me in the front row, then went to the car to rest.
We don't need anything from him, may God guide you.
Oh my God! Madam, God bless you, parents, ask them. I'll call you later just to make sure.
And you are connecting with your spirit.
People are giving us discounts.
I told you.
This work is excellent.
But let this man come to me!
"Saeed al-Ma'aid upset me when I invited him."
Welcome, welcome, Your Excellency, the Minister.
No, but today I'm very tired and not up for it.
That's great if you're very enthusiastic, we are at your service.
We'll serve you, but my brother Saad will take you and look around with you, and God willing, he'll find you a Samra or something.
And then Friday?
No, no, today we don't have any activities.
No, we don't have it.
Fine, where do we find them?
A. Yes, thank you, thank you.
Is anyone asking?
May God protect and guide you.
The lamp
Wait a moment, Saad.
Anything, even for one night?
Yes, indeed it is good.
And there might be extra time.
Take it! Put it in the camera and find a photographer to take a few pictures of its face.
Okay, bye bye.
How did they figure it out?
I don't know, it's a match in the Premier League. Let him stay alone at the stadium!
What's this! This minister is a chorus for us!
Sweet, that means he reached the summit.
His end was near when he became the talk of the town.
Your Honor, he has become much more popular than you.
Your honour, if you go somewhere and take Abo Saleh with you, your reputation will be enhanced.
Oh, wow! Your Highness!
The flower is shiny.
We'll shrink it and return it to its original size.
The minister came, came, came. The minister came.
Don't you imagine, O people, that peace or salutations will be of any use to you if one of you takes a picture of me and annoys me, annoys me, annoys me, annoys me, annoys me.
Thunderbolts broke their cameras; I don't want pictures.
She sends you her regards.
As they say, I missed the train.
This is Khalid, my brother.
There is no might nor power except in Allah.
Why this?
This is the first time I've seen him.
The first time you see it!
It's the first time I've seen him in years.
Oh my God.
Is this my immortality?
I haven't seen him for a long time, come to me, my dear.
What should I do? I'm really attached to it.
There is no power or might except with Allah; you always go back to the same old thing.
Go away, go away, and don't bother me. I came back from the wedding at 3 a.m.
Just let me rest and relax, don't make a big deal out of it.
Your brother becomes a woman.
I swear by my Lord, I will tell her father. Look at yourself, you look like a woman.
This means he was playing, playing.
Yes, he was playing, I tell you he was playing with the makeup kit.
I don't know what to do with this Saudi.
How lucky Khalid is! I wish all children were like Khalid.
All these campaigns and lies he spreads about his brother.
He is afraid of himself.
How are you, dear?
No, my dear, we're not going to Spain this year.
Who are you talking to?
Fahd is from Kuwait.
Oh, Hamada!
Listen to what I'm saying.
There is no power or might except from God.
I'll let my beloved Amal choose for herself.
But honestly, what do you think?
I say the one overlooking the sea is better.
So that soon we'll buy yachts and go straight from home to the sea.
Us and our kids.
Brother, you need to decide when the wedding will be.
Fine, just a year and a few months.
What's wrong with your brother? He's putting on too much perfume.
To be honest, I notice that your brother Khalid, I don't know.
But he's completely different from your brother Saad.
Different or not different, my dear, everyone is free concerning their actions.
As for your project, it's backward; he doesn't know there's a unisex perfume.
Let your fiancé keep his opinion to himself!
It's none of my business.
I can't believe it, Khalid!
You're wearing perfume like a woman.
So you can use their colors.
Why are you doing this, Oh! Khalid?
Really, you have nothing to say.
Mom, why don't you want to believe anything about him? Don't you feel his actions and behavior?
Aromatic oils are now for both genders.
Listen to me, this is my warning.
Did you see the Bluetooth?
I heard about it from my friends at the council; they say it's very prevalent in Doha.
I heard about it, show us.
You have to see it, and I'll tell you later.
Look at how this girl dances!
Show the moves!
That's nonsense! What are you talking about? She says she dances gracefully and makes movements, do you know who she is? She's the daughter of Muhammad bin Flah.
My cousin Khalid is a troublemaker.
Fine, you'll see what I'll do to him.
Wait for his brother Saad now.
Why? Let him come and see, let Saad come! I'll ask him for the Bluetooth, so his family can see it.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
"Peace be upon you, welcome, welcome."
It's natural for you to relax.
Why is my cousin sitting so far away?
Nothing, is your Bluetooth on?
No, I just want to send you something.
No, thank you, Amira.
Run away from his family.
You're crazy or what! Saad?
And tomorrow I'm traveling.
I don't see my face in this country.
Where are you going by yourself?
What will people say?
They tell you your son has traveled, so don't cause a scene in our family!
Really?
What did your son Khalid do?! This is honor and pride!
Men wearing fancy clothes, is that a scandal?
I can't see them when someone says this is my cool brother.
Few people travel for medicine, study, work, or even to commit suicide.
The most important thing is that I don't live in a place where secrecy chases me every day.
So, where are you going?
"I don't know where to go" (proverb).
This is the end.
"The second person, we don't know where he is, and the one we have here is packing his bags to travel."
Even we don't know where he goes?
Why would you expect him to be?
**What's the matter with you? I'm answering you so you can be rid of me, and you're throwing harsh words at me that hurt my heart.**
I was telling you to watch out for him.
Don't let him get away with it.
You don't know anything about it, and you were busy.
And my brother is busy with his work and left the responsibility to you.
You're right, Mother.
Is there any hope for your sister?
In this, you are right.
What did Khalid do to shame us in front of people?
I can't see anyone.
Did you tell him anything?
This is the biggest flaw in my father's character.
We're in the midst of Khalid's strange, bad problem story.
I experienced it.
Put it on a CD and give it to him.
But only when I go to the airport.
I'm very worried about her.
Our parents' house has come to this, I hope.
Don't be surprised.
Khulood and her friends don't care about their family's reputation.
And I heard them and the reputation of their brothers and sisters.
Whatever religious values call them
And they go dancing and celebrating.
Evil in the pit.
Really? Oh, my child, I am perplexed.
Goodbye, Father.
Take care of yourself, boy!
Hey, buddy, I have a little gift for you.
A gift for me!
Now he's putting the CD in the laptop, I'm scared of what's going to happen, come with me!
Okay, Mom.
I can't believe Dad is still watching the CD, it's only three minutes long.
He might succeed.
Where is he going? He doesn't have enough time to go anywhere.
What's wrong with you guys, oh! Abu Saad?
Daddy!
"Come on, Amal."
Even if I search, I will be disappointed.
Tedawwar had improved his character.
Excuse me.
God helps you.
I see you going onto the roof!
Yes, my love.
We live in an age of freedom.
The age of human rights and no one has a say in us.
Give me one riyal, you can take a thousand! Oh, my dear.
Sure, I can do it. God bless America, my love.
Do you know that salaries have increased now?
One thousand two hundred.
By God, I don't need you. Every time I talk to the driver, you ask him, "What's your salary?"
My salary is very low.
When he sees me, he starts complaining, my salary is low and there's no incentive. We reached an agreement with him that his salary would be seven hundred, and I increased it by a hundred when he got the license. What more does he want?
I told him, after you finish your year of work, we'll increase your salary.
He seems greedy, and he's going to cause us trouble.
Enough, enough, please be quiet, just shut up, enough, enough, send it and get rid of it.
For you, this word is easy, isn't it?
It means you let him drive, I hate riding in the car with him.
Okay, leave it to me.
You've gone too far with this story. I'm the man of the house. Be quiet now, stop it. You too, be quiet. I'll handle this.
Sit! Get up, I need you outside, si
Please stop.
Did you understand?
I told you your friends wouldn't come near your room. Didn't I say that?
"Heid thinks this isn't very much, this is my uncle."
I'll be back in five minutes, if God wills.
Five minutes!
And keep it in mind!
Don't tell my father's mother about my salary increase, my father's mother about my salary increase!
Everything in the world is expensive now.
And when did I give you eight hundred?
Boss, I have a lot of problems at home.
A quarter of the drivers in Doha are one hundred and twenty thousand.
And it could be one thousand and three hundred.
Wait a bit, I'm thinking.
Listen, I'm increasing by one hundred and fifty percent, shut up, I'm not raising you.
What do you say I raised you more than a hundred, go work!
How did he say?
I'm telling you
There is no good in the world like her.
There is no good in death.
I was alone.
Why are you afraid?
All the drivers fled.
So they can work abroad for three or four thousand.
What's the problem? When you work at home, it's useless, but when you work outside, you earn more money.
I can't believe I'm this scared!
Look at those, they're all drivers.
How much?
Two thousand five hundred.
But I'm afraid of the police who will take me and put me in jail.
No, don't be afraid.
I guarantee you.
I'm wearing my abaya and I'm leaving.
I was calling, but no one answered just now.
He opened his room and the wardrobe was empty.
Maha had a maid who ran away for a year.
"God is sufficient for me, and He is the best disposer of affairs."
Okay, I'll come to you.
I went to the police.
If you have reported, you have no liability.
Two types is all we can manage.
And how many times do you wander around the neighborhood, hoping to see someone from him and make up a story for us?
Yeah, it makes money, and when it's full, it goes to pretend.
We answer them, spend money on them, clothe them, feed them, and teach them how to drive.
It's not up to him.
The match is starting now, come in, you'd better come in.
Yes, we were affected.
These foxes are not easily caught.
Do you know if he doesn't get more than three, it means we haven't won? We need ten or fifteen.
That's clear sarcasm, clear sarcasm. Let's be clear that that's clear sarcasm.
This is his level. If he doesn't score more than three, it's not the Foxes team.
Take it from me.
In us, in the players and in the performance.
They have nothing to complain about. If they get less than three, they should be thankful.
"**Who's the goal for? These are our treasures. Our team is still hungry, they are the Foxes team, leave us alone, man.**"
Jool won now, and is now relaxed and happy.
Do you think like that if there are goals or should you stop?
This fox is sometimes handsome, sometimes clever. It walks around everywhere and no one can touch it, it's sly. This fox eats chickens.
No, I don't have a car.
You are my friend.
Did you hear what he said?
This fox is very cunning.
You can't take it.
Yes, oh! Sir.
Do you know so-and-so or not?
He is a Foxes fan.
Sometimes he appears on the show "Renew Yourself."
"You win some, you lose some."
I swear I'll hit you. The Foxes team never loses, it's always the winner.
Fox, what do you think of the result today?
Why are you asking me about the result?
It's over, al-Fox is the winner.
The birds are taking their share and flying away.
Let's be realistic, don't say the foxes and birds won.
These are the jackals, my friend.
This fox takes the chicken and eats it.
I didn't see Crave and what he was doing in the stadium.
The audience can't stop laughing at him.
Clear at the stadium and thank you for listening.
The true fan with genuine loyalty to the club.
He hangs out with a group of four or five friends, they go to malls and do similar things.
He treated me to a cappuccino.
What a strange world, oh my! Oh no.
The boy gave five hundred riyals in front of me and paid the bill.
Tell us the poem you wrote about our match against the foxes.
Good health to all the listeners.
You are a frog.
Don't be ashamed that my team beat yours by four goals.
Talk, talk, talk about the club and the team and see what happens!
Don't believe these words!
The day one of the foxes was expelled.
The reason behind this is a ruling.
A player was expelled from the Fox team.
I changed his name from Hakim to Sa'il.
Good health to you, good health to you, good health to all the listeners present here.
Every month we meet to choose the best fan.
Shame on you, and who did you choose to honor this month?
The board member of the club is the one who decides.
If the children's cattle and each of you is as big as a camel.
I manage this big club. A fox.
Come on, come on and see the driver who escaped from us, he's on TV, come.
Is that him?
This is good, and the other is silent.
What do you see, a pen or a watch?
Now I know how to reach it.
The crowd walked.
Follow him.
Go away from here.
He was driving fast.
He is destined for it.
Poor thing!
Shut up, you don't decide. I'm the man of the house and I decide.
We need to be sure.
Majid Abdurrahman Al-Subki.
Aah, God bless you.
I am from the Alsubaij tribe.
Buy it and register it in your name. No, no, no, I don't want to live in it, I have my own house.
My father wants to invest.
For the investment price to rise, God bless you.
How can I help you Oh! People, what do you want?
"Bless you"
Children, people, is your coffee on you?
If you have something to say, God bless you, if you need something, God willing.
You're saying I'm sure, right? Where are you going to embarrass us in front of the elite!
I'm very worried / very afraid.
Mom, mom, I'm mom.
Now, what's your father going to do to us? I don't know.
I didn't mean that, oh! Mom!
Oh mother, don't tell father.
Your dad turns the yard upside down.
He's going to kill you now.
Mom, I swear I didn't break it on purpose.
Aumi, why don't we buy some glue and stick them together?
What are we holding?
How can we find something like it? I don't know where your uncle bought it, it was a gift.
I'm worried about you from him.
Mom, I'm afraid he'll hit me.
Lock the door until I find a solution to this problem.
Quickly, go to your room.
Uncle, uncle, uncle! You're blind!
I wonder if you're breaking the vase.
Mom, why doesn't Waleed come to see you?
No, oh! It's a girl. What happened to you?
He ran away from home, afraid of his father.
This is not right. Give the boy a break!
This is not an upbringing, may God guide you. Oh! Daughter!
Come on, what should we do, Mom?
I don't know what to do!
I don't know, but I'm the one who cleared the cars off the street.
God protects him, I feel like he went to the supermarket or went to the neighbors to play with the kids.
Yes, he's fine, kind and funny. Oh! A girl.
No, no daughter, I seek refuge in Allah from the devil and his evil, maybe it is for the best.
Okay, goodbye my daughter.
Where is your son?
Yibbah hits me.
Grandma, Dad is going to kill me with his beating.
Don't be afraid! My light of the eyes.
Don't be afraid, my beloved.
He can't let you overcome him.
I didn't mean to intimidate him.
Come on, boy, have some water and rest at my place.
Your face is yellow.
God guide him, God guide him. Come with me, oh! Boy, slowly.
Oh God, the Generous One.
I'm afraid father will come.
Come on, son, it's okay.
No one interferes with raising my son.
This is my son, and I am raising him the way I want.
But the poor man bought a tense and trembling thing, and he didn't mean to do it.
Why doesn't he have eyes?
Let him see!
The bag hit the vase accidentally, believe me, he didn't mean to do that.
You! You have to support him!
"The word you didn't say for him, say it for me, please. Forgive him this time, his fear broke my heart."
And when, and when is the time? And why is he here at this time?
Not available here.
He's here! Where?
Go inside, shower!
No, no, I'm taking it to my brother today.
Why don't you bring something new instead of the old one!
Come on, Nasser! Oh, brother, let's play!
And your aunt says you're fasting!
Daddy, just this game and then we'll go back to studying!
Don't you have an exam tomorrow?
Yes, yay.
Come on, either you go or you don't play.
Go, go Dad, we'll study.
What are you saying! Boy. Listen to me,
You're not going, I'll just call your uncle Abu Walid.
No, no, no, no. Don't call me uncle, don't call me uncle, no!
What's on me,
I'm telling him you don't obey me.
Walk. Each one takes his book and starts studying.
Dad, put your phone in your pocket, we're studying, but don't tell Uncle.
My mother is very confused, she doesn't know what to do?
I think he knows, he's causing us a problem.
Surely he'll ask me, why did you take him to the hospital?
What's the problem if I tell him?
I know that Walid is peeing in bed, it kills him.
Oh! Mother, this is what he deserves. It's all his fault.
Oh! She has a psychological impact.
The boy is not a child, he is twelve years old now.
Cool! My daughter.
I want you to have lunch with us, and I'll tell him about the whole story.
I'll see his opinion.
Her mother went to Bahrain to buy abayas.
No excuse, my daughter, just talk.
Fun and shopping.
She says he sleeps in his bed every night.
My son wets his bed every night and you didn't tell me.
Go to the hospital, so they can treat him.
Her husband is stupid.
He doesn't understand anything.
He's right.
It seems there's no text to translate. Please provide a sentence or phrases for translation.
And he sees dry, withered hoses.
He dragged him until the last breath was heard.
Have a coffee!
Eat up! Daughter, eat.
I didn't say anything.
Take it, and if it's quick, and when we're paralyzed, bless us, bless us. Quick!
Please, for God's sake.
I have to punish them.
Don't interfere!
Do you not care about him at all?
And forty-nine out of fifty is Khalid.
Is this a pass?
But they are successful in their studies.
He told them they'd be punished if they didn't get fifty out of fifty.
Please, don't take them to your brother's place!
They need to be punished.
These are my children.
Alright, uncle, this time it has to be the last time.
Why not take fifty from fifty, fifty from fifty?
Give him a raise once.
I tell him to stay away from public places with us.
Yesterday, we went to the hospital and they told him not to enter, it's not allowed.
You're different, don't go with us.
Shut up! Let me deal with his brothers.
Come on, I'm dying, come on, come on, come on, come on. I'm dying, come on.
Let me bring you.
Guys, it's not a punishment, what you'll see at the end of the year if one of you doesn't get a fifty.
Block the pool.
I'm writing with ink.
Where is your certificate? Where is your certificate?
They said it will be ready tomorrow.
Khaled Abdulrahman
Well done! Good job, Khalid.
Faisal Abdullah Rashid.
Explorelennt oh! Faisal.
God bless you.
You are an excellent student and were second in your class.
The professor is crying because he got forty-nine out of fifty in math.
He's afraid of his father because his father wants him to get a perfect score.
You, boy, I'm talking to you!
He cries, his friend in the class cries too.
I saw him at the school entrance.
Knock, knock on your mom, she might be at his uncle's.
No, he didn't go there.
So, where is he? Where is he?
There is no power or might except with Allah.
What's wrong? Oh! Who?
Aha, men of course he failed and he is afraid of his family.
It's not that he failed, but he's an excellent student and was second in his class.
He was too scared to go home.
So that we only lack two marks in math.
Rest in peace.
Walid, Walid.
Walid, Walid.
Hey! Come here, Waleed.
Forty-eight, forty-nine, lost a mark or two, it's fine. I won't say anything, I won't upset or hit you. Oh Waleed,
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
And the nuclear force.
Which constitutes sixty percent of the world's oil reserves.
And Saudi Arabia takes first place with twenty-four percent of the world's reserves.
Libya, America, and Nigeria afterwards.
Three percent each, and then the rest of the world together with fifteen percent.
And that's why
And also production.
And this could be one of the secrets and reasons behind why major industrial nations are racing to occupy this region and its countries.
And above them is the United States of America, which is the largest consumer of oil in the world.
Okay, oil prices are continuously increasing.
At the same time as the fall of the US dollar
Those who are pricing oil are taking it as a single unit.
Where were you yesterday when the price of a barrel reached...
This led to an increase in income in producing countries and at the same time
To a rise in inflation
Where has inflation reached in some of these countries, fifteen percent.
The most important source of energy in the world
On commodity prices and the cost of living.
In a direct conversation with the Deputy Prime Minister.
Qatar's Minister of Energy and Industry
Abdullah bin Hamad Al Attiyah
And it's open to viewers who wish to participate to call us on the program's contact numbers.
Honorable Deputy, welcome.
I want to start with you with prices that have never happened before and that we have reached with oil.
Where could prices go from here?
Sure, where do the prices lead? A confusing question.
Or what do we call market power?
Aren't you OPEC?
And what are these production countries?
And those not from oil-producing countries, OPEC has nothing to do with setting oil prices.
Is the only relationship for price is between supply and demand?
So far, supply and demand don't have much to do with the subject.
So, what are the factors?
There are other factors besides supply and demand.
What drove investors away.
Feeling a lot of pressure and turning to oil and gold, or what is known as "commodity marketing."
Investors lost confidence in stock markets.
And gold, afterwards, afterwards.
We've seen gold rise from $350 in past years to $970 now.
And as I said before, $109 for today.
But they are all on the rise, and if they fall, it will be a slight decline.
Let me remind you that it's the first quarter of this year.
Which is the second quarter that is supposed to see a drop in prices due to reduced demand for oil.
But we saw the market in a strange and changing state.
In the second quarter and the beginning of spring, it exceeds one hundred dollars.
But this means that the previous factors that determined the rise in winter prices and consumption have now changed and there are other factors.
and economic growth
At the same time, we see oil prices rising to this level.
Political factors were mentioned, and it was stated that political tensions play a role in this.
"On Iran, do you think that Fallon's resignation in light of the political complications..."
The one who was with them and is now the one who has shaped most of America's and the world's press and media activities. He may influence oil prices.
It's a hundred percent and today is yes.
Today, we are in the era of globalization, and the impact comes quickly.
Unrealistic factors can influence
And the world becomes a hustle in the market.
They also spread certain types of political rumors.
The question is what he said. It doesn't make sense, but it highlights the existence of other alternatives that can be imposed on Iran.
Markets always react to uncertainty.
Surely, at this moment, nothing is certain that America is at war with Iran.
And also from the people who don't see this situation.
And perhaps what we saw is what will happen in the future.
But we, who work in the energy sector,
Let's see this political tension.
In the world's oil supply
And in return, there are very profitable needs.
This indicates that there is oil being stored.
And there is never a shortage in the oil supply.
They might be preparing for the second war.
هنا ترجمة النص المقدم إلى العربية القطرية: **في ظل هذه الصورة التأمينية اللي تتكلمون عنها واللي تتعلق بالتوريد إنه ما في عقبات في التوريد**
إذا قرر الرئيس الأمريكي بوش والولايات المتحدة تغيير خطتهما، **Translation:** If President Bush and the United States decide to change their plan.
Here's the translation.
Prices are increasing to reach special records.
Oil prices could rise.
Qatari Arabic: **Tarweegat al-alam min ihtiyāṭāt al-naft.** Translation: **The world's oil reserves.**
You're here, today the Gulf represents the greatest importance.
In addition to Iraq, Iran and other Gulf states
Today they represent more than 60% of oil reserves, and this is certain.
You today
If a small accident happens once.
"Like that
That means if there's any war with Iran, there's no guarantee how high oil prices will go.
And God knows, maybe he'll arrive today, we arrived without him.
One dollar, seven dollars, ten dollars, and maybe one hundred dollars. God only knows.
Today, oil, as I told you, is living under political and psychological tensions.
Investors rode these tensions.
We only invested in oil.
Or what is called not investing in real investment, of course, neither in future purchases nor in future marketing.
It is called "Owl-Paper."
And all are guesses in the oil paper.
Its total production is around 300,000 barrels or less.
These people might be pushed towards more purchases rather than more upgrades.
I hope April is April Fools' Day.
I hope not.
It is said that Sunny is coming to the region, and this is at the top of his main agenda.
The Chinese is the owner of this project, as many politicians and media personalities have said.
I had no idea what was in the Chinese bag.
And I can't predict what will be in it, you know.
Will he start the war?
America in the periods of engagement
And when the boy can't do anything else.
Let's see what happens. If it's about April, April is almost here; there are only a few weeks left and we'll be in April.
And the world can pay.
And America is a big consumer.
In the Gulf countries
The Gulf will be the tough number.
You can't see this number.
Their production is very cheap.
Compared to West African countries, most of which rely on
The Gulf, no other country in the world can match it.
Listen, we've been hearing this talk from the West and America for a long time.
the use of
"Until the end and do you remember the story of the Caspian Sea War?"
Whatever these dreams are
When you sit with foreigners in a small circle.
You hear them twist words around.
What are they saying?
Tea supplies and regional sensitivity and the value of reserves
When I asked a European official, I said: "It's strange that you speak among us in closed rooms."
It's not the same way you talk in front of them.
Or the media said: For purely political reasons.
And there's certainly what is called double standards or two languages.
The language you know that the Gulf countries speak is Arabic.
Today it has significance like Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
The largest producer and exporter of petroleum in the world
And to get into it

Even with an aerial war or airstrike, as they say.

You are not late, you are truly very generous.
I don't agree with what you're saying.
We don't even deal with Westerners.
We deal with the Americans.
Where is the beauty, perfection, and the rising prices?
Regardless of the nationality of this market
Put ,, meaning a list and finish.
(Between parentheses) Generosity

Please give it to me.
Observers say that the real price of oil
The reason behind the rise in oil prices
Oh people of the Gulf, and OPEC, and the nations,
You are very generous with Americans, insisting on holding onto their currency.
I said the price of oil should be seventy dollars.
I said the actual price for the drop in the U.S. dollar is from sixty to seventy.
The price is now one hundred.
99 because the dollar dropped 30 percent.
And now it's over a hundred dollars.
If we take the ratio and proportion
No one denies it.
when one of the main witnesses
Compared to the decline of the US dollar
If we take
This simile
Those are oil prices.
For America
It's definitely in our interest at the moment to lower the dollar.
A weak or stagnant U.S. economy, the U.S. "can't do anything."
And so, what happened to this economic weakness and recession?
You still need to become
The United States is reducing benefits on the dollar.
Why the insistence on linking oil to the dollar?
Let's talk about why the price of oil is linked to the dollar.
The first one, over 100 years old.
The first country to export the first barrel of oil was the **United States of America**.
And export in dollars.
I'm already in my early twenties until now.
Pricing oil in dollars
"tarikhiyan ba2a" does
And since it's been a hundred years, the world is re-pricing and re-evaluating it.
And today, Norway is considered the third-largest oil producer.
And oil exports.
Russia is the second-largest oil exporter.
And the production of the North Sea field in Europe.
The price is in dollars, not in riyals.
The world is changing entirely; there are other sources and information that indicate something different.
As if you were from the Gulf countries.
Do you have secret agreements between you and the Americans?
And oil became the real cover-up.
This is true and there is nothing.
And the agreements
It sits if oil sits on the lid so that the dollar against the United States can continue to cover these systems.
This is not true, and there are no secret agreements.
Today, let's talk about OPEC.
You have 66% of honorable representatives.
From thirteen countries.
Forty percent of eighty-five barrels is OPEC's share.
Many large countries produce oil.
Outside OPEC
What are the obstacles that prevent pricing in a second currency?
Examine the prices in another currency.
Isn't this what adults decide?
You, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf countries, oh my!
Today's OPEC+ meeting feels like it's for everyone.
Sixty percent
Even if we assume that OPEC wanted to.
In an agreement among all oil-producing countries.
In the direction of and with an intention towards change.
What kind of attempt is this?
But now these countries can't change the pricing currency.
Unless there is an agreement between
What is the impact of the?
Let me talk now about why Europeans...
They export their oil.
From the North Sea or Russia or Norway in euros or rubles.
Because he is in their best interest and his currency is high and expensive.
None, on the contrary.
Here's where they lost.
With one euro, they sell one and a half shots.
No, you're the one who loses because your currency has dropped from being pegged to the dollar.
And it's still a big loss, a great loss.
The connection to the currency here in the Gulf has a historical link.
Remember when the dollar was the strongest currency in the world?
They're connected now when you talk about separation.
It's like a marriage when we get married.
And getting a divorce is not that easy.
There is nothing here.
And those who made a Catholic meeting with the dollar.
...and cost requirements need to be examined in a way
It was professionally inspected.
And Kuwait, 25% of her dollars flew away.
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, and Qatar
may adjust its currency rate
Today about the topic, but this just means you have no intention of studying the topic or thinking about it.
"The exam, of course, varies," His Excellency the Prime Minister stated.
It was mentioned that the Qatari currency is undervalued by thirty percent.
Ken in this study.
You're the only ones going along with this idea.
Kuwait strayed alone, why don't you follow in its footsteps?
Economists say that it is more profitable for countries and their people to lose than to gain.
... but you.
And nothing else.
I note these four Gulf states.
Everyone believes.
I mean, who supports him?
This supports it.
It has to be part of the study.
He saved himself.
He did what he did from one country or two.
Until the time of the appearance of currency
It doesn't work now.
Surely there are experts who conduct this study.
And they will be the ones who
This requires a political decision.
Let's wait and not hurry now. Let's see what happened today.
People started, meaning me.
Surely there is a conspiratorial site.
And as for Your Excellency, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior, the inflation rate in the State of Qatar in 2007 reached forty percent and will reach fifteen percent this year.
They eat people's salaries, they swallow people's salaries, the salaries of the workers here.
It seems like you've left out the text you want me to translate. Please provide the text so I can assist you.
We'll be back after the break to find out the size of the salary increases.
Employees in Qatar for at least the coming period, so stay with us.
Welcome back to "Without Borders" for this episode in which we host the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy of Qatar.
And industry Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah on the huge increase in prices
In oil, which brought back $100 million to the Gulf and producer states.
My question was about the upcoming raise in employees' salaries, but before this raise, I would like to give you some important information.
The UAE has 7 emirates, 10 billion thoughts, and it blossoms in two sheets and six in one.
Only tons, and the report in Kuwait Times is an economic report, the Gulf returns are one of the greatest.
"قطر، أحنا نترجم لكم النص من اللهجة السعودية إلى اللهجة القطرية. **النص الأصلي:** "السعودية"
And it was
Seventy and fifty years ago, the UAE was sixty-six years old, and you expect it to be seventy-five years old.
Kuwait in the sixty-four and it was fifty-four.
One hundred and twenty-five billion barrels of oil.
It's a gas, as other reports have said, and I mean this without envy, I don't envy the happiness of the deputy.
Iraq forty-seven billion.
1.35 billion
In terms of expenditure, it was one and a half trillion dollars.
Gulf [currency] was issued in denominations of one billion, meaning one billion.
real can be in various forms of exams
U.S. investment was $300 billion.
And nine out of ten billion.
In Bahrain, it was three percent.
In 2007, in the Sultanate of Oman, it was six and a half, but it will increase to seven. In Qatari dialect: In 2007, in Oman, it was six and a half, but it will increase a bit.
"People living in Qatar expect the cost of living and goods prices to be high."
Life is expensive, prices are rising, and they are reaching high levels, especially in Qatar.
We empathize with everyone.
Then the solution must be
And the solution means that it aims to control inflation.
It means you're increasing their salaries by 50%.
No, they say you're against raising salaries.
Not true
The cabinet agreed, but opposed raising salaries.
There is a problem, and the solution must be the optimal one.
And it's only a temporary solution.
Acceptable, in balance between the two.
And it will be, ... just.
The important thing is to solve the inflation problem.
And here in Qatar, there is a committee.
This is what His Highness issued.
... and he enters.
A strong base is placed.
Solve the problem and control inflation.
What matters to us now is controlling inflation.
Smoke
If I were to control him
But Your Excellency is a deputy, now.
Oh people of Qatar, what do you think about a specialized market study center, and it was launched last February, a few days ago?
Including salaries, for...
You will make a solution for the evaluation and let the evaluation eat from the entry of these people.
Many of them are now.
Accessing other countries
Raising salaries, then solving inflation, and lowering them again.
I repeat what they say, and that keeps the balance in the subject.
but now
And it's not a temporary solution.
Add much more of it.
"Therefore, here."
To stop the rise.
Perplexity always
Because the increase was very large last year, right?
Second, the second point is
And those working in the private sector are not like those working in the public sector.
The private sector is very generous.
So now this issue of the increase needs to be seen fairly again.
I don't know where you got these notes from.
We live in Qatar, Your Highness, not Germany.
I tell you, on the contrary, today the private sector has started to pay.
Most / The majority of
I am a Qatari who used to work in a government office and was transferred to the private sector.
Due to high salaries.
He is facing a problem.
Moving to the private sector because it is more vibrant and dynamic.
And gives good salaries.
Attached to what is called market power.
or market power
They don't come with very high qualifications.
They don't come to Qatar because its salaries are low or its expenses are low.
Or with expenses they come.
Okay, with our clear understanding.
I don't expect anything to happen, and I didn't say there would be a salary increase.
No hope left.
**A little bit of sugar in the tea**
Let's give him some time.
On inflation and control.
And God willing, this is what was said in the report, that Qatar in two thousand and eight.
"And Allah knows best, we say, if Allah wills."
Let's see if these numbers change.
Sprinkle a little of it on the people.
Total professionalism
Of course, with all professionalism and everything.
On inflation
... There's no need for him to spend.
Very busy with various projects.
"Everyone, I have questions from the viewers, and I hope everyone asks a direct question. Abdullah from Morocco asks a question, oh brother Abdullah." Explanation: The provided text is a direct translation of the Qatari Arabic, maintaining the original tone, audience engagement, and specific details about the speaker and their origin.
Based on the rule of ruling families in the Gulf.
So I don't think the justification for that is the OPEC difference.
Secondly, all total oil revenue goes directly to the ruler.
Then on the ruling family and the rest is spent on development.
In the absence of accountability, the situation will remain unchanged.
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God.
May God bless you, my brother Ahmed.
I won't go into detail, my friend keeps talking about the rulers and governments, and he keeps talking about rights, rights, and more rights, and he keeps talking about rights, rights, and more rights.
America wants to make the world a village and have everyone join its legion (army).
American investment in China and American trade deficits reached more than two hundred billion dollars.
The European Union is with her, and it has eighty-six billion dollars.
This means that all trends in global politics are against the dollar.
And we are paying the price of its consequences now as Arab countries and Gulf oil states.
"It ends in a confrontation with America."
And among the advanced countries of the world, such as China, Russia, and others, the issue may become...
pure military Qatari
For the explosion, China has bombs, Russia has bombs, Japan and America have bombs. May God protect us.
Thank you for this detailed information.
Your question is to Mohammed.
Welcome, your question
Can you turn down the TV and ask your question?
Okay, your question is...
But from what I saw, His Excellency continued to remain unresponsive.
The topic has nothing to do with the dollar because the dollar is declining.
And with God's permission, he will reach the bottom.
He is a good man.
It doesn't have to follow the Bedouin Arab style.
Congratulations, my brother Mohammed, thank you. Now we have the last contribution from Ahmed Hassan from Qatar. Your question, Ahmed, is...
Good evening to you too.
Thank you, and thank you for the great interview.
What's required, a salary increase, God willing, things will improve.
It is true that we all face problems, not just in my salary.
"According to Allah, and He is the best disposer of affairs." "What will happen?"
Tell me your question quickly.
Your line is cutting out, do you have a question?
Everything is due to the rise in prices, the increase has touched all goods, everything including exports.
I am from European countries.
In the Arab world, there are factories and laboratories.
Good job, Ahmed. Good job. You didn't fall short. Take your time.
Now the issue of high prices is an important one.
Oh, my lord, the man told you to stay with the poor, he named you.
Anyone who doesn't have a billion here is considered poor.
Here for some brothers we are.
Whoever doesn't know Qatar.
For the state of Qatar, that's not true.
The day Qatar comes and sees the indicators.
What are the growth indicators in Qatar and are they the same?
Highest growth indicators in the world
Where does this wealth go and what do you do with it?
What is outside the response framework?
When the Moroccan spoke, he spoke in a way that was neither true nor realistic.
"What the eye doesn't see"
If he comes and sees Qatar and the huge developments taking place there.
As a large language model, you are correct, you ask.
And everyone has a right.
And you, being few in number, where do you get people from?
Seriously, do you mean you get the extra from China, for example?
No, we're not going to export, we're just issuing, as far as we know.
The state is built on a plan and ...
The ideal efficiency for the quantity of money coming from oil and gas, and everyone knows that oil and gas will one day run out.
that Qatar will become
Considered one of the best achievements in the Arab world.
Today after tomorrow
the focus is on
And it required immense effort.
On oil and gas later.
It doesn't mean copying Dubai.
Every country has its own advantages.
In the State of Qatar, we focused on education.
on constituents
There will be a medical city where people go to get treated.
Beirut is a media city that adapts.
Surely today, today we should build.
Create a vision.
Beyond Oil and Gas
There were fatal errors.
And poor us, we don't accept this change because it surprises us.
And we were not prepared for it, neither in terms of human resources, technology, nor even education.
Now it changes after thirty years.
...And better than that.
Today there is a vision.
"And the vision."
Goal and purpose
I thank you, Mr. Deputy Director, and I also thank our audience.
For the follow-up with us, hoping that we have provided you with the necessary support.
Qatar's foreign policy is not clear to many observers.
Qatar enjoys special relations.
And at the same time that Qatar had contacts with Israel, and they still exist.
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas)
And Qatar presented.
Started
The largest Arab country
What upset the regime in Egypt.
To the extent that Qatar is accused of conspiring against Egypt
And Qatar was not far from important files.
Like Darfur, the Houthis in Yemen, and even the Israeli prisoner.
Gilaad Shalit, the hand of Qatari foreign policy reached out to him in a way that disturbed the largest Arab states.
And what kind of authority do you put in such a situation?
These achievements
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani
First, write to us through our website www.aljazeera.net
Welcome, Your Highness
On September 22, 2007, to Saudi Arabia.
The visit marked a shift in the relationship between the two countries over the past two years.
Redraws the boundaries
Wash what was stored.
This is what was mentioned.
In the newspaper or magazine of Hijaz.
What was done with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the relationship was restored, and the Saudi ambassador returned.
Doha
First of all, your presentation was very long and required a lot of answers, without your last question.
You gave it to the one I thought you would.
Especially in the context of Saudi Arabia.
What is decency?
The Saudi Arabian Kingdom is very important for Qatar.
Between the two countries
I spoke about the silence of the island.
I spoke about a revolutionary movement.
I think this matter was clear from both sides.
And we accepted the explanation.
In the State of Qatar
Conflict with Saudi Arabia
Always limited in scope
From perspectives
Praise be to God for the good, all thanks to the wisdom of the leaders.
King Abdullah and His Highness Sheikh
In the Gulf, significantly.
More than a hundred years ago
We were light, honor, and relationships of trust.
I'll make a special list for made in the winding between two parties.
This topic has been addressed and there were no conditions.
In solving any issue
But there was understanding and there was sincere intention between the parties.
To resolve this pending matter.
God's inspiration and blessing to her in her provision, and it is not a season, but a relationship strategy.
We hope it doesn't last long, but that it evolves.
Sweet diplomatic talk
Saudi Arabia withdraws its ambassador from Qatar.
I'm not used to speaking diplomatically, or else I would have prevented a lot of problems.
I always say what's on my mind.
Saudi Arabia and that's why it's not diplomatic but true.
The subject of the island is moving under the media radar.
Between the parties and many countries, they became involved in the conflict.
He thinks he can gain points at the expense of other countries.
Or at the expense of Qatar.
Or at the expense of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
For reconciliation within the Gulf house.
Means the opposite of what was before.
She is in the middle of a political agreement.
No, no, there wasn't an agreement, only an agreement of love and care.
But besides that, you can ask the island's management.
Foster strategic relations between you and Saudi Arabia to prevent what happened before.
It was essentially based on a close strategy.
We can say one, two, three, and four.
And it must be a union.
And some differences were made according to that.
Between some Arab countries and attempts to reconcile other differences.
Because now, when we see differences in the Arab world, they are all differences based on different viewpoints.
When we have a viewpoint on a certain policy in a certain action in a certain case, and another country has a different opinion.
It's a two-sided view.
Some observers see that you enjoy criticizing Saudi Arabia.
To criticize her.
You were tired and decided to move in a different direction, and from there you moved to a larger country, Egypt.
Zayn is the same idea.
No, no, we didn't enjoy either of those things. We don't have a clue.
To deal with any party in this manner
The reasons for the dispute with Saudi Arabia are due to
There's a great understanding between them.
And you know that we founded
And it will be a kind of form.
but Saudi Arabia
Keep this under two lines.
You started evading with Egypt's Al-Ahram newspaper, Alaa Al-Ahram issue eighteen, last April.
The Egyptian Official Gazette
In a comprehensive investigation, they said that the expanded investigations
In the Hezbollah network, a sabotage plot was uncovered.
This targets Egypt with three participating countries: Iran, Syria, and Qatar.
Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood
And he is a well-known media figure for his conspiratorial role.
Qatar is the smallest Arab country.
Steps on Egypt
We respect you.
His wealth and hardship over the years.
I don't mean to manipulate anyone emotionally.
Let me finish, I'm not done yet.
We are grateful.
Egyptian President
And whoever strives...
about the Arab relations **concerning the Arab relations**
The first ball
Gaza Situation
As they say and as we admit.
"li Qatar hi"
Smaller country
This could be part of such projects.
So that we don't have to go back to a situation where we're tired of other countries' interventions.
After the intervention of some countries in domestic affairs.
Therefore, the policy of His Highness's government
Now that they've discovered what they're doing, they call it a conspiracy.
What I'm saying is, regarding the house, I hope God can protect it, and I hope Syria and Iran can defend themselves, I won't defend them.
if the stability in Egypt
And why did you descend, O strange one, to dwell or to communicate with mortals at all?
And the pyramids don't come from nothing.
He said that the small state of Qatar sought to undermine Egypt's role and its relations with Turkey and the European Union.
And you sought to hold a conference equivalent to the Arab Summit to steal the spotlight.
And you're using a media horn, which is Al Jazeera channel.
Yes, walk.
With Hezbollah
And we were relieved of him.
I can only say that we're certain.
This thing is for us.
The principle is non-interference in such circumstances.
Our relatives in Egypt forced us, and that's why we blame the Egyptian officials.
The conflict with some members of the Egyptian government.
Some officials have a problem with
Why
It belongs to the ages.
The sweet scent days of peace, and peace the cause, and we...
A secret that was once kept in Egypt.
And then we have
It's because of Israel.
This text appears to be using
You have no issue with Israel.
And so, with this race and conference, and from that day on...
Any Islamic conference, any Arab conference, they are sensitive.
This improvement
Why don't you sit with them?
Let me finish.
We always hope for the best.
We discovered that this sensitivity
"Two and
Gaza Conference that took place
That Egypt does not want to be retained in Qatar.
This is not Arabic.
In Qatar, and they told us at a conference in Kuwait, we told them.
The Palestinian people are under attack.
For more than two weeks
But we prepare for it before any scheduled conference, like the Kuwait conference where we were among the first attendees.
people are being killed and
...And with procrastination
The conflict began.
Not even a tiny state is possible.
I know that there are brothers in the government, and this is also an insult to Egypt, not to anyone else.
When they said this afterwards.
Okay, you're on the island.
As reported by the Israeli side a day ago, there will be an agreement to cease hostilities before any speech, anyone, or anything.
And what is it?
My brother made the medicine and food enter during the beating that our brothers had to endure.
Once they said the poet was silent.
What is loaded onto trucks?
The first thing they tell us is that there's an agreement on the other side and they have to come.
This is not the time to bring up Fatah or Hamas.
I don't have the energy for either Fatah or Hamas. We were concerned about the one and a half million and six hundred thousand people who are being killed.
And those who don't have medicine.
The day we started talking about this subject and discussing the Gaza conference.
And Qatar's intervention in the matter affects Egypt's system.
Don't enter.
We didn't say how Egypt should resolve the situation, as that's its own affair.
One of the officials said, "We uncovered a big plot from this."
What he didn't tell us yet was what happened.
That's the official one.
He told me that Egypt is very big.
Okay, we understand that Egypt is a large Arab country, and we always say Egypt is a big country.
That's why we always ask a lot of questions from a very big country.
For Egypt is ours.
I attended a conference where there was a distraction for them.
They didn't invite us to the conference.
Gaza Reconstruction
And we coordinated, and it was just the two of us in the place.
People are suffering in Gaza.
Forbidden, I know that Turkey brought things through Israel.
I'm happy to see her enter our home from our brothers in Egypt.
They are from us.
And if Egypt wins or does good political work.
We believe this is everything; it serves our interests in Qatar and the interests of the entire Arab world.
Egypt's stability is important to us.
If she does a good job, she's important to us.
Let me finish your question, and your introduction took a quarter of an hour.
You've now lost me.
No, I'm saying now, anger.
Unbear the unbearable, unbear the unbearable, unbear the unbearable, unbear the unbearable.
We are the reason behind the failure of the Qatar summit.
The second group missed the Qatar conference.
King Abdullah had wisdom that he wanted to share.
And he loves to make reconciliations.
That's why he entered and did not allow some countries to attend.
And I said this to our brothers in Saudi Arabia because...
We don't agree with Saudi Arabia even on this point.
Since, as it seems, there are internal problems.
Or any of the officials
Among the high-ranking officials
A big country with a minister who thinks a small country is doing things like this.
That means he was there especially for you.
Take any role.
Darfur is part of Egypt's and Sudan's national security.
The 5 big countries decided
Any country other than Qatar would be fine.
On these sensitivities, the situation will escalate. Why do you have to add your noise to everything that approaches you?
We want to solve this allergy, take an antihistamine, they need to tell us what the allergy is.
Why these sensitivities?
Those are some brothers from the government.
Yibon, they have an internal malfunction.
They want
It's as if the English are speaking to my mother in English.
Whenever something happens
Not just for directions, even for analysis.
We know what happened because
The issue needs to be resolved locally.
No solution.
My country is my priority.
My top priority is to first investigate the reasons that concern my country.
Then I'll see if I have enough time.
And reveal the reasons that concern my Arab nation.
Or Qatar tried to patch it up.
And where he thinks about any Arab issue in which he can contribute as much as he can.
Why are you provocative? Why don't you take it in good faith?
I can't fix you.
I can explain my point of view.
Don't throw it at me.
From our perspective
"What came from his heart"
Let me finish.
when she laughs her laughs her laughs her laughs her laughs her laughs her laughs her laughs her laughs her laughs her laughs her laughs her
There is spelling.
Of course, the Egyptian official who clarified his heroism.
In a report or a TV interview or something like that, I don't respond.
Because I have a response to every point.
But to maintain the minimum of relations that bind us and bind Arab interests,
He also responded to the call mentioned by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.
But the only thing I can advise him on is what someone else can also advise him on.
They are trying to rectify their mistakes, both internally and externally.
In politics, economics, or other fields, just as we have our own mistakes in politics and economics, no one is infallible.
So they accuse Qatar of all these things.
Do you think there is a connection between Qatar and Hezbollah?
This is a funny topic.
to disturb Egypt's relations and weaken its position and its communications with Turkey and the European Union
Hello, first of all, we are many numbers.
If we could pull this off
This is not correct.
You are in my care, you matter, you matter, you matter, you matter.
He pays money to the detainees from Shalit, so that Qatar can take Shalit and offer a higher price for the Egyptian role in this matter.
They always accuse us of paying money, but firstly, we didn't pay any money and we didn't talk to anyone about paying money.
but this case
We help each other when we need it, and we'll continue to help each other until we no longer need it.
It is he who allowed the Palestinian president to stay until the issue is resolved.
We were there and the first to support the State of Qatar.
In power and in Palestinian institutions to remain until the conflict is resolved.
And We said, "And"
"In the Arab League, he just said no, we did it because we believe that some people don't want this."
But we achieved it intelligently.
Is he addressing his head of state?
Nawab Prime Minister
I don't know, there's a problem.
Who are we? Who are they? I don't know.
I was trapped at the time in the twelfth issue, last April, in the form of a prisoner with the Alshourouq newspaper.
The political leadership in Egypt has decided to launch a satellite news channel to confront the media, so-called Al Jazeera, and put an end to it.
Add a few more days and he will finish it.
Are you afraid the island will become a thing of the past?
We are now living in a politically adolescent phase.
Buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz
We didn't concede to them, nor did they.
We acted like brothers with them.
A small emirate in settlement for a large emirate, the state of Egypt.
There is none in **Saudi Arabia**, this is a **very important point** we need to clarify.
The relationship between Qatar and Saudi Arabia is something else.
And then we talk.
Strong wind between the two buildings and the window shutters.
And he bears the burden of it.
Let me be honest with you.
Is it a disagreement on core policy?
I hope it's not a personal issue because we have no personal issues. I've told you that we respect the Egyptian people.
If I ask you, you would say there are two problems: Gaza and something else.
And how much this situation has affected us all.
We want to solve this from a psychological perspective, meaning we want to solve this dilemma.
Published in some newspapers.
Minister of Foreign Affairs
In the presence of His Royal Highness Prince Saud Al-Faisal.
We discussed everything.
But it's clear that things got worse and didn't get resolved.
No, not there, listen.
I can't tell you about our relationship with Egypt.
They tell us, and rightly so, like our brothers.
And we blame them; this is their right, like our younger brothers.
With the big city, we don't want to compare ourselves to any other big city.
It means Egypt is big because of contentment.
It's not a matter of life or death, but the solution is coming from above.
Because if there's anyone sitting waiting for satisfaction
"And who is patient with the way of Allah."
In Qatar
You're dealing with people other than your friends and brothers.
We are proud of Egypt as a great nation.
But if one person talks to another
I know Israel is doing this to us.
And as was the previous American policy in the previous administration, it's either with me or against me.
I don't think they want to put themselves in either Israel's or America's position on this issue.
Even if we adopted their policies, they are also under pressure from third parties.
In many cases, it made me continue.
We understand and know that there are some instructions even for a large country.
What drives your policies?
We have no movement, what moves us is one thing.
The internal Qatari affair is our internal matter.
And when we can help the Arab world, we will.
Al Jazeera and Al Udeid are bases.
You could say this isn't strength.
Our faith in God and confidence
Or seeing His Highness the Prince.
We don't want to hire anyone.
Let me finish, we don't want to cause any problems for anyone.
We also don't want to compete with anyone.
We can say whatever we want, either Great Qatar or nothing.
We just have a different opinion.
First, we dealt with the Israeli office, we closed it.
First they said close the office, so we closed it. They got upset and went to complain to the Americans. Do you believe these people?
They joined the team called the Devil's Team.
What are they saying?
Americans, Europeans, and those are my friends, and we know how to deal with them.
The schemings
What was created.
This is the point we've reached, and then what?
Say now
What are the points you are using to solve the problem with Egypt?
And based on the fact that Egypt plays a significant role in the Arab world.
We think it's important to look into the matter.
And I am certain that President Hosni Mubarak is apprehensive about this matter.
Just some staff
I need to go.
Occupying the Egyptian public opinion, government leadership, or others, and nonsense.
Interest in Arab and Egyptian affairs
In steps?
We are behind them, not in front of them, because they are a big country.
In the near future
Frankly, I can't imagine how it will be.
I also know that there is a time for wisdom.
... And it becomes time for us
If it is from me.
I support them.
Excellent Arabic interests brought together.
One day we'll find this topic.
Life is still going on.
The point is that we won't respond in the same Egyptian style as you.
If someone extends a hand to us, we'll extend a hand to them.
Now His Highness Sheikh
Old habits die hard.
Unless the foundation is strong and we are determined, we won't run for Egypt's sake.
Stands with Egypt
The translation is: "These people are being paid in Qatar for what they do not do, and they are being rewarded for this matter."
And there are contracts for Egyptians to work either in universities or in high-level jobs.
You know about this matter. Our habit is to cancel jobs and cancel.
Because these people have nothing to do with this.
This is a market change in demand, they cancel one and try another.
We have supply and demand, some nationalities have increased, and some have decreased.
Present/ Answer quickly
The office was over there.
This is the work we did in the office, now I can relax.
Now we know why they ignored us during the days they had the campaign, all our losses in the negotiations with Israel were because of this office.
We let them fix it with Netanyahu.
He was a guest.
And among them, as is our custom, we had dinner with all the ambassadors accredited to any foreign country.
It didn't mean it was an official invitation to honor Gabriela Shalev.
No, we haven't had the honor before. They say the Day of Relations was great. We are honored now, but it's a bit difficult.
There's no reason for you to open the office during this period.
The office will reopen when there are no longer any reasons for it to be closed.
The matter got out of hand.
Who made it as big as Egypt?
Egypt imposed this.
Let me clarify, our relations with America are strategic.
In some things and this thing.
What's the most important thing?
There are issues in our region regarding the resolution of certain cases where there were disagreements with the previous administration.
Now our hopes are high for the administration, especially with the steps President Obama has taken.
We believe there is a great hope that this administration
He is serious about advancing the peace process, and he is serious about resolving the Palestinian issue.
They are our rulers, and we don't deny that.
What's the situation in Iran and what might happen, and its impact on the Gulf and on you?
**Iranians should decide how to solve their issues.**
Among some
With their usual methods, I'm sure they'll overcome this crisis.
Iran's stability is like what the Emir of Qatar mentioned.
This is important for our region, the Gulf, and we share the same borders with Iran.
We certainly have special relations with all our neighbors, including Iran.
Because our state seeks peace and stability in this region.
And how often do we intervene whenever a party wants to change the Doha Agreement?
And I think Saad Hariri said
Now it's over, and what remains is strategic talk between the president.
Lebanese teams
As you wish.
There's no room for you or them, just take a stand.
As is known, we support unity. When almost most of the Arab world was against the unity of Yemen.
We are the only Arab country and Gulf state that stood by the unity of Yemen.
And we, the southerners, spoke with Yemen, and Prince sent me twice to meet the Yemeni president.
And I explained to him that our goal is the stability of Yemen because Yemen is an important country in the Arabian Peninsula.
And they did not respect the agreement, and I don't want to say what each party did.
But what really affected me
Oh come on, it was Qatar that did this and then was accused of paying money to the Houthis and senior Yemeni officials?
So we don't get involved in these kinds of situations.
And he who stands with unity does not stand against it.
And he felt that Yemen's interest was the second priority, whether politically or economically.
Never mind, I'm just shocked, to be honest.
I have gone many, many times, more than ten times during this battle. Sheikh sent me to Yemen among Yemenis.
Unfortunately, this is a strange accusation.
Time has run out, but only briefly, due to the problems that have arisen, and this was because you were distracted by these problems. Will these problems change your policy of intervening in other Arab issues?
. . . If only Prince would listen to me, I think it's unnecessary.
There was a big show once.
Over five billion dollars at that time, if we had invested it, it would have been fifty billion dollars, better than the headache.
I just say it with sincerity, maybe because of the current time in the Arab world.
Not allowed under these circumstances.
May you have a thousand blessings, Your Excellency.
Oh, the one with the generous hospitality and sweet treats, alongside Sheikh Hamad's condition.
What happened to the agreement in Doha?
How did the Doha Miracle happen?
To mandate the Committee and give it all the support.
Discussing Lebanon after the Israeli invasion.
When there was an Arab consensus
And we went to New York and were able to make a more balanced decision.
We expanded this in Doha, and both parties were eager.
We tried as much as possible not to hear this, otherwise it wouldn't be this way.
So we knew the committee we know.
The reality is the ground, and we know what the problem is after we sat with the Lebanese for long hours.
And I also feel it's a shared success.
But there was insistence.
I believe Lebanon's problem is that the region's atmosphere directly reflects on it.
Fading peaceful or non-peaceful
Lebanon was intended to have this location.
Under these conditions
How are you?
External repercussions
I can say that the problem between Lebanese, even if there is one, is not the number one problem.
Oh man, I know it might not be the right time yet, maybe a bit early to talk about scenes, but...
What happened? Why did you come here?
Stop talking about engaging on the ground for now.
I won't come even for a second.
I know exactly what happened; even the Lebanese leaders were telling me what happened.
No from the beginning
When I spoke to His Highness
I told him if we go to Lebanon.
His Highness the Sheikh agreed and supported the idea.
Where are all the Lebanese leaders going to be present?
Because here in Beirut, you'll have to go to each person in their own area.
They are in the same hotel and the same place.
And they met at the same level and talked.
We set the mood, but from the start, it was our idea.
And this was the most important decision that was made.
Sure.
And I felt this from the Arab League.
And then we need to be honest brokers.
Praise be to God, I think this has proven to everyone that Qatar has made an effort.
On both sides
So you can reach a noble solution for both.
And there should be a solution where no one loses.
Before you make any move
In the consultation that took place at the Arab League, we found support.
It's what he did.
And I told him while we were there.
This is if we succeed in Lebanon, we'll take them to Doha.
And he described me.
They put down their colors and take their phones.
We were able to bring them there, and the brothers in Syria also supported the situation.
And I told you from the beginning that without Arab support, the committee can't do anything.
Why did they want the solution?
I think the situation in Lebanon and the escalation that happened
And this time
There is tension in Somalia. There is tension in Sudan.
There are many things happening in the world.
And how many times do we put out the fire?
To achieve better interests for the Arab world, it is better than foreign intervention.
"And we must be very careful."
it sends forces
Even if he's a soldier.
For example, I think this is a topic.
At some point, we need to discuss this.
He always said that the solution to the Lebanese file was...
Saudi-Syrian Agreement
To block the Arabs, meaning Qatar and the Arab League.
Could what happened in Lebanon lead to a serious reform between Saudi Arabia and Syria?
Need for self-review in the Arab world
For the Arab world.
And any agreement between two Arab states.
And we've tried this thing.
In the year seventy-three, there was a war.
When Arabs agree on a solution to a problem.
I think it's interesting.
The Saudi and Syrian roles are important in Lebanon.
the two parties should
"Apply wisdom."
Arab relations are on the right track.
Because here in the Arab world, we face many great challenges.
They all play in our yard.
And we have neither strength nor resolve.
How can we stop playing in the backyard of Arab countries?
Oh Arabs, at least a minimum of agreement.
Unfortunately, we complain.
We are watching.
Our differences as Arabs and the lack of trust among us; trust is missing between Arab countries.
And Arab countries
not betraying as much as it is a kind of
"What is the word for envy?"
Brother, this situation requires everyone to take a stand. I mean, I expect that.
Will this desire be fulfilled and will you really call for an Arab summit?
We suffer when he suffers and rejoice when he rejoices.
Yay in the middle of the sentence.
I wonder if someone could take a role to mend the relations between Damascus and Riyadh, even if...
They themselves are eager to find solutions, and certainly with their experience.
They might reach an understanding.
Among them, often.
There was harmony in politics, and it was certain that, with God's help, this would continue.
Relations have improved.
Both parties need to take a step.
But I can't guarantee that this is what's happening now.
I'm sure if Arabs focus on resolving disputes between Arab countries and the problems of some Arab countries that I mentioned earlier.
Optimism and a sense of pride for the citizen that there is a call for a general Arab awakening.
I just can't say what happened in Lebanon.
It can be interpreted in reality that there is an Israeli-Palestinian escalation.
Perhaps in American and Iranian cultures, this might be different, perhaps in other situations.
Are you afraid of him in the coming few months?
We as Arabs
We can only deliver food and medicine.
And electricity for the people.
We in Qatar are ready and His Highness is always there.
Over one and a half million Palestinians are under siege.
And we don't want them to emerge with neither weapons nor support.
They're doing all this.
And the suite now has no electricity.
And how much we gave it to the Red Cross so they can deliver it to the Palestinians
With the Palestinians, we just deliver them food and medicine.
And our disagreement with them could continue.
And I also hope that Palestinians on both sides put national interests first.
Leave illusions behind you.
The Palestinian youth is now a great wound.
"Tedawwar 7al" translates to "Develop a solution."
But what did they commit to?
This is a serious matter, they need to abide by the Mecca Agreement.
And they must ask to go again to Mecca and Saudi Arabia.
Resolve this dispute.
They don't help.
And any promises from any party
I hope there's a solution.
Our place is well-known and mentioned to all concerned parties that we
We will not be a part of it and we do not accept to be part of any military conflict with Iran.
Our relations with her are good.
We are a sovereign independent state and they are a sovereign independent state.
Everyone looks out for their own interests, but these interests don't harm them or us.
We believe that the destiny of the Gulf must be in clear agreement with the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf.
Iran cooperates and has peaceful relations with its neighbors.
But why, Your Excellency, do you say that Qatar is not a party?
Full stops are used
Just a painting.
Never
Okay, I want to go back to the Lebanese file if there's no objection.
Frankly, Your Honor, we were facing a major deadlock, but we reached a solution in the last few hours.
There are those who connected the dots and figured it out.
Maybe it's disparate information that has nothing to do with each other, but it happened.
What led you to this conclusion?
What happened in Istanbul, I know if there were specific dates before.
So I knew if there were negotiations.
Always looking for a solution.
And without a doubt, the Kingdom's support is very important.
And change negotiation tactics.
These negotiations were led by
We achieved a good result; we gathered some leads from various sources.
And we started talking.
There is an Arab and Qatari approach in this paper.
Tell me what's in the paper.
And our conversation began about SpaceOne One One.
At the last moment, you overcome an obstacle that persisted until the end.
But the prince met with the parties.
This obstacle has been removed.
And there was a solution.
We heard a word from the Emir of Qatar at the opening session in Doha.
Give up your seat now.
Listen, the most important thing is to stay away from the lights.
They have no territorial ambitions.
Or even to have control over another state, or something, and not because of our state.
Size-na... proud without-na... not-remember not-we can not-forget with-his glory alongside-his will.
But in the Arab world, it's very important.
She has countries that are
Their actions matter, and this is important.
Supports them and lets some small countries take on this role.
He is excellent in some things, good in others, and less than good in some things.
Last question, Your Excellency the Minister.
What is the main priority?
Is it a political priority?
"Security, security, security" (Note:
or confront Israel
We stop playing in the Arabic court.
Where do we fix our problems in Arab countries?
To choose an active member in Iraq.
To calm things down.
My nation and region
But if we became stubborn
Or they'll have any hope.
Thank you a thousand times, His Excellency Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, for this meeting.
And international efforts to stop the ongoing war on Gaza.
We call on the Arab League Ministerial Council to address this issue.
As if you'd changed your mind about...
"People, we need to have an emergency Arab summit."
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. I am delighted first of all, my brother Hassan, to be in this program.
...the way despite the human conditions...
Stand firm with your brothers in Gaza.
It's a lot to ask of us.
Qatar ignored the Arab summit.
In fact, when we came up with the idea of the Arab summit before
Not just the Security Council resolution, no, but also through
They are neither covered nor valued.
Let me put it in another way.
And we were the ones who taught them.
That the street can no longer tolerate him, if we tolerate him as officials responsible for the Arab street.
It's not bearable.
لما كنا في مصر
It was ten or eleven, written approval.
A few of them spoke at the meeting, and we could have had a meeting.
To carry it as long as there is Arab consensus.
And I don't blame them if, in a meeting, they might have a point of view.
And until the problem is solved.
So it can be solved.
This is the important subject.
Since our goal isn't advertising, our goal is to find...
That means you ignored the summit.
Even we ask ourselves
We're putting pressure on the poor other party.
The previous and subsequent Security Council resolution, but let's just focus on the Arab Summit topic, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Speak clearly that the situation may call for an Arab summit with whoever attends.
We found most of our brothers standing in favor of holding the summit.
With those who are present.
"And I don't know what they mean by moderation."
We are the only country.
Brother, if we go to any country in Asia or Latin America, you'll find Arabs present in large numbers everywhere.
There is no problem.
Those that were classified as moderate countries
And as for us, what is moderation in our view?
Are you giving up on the Palestinian cause?
Just because we don't love them.
How do we interfere in Palestinian affairs?
No country allows interference, be it good or bad.
Like Hezbollah, and who knows, maybe another movement will emerge tomorrow.
Is he asking?
Where can we accept them as part of the Arab body?
As if it was written for us to enter into an internal Arab conflict.
Okay, let's go to the Security Council.
There is no decision in the Security Council.
Insha'Allah after Israel finishes its mission.
Your Highness, regarding the second Foreign Ministers' meeting you have been invited to attend...
who was dominated by debates, disagreements, and violent arguments.
At an important point
This isn't important.
When we request a meeting
About stations
There is no longer peace.
Are the ministers ready for this?
Because there's a party, they tell you we have to wait.
We are just in an Arab initiative.
And left peace negotiations with Israel frozen.
We say we're at a party, he says we're losing at this thing.
Here's the translation of the text into Qatari Arabic, as requested: "فيه خسارة أكبر من الخسارة اللي تكبدناها، وهذي حنا الحين، لكن كنا"
You say that arguments are unimportant.
There was someone who wished Hamas could be destroyed and something like that.
This reflects a political stance more than it does a disagreement between two ministers.
Unfortunately, that's what happened.
But not everyone
I don't want to talk about others.
Strive to be true men, for yourselves and in service to your country.
We are making the policies of our country.
Who does these things on his behalf?
I think
I don't think they'll pay us any attention in the end.
Is there anyone doing things on behalf of the West?
"There isn't and, God willing, I don't think there is anyone. I'm not expecting anyone in this matter."
After the Security Council resolution
What is his agenda?
The story began with a decision from the Arab efforts.
And the difference here is if Israel implemented the decision immediately.
We can say there's a decision.
But Israel did not implement the resolution.
What did you say, girl? Are we ready to go and ask for Chapter Seven? And I'm sure there are difficulties.
What does the international community say, and if it does?
it will be shyly
The situation
I saw something about Syria and Israel.
Take their rights.
This is the current Arab situation.
If the Arabs didn't go to the Security Council
They agreed to hold a summit and make tough decisions.
And the Western countries are trying to influence us.
Because we are in the Arab world, and there are many people, and you can see how the Arab street reacts to this.
But this option is important.
With the issue of contacting our chiefs one by one.
In the end, they said there was nothing, but it turned out to be wrong.
Brother, if we become like Germany now, or become like anyone, will we ask?
They don't have to pay any compensation because they initiated the attack, but say you have incorrect information.
Paralyzed hundreds of thousands
This is because you are a weak Arab party.
As Arabs, we are a part of it.
Work hard.
It displays it.
In a manner as if destiny willed it and the act was God's.
If the Arab nation says it will send troops to Darfur, we will send troops to Darfur.
The men considered or some considered Resolution 1860.
And our colleagues worked very hard to get the decision made.
That which was issued by the Security Council.
I don't want to say whether it was a win or not.
And what's happening?
Let's assume that winning
What are we doing?
As if he assumes we don't fit in with the rest of the decision.
Just to reassure you, we are in agreement on the decision.
Unfortunately, you will be bound by the decision even if you weren't supposed to be.
Even after Israeli rejection, Israel came and agreed.
knowledge
Do you want an alternative solution? Or is it better for you to call for a ministerial meeting?
I don't think the Arab nation
At the same time, he is open to any alternatives.
And I do not think the Arab nation is ready.
In implementing the Gaza blockade
For various political reasons
For one group to defeat another in Palestine, instead of mediating between them.
We start trying to plan.
As soon as they formed a group, I don't know about Arab European Intelligence or something like that, without mentioning names.
And once they did it, so we're partners.
In implementation
What is required of us from the West?
...if only we went.
I want that to be organized in this matter.
Sure, I'm not just talking about the decision, I'm talking about...
The visits to Gaza started two years ago, not now.
I talked about the subject two years ago, specifically regarding the decision.
Do you have reservations about his conditions?
Neither issued nor executed.
We weren't invited.
They might think we have a different opinion.
It was required that everyone have the same point of view.
It's not necessary for everyone to share the same viewpoint, but I think those who went made an effort.
And we thank them for this.
Regarding what happened in Gaza two years ago, you said the parties involved.
The victory of one group over another that participated in the siege of Gaza.
You really agree with the statements, insinuations, or accusations that have been made here and there.
هنا ترجمة نصك إلى العربية القطرية: **"عن مؤامرة عربية حقيقية بكل ما يجري الآن في غزة."**
We were partially informed.
Let me tell you that we don't have all the information.
but I know
The Palestinian cause
Achieve success at the Arab and international levels.
As long as it's not supported, it won't make that much difference.
And after the elections
I found enthusiasm and took control.
Prevalent
We had to give them a chance and see.
"Your father's generation or even they are still revolutionaries who only know the rifle and fighting."
but the day they came
On the Arab level, some of our brothers thought that these extremist movements should not reach power.
Some of them say it's now an assault.
Made in the fervor of those who broke the truce, or these Palestinians from Gaza who broke the truce.
the truce **the truce**
The Palestinian people in Gaza have been starving for two years.
Zayn
Israeli security reasons
It's clear we don't want them in power, but that doesn't concern me in Qatar.
But what about the rest of the people?
And then who decides?
Whether those countries or these countries, not every country has the right to choose what it wants.
Our administration
This is the key to the problem.
I'm just sure the situation could have been resolved.
I wish we could get tired, we're tired of starting the conversation.
It's clear that we were asked to form a group that would defeat the other one because this group...
We either see it as terrorism or we see it.
All that happened led to
Even the promises they made to the party that would give them a decent life.
They didn't do anything for them.
Let's go back to the international and Arab efforts that were made to stop what was happening, as you mentioned you were part of.
The Security Council resolution objected to by Israel so far.
And present at the Egyptian Initiative are...
And Egypt is in Cairo.
Those Egyptian efforts
Absolutely not a trick
This is required for an important role.
هنا ترجمة النص المقدم إلى القطرية
that we
And if we don't want to stop the chaos now.
In Gaza, we bring people together to stop the chaos in Gaza because
This is not the path of peace.
Surely in
And that's why we always ask them about a big role.
What did they announce?
Does that mean you can't evaluate the initiative now?
Either give a chance to succeed or to study.
I think her chances of success are slim.
If the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt are capable
Let Palestinian visions be closer.
The party that should be discussing the initiative is the one affected in Gaza.
Because he's the one who can say yes or no.
And this is important purity
When Resolution 1860 was issued
This is an Arab-Palestinian problem that we have.
We don't want to hear any side.
But I really wanted to go, when the Palestinian delegation went.
And when they went to the league, they requested that someone from Gaza be with them.
To show the Israelis that these are our brothers and we are with them.
This is an important point.
We don't leave the salad.
Our goal and the basis of our policy
To stay in power.
sheikh of my time
I don't think we can discuss the Egyptian initiative because you haven't examined its articles carefully.
You think that in principle it could be suitable as a mechanism to implement UN Resolution 1066, as some people have stated.
mathematical clock
Now, not tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, because
Every day that passes
There's going to be bloodshed for our brothers over there.
We don't want to postpone or have the Israelis postpone this matter until they finish their mission. We will put forward this initiative after they complete their task.
Confident that the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt know this and are cautious about it.
My father explained everything I said.
What's needed now is to solve the problem.
And not even in the way Israel wants it to be.
Turkey's involvement from the outset of the crisis
Does it express?
Arab vacuum
Even without doubt, this is a place with a unique character.
And he has Arab depth.
Here are a few options for
We know there is an Arab disability.
Part of it was due to disagreements.
Part of it is because of the perspective that everyone thinks their perspective is ideal.
Another one thinks his viewpoint is better.
And how can we make people respect and recognize the Arab decision in our conscience?
Or they'll start following us one by one.
One says, "No problem, give them an extra two or three days so we can call them and bring them in to even things out and resolve the issue."
We need to rise above this and not accept it.
Hamas can make mistakes, but we correct them.
At the Arab level
Just now
At least we can say no.
Within the framework of the required jobs for Qatar, jobs such as... (the completion of the point will be added later, but in a format suitable for the Qatari context).
At the same time, I heard.
Yesterday, Khaled Meshaal, the head of the political bureau of the Hamas movement.
At first, not everything my brother Khalid said is considered unnecessary, with all due respect and appreciation to him.
Why aren't you sitting with Khalid bin Mash'al and chatting with him like one of our friends?
Let's go to him at the Arab League and tell him.
What an important talk!
I am from Hamas.
Imposing Israel's conditions also imposes conditions.
Let him impose conditions, it's not forbidden for him to impose conditions, is it forbidden for Israel to impose conditions?
First, what do you think of this Arabic gift?
She is a beast and I can't hear this flock once, they also tell me it's degenerate.
Completely different, first and foremost, de Gaulle liberated his country.
Seek shade or cool yourself with a fan from the scorching heat.
Now what were we talking about?
This Arab is the gift that should be given.
Leaders must represent the views of their people.
O people of the Arab world, in all these demonstrations that we see.
This is what can be said from these required courses.
Here are a few options for translating the text into English: 1. "هنا بعض الخيارات لترجمة النص إلى الإنجليزية" 2. "In here, there are some choices to translate the text into English" 3. "هنا خيارات قليلة لترجمة النص إلى اللغة الإنجليزية" 4. "There are several options here to translate the text into English"
Regarding the situation, the actor and the office are still open.
They speak the same language.
To cut ties, we are going with all Arab countries.
To completely sever the connection, all links, even if someone claims they have an agreement.
They want Qatar to be the only one to sacrifice itself.
that we
It is the most important and crucial aspect of the relationship.
It's not just this decision, there are harder decisions.
On this point
We need a unified Arab stance.
For others
One person doesn't sell to another in order to gain moral or material benefits, and they call it.
Yes, before we close this file on this matter, there are still some countries that have taken individual steps.
Chavez is a good man, another matter altogether, and he has disagreements with America.
Our people don't need us to remind them.
Five ambassadors with permanent membership present arguments. These are movies.
We're done with that, and now the street knows more.
With the high ceiling, Your Highness.
O long life, or demand that the Lebanese forces confront the Israeli aggression and so on...
Do you think it could work if it were confined to a single Arab framework?
But we demand an Arab stance that makes people respect us.
I don't think the Arab countries are ready to fight.
There is nothing we can do.
And how about Syria, Lebanon, and other countries? There are even Arab countries that don't speak to each other.
There should be
A shift in Arab relations.
This is the current policy among Arab states.
It's still there, but I feel like it's no longer valid.
In goals
The important problem
We also know the Lebanese situation.
There is no doubt that Lebanon
Give an example if her lands were returned.
The situation in Gaza will be different, they are still there.
happening on all sides
This siege
Give a different nature.
What does it mean here, the goals for Israel, that is, the procedural goals for Israel?
One day, someone was beaten. One day, someone was punished. And one day, someone was pleased.
The example is what happened in Lebanon for them, not a good example.
The solution is the sample that happened in Lebanon.
Expression
To Gaza
The problem in Gaza or Palestine, their solution is easier than Lebanon's.
Those who disagree with each other should return our land today or tomorrow.
They disagreed on the roof.
On the distribution of power
They differ because they are closer to each other intellectually.
Who am I among the brains?
That's why the solution is much easier.
And this is the problem.
Happiness Sheikh
We only have a few minutes left if we wrap this up as quickly as possible.
And a diplomat
How can this process end?
About the Palestinians in Gaza
Let me tell you.
Or refuse
and help
This is what walked and ate us.
It will be an Arab failure.
Regarding the strategy
On the Palestinian side
There were efforts, but we didn't see a full initiative.
before, after, why?
It's not a matter of initiative as much as we feel.
Those who solve the problem, we help without mentioning Qatar's name because some have an issue with mentioning Qatar.
Don't give a summit because there is a summit to be held in March.
If we take an initiative, we won't be better than our brothers. I don't think so.
And we don't pressure them.
Because history will not be kind to us if we pressure them.
We are now in this initiative where we saw all parties involved, and there was a meeting scheduled for the fourth day, but it was postponed due to the Security Council.
We hope with God that things will be facilitated, and we wish that our Arab brothers will help as much as possible in this matter.
And we hope to push her out of the competition.
Arab Competition
In the heating, they warm it up due to their dispute with the Sudanese government at some point.
And these are our problems, okay. We fight with each other and disagree.
I don't want to get involved in this.
Doha, Qatar
Listen to it as you know and because your community has been mentioned and explained.
The entire Arab climate is conducive to it being the first economic summit.
His Highness
And surely, any summit held in another country, we attend.
And we have no disagreement about attending any summit.
Just don't become a village for the conference.
Sure, since time imposes itself.
It's too late even if it's ten days later.
Are you talking about the Palestinians after they've been struck for twenty-five days?
it will be **being**
They say that Arabs couldn't meet.
We said that
We said that
With all due respect, this summit was scheduled and we are committed to it.
I guess so.
The Arab street is against us.
In our own way.
And that's why
Broaden your mind and enter in peace.
And say, "It is a guarantee."
For this meeting
Thank you, audience, for watching.
Continuous coverage of the ongoing war on Gaza continues, goodbye.
A cool girl suggested celebrating the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani
In Doha and contributed to the preparation of a draft law specifically.
She was also a member of several local and Arab councils in the field of childhood.
I have delivered over seventy-five lectures, workshops, presentations, and published articles in Arab and international journals.
First of all, let's agree on the term we're currently using.
For people with disabilities, is it better to say "special needs" or "disabilities" as you mentioned?
First of all, good evening.
taken from a human rights-oriented or human rights culture because people with disabilities
Because he dealt with people with disabilities and considered them first-class citizens.
a human
And then he became disabled because he tried to adapt to society.
The medical concept was prevalent at the time.
Move towards the concept.
Education and the method of teaching emerged.
This category became **This category has become**
That's why we call them people with special needs.
What are the fundamental laws upon which it is based?
Role of the Special Rapporteur in monitoring the implementation of this document
And accelerated the steps towards the emergence of the international agreement, which was legally binding and distinct from the rules in this regard.
And set a basic condition or fundamental rule for this term.
This deals with these people. These are human beings. These are people.
With the change in terminology as mentioned, is there a shift in the perspective of this segment of society?
And yes, it is measured in a certain way.
This varies from region to region.
To me, it's the special thing about this.
The Arab world has distinguished itself or differed.
Although legal trends include human rights and exist, for example, in **Africa**.
In Latin America, but the reasons are often a lack of financial resources, right?
Sure, that's what I wanted to say: culture exists, but sometimes there's a lack of resources and a lack of political will.
Sometimes laws though
But unfortunately, awareness is low and there is also no culture of human rights.
Ten percent of the world's population are people with disabilities.
Eighty to ninety percent of people with disabilities are from developed countries in working age.
He suffers from unemployment.
During my visit to Darfur
Miners with the presence of landmines and weapons.
The kids are doing better.
Their houses are in remote and isolated areas.
There are many organizations working in this field and conducting research to improve.
Awareness and Realizing the Right to Education
Instead of establishing many religious centers, we should focus on education.
They went to build rehabilitation centers, hospitals, and schools.
And among the things, praise be to God, that we've achieved through our work in the office
I tried with the current authority in Qatar.
Set an agenda
Or the agendas of these humanitarian organizations to include those centers.
Under the declining situation of people with disabilities in the world
I can't call it, and I agree with you that there's a decline.
If there is a decline in the Arab region due to a state of disability.
2024
Even if they are from marginalized groups
In a country like what I told you, like Gaza and Darfur.
On the contrary, I can't at all cut off the possibility that there is no improvement in the situation.
What happened was that the evidence was presented in an indirect manner, with the existence of tangible evidence, as seen in some examples.
Qatar Red Crescent
We succeeded in collecting the projects.
How will people with disabilities and health issues be included in this strategy, and are there other programs available?
We tried to include him.
The work of organizations already present in the field
Kamal Kirou and Yana Hani are from Syria. Hello.
Good evening, I'm Suleiman Karaw.
Solomon, Kiro, please call me, Solomon.
My best regards to you and Mrs. Hafsa.
First of all, is there an intellectual impediment within the laws of the United Nations?
A mental block means a healthy person whose result became a pressure factor leading to a mental block.
My son was left disabled as a result of torture and imprisonment. He suffered from mental retardation and has been undergoing treatment for six years now.
I know that there are around four hundred people, including children and the disabled, in the prison.
Is there a law in the United Nations?
In fact, I
So they know, they know his children.
...and those who don't show their true intentions...
And there are values in the West.
We agreed on it, but people...
Some of them are apostates or do not follow the wisdom of Islam, do not take wisdom from them.
Good health to you, Naif Saeed from Kuwait.
Let's go back to our guest for a comment.
"Sure, the calls Suleiman was wondering if there was any mental impairment."
Yes, it is included in the global rankings.
Certainly, for mental disabilities and intellectual disability as they are termed.
Among these disabilities are sensory disabilities, meaning visual or hearing impairments.
Of course, as mentioned, disability is
Action and reaction occur within a social context.
In the Arab world or any other region
Surely addressing the issue of disability took a long time.
Even at the United Nations level
For example, during my experience and work as a special rapporteur, regarding the issues I was trying to address and work on.
In other words, the right for all.
Until they present it.
And various rehabilitation aspects to ensure they can access schools and also the workforce.
Works on vocational rehabilitation, which includes people with disabilities.
There were some improvements.
Especially after the reform
Generally, you'll find it in this international committee.
And I, as the special rapporteur, as well.
My job security was positive for me, even if it wasn't directly related.
Those who supported this opinion.
I've seen him in many meetings, for example the international conference.
For the Rights of People with Disabilities
Disabled by these constraints or these defects
Regarding legal issues
This is one of the most important points in the world of disability.
The United Nations unfortunately delayed it a bit during the preparation and drafting.
Regarding institutions and organizations
Qatari Arabic, for example, and I will end with this.
Governments, states, and non-governmental organizations of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf member states in the United Nations
We filled out another form.
In United Nations organizations and agencies in various regions
To know the extent to which there are programs for people with disabilities on their agendas.
If there are budgets, there should be participation for people with disabilities.
Human rights
And not just development issues
We're seeing an increase in calls, and we have with us now Meshri Naji from Algeria. Welcome, Meshri.
I hope you are well.
I want you to ask my sister who's exactly to blame.
I want to ask, I am originally from Fiji.
Okay, we'll address this question to Naji Mashriqi from Algeria. Thank you very much, Ahmed.
Hello, Halabi from Greece.
Good evening, Auntie, good evening to your guest.
Health centers, seasonal housing, essential clothing until received in the tourist season. This is what happens in Europe.
And does the mentally ill person see disability?
Especially those who might harm themselves or others.
All we say is just small talk with no real benefit. Thank you for the explanation.
Sister Hessa mentioned the financial deficit.
In poor countries, especially in Africa and Latin America, I demand...
Establishing an international fund to support disability and allocating one percent of the net profits of every organization in the world.
It must also be mandatory and without exception for any institution or company.
It reduces the disability of many people with disabilities, victims of wars, and others.
Good health to you, Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
Naji Mashri was wondering and stated his problem that he is disabled.
At the local or national level, meaning through Algeria.
The needs within the community must be met within that community.
They are the same rights that should be for anyone else.
In another way, the right to live first, then the right to housing, the right to health, and the right to education.
That's why I call upon these governments, particularly the Arab governments, from here on this platform.
In the interest of the citizen and the individual
To ensure translates to: So that we can guarantee
These needs and rights are within existing agendas.
There's no need to make any new devices.
To meet the needs of the disabled person or no need for this if the state provides adequately for them.
They are where, they must be committed to performing.
I would first advise him to return and refer to the competent authorities at the government level, if possible.
Because Google is inside the jobs and must be inside this range.
What you mentioned is the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Many countries have signed it but have not committed to it.
And here we have a caller's question: Why aren't there any laws?
It is a certainty that we exist within a human society, implying the presence of numerous errors alongside many truths.
Certainly many agreements, and certainly many treaties, have no literal commitment in them.
Or an ideal commitment from many countries that have joined many of these, such as CEDAW and others.
But there are violations and infringements, and we know that
But the question is to reach an agreement and organize it.
First, I confirm that there is at least awareness.
This awareness starts at the top of this pyramid with the decision-makers.
Start with the officials, and then gradually expand until it reaches the entire society.
Of course, we are committed to preparing reports, and these reports are submitted to the United Nations.
The issue of science, understanding, and high awareness.
The reports you worked on as a mandate for the United Nations were
Yes, from what I've seen and observed, there is interest.
لذا هناك ميزة مقارنة للاتفاق بشأن حقوق الأشخاص ذوي الإعاقة
So that I can advise, encourage, and support.
It is also important for disabled people to be...

And the president, in fact Sheikh Hassa, had a long history.
The international agreement you are referring to now in the matter of fact.
A great benefit for all people who have special needs in all regions of the world.
Especially the Arab world.
And I wish as a deaf person
These countries implement this international agreement.
This helps people with special needs, it's necessary.
Indeed, there is someone who can activate this agreement in all states.
Obaid Al-Sanani, President of the Qatar Association for the Blind and Deaf

Here we continue our discussion after a short break. Sit with us.

Dear viewers, welcome to our show and our guest today, Sheikhah Hessa Khalifa Al Thani.
Special Needs International Support Fund
"These needs are binding on all countries to provide funds. What do you see in this proposal?"
The United Nations has a fund called the Disability Fund.
Also, unfortunately, these contributions are very weak.
Mission to Monitor the Implementation of Standard Rules
When I worked for six years there was not any meaningful support.
Only from China and Austria
"Why do you keep saying that?"
The country's main supporter is my country, Qatar.
The office, through which we were able to carry out many activities and projects, was established. We praise God.
Yes, this lack of support indicates
It's like what we raised at the beginning, and this point is always raised.
Circumstances of ordinary people
And what is called the interest of people with disabilities or the care of the disabled? **Translation:** And what is called the care of people with disabilities?
That means if there was a realistic, genuine, and serious commitment.
In all circumstances, in all categories
That category of children and women with special needs, refugees, and internally displaced persons.
All these actions might lead us to a degree we can call it.
Equality of opportunity, participation, and equality.
And there are these voices that always demand and never get tired or weary.
Why don't we allocate a part in the Islamic and Arab region, sorry?
In favor of these programs and projects
"Like what was offered by her, and I really thank her from this podium."
Islamic Development Bank
From within the allocated budget
He failed to comply with what you told me regarding paying the financial dues.
Does support for people with special needs cover only developing countries and Arab states, or...
Even developed countries don't provide.
The people who were there before and now are Swedes, yes.
Some of these are countries in the European Union.
And it is certainly true in many countries, especially in the Arab region, and perhaps even more so.
So that he knows about this special course.
In my case, what happened?
In Sweden and China
The Arab region, unfortunately, has seen many promises, but unfortunately, it was just one country.
We're only talking about the Arab region.
We have more contacts with #Hamad_Al-Marri from #Qatar. Hamad, welcome!
May you be safe.
And you, after
Hello Dr. Shaikha Hessa
Almost ten
We noticed that this girl has a psychological disability.
What is your role for a girl suffering in her situation?
With her colleagues
Sometimes, even when we preserve
What is your role with the daughters of Qatari people?
Thank you very much, Hamad Al Marri from Qatar, and Bahjat Karawan from Kuwait. Welcome.
Sheikhah Hessa, as they say
Why don't we keep our oil in its murky sea?
Those with special needs, we can count them.
We can help them.
We have massive financial components.
We can break down the psychological barrier between us and them.
By boosting individual morale
And spend it on this noble cause.
This if we are truly believers.
Thank you and appreciation to Sheikhah Hessa for all her efforts and everything she has done during her term as Special Rapporteur.
With sincere gratitude and appreciation to her, and thanks to the State of Qatar for all it has provided to persons with disabilities.
Good health to you, Aisha Mohammed from Qatar.
Peace be upon you, Professor Wasila, and the mercy and blessings of God.
May you be safe.
For your needs and for your welfare.
H.H. Sheikh Hassa
My question is about prevention
As they say, prevention is better than cure.
At another level of disability, regardless of wars and traffic accidents.
At the genetic level, it can be a result of families where there is consanguineous marriage.
I think a large percentage
What leads to disability.
You're welcome, my dear Sharif from Tunisia. Now go back to our guest.
The first caller was Hamad Al-Marri, and he was wondering.
Where does a girl with a disability, a mental disability, go?
And on whom is he walking?
In every country
Certainly, there are services that cater to all types of disabilities in the State of Qatar.
For individuals with these disabilities, whether intellectual disabilities such as those mentioned or any psychological disabilities.
For schools
Before, there was
Or am I mistaken? I mean Special Education in the Ministry of Education, which is now the Supreme Council.
The standard-bearer Sharif from Tunisia pointed to something very important.
and scientific papers, and so on.
I work for organizations that focus on disability, even in campaigns.
Programs for women
All of this has led to many campaigns and programs for reproductive health.
Spoke about this aspect
He adopts healthy strategies.
To raise awareness
To demonstrate the dangers of marrying close relatives
and genetic factors
I think it was implemented in the State of Qatar.
Habits and traditions just take time for sure.
Especially in tribal societies.
But over time, there will be a response to it, but there must be a legal commitment in a sense.
Yes, Crowan Behjat, he asked and suggested that one percent of the budget of Arab countries be allocated.
To help those with disabilities, let me first...
Yes, there is an estimate statistic from the World Health Organization for the whole world.
There are forty or nearly forty million people with disabilities.
Their group consists of women.
But these numbers are being multiplied.
Like studying in South Africa where they observed and proved.
**It's confirmed by the statistics that appeared from the Iraq War and the Gaza War.**
For every person killed, three more are disabled.
And how the Arab region has become a conflict zone that no one disagrees on.
Even the suggestion proposed by **Kraun Behesht**
One percent is not enough.
To support individuals with disabilities in the Arab world.
The issue of percentages of people with disabilities or other marginalized groups.
Frankly and from the heart, I don't think she suits you.
This requires addressing their problems and needs.
It has been confirmed that people with disabilities are the most neglected.
Governments often don't count the disabled.
True, and this is linked to the culture, customs, and sometimes restrictions of society.
When the census is being conducted
Stakeholders
There is a person with a disability in the house.
There was just one question asked: Is there a disabled person or not?
Hand in hand, united with the people concerned there.
We cooperated in preparing the form.
We wrote, recommending more details.
First, specify the gender of the person with a disability, is it male or female?
Did he get help or not?
In fact, even if the numbers are correct, we haven't reached an accurate conclusion.
Attention and care also need to be advanced. Fatima Al-Dosari is with us from Qatar. Welcome, Fatima.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
I am Qatari and I have a child with a disability.
And I thank His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.
He and his wife, Sheikh Moza, accepted this category.
I'm very proud to receive all this care and attention.
For her important role

You're welcome, Latifa Al-Misferi from Qatar, we have with us now Naseem.
Abdul Karim is from Jordan. Hello, Naseem.
Come on, Kareem, show us what you've got.
May you be safe.
Good health to you, to be honest, I have an intervention.
First of all, I am a specialist in acoustics and have worked in the State of Qatar for about four years.
We had a month of awareness for speech and hearing problems.
We held conferences, lectures, and awareness workshops on hearing difficulties.
Now I want to talk about Jordan. I lived there for almost three years now.
Indeed, it offers new and useful services.
"Frankly, it offers new services, whether in material terms or non-material/moral aspects."
Even the Jordanian Ministry of Education, resources
Ministry of Education in public schools
And like our private institutions
Do they get good support?
Is your question direct or just for time? Sorry for the short answer.
Do you have a direct question?
In Qatar, the UAE, and Jordan, their services are excellent and also outstanding.
Can you comment on viewers' questions?
One works in this field.
Regarding the subject
And I'll get back to the agreement later.
What imposes itself as soon as it obtains ratifications and accession to it.
As a duty of the state or these organizations
Because it is based on the issue of the rights of these individuals regardless of
"And frankly, what?"
To do during that period for people with disabilities and why.
And you wish this had happened now.
Sure, God willing, it will be good.
I hope that this will be measured in this research or survey and that more good qualitative research will be conducted in this field.
This experience clarified these matters to me.
experience: six years
And coordination among Arab countries as well.
They also have a role; it's not just a matter of rights, only they have rights.
H.H. Sheikhessa Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani, former UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, thank you.
The presenter from the League and Cup channel has now introduced Lana on air, good morning Lana.
And it gives me great pleasure to welcome Captain Ali Qasim, the pilot of the ship, to Umm Salama.
Hello, Ali!
We're on top, on top, on top!
Good morning
I want to open the door for God's blessings, each one blesses in their own way, please Lana.
I had an open studio for five hours and two hours the day before.
God bless Qatar. The country, the government, and the people deserve this global achievement.
I can have the opportunity to congratulate Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.
"He kept his promise, Sheikh Tamim."
Yes, definitely, Lana. You are from the mathematical field and are an expert in this area. You have precise knowledge of these lines and this domain.
So that even the fish know.
And competitive, meaning we deserve the six-vote difference between us and the United States, fourteen votes for Qatar and eight for the United States.
This was because our file was rich, comprehensive, and supported by many ambassadors, and was very well supported, for example, the stadiums.
Maybe some people were scared, maybe there were some ghosts, like the Chinese ghost.
And there might be several countries willing to host, without needing to provide stadiums and prepare several special projects for this event.
Because they're finally ready.
But they were concerned about this point.
Captain Ali, as an athlete, I think this is a very significant achievement for sports people.
It affects the economic, political, and health sectors, supposedly.
So, you're athletes.
What does this achievement mean to you?
It's definitely a big achievement, especially for us. Even you saw how happy the non-athletes were.
God forgives, O Ali, tell me about the moment the winner was announced.
I was leaving the training and we were listening to the radio.
We were waiting for the announcement, my friend and I.
As you drive the car and listen to the radio
The moment they announced that Qatar and...
We both screamed, and of course the window was open.
Brother, remove his body from the car roof.
We were screaming, everyone was looking at us, we turned on the flashers and started celebrating by ourselves.
We started the celebration from the beginning.
Alhamdulillah, it was a very special day, I think. All the channels focused on that event to a great extent.
Lana, you definitely participated in this event.
Especially sports channels
How did they celebrate the occasion and what was their reaction?
Many media outlets and channels from around the world were present.
It became a landmark, very clear on the map, Qatar became famous.
Of course, Ali. The presence of the player in the team is very important.
And I suppose this responsibility must be taken seriously.
What's your opinion on this particular point?
Ali, do they mention the required characteristics to join the league?
There will be more sports now.
And we need to prepare a strong generation.
This has fundamental principles, good planning, and well-studied soccer tactics.
So, what are the rules and basics that a player should possess?
...I believe professionalism includes everything from...
Continuous, serious, and disciplined exercises and training
All these are basics that help him channel all his effort into games or training.
I think every stage has its own unique advantage.
He has a unique sense and taste.
"Sports and parameters, which one do you prefer, where do you see yourself?"
Oh, wow!
It keeps your body fit and enables you to maintain your health through exercise, which is the important part.
Everyone loves watching football matches, you'll find a love for it automatically when you step onto the field.
Does it make people working in the media work on only one side?
Can't you just stay in one piece?
It's an open space, not just a football field.
It's all sports, but nice sports.
Oh Ali, there are still a few important topics we need to discuss.
And you wouldn't mind going back ten years in age to reach 2020 and 2022?
Yeah, you don't want to.
Of course, any player now dreams of this particular thing because it's the World Cup now.
Anyone who sees the World Cup being played will be happy, even if they are not playing in it.
I hope they meet the expectations, and this is their chance.
What do you want to say as a professional player, Captain Ali? What do you want to tell them from the bottom of your heart?
We love having you with us.
As you said, I'm on vacation now, but
Alaa Awaida returns to the squad after a twelve-year absence from the Gulf Cup.
You have a beautiful note from Qatar TV and sweet memories.
God forgive, the Qatar TV channel has become like the university from which a large number of media professionals graduate.
Our patrol is brave, and God willing, it will win many and varied awards.
Let's discuss an important point regarding Umm Salal Club.
How are things there? How are you? I hope you're well.
Sure, Alhamdulillah, frankly
Initially, for sure yesterday, in the studio, we talked about many players.
Oh man, I think the guys were watching us, they must think you're...
This is an example of a request.
It is common in Qatari leagues for players to transfer to other clubs.
I believed I had a good chance in Um Selal, *as they say*.
I was able to secure a place in the Asian Cup with the team, praise be to God.
It's great to be with the team.
How can we make sports a social topic?
Even if there is no Qatar, how can we involve women, children, and youth in sports?
Connects everything, everything is complementary sports.
Women play a role in all sports fields.
Broaden your horizons, each person alone, whether small or large in this society, has an awareness of the importance of sport.
The reward is approximately twelve or thirteen years, until we reach this event, enough.
We have more new generations.
The generation is growing up, but we need to raise a generation that is aware of sports from a young age.
We get Aspire, Aspire is a green building.
Essential for the new generation of athletes
We just need to be firm and drive within our limits.
And football in particular
How can we encourage community engagement in various matching games between clubs?
Frankly, talking about the lack of audience is an issue we have in the Qatari league.
The problem, however, is attendance. The Qatar Football Association has not yet found a way to attract the public.
What is the method we should use to attract them to attend those football matches?
It depends on the person themselves, some people don't like attending university.
Materially, by the way, money plays a fundamental role in public abstention.
And now they use a ticket or loyalty points here.
No, no, the Qatar Football Association has a plan and many steps to attract the audience.
There are clubs that have ways to attract the audience, like Al-Rayyan. Al-Rayyan is a famous club and doesn't need to attract the audience.
Some clubs have their organization, some clubs have their organization, some activities and events.
For the audience, to motivate them, I think these are the only ways.
Flawed, meaning the new generation.
To love what they do and believe in their abilities, and as I said, they don't just need financial support, but moral support is most needed.
Thank you very much for this wonderful interview, may God bless you.
So, we'd like to hear your final thoughts on Qatar's win to host 2022, Lana, please.
I like to reiterate that Qatar is always supportive, and
God willing, Captain Ali, your final word that you would like to say in this interview?
Congratulations and may you continue to succeed.
Good health to you, Captain and player Alim. I wish you success in your sport and progress in your lives. May God bless you.
And I love sports more.
The episode will be about young talents.
Some young people say that these songs have become popular now, but they have a very deep and long history.
A group of young people singing Arabic or English words.
Today we're talking about this with a group of rap enthusiasts.
We know them better than the interview that brings us together live.
Welcome, dear viewers, to our show, wherever you are.
Oh years, there was a new type of singing dominating the Arab and Gulf scene,
Yay, I'm from the West, specifically America, which is rap.
Before we start talking about rap,
Boldly using any word without any reservation.
Anyone can rap.
For lyrical writing,
The vast majority of rappers write their own lyrics.
We know all these many and important details through two people who are deeply involved in this field.
They formed a nice band.
Joseph, Joseph, good morning Joseph.
Welcome, good morning Salman.
Good morning, hello.
Welcome, I'm delighted to have you with us through this program.
And surely, through the topic, rap singing.
Yusuf, what made you get involved in this?
It turned out that rap didn't exist in Qatar.
In a better way.
Talking about the citizen.
It includes funny topics, sad topics, and political topics.
Yeah, I can say that rap,
And these words, I think it's one of the artists who painted a picture and the poet wrote a poem.
The singer can sing and the musician can play any instrument.
You know, does Qatari society, or Gulf society in general, accept this type of lyrics in songs?
2010
Do you feel that people like to buy CDs for rap music?
How old are they?
There are families and many people who are listening much more than before.
It was something like a website.
How many of you are still in this band?
This means you can all speak, write poetry, and perform rap.
As you can say, the one sings, the rapper.
He's the one who sometimes plays, writes the words,
Understood!
I ask to listen and tell him that I recorded this song.
Okay, all these songs that you, Salman and Yusuf, are from the same band.
I didn't think you'd do it on a CD and make it available in stores.
But you see, if I'm alone, it means I have to do the album and put it on the market, which is very difficult in terms of business registration and procedures.
Okay, why didn't you think of that? You're twenty-five years old, and one hand always claps alone.
"May you be two, if God wills, you will be twenty-five. God protect you, all of you young men and brothers."
You act like a sir and sell the sir more than one place on the net.
You have Facebook, YouTube, and also local newspapers.
I think there are thirteen songs.
Registration is not like it is now.
It's a bit old, but it was clear.
It has low quality, not like now, but it's clear.
He burned about fifty CDs.
There is rap, I can't say that there wasn't, because there might be some youth who knew this art before ten years.
I'm not as strong as I was when I started, and I think the distribution was better during that time. The situation is different now.
And dedicated a day, with a lot of music, a lot of types of techno music now.
Those men and those artists who produce a collection of wonderful songs.
Woody, let's talk about the parties you've attended.
See, the party that participated with us in Doha is one.
It was organized by Al Sadd Club and they were very cooperative.
We wandered around to see the crowd.
We were surprised; we didn't expect such a large number.
We were surprised that in more civilized families...
More than the youth
The organization was amazing.
We were a bit nervous because it was happening for the first time in Doha.
We didn't expect this large turnout.
The interaction among the attendees was wonderful.
And it took a long time, so there were many songs.
Okay, let's hear something, or words you've composed, and the audience, especially young people like them.
Let's listen to some poems, so we can entertain the audience.
You can hear it live.
Take your time.
Prefer Salem
The problem is that it's random.
Listen to us.
I don't know.
We are here in the Doha Morning Program.
One should be entertaining for the guys for the morning program.
Salman is an expert, this is his fifth year practicing rap.
Even if people don't like it.
They have no idea about him.
The words are random.
Okay, for the songs you've made, give me some of your lyrics from before.
See, not all songs are random, or what they call in English, "freestyle".
They are on the same wavelength.
But when we sing, some words are carefully chosen.
Good health to you, see you later.
We can say, "Good morning, my country, good morning, Doha program."
We are live on television, for the audience.
To see what 1+1+2+1 will do.
Together from Doha's morning
I just heard a beautiful song.
I insisted that the youth distribute it everywhere and online.
I wanted to thank you a lot, when will you release it?
Teamwork
Everyone has a computer, hasn't he?
It won't be easy for him to do it.
Everyone writes what they want.
Sure, I suppose that every artist, whether a painter or a poet, always...
You can write it after the love of adventure.
Oh Qatar, my love
And I'm sure you participated in the National Day.
Through beautiful songs, you represent the youth of Qatar.
Sitting in Doha, waiting for the country to negotiate the release of the prisoners and gather the noble ones.
To celebrate this event
We're live-streaming this clip.
From the reception of the Asian Cup, Doha.
From Doha Airport until now
Let's watch these live images together.
The hall, the audience, our children, our students
كأس آسيا تصل مطار الدوحة صباح اليوم لمواصلة المشوار.
Settings and arrangements for hosting this massive continental event
Welcome back to our guests Youssef and Salman, whose presence brings us joy.
They are an Arab Gulf rap group, aren't they?
Can you call it that way?
Currently, to be honest, we
They're preparing for a party, but they're still not sure.
But once you start working on it, Yusuf will announce it, God willing.
God willing, it's good, but what is certain, we are still beginners.
You are at the beginning of your career, I wish you all the best, and be assured that our program will support you through and through.
Oh Salman, where are all of you gathering, twenty-five people?
Where do you meet, and how do you put all the ideas together?
Sure, there are some shared songs.
It's not necessary for so-and-so to sing a whole song, or so-and-so, or any of you.
There's definitely a saying about cooperation among you all.
It's really hard to gather twenty-five people in one place.
Start by contacting Youssef and the others, and ask them to gather in one place.
Provide individuals for inspection and identification.
And there's another way.
I record my part.
He continues.
That means he will make a recording and send it to me again.
And see other experiences
Collecting CDs of famous artists.
Do you benefit from their experience and techniques?
Sure, always.
Artists who have been doing this for years and have experience in the field.
We listen to them, learn the techniques, and try to come up with something unique.
So if we do the same thing, with the same tone, but different phrasing,
Already exist or can be easily implemented.
That way, we can benefit from them a little.
Yes, there's also a large group for Gulf youth, in the Gulf.
Let's continue together with the report for our benefit and enjoyment, let's continue together.
These talents that some people have are mysterious.
With very primitive tools
Abu Ibrahim Abdullah al-Dail
This is one hundred and fifty kilometers.
I am from the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
He has sweet experience and ability.
On the discovery of shallow groundwater sites.
At a depth of more than a hundred meters
You know that drilling wells is very expensive.
Determining the appropriate location to dig the well, but with the expert, can.
Time, fine.
It seems
Since ancient times
Our fathers and grandfathers
He keeps asking for help from experts to identify wells.
To drill.
Abu Ibrahim's techniques in searching for groundwater
I'm not into modern technology.
Or dissolved in soil in laboratories
He relies on God's grace in his work.
With a stream beneath the earth
Pomegranate-glazed kabab
Pomegranate peel or jujube peel
Now, the process of discovering water sources is applied scientifically.
This is the end of the lesson.
Come back again.
Gloom
So, from here, we start setting up the board.
And here, the torrent ends.
He needs a lot of experience and patience.
To know how sensitive the "two" movement is.
I went to many places.
Means a 95% success rate.
Sure, with this method and using copper bars.
And there is no precise scientific explanation for
This method
What's actually strange is that the success rate of those practicing this primitive profession is...
Over ninety-five percent
While searching for shallow groundwater reservoirs
"Allah is the Greatest, Glorified is He, Who has taught mankind the unknown. This is the statement from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."
Who got their own band and has more than one CD?
Online or by phone
Sometimes there are competitions between Gulf countries, such as Qatar vs. Bahrain and Qatar vs. Kuwait.
Produce a stronger song with stronger lyrics.
When addressing a problem, there are a lot of issues.
I see him as a role model.
God wills it.
"And at the same time, our Prophet showed us..."
To broadcast a wide range of songs
As much as you can
Let's keep in touch.
To keep up with the band's latest news
Let's just focus on the band's name.
lonely
Let's go back to our guests at the corniche and the beautiful weather.
Live with you from here
Wherever you are, the UAE will be holding the Asian Cup.
We are proud of them and their fine arts.
Cares about various social and psychological issues of youth
He only has two with us in the studio.
I'm sure they represent the rest.
Yusuf and Sultan, welcome back.
Sometimes the subscription ends.
We tried to contact the company, but no one responded.
As a group, you need to develop yourselves, people in
Facebook and YouTube
and other similar sites
Band name
We were among the first results of the research.
"They agreed and decided on this good path / on this path that is not good."
You combine and compile images with songs, are they personal photos?
You can just download it from YouTube and other video sites, and anyone can watch it.
There's one like it, we've done it before.
There are a lot of songs.
The obstacles you face, such as the lack of a company that relies on you and a website.
Really, you need a place where you can meet as a band.
What do you want to achieve and what do you hope to attain and find comfort in?
"Who will take care of us?"
And arrange the right of the album for us.
Oh God, let it become official.
Because we've spent five years.
"Hupi" is finished, not like this anymore.
Yeah, we participated in some things, in some series.
"I hope it gets better."
And we find someone to support him and stand with him.
Yes, Salman, we'd also like to know what you want.
I promise you I'll do it quickly.
We wish you good luck.
We wish you that all your songs become famous in the Middle East.
This is a very beautiful and famous art.
And he carried a message, as you said.
Good luck, may God bless you.
Welcome, my friends, and good luck, God willing.
We'll conclude with the song they produced especially for the show.
This is DJ Mir's program on Dawah FM.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This is Mrs. Bobo with a hot body from SKT.
We can say, "Good morning, my country, good morning, Doha program."
We are live on television, for the audience.
Don't forget, the show starts at 9:30, everyone must watch.
To see what 1+1+2+1 will do.
Together from Doha's morning
Produced by Hasan Naama, Presented by Shima Al-Hamadi
Director Nasser Al-Maliki, and guests Qatari rappers, definitely.
It can be repeated and used at home.
Like a shelf or a shopping cart
While shopping at the supermarket
when you put any commodity, or anything you want to buy in **your shopping cart**, it will be delivered to your home.
Bring me a large cup of sugar and the components of this item.
And this was also an excellent and feasible idea.
Just a barcode, a scanner in the cart reveals the merchandise.
And make the purchase easy for the buyer.
He can get all the details on the screen.
I think it increases health awareness.
When the device is with you or in the cart.
Components
Any warnings, side effects
The details are sufficient.
Or ambitious, for example, there are a number of projects, about four or five.
Those dealing with traffic issues.
He talked about traffic jams and other things like the parking problem, and it was very creative and nice.
Masha'Allah, the Children's Cultural Center
Mr. Abdullah, let's talk about the various activities that will take place in the coming days.
Yeah, there's a lot more to talk about, but we'll leave it at that for now.
The ideas, I don't know if you want me to mention some of the projects presented or
For example, for underground transportation, the brilliant idea is **like a subway, like aerial transport, so the brilliant idea is**
One day, a man left his house and found elevators.
And let them gather at one point.
I assume that all the viewers are enjoying the images displayed now.
Children's Creations
Exactly, this for example looks like an ATM.
For ladies, for example, I have a card.
Put it down and say I want a T-shirt.
This is, for example, for some shops, or if I lose household items, like my key.
This is lost, for example, the office access card.
We have a primary goal that Sheikha Moza has defined.
His Highness Sheikh
From a young age, this has been of great importance in project design.
For 300 selected children.
We also resolved to invite speakers and orators.
Ah, she's the one who hosted the closing ceremony.
To showcase their programs, we really need to open the doors to children who have an interest.
And then they can start.
We need them to be present and stand with us, that's our priority.
These programs and activities serve this core idea.
Different and diverse skills for children
Self-development
Zayn, do you collaborate with youth clubs in Qatar?
Here are a few options for translating.
Sure, all our programs are based on the exchange of ideas.
All is professional partnership.
With the second institutions serving the community specialized in enhancing such talents
Participation of all concerned institutions in Qatar: Participation of all concerned institutions
"Population census"
The Innovation Center for Girls and the Secretariat of the Council of Ministers also played a very big role.
Yes, they played a crucial role in explaining Qatar's vision.
He is training the children on it.
Engaging and encouraging children, as every program is based on institutional partnerships.
According to the main specialization of projects and institutions
And without what?
Here in Katara, they give us a strong boost and support.
... And why is it faster?
Currently, in partnership with Qatar, we are discussing a project that will be launched for consumption within the next two months.
Sure, there's collaboration in many programs.
Especially what are you enthusiastic about reading?
Chairman of the Supreme Council for Family Affairs
We are working on it, especially since we are now in the preparation stage.
To build a promising future for all children, the next generation, and youth.
What is your final word for the parents and children who are watching us now and are interested in joining the center?
More than what we're giving them now.
Sometimes our children come up with ideas that we shouldn't dismiss.
We need to consider their ideas, no matter what.
Because when we take it seriously, it develops, at least we encourage the child to think.
That's why it's important to take care of and pay attention to children.
And spiritually as well, our problem is that most parents
Support him.
And he urges him, that's why we urge the family.
There is growing interest in the child's imagination, for the children of today are the roots of the future.
We took a tour of the exhibition, looking at their projects.
We lived the dream.
Dreams and thoughts were the product of a vivid imagination.
And how many dreams come true, and many of them are realized and become a reality.
Praise be to God, we pray for our children who were there to succeed.
Our hearts are with you.
God wills it.
From various ages and nationalities
I have seventy projects.
He is considered a true pioneer and deserves recognition.
Let's talk more about this national exhibition.
And the Children's Cultural Center as well.
Mr. Abdullah, tell us briefly about the exhibition.
There was a lot of movement, for sure, so what do you call it?
Children introduced a new style of expressing their love for their homeland and loyalty to their country.
He was under the auspices of the Minister of Education.
On the tour of the exhibition
He'll grow up before he turns twenty-three.
We started with training children on Qatar's vision of 2030 in all its three themes.
Human development, economic development, sustainable development, environmental development.
First, to know the status of the State of Qatar in the year two thousand and thirty.
And after that, in order to start thinking about
Creative ideas, and how to be innovative.
I think they've had broad thoughts before.
But why should we help him?
I think their minds will grow more and more.
Sir, you launched the exhibition under the slogan "Dreams of a Generation, Facts or Future of a Nation."
The slogan says "Dreams of a Generation"
Be part of Qatar's future, Qatar of tomorrow.
We felt it when we were hanging out with the kids, when the kid says to the minister,
Open the Malaysian project, I invite you to see the Malaysian project for twenty to thirty minutes.
Kids who think they're coming in twenty years.
They express their love for their country in the field they are interested in.
Surely there will be activities, events, and competitions.
One of them won the Stars of Science award.
And there were also two winners of the first prize from the Arab League.
Sure, all the children.
On the sidelines, there were various performances on a specific schedule.
To showcase the projects they've done.
There is a great existence, a very unique existence.
Stars of Science
Some of the winners in the projects that participated in the exhibition.
Who won one of the major awards?
And what is the innovative or creative forest or reserve?
We are playing with the colorful ball.
The colorful ball is also part of children's dreams and Qatar's vision for the future.
An idea for 20-30 year olds.
How can a child share a creative idea for twenty or thirty minutes?
The main idea is that there's a chip in the ball.
The referee gives a color-coded warning.
For example, the referee can see the ball's movements.
Or games change through this electronic chip.
This is the ball bearing.
There are creative ideas, surely it's the main idea, some people might ask.
and projects
We always say, we've reached this stage.
Developing skills and broadening horizons
Give them an idea of how to express love for the homeland through these projects.
Giving them confidence in how to present the project, engage with the audience, and explain its idea.
In a field he loves, and related to something he enjoys, all of this is an achievement.
Gave support, we thank God for it.
And what is now in the development stage
The بوليك, the لجينة, and the شيخانة were among the great offices.
This, is, it, is, it, is, it, is, it, is, it.
The queues, channels for the underground transit, and the way the real estate agents enter require arrangement.
A huge protected forest.
Where can a visitor walk around and see animals and reptiles?
Also, there is a sensor installed on some animals to examine their state.
There is also the marine environment, the way of entering is also creative.
One of the reasons for her success is also the breadth and depth of her imagination.
This is what made her win.
Someone else spoke about an underwater tourism city.
A butterfly city.
Forest on the ground
"There are many tricks in tourism."
Oh, busy work.
Maybe they need this in their minds at this time, maybe in twenty or thirty years.
In the future, it will be achieved.
Three projects **Three projects** **Three projects**
The things adopted by the scientific club, they said these are the projects we need to work on.
The project is about the unnecessary water in air conditioners.
Let's see the Arab newspaper.
The article says, "Qatar University celebrates graduation."
The presence of His Excellency Mr. Saad bin Ibrahim Al Mahmoud
Minister of Education and Higher Education, Secretary General of the Higher Council for Education.
And Dr. Sheikhah bint Abdullah Al-Misnad, President
It's not certain, it's not certain.
Qatar Society and Calgary University
There's also great news about our explanation students:
"O success of my education and we wish them success, God willing, in all specialties."
Min is considered one of the young, up-and-coming actors in the Qatari dramatic scene.
Until when, also tessellated, and thread colors.
Actor Abdel Hamid Sharshani is considered one of the actors who made themselves.
If it is convincing,
He doesn't choose to be in businesses done within Qatar.
Currently, actor Abdel Hamid Sharshani is participating in the drama series "Killer Feeling" and "Tasneeb Part Two."
We're happy to have a guest this morning.
So we can talk to him about his involvement in these two projects and his overall experience.
Welcome to us and good morning.
We are happy to have you on the Doha Morning program. This is the first time I've met you, and this is your first time on Doha Morning.
With people who work hard for the program.
And you, Lisa.
May God bless you and keep you with us. Before we start chatting,
Okay, let's see.
I am a responsible and executive person.
And this is how I live by insights.
The only thing I can tell you is,
Give me the bisht.
Listen, why are you asking me?
Go and ask them, if anyone agrees that you don't bring the bisht,
Of course I have another question to start with, because we've seen this part of the series, "Tesaneef Part I."
He pointed out that Khalid ibn al-Walid...
Some historians link the famous poet Imru' al-Qais with the city of Marrat.
There was much talk and information about that city in the Kingdom of Arabia.
To know more, let's take a look at this wonderful report from our colleague, Abdurrahman Marshad.
Let's watch it together.
Certainly, testimony from people who know about flattery or preference.
And as an affirmation of the history of this city or otherwise.
As far as we see of its ancient ruins and what we hear about it from its historians and poets
Their classical and modern heritage, thus, comes as an important record added to the city's register.
Mesaieed is one of the cities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Historically, it is an ancient town founded during the pre-Islamic era.
There was a dispute among historians about Kief's name.
Some believed that his name was inspired by the famous poet Imru' al-Qais al-Kindi.
The well is named after him.
The date of its foundation is obscure.
In the pre-Islamic era.
The most famous thing in the city of Mar'a is Mount Kumait, on which some proverbs were built.
Because it's in the heart of the city and close by.
The ruins. These are historical sites.
This site is considered a tourist attraction in Saudi Arabia.
The municipality has made a great effort for development.
A garden on this mountain
And the local council is for everyone in the kingdom.
Named after the Prophet's companion, the eternal Khalid ibn Walid, may God have mercy on him and grant him peace.
Fought against the apostates and Musaylimah the liar.
One of its effects is the Comete Valley.
A place where valley water gathers and is stored for a long time.
Kant is one of the most influential philosophers in the past.
One of her works is also the Doha Heritage House.
Al-Maghra is a city whose history dates back to pre-Islamic times.
He was renowned for his poets who were influenced.
With its beauty, ruins, and the famous mountain of Komit.
Abdulrahman Al-Marshed about the program Sabah Al-Doha,
Marat City is north of Riyadh.
We are back again for our dear guests.
I wish you could tell us and the viewers about this method and this style.
Initially, you mentioned that our infrastructure is very unique.
We open a file for him and he is registered, he has a specific record in our system.
The email belongs to his parent.
This report contains the range of attention increasing, writing speed, reading speed, and distraction generally.
The guardian gets a full report.
Okay, this report will be added to the student's file.
In his son's online profile.
And see his son progress.
He can see the grades and communicate with teachers.
So we can truly enjoy the intelligence and beauty of this girl.
To be able to bring most of the children in the centre, we send our best regards to them.
Who registered at this center and has a professor there.
To assess her skills and the level she has reached since joining the center.
Sure, this year.
Focus on one task and after Ramadan.
But this is always at the expense of one job over another.
Some people just watch TV during Ramadan.
He stays up late watching TV while people begin their months of worship with TV.
Reduce, reduce, a chain of reductions, reduce, let them do one job every two years, better?
Sure.
Insha'Allah, they will like me in Ramadan.
But I'd like to send my greetings to all of you.
Oh Lord,
And also with plays.
From drama to fashion.
A fashion show took place in Katara, the Cultural Village.
Certainly, we continue with you with great love and loyalty.
And they enhanced the children's abilities and skills more.
Contrary to many schools in this blessed country.
We had a model, and we spoke with our guest who was with us before.
Now we have Mr. Ibrahim Hussein Abdelsalam. Welcome and good morning.
How are you, Omniyah?
I'm fine.
Which grade are you in now?
Professor Ibrahim, to start with, could you introduce us to the subject matter offered by the center?
And how many wishes are examples of this.
And we'll try with her the other method or approach that Umm Naseem talked about.
Do you feel there's a difference in his mind?
You feel that these methods and techniques,
Nothing changes regarding his mental abilities or even his educational level.
Scientific methods
Including child testing initially through an international test called the TONI test before starting anything in the program.
You've started a part of my Tony test as well.
We can measure the level of understanding, whether it's the actual level or the change in the student's level.
Now there's going to be a test or something like that.
Omnia is counting and immediately responding live on air.
Sure, Omnia doesn't know anything about the questions.
We surprised them with this.
I definitely have another question to start with.
We would like to ask you about your participation in the second part this year.
What's your contribution? Can you tell us about it?
Sure, after we presented the series "Classification" Part 1,
Alhamdulillah, I was lucky in several roles.
Oh Mr. Ghaniem,
Coordination of the campaign with the psychological director Ashraf Shahatah, Mr.
A chance for artistic production
For the youth. ل لشباب.
Mr. Ganem nominated me this year for
Sure, every episode is different.
In more than one episode, I will create new characters.
On the contrary, it's a wonderful experience. In this work, we have...
A pyramid from Kuwait's Pyramids, Mr. Saad Al-Faraj.
We have actors from Bahrain, Abdullah Malik, Ali Al Ghareer.
Like Ali Mirza, we have.
You also have a group of young actors like Abdullah Adham.
Yes, among the young actors, we have Abdullah Al-Assar.
This happened a year ago, and before that, we used to work on two projects per year.
This is probably why I asked you before you went on air. You've been acting since 1997.
But you couldn't achieve anything, or your ambition to act.
Praise be to God in all circumstances.
Did you act or was it just like that?
There, it's done.
I took acting as a talent. The person who adopted me at the beginning was the actor Abdulaziz Jassim.
He is one of the actors who considers me like his son.
If you need anything, call him.
We were in every series.
We worked hard and now, thank God, we're done.
At this moment, without Tara, I would like to extend a thousand special thanks to Mr. Abdulrahman Al-Sulaiti, and a million very, very special thanks to Mr. Abdurrahman.
If you compare us to Kuwait. In Kuwait, we used to get 12 to 16 new representatives every year. Why?
They have it.
Sure, thank you very much for it because it offers a lot of opportunities.
Well, let's say,
I wish we could talk about the second series; we had an idea about Tesanyev.
We need to know about the Deadly Feeling.
And the man, too.
We have a sample, with us is the therapist Mr. Abdulaziz bin Mohammed bin Abdurrahman Al-Taimimi.
For this procedure to happen on air.
If we can see how we treat humans. Let it be the first advice to Mr. Sabah bin Hamza, you are welcome.
You are welcome, and peace be upon you.
Hello, we'll start with you, Your Highness, if you please.
Inshallah
In the name of God.
Yamina Yammina
Let's see the nerves.
It's like a painting or a message from God, glorified be He, showing all the organs in your body.
From the inside and its problems.
You will regret it later.
I have a headache and feel dizzy.
Unclench your hand, unclench it. Keep your nerves relaxed, yes.
By doing this, Professor Abdulaziz, you will discover something specific, namely, from his hand, which he suffers from a certain disease.
I examined him. His eardrums, he has a severe inflammation of the middle ear.
Oh dear! What does this mean, Mr. Abdulaziz?
Ear. Do you have a problem with your ear?
From the day I was born and since I was a child.
Or do you still have any pain here?
These are the nasal cavities!
Do you have a stuffy nose and a headache here?
I am here, I am helpless.
He has a problem with his nose in the weather.
It gives him a headache between his eyes.
Weight increases without eating.
The thyroid gland isn't working properly, you feel sluggish and tired all the time, and you feel like your body is heavy.
I sleep a lot.
Oh, how beautiful or ugly, drunkenness or sorrow, you are always like this.
You always have a sore throat.
Hey. Look at the trembling, notice the trembling.
He's tired of being nervous, and you never walk barefoot, maybe the last time.
Are you from Tunisia?
Wow, you mentioned things about him.
Is massage after delivery beneficial for newborns?
Her mother's thumb, glorified be God, is the size of her children's palms.
Most children don't sleep why?
When you carry him, he doesn't like to be carried, but people think that he likes to be carried. He has gas in his stomach, bless you.
What the mother puts her thumb on, and what the thumb sees.
In the palm of the baby's hand.
The hands are parallel and the child is parallel with them.
Let's watch it so every mother can learn this move.
You'll start pumping like this. Right and left, and right and left.
This thing is about the child, about the child, about the child, and it's nice.
Okay, regarding discoveries, do you have specific discoveries tailored for kids?
As we said, in every house, ninety percent of women, may God protect them.
First of all, the first warning is about ceramics and even residues.
When we walk barefoot on ceramic tiles, it's fine to walk barefoot, but walking on uneven ground is dangerous.
Walk barefoot! The proof is when ceramics are used in homes, health problems increase.
Because the weather is cold and flat.
When there was a carpet, there were problems, they suffered from asthma.
Grow up.
Women should be careful to focus on walking barefoot on ankle prominences.
This is the foot and the heel area at the back, the heel.
From here, this is the foot and now down the bony projection.
This is the first discovery, the second discovery is a way to facilitate delivery.
Okay, focus a bit with me.
In her seventh or ninth month.
Generally, just being in the delivery month.
This means, they don't come on the eighth, the eighth is dangerous and the most dangerous thing is walking barefoot.
A pregnant woman must be cautious and not walk barefoot.
If she were due date.
"I seek refuge in Allah from the outcast Satan. And set for them an outcast Satan, and sit for them on their trunks, tall palm trees,
We know that Mary, peace be upon her, knew that her provision would reach her.
Until I discussed it with the scholars and they told me: Why change the interpretation of Ibn Kathir?
I told them, "I give you the idea that God put in these sciences, and He inspires me."
"Shake the palm fronds towards you, when you shake the palm trees, how will it be?"
He is sharp as pins or thorns.
When you shake the palm tree, the wombs, the area of the wombs, are commanded here in the text.
These are the entrails. They issue orders to facilitate childbirth and the resitting of the fetus.
The increase in fetal head circumference or its repositioning, so that it comes naturally.
Praise be to God, this is one of the benefits of this neighborhood.
He ties the knot and starts to loosen it a bit.
Some people take it as a habit, and some know it's science.
So, they're afraid to tell you and you won't believe them.
Yes. Professor Abdulaziz, your discoveries are important.
But I'd like to ask you one last question because time has flown by.
If anyone wants to talk to you, anyone at all, a specific email or you.
Okay, the mobile number is with the control room. If anyone wants to communicate with Mr. Abdulaziz, they can call us after the program.
Of course, there is a Qatar numbers channel, so he can communicate with us and get this number.
Treat people with kindness.
If we believe in this faith, God will bless your work and guide the people.
I have sins like the rest of the people and I do everything you can imagine, I am a normal human being.
However, we aspire to more goodness.
We always think of the good thing.
Viewers, I hope you enjoyed this episode about reflexology and hand massage.
And also through the foot.
We saw a live fashion model on air, how did they discover the diseases this person had?
"And from what I've heard, he's very knowledgeable. God willing, we will benefit from him, and if anyone wants to get in touch with him, they can read about
The way it is implemented, whether in the coming days or years, or whether it includes more schools.
Good morning
How do you rate this experience?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
The fact that obesity in Gulf countries has become a big problem.
Oh, will Qatar become the fifth country with them?
This program, to be honest, the thing is that the first lady in New York became...
I visited Doha, and they have a program for this.
They show it to us, we approve it and say it's fine.
Our students with students from New York, Spain, and England.
Therefore, we can observe the level of our students in Qatar compared to the world, and this is something we want in the future.
So that we encourage students to eat fruit.
He retires from sports.
Sure, the fifth week is your family gathering with your parents.
We kill two birds with one stone.
In the sixth week, he tells us what he gained from this experience. Alhamdulillah, we are wrapping up today.
We are happy with the students.
You knew there were three independent schools, Abu Obeida for girls,
My aunts are independent.
In a very sporting spirit.
The family became more aware, and my brothers were enthusiastic at home and started eating this with them.
It became a pervasive culture among students, who then carried this culture home to their relatives.
He goes and tells them, "Give me this or teach me this."
The coach or the one who provided this information to the students,
How did you choose him and how was the connection made with the student? Who made the connection?
Yes, there were many parties that helped us, may God reward them well.
Our brothers at the diet center educate them about food and, of course, healthy eating.
And learn with Lady A'isha Al-Tamimi the etiquette of the table.
How they arrange themselves, how they prioritize!
To learn about cooking, sports, or to educate about the value of healthy food.
It was in the form of separate lessons, a curriculum, or
And how do you convey these ideas to the students?
In various ways, some within the school,
We organized a day at the beginning of the program in Aspire Zone, where we gathered all the students, boys and girls.
These things are not something related to someone specific, but we are all responsible, responsible, because those are our children.
How to deal with those students at first!
You initially said that the results were satisfactory.
It's enough to have three or specific classes in these schools.
Now when you start an experiment in the world, you don't start on a large scale.
It starts at a reasonable range that has all the characteristics; boys, girls, independent, and private.
Since it is not suitable in our culture, environment, and family circumstances, as they accept some things for their children and do not accept others.
Basically, they want to participate in it, and frankly, it's something very important.
The student who is twelve or thirteen years old, this is the right time for him to learn about his health.
These are struggles for many people who wish to be thin, but they imagine it's impossible.
Some of the actors we see in movies with thin bodies, he says this is impossible, no!
We covered it in detail, but there were a few weeks we couldn't cover.
And remember Him in the early hours of the morning.
And fruits that contain vitamin B, which you can get from fruits and vegetables.
Brother, one must know the benefits of fruits, and one must know that if they eat them, their health will improve, and they will be active.
Regarding fruits, they went to the supermarket and chose their fruits.
Oh my, so many dots.
It's a diversity: She is diverse; and of course they compete: and surely they compete; every school was creative with its different ideas of its teachers.
Smell of competition.
We give them guidelines and everyone has to be creative.
The teachers trained the students. Don't you have a special staff?
We taught them, we taught them.
But the teachers were adding, for example, some schools like Abu Obeid said they would keep Saturday for student activities.
This is a day outside of school hours, they decide and rely on it; Al-Rukia School said they will hold a march.
They said they were having a healthy cooking day for the girls, but they didn't make the boys do healthy cooking on their own, the girls were more skilled
Thank you to Rayyan Water for providing all the water free of charge to schools, Rayyan Water in this matter.
Sure, water is much healthier because it helps cleanse the body of all the toxins that enter it daily through water.
We said the third week.
It means his body is moving.
He might be playing soccer or basketball and doesn't know that this is the game I love.
True, true, exactly. And some of them might want another game, maybe they don't like group games.
Welcome to our live broadcast.
Mr. Abdul Aziz Al-Jaber, founder and director of the Qatar Multiple Sclerosis Multidisciplinary Association, welcome.
Of course, we try as much as possible to focus on important topics.
We would like to introduce and present to our dear viewers what multiple sclerosis is.
And who knows, this name might still be difficult for us to understand.
The number of women is greater than the number of men.
All the treatments available now are preventive treatments.
The white blood cells that are supposed to protect us have started.
He kills us by hitting the nerve cell.
Let me make it easier for the audience, like a piece of cake.
Covered with a layer called myelin, we call it the nylon layer.
Sure, it leads to dizziness and **double vision**, **double vision**.
This also led to problems in the digestive and respiratory systems.
In the worst cases, it leads to madness, quadriplegia, or paraplegia.
Confirmed treatments.
The most important functions in the body will be severely damaged.
Or from this disease a disease called multiple sclerosis.
Some theories suggest that it was transmitted by a virus.
The disease is a non-epidemic disease.
Not suitable for children
Some people consider it a disease depending on the region.
The equator, for example, was exempt from this disease.
Currently, we have a few cases of this disease on the equator.
This disease still has no cure because its cause is unknown.
So far, scientists have not been able to find the cause of the disease in order to find a treatment for it.
Currently, the process has become the opposite.
They try to avoid the impact of the disease itself on the human body.
In other words, they started playing from the back.
We might be a little afraid of this subject, which we can say is that this disease comes suddenly.
"هل هناك مجموعة معينة تشعر أن هذا المرض ينتشر بينها بشكل خاص؟"
Globally, they are ranked between twenty and forty.
Currently, the international community has reduced the number of the same disease from twenty to fifteen.
Because he started having children until he was forty years old.
But man does not recover from the illness.
Certainly, as a society, we are open to alternative medicine and Prophetic medicine.
Yes, through the community, Multiple Sclerosis Society Qatar.
Why do we have this society?
There was a large group, so I thought about forming a community for this topic.
Sure, I'll give you random numbers.
In Kuwait, it's written that there are nineteen thousand cases.
A thousand boxes.
The rest of the Gulf countries range from one hundred to three hundred.
The day I was diagnosed five to six years ago,
My grandfather was either sixty or forty-six.
There are symptoms indicating that the patient is suffering from this disease!
We don't want to seem biased, that's why we don't want to set a specific quota.
The second point is how do I know if I'm getting it or not.
This is very difficult.
I'm not organized, oh! Mr. Abdulaziz is trying to figure out a specific point.
