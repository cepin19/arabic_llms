khoa is the most important person in the kingdom?
khoa t then, the disciples came to Jesus and asked him, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Jesus called a little child to him. He made him stand among them.
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
khoa , al-insānu, inna ka ḥattā takūna asraʿa khāliṣan min al-kibrīāʾi mimmā yakūnu ʿalayhi hādhā al-ṭifl, huwa al-ʾaḥammu fī mamlakat al-samāʾi.
"Anyone who welcomes a child like this in my name welcomes me."
But what if someone were to lead one of these little ones who believe in me astray? It would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.
khoa what a terrible thing it will be for the world because of the things that lead people into sin! Such things must happen, but what a terrible thing for those who cause them!
If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or one foot than to be thrown into hell with two hands and two feet. In hell, the fire burns forever.
If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. The Parable of the Lost Sheep
Look, don't underestimate any of these little ones. I tell you, their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.
The
What do you think? Suppose a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them gets lost, won't he leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go and look for the one that is lost?
What I am about to tell you is true. If he found that sheep, he would be more joyful about it than about ninety-nine others that did not go astray.
So it is with your Father in heaven. He does not want any of these little ones to be lost. When one of them sins against you
If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother.
"But what if they do not listen to you? Then take one or two others with you. For every word to be established, it must be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses." (Deuteronomy 19:15)
But what if he refuses to listen even to the witnesses? Tell the church. And what if he refuses to listen even to the church? Then treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. What you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and what you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
I tell you again, this is what I am commanding you. Imagine if two of you agree on earth about anything you ask for, my Father in heaven will answer your request.
The merciless servant
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to collect all the money his servants owed him.
And as the king began, a man who owed him millions of dollars was brought to him.
The man was unable to pay. So his master gave an order. The man, his wife, his children, and all that he had were to be sold to pay off his debt.
The servant knelt before his master, pleading, "Give me some time." He promised, "I will pay you back everything."
His master took pity on him, forgave what was owed, and released him.
"But then that servant went out and found one of the other servants who owed him a few dollars. He grabbed him and started choking him. 'Pay me what you owe!' he said."
The other servant knelt down. "Give me some time," he pleaded. "I'll pay you back later."
But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and ordered the man to be thrown into prison until he could pay back what he owed.
The other servants saw what happened. It disturbed them greatly. They went and told their master everything that had occurred.
Then the master called the first servant. Then he said to him, "Where are you, evil servant?" "I have forgiven you all your debt."
Shouldn't you have mercy on the other sinner as I had mercy on myself?
In his anger, his master turned him over to the jailers to be punished until he paid back everything he owed.
This is how my Father in heaven will treat each one of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.
Jesus teaches about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Large crowds followed him. He healed their sick there.
And some Pharisees came up to him and tested him, saying, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator made them 'male and female'?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
They are no longer two, but one. Therefore, a man must not separate what God has joined.
They asked, "Why then did Moses command to give a man a certificate of divorce and send her away?"
Jesus answered, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of heart, but it was not this way from the beginning."
Here is what I tell you. Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery. A man can divorce his wife only if she has been unfaithful to him.
The disciples said to him, "If that's the way it is between a husband and wife, it is better not to get married."
Jesus answered, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining single. Only those who are helped to live without marriage can accept it."
He recites to you now its news. The verse [7:173] you read it as you read "now its news". The meaning [7:173]: "now its news" you read it as "now its news".
Some people brought little children to Jesus. They wanted him to lay his hands on the children and pray for them. But the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he departed from there. Jesus and the rich young man.
جاء رجل إلى يسوع وسأل: "يا معلم، ماذا يجب أن أفعله لأنال الحياة الأبدية؟"
Why do you ask me about what is good? Jesus answered. "There is only one who is good. If you want to enter the kingdom, obey the commandments."
"Which one?" the man asked. Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness."
Honor your parents and obey them in all matters where there is benefit, no harm, and agreed-upon right. Do not corrupt the commandment of your Lord, for verily, the Lord is All-Powerful.
"I have obeyed all those commandments," the young man said. "What more do I need to do?"
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell all you have, and give the money to the poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me."
When the young man heard this, he went away sorrowful, for he was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
Indeed, He is severe. If a close relative were to seek a single drop from Him, he would not receive it. If the skin of the earth were to seek a single drop from Him, it would not receive it. If what grows from the earth were to seek a single drop from Him, it would not receive it.
When the disciples heard this, they were astonished. They asked, "Then who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter answered and said to him, "We have left everything and followed you. What then will there be for us?"
"What I am about to tell you is the truth," Jesus said to them. "When all things are made new, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. Then you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, and you will judge the twelve tribes of Israel."
Everyone who has left houses or brothers or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.
But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.
The Story of the Workers in the Vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a man who owned a vineyard. He went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
He agreed to pay them the usual wage for a day's work. Then he sent them to his garden.
Around nine o'clock in the morning, he went out again. He saw others standing in the market square doing nothing.
Tell them, 'Go you also into my vineyard; and I will pay you what is right.'
So they went. "He went out again around noon and at three o'clock, and did the same thing."
Around five o'clock, he went outside and found others still standing. He asked them, "Why have you been standing here all day doing nothing?"
They said, "We have not found anyone who will hire us to work in this remote place." He said to them, "You also go and work in my vineyard."
As evening came on, the owner of the vineyard said to the man in charge of the workers, "Call the workers and give them their pay. Start with the last ones hired, and then go to the first."
The workers who were hired around five o'clock arrived. Each received their usual daily wage.
When those who were hired first came, they expected to receive more. But each of them also received the usual daily wage.
When they received it, they started complaining about the owner.
These people who were recently converted have only worked for one hour, as they said: "You have fulfilled their time, equal to that of those people. You have completed the greatest amount of work, and you have exposed yourselves to the most intense heat of the sun."
One of them answered their companion, saying, "My friend, I am dealing with you justly. Did you not agree with me to work for the usual daily wage?"
Take your money and go. I want to give those I've recently hired the same pay I gave you.
Don't I have the right to do as I please with my own money? Do you feel I was cheated because I gave generously to others?
"So those who are last will be first, and those who are first will be last." Jesus speaks again of his coming and his death.
Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. On the way, he took the twelve disciples aside to speak to them.
He said, "We are going to Jerusalem." And he said, "The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of the chief priests and the teachers of the law. And they will condemn him to death."
"Then they will hand him over to a people who are not Jewish. And they will mock him and scourge him. And they will crucify him. On the third day, he will rise from the dead!" A mother asks Jesus for a favor.
The mother of the Zabid sons came to the Messiah, with her sons presenting her. And when she bowed down, she asked him to take care of her situation.
"What do you want?" asked Jesus. She said, "Grant that one of my two sons may sit at your right hand in your kingdom, and the other at your left."
"You do not know what you are asking," Jesus said to them. "Can you drink the cup I am about to drink?" "We can," they answered.
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The remaining tithing men heard of it. They were angry with the two sisters.
And He resolved for them to gather. He said, "You know about the rulers of the nations. They have authority over their peoples. And their high-ranking emirs guide them."
Do not be like that. Rather, whoever wants to be important among you must be your servant.
"And let one of you take a way, let him be his servant."
"Be like the Son of Man, who did not come to be served, but to serve others and give his life as a ransom for many." Twelve kings and men were dressed in fine linen, with gold chains around
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, and a large crowd followed them.
Two blind men were sitting by the roadside. They heard that Jesus was passing by. So they cried out, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The crowd ordered them to cease. They instructed them to be silent. Yet the two men cried out all the more, "Master! Son of David! Show us compassion!"
Jesus stopped his steps and called out to them. "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked them.
In response, they said, "Sir, we would like to be able to see."
Jesus felt deep compassion for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately they could see. And they followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem.
And as they approached Jerusalem, they came to Bethphage, on the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two of his disciples.
He said to them, "Go into the village ahead of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt by her. Untie them and bring them to me."
If someone tells you something, say that the Lord needs them. The owner of the place will send them right away.
This happened so that what was spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled. He said,
I say to the city of Zebulun, "See, your king comes to you, humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey." (Zechariah 9:9)
The disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them.
They brought the donkey and the colt. They placed their cloaks on them. Then Jesus mounted the cloaks.
A very large crowd gathered, so they spread their coats on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
Some people went before him, and some followed him. All of them shouted: "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 26:188) "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 27:188) "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was moved. The people asked, "Who is this?"
The crowd shouted, "This is Jesus. He is the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Then Jesus clarified the matter in the temple.
Jesus entered the temple of the Jews and began to drive out all who bought and sold from there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and also the benches of those who sold doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations' (Isaiah 56:7), but you have made it 'a den of robbers' (Jeremiah 7:11)."
Blind and lame people came to Jesus in the temple courts. There he healed them.
The chief priests and the scribes saw the wonders that he did. They also saw the children in the temple area shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" But when they saw all this, they were indignant.
"Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," answered Jesus. "Haven't you ever read in the Scriptures? 'From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise.'" (Psalm 8:2)
Then Jesus left the people and went out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there. The fig tree withered away.
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the roadside. He went to it, but found nothing on it but leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" And at once the fig tree withered.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?" they asked.
Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, if you believe, you will do the works that I do, and greater works than these will you do, because I go to the Father."
"If you believe, you will be given what you ask for when you pray." The authority of Christ is questioned.
Jesus entered the temple courts, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. "By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked. "And who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered, "I will ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
"Where did Imad Yohanna come from? Was he from heaven? Or did he come from men?" They discussed this among themselves. They said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why did you not believe in him?'"
But what if we say, "of men"? We fear people. Everyone thought John was a prophet.
So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." And Jesus said to them, "Then I will not tell you by what authority I do these things." (End of the parable of the two sons)
What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work today in the vineyard.'
" 'I won't do it,' the son replied. But later he changed his mind and went."
Then the father went to the other son. He said the same thing to him. The son answered, "I will, sir." But he did not go.
"Which of the two sons did what his father wanted?" "The first," they answered. Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John came to show you the right way to live, and you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. You saw this, yet even then, you did not turn away from your sins and believe in him. The parable of the tenants.
Listen to another story. There was a man who owned some land, so he planted it with vines. He built a wall around it. He dug a winepress in it and also built a watchtower. Then he leased the vineyard to some farmers and went away on a journey.
The time of harvest had come, so he sent his servants to the tenants. And he said to the servants, "Gather my share of the fruit."
But the tenants seized his slaves. They beat one of them. They killed another. They stoned the third to death.
Then the man sent other servants to the tenants, and he sent more than he had sent the first time. But they treated him the same way.
Finally, he sent his son to them. He said, "They will respect my son."
But the tenants saw the son coming. They said to each other, "This is the heir; come, let's kill him, and everything will be ours."
So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
And when the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do to these tenants?
He will destroy those wicked men; the Lord will cut off their vine and they will be forced to give up their share of the produce at harvest time.
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures, 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
"Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a people who will bear its fruit."
The mountain breaks every person who falls on it. But the mountain breaks any person who falls on it.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables, and they realized that he was speaking about them.
So they looked for a way to arrest him. But they feared the crowd. The people believed that Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Story
Jesus told them more parables. He said: "The kingdom of heaven is like..."
"Behold, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man who sowed good seed in his field."
His servants sent to those who were invited to the feast. The servants told them to come, but they refused.
Then he sent out another servant and said, "Tell those who are invited, 'I have prepared my dinner. My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.' "But they paid no attention and went off—one to his field, another to his business. The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them. The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.
But people paid no attention. One went far away to his field. Another went far away to his work.
The rest of the men seized his slaves. They treated them cruelly and then killed them.
The king was furious. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed the murderers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants, "The wedding feast is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come."
Head to the street corners. Invite anyone you find to dinner.
So the servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both good and bad: and the wedding hall was filled with guests.
The king came to see the guests. He noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.
"My friend," he asked, "How did you get in here without your wedding clothes?" The man couldn't think of anything to say.
Then the king said to his ministers, "Bind his hands and feet. Then take him out into the darkness. There he will weep and gnash his teeth."
Many are called, but few are chosen. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went out. They plotted to entrap Jesus in his words.
They sent their followers to him. And they sent the Herodians with them. "Master," they said, "we know that you are a man of integrity. You teach the way of God in all honesty. Don't let others tell you what you must do or not do. Don't be swayed by their importance."
So tell us, what do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
But Jesus knew their wicked plans. He said, "Hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me?"
"Show me the coin that people use to pay the tax." They brought him a silver coin.
He asked them, "Whose is this picture? And whose are these words?"
"To Caesar," they answered. Then he said to them, "Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
When they heard this, they were amazed. They left him and went away. "Marriage is when the dead rise."
On that very day, the Pharisees came to Jesus with a question. They did not believe that people rise from the dead.
Professor, they told us, this is what Moses told us. If a man dies and has no sons, his brother must marry the widow. He must father children to carry on his family name.
There were seven brothers among us. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened to the second, third, and subsequent brothers down to the seventh.
Finally, the woman died.
Now, when the dead rise, whose wives will they be? For all seven of them were married to her.
Jesus answered, "You are wrong, because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God."
When the dead rise, they will not marry, nor will they be given in marriage. They will be like the angels in heaven.
"What about the dead who are raised? Have you not read what God has told you?"
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." (Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
"At a time when God hears more."
The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees did not believe in the resurrection of the dead, so the Pharisees gathered together.
Someone was an authority in the law. So they tested Jesus with a question.
Teacher, he asked, "What is the most important commandment in the law?"
Jesus answered, " 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Love him with all your mind.' (Deuteronomy 6:5)"
This is the first and most important commandment.
And the second is like it: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"All things written in the Law and the Prophets are based on these two commandments." "Whose son is he? Christ's?"
And the Pharisees gathered together. Jesus asked them,
"What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?" "The son of David," they said.
Then why does David call him 'Lord'? The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself. David said,
"The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.'" (Psalm 110:1)
"If David is referred to as 'Lord', how can David's son be referred to?"
No one could answer him with a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him any more questions.
John judges the Pharisees and the teachers of the law.
Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples.
"The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat," he said.
Obey them. Do everything they ask of you. But don't do what they do. They don't practice what they preach.
They document heavy burdens and place them on others' shoulders. But they themselves are not willing to lift a single finger to remove them.
"Everything they do is done for others to see. On their foreheads and arms they wear small boxes containing verses from the Scripture. They make the boxes very wide. And they make the decorations (tassels) on their garments very long."
They love to sit in places of honor at dinner tables. They also love to occupy the most important seats in places of worship.
They love to be greeted in the markets. And they love it when people call them 'Lord'.
"But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers."
Do not call anyone on earth 'father,' for you have one Father, and he is in heaven.
You shouldn't be called 'teacher.' You have one Teacher, and he is the Christ.
The highest rank with God is for those who are closest to me.
Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
How terrible it will be for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You lock the gates of the kingdom of heaven in people's faces; you yourselves do not enter, and you hinder those who are trying to enter.
The
"How terrible it is for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert to your faith, and when you have done so, you make that person twice as much a child of hell as you are."
كيف يكون ذلك شرًا عليك، أيها الضالّ؟ تقول: "إذا أقسم أحد باسم المعبد، فإن ذلك لا يعني شيئًا. ولكن، إذا أقسم أحد باسم ذهب المعبد، فيجب عليه أن يفي بالقسم."
You are blind and foolish! Which is more important? Is it the gold? Or is it the temple that makes the gold sacred?
It also says: "If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing. But anyone who swears by the gift on it is obliged to fulfill the oath."
O blind ones! Which is more important? Is it the gift? Or is it the altar that makes the gift sacred?
For everyone who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.
And whoever swears by his hearing, let him swear by it and by Him who dwells within it.
And whoever swears by the name of the sky, has sworn by the name of the throne of Allah and by the name of He who sits upon it.
What a terrible thing it is for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin—and have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faith. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former.
O you who are blind! You strain out the gnat but swallow the camel!
How blind you teachers of the law and Pharisees! Hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed. You only want to please yourselves.
You blind hypocrite! First clean what is inside the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean.
What a tragedy for you, O poets of good and valor! O pretenders! You are like graves that are whitewashed on the outside. They appear beautiful outwardly, but inwardly, they are filled with the bones of the dead. They are also filled with other things that are not pure or clean.
Indeed, the matter is yours. The appearance of the matter is that you do what is right, but within you are filled with what is wrong. You pretend to be what you are not.
How can you inherit the earth, you inheritors of the law, you priests and Pharisees? You hypocrites! You build the tombs of the prophets. You decorate the graves of the righteous.
And when you say: "If only we had been in the days of those who came before us, we would not have done to them what they did. We would not have participated in the killing of the prophets."
"So that you may bear witness against yourselves, and you may say, 'Indeed, we are the descendants of those who killed the prophets.'"
So complete what has been revealed to you from your Lord.
O nest of vipers, how can you escape being sentenced to hell?
I will send you prophets, wise men, and teachers. You will kill some of them. You will crucify some of them on a cross. Others you will flog in your temples. You will pursue them from city to city.
You will pay the price for the blood of all the righteous people who have been shed on the face of the earth. I mean from the blood of the righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. All of this will happen to those who are alive now.
"Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!"
Look, your house is left empty.
"I testify to you, you will not see my face again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.' (Psalm 118:26)"
Signs of the Hour
Jesus left the temple. As he was walking away, his disciples came to him and pointed out the temple buildings.
"Do you see all these things?" asked Jesus. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. There his disciples came to him privately and said, "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end?"
Jesus answered, "Be on your guard! Beware of being deceived."
Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ!' and they will deceive many.
You will hear of wars. You will also hear people talking about future wars. Do not be terrified. These things must happen. But the end is not yet.
Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines in many places. There will be earthquakes in various places.
All this is the beginning of labor pains.
Then they will hand you over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me.
At that time, many of them will turn away from their faith. They will hate each other. They will hand each other over to their enemies.
Many false prophets will arise. They will deceive many people.
For evil will grow, and the love of most people for cold will grow.
But those who endure to the end will be saved.
This good news for the kingdom will be published throughout the world. It will be a witness to all nations. Then the end will come.
The prophet Daniel spoke of "the abomination that causes desolation" (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11). One day you will see it standing in the holy place. Let the reader understand this.
Then those in Judah must flee to the mountains.
No one goes up to the roof, then down to his house to get something.
No one on the site should go back to get their coat.
What a terrible thing it would be in those days for pregnant women! What a terrible thing for nursing mothers!
Pray that you may not have to flee in winter or on the Sabbath.
There will be great tribulation in those days, such as has not been since the beginning of creation until now, no, nor ever will be again.
Were it not that time is short, no one would exist. But because of a people whom God has chosen, it will be brief.
"At that time, someone may say to you, 'Look! Here is the Christ!' or 'There he is!' Do not believe it."
False Christs and false prophets will also appear.
See, I told you so.
"So if anyone tells you, 'He is far out in the desert,' do not go. Or if anyone tells you, 'He is deep inside the house,' do not believe it."
The thunder that comes from the east can be seen in the west. So will it be when the Son of Man comes.
Starving vultures will gather wherever there is a corpse.
"After the terrible suffering of those days, 'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light. The stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will be shaken.' (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)"
"At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory."
He will send His angels with a loud trumpet call. His chosen nations will gather from all directions. He will bring them from one end of the heavens to the other.
Learn a lesson from the fig tree. As soon as its branches become tender and its leaves sprout, you know that summer is near.
In the same way, when you see all those things happening, you know that the end is near. It's right at the door.
That which I am about to tell you is true. The people of that time were alive as long as all these things were happening.
**The heaven and the earth shall pass away,** **but my words shall not pass away.** **But of that day and hour knoweth no man,**
No one knows the Day and the Hour except Allah. No one knows it, not even the angels who are near to Him.
"It will be just like it was in the days of Noah. That's how it will be when the Son of Man comes."
In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking. They were getting married. They were giving their daughters in marriage. They were doing all those things until the day Noah entered the ark.
They knew nothing about what was going to happen until the flood came and took them all. That is how it will be when the Son of Man comes.
"Two men will be in the field. One will be taken and the other left."
Two women will grind with a hand mill. One will be taken and the other will be left.
"So remain conscious (and mindful) of (the fact that) you do not know on what day your Lord will come."
You must understand something. Suppose the homeowner knew at what time of night the thief was coming. Then he would have kept watch. He wouldn't have let his house be robbed.
Therefore you also must be ready; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
Let's assume that a master puts one of his servants in charge of the other servants in his house. The servant's task is to give them their food at the right time. The master wants a faithful and wise servant for this purpose.
It would be in the servant's interest to be found by his master doing his work upon the master's return.
Here is what I will say to you is true. The master will give that servant responsibility for all that he owns.
But suppose that servant is wicked. Suppose he says to himself, 'My master is staying away a long time.'
Let's assume he started beating other servants. Let's assume he eats and drinks with those who drink excessively.
The master of that servant will come on a day when the servant does not expect him. He will return at an hour the servant does not know.
Then the master cuts him to pieces and sends him to the place where sycophants go. There people will cry and gnash their teeth.
Tales of Ten Maidens.
"This is how the kingdom of heaven will be at that time. Ten virgins took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom."
Five of them were fools. Five were wise.
The foolish took their lamps, but they did not take oil with them.
The wise ones took oil in jars along with their lamps.
The groom hasn't come for a long time. So, all the bridesmaids felt bored and fell asleep lying down.
At midnight a voice cried out, "Here comes the bridegroom! Go out to meet him!"
Then all the bridesmaids awoke and prepared their lamps.
The foolish ones said to the wise ones, "Give us some of your oil. Our lamps are going out."
"No," they replied. "There may not be enough for all of us. Instead, go to those who sell oil. Buy some for yourselves."
So they went to buy oil. But while they were on their way, the bridegroom arrived. And the maids who were ready with him entered the wedding feast. Then the door was shut.
Later, the rest of the bridesmaids came. "Oh, sir! Oh, sir!" they said. "Open the door for us!"
But he replied, "What I am about to tell you is true. I do not know you."
"Therefore you must be ready, because you do not know the day or hour when the bridegroom will come. Three servants story."
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man who was going on a journey. He called his servants and delivered to them his goods.
He gave ten thousand dollars to one. He gave four thousand dollars to another. And he gave two thousand dollars to the third. The man gave each servant the amount he knew the servant could handle. Then he set out on his journey.
The servant who had received the $10,000 went at once and put his money to work. He earned $10,000 more.
The one with the $4,000 earned $4,000 more.
But the man who had received $2000 went and dug a hole in the ground. He hid his master's money in that hole.
After a long time, the master of those servants returned. He wanted to gather all the money they had earned.
The man who had received $10,000 brought the other $10,000. 'Master,' he said, 'you trusted me with $10,000. See, I have made $10,000 more.'
His master answered, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master!"
The man who had been entrusted with four thousand dollars also came and said, "Master, I received four thousand dollars from you. See, I have made four thousand more."
His master answered, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master!"
Then the man who had received the two thousand dollars came and said, "Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not scatter seed.
I was even afraid. So I went out and hid your two thousand dollars in the ground. Look, this is what was yours.
His master answered, "You wicked and lazy servant! So you knew that I sow where I did not sow? You knew that I reap where I did not sow?"
Alright then, you should have put my money in the bank. When I returned, I would have taken it back with interest.
Then his master commanded the other servants, 'Take the $2000 from him. Give it to the one who has $20,000.'
Every person obedient to Allah, Allah will reward him with the best. And whoever does not obey Allah will not be successful.
'Drive that wretched servant out into the outer darkness. There, in the dark, people will weep and gnash their teeth.' Sheep and goats
"The Son of Man will come in all his glory. All the angels will be with him. Then he will sit on his glorious throne."
All the nations will be gathered before Him. He will separate people into two groups. It will be like the shepherd who separates the sheep from the goats.
He will set the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right, "The Lord of the universe has destined you for this. It is the kingdom that has been prepared for you since the creation of the heavens and the earth."
You made me hungry, so you brought me food. You made me thirsty, so you brought me drink. You made me homeless, so you brought me shelter.
I wanted clothes. You gave them to me. I was sick. You took care of me. I was in prison. You came to visit me.
Then the righteous will answer him, saying: "Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you? Or thirsty and give you drink?"
When we saw you as a stranger, did we invite you? When we saw you in need of clothes, did we clothe you?
When we saw you sick or in prison, and went to visit you?
The king will reply, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.'
Then he will say to those on his left, "You are cursed! Depart from me into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels."
You made me hungry, but you didn't give me any food. You made me thirsty, but you didn't give me anything to drink.
I was a stranger. But you did not invite me. I needed clothes. But you did not give me any. I was sick and in prison. But you did not take care of me.
And they also will answer and say, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty, and did not help you? When did we see you a stranger, or needing clothes, or sick, or in prison, and did not help you?'
He will reply: "What I am about to tell you is true. Anything you haven't done for one of these less important reasons, you haven't done for me."
Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but those who have done right will have eternal life.
Plan to kill Jesus
Jesus finished saying these things, and then he said to his disciples:
As you know, the Jewish Passover is in two days. The Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, Caiaphas.
They made plans to arrest Jesus by stealth. They wanted to kill him.
"But not during the feast," they said. "It might stir up trouble among the people." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in the house of Simon, a man with a skin disease, in Bethany.
A woman came to Jesus, peace be upon him, with an expensive, sealed flask of perfume. She poured the perfume on his head while he was at the table.
When the pupils saw this, they got angry. "Why this waste?" they asked.
The perfume might've been sold at a high price. The money might've been given to poor people.
Jesus was aware of this. So he said to them, "Why are you troubling this woman? She has done a good thing for me."
You will always be with the poor. But you will not always be with me.
She poured her perfume on my body to prepare me for burial.
"O my companion, do not weep for Layla, nor praise Tarif; indeed, Layla and Tarif, and everyone who lived among them, are not like those who did not live among them..."
One of the twelve went to the chief priests. His name was Judas Iscariot.
He asked, "What will you give me if I deliver Jesus to you?" So, they counted out for him thirty pieces of silver.
From then on, Judas watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. The Last Supper.
This was the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover meal?"
He replied, "Go into the city to a certain man, and tell him, 'The Teacher says, 'My time is near. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.' "
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them; they prepared the Passover.
As evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve.
As they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."
The disciples became very sad. One by one, they began to say to him, "It is not me, Lord, is it?"
Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand in the dish with me will betray me."
"The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. Woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born."
Judas' betrayal was the one who would hand him over. He said, "Not me, Lord, is it?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is you."
While they were eating, Jesus took bread. He gave thanks and broke it. He handed it to his disciples and said, "Take this and eat it. This is my body."
Then he took the cup, praised Allah, and passed it to them, saying, "Drink from it all of you."
This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
Here is what I tell you. From now on, I will not drink wine with you until the day I drink it with you in my Father's kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said he would be betrayed.
Jesus told them, "This very night all of you will fall away on account of me. For it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)"
But after I am raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."
Peter answered, "Everyone else may leave because of you. But I never will."
"What I am about to tell you is the truth," Jesus answered. "This very night, before the cock crows, you will deny me three times that you know me."
But Peter said, "I may have to die with you. But I will never say that I don't know you." All the other disciples said the same thing. Jesus prayed in his anguish.
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
He took Peter and the sons of Zebedee with him. He began to be sorrowful and very troubled.
Then he said to them, "My spirit is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and keep watch with me."
He went a little further, fell on his face, and prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Could you not watch with me for one hour?" asked Peter.
Watch and pray. Then you will not fall into sin when tempted. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Jesus went back to the same place. He prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned. And again he found them sleeping. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
So he left them and went away repeatedly. He called out three times.
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand. The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of sinners."
"Get up! Let's go! There is the man who is handing me over to them!" Jesus is arrested.
While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. A large crowd was with him, carrying swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
John, who had wanted to deliver Jesus, signaled to them. "The man I kiss is the one," he said. "Arrest him."
Jesus went immediately. He said, "Master, have mercy!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you have come to do." Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
And at that moment, one of Jesus' companions drew his sword and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
"Put your sword back in its place," Jesus told him. "For all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you think I can't ask my father for help? He would immediately send an army of over 70,000 angels.
But then, how can the scriptures be fulfilled? They say it must happen this way.
At that time, Jesus spoke to the crowd. "Am I leading a band of armed men against you?" he asked. "Do you have to come out with swords and clubs to seize me? Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me."
"But all this has happened that the words of the prophets might be fulfilled." "Then all the disciples left Jesus and fled. Jesus was taken to the Sanhedrin."
Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had assembled.
Not long after, Peter followed Jesus. He went directly to the high priest's courtyard. He entered and sat down with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.
But they found no evidence, although many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two other witnesses stepped up.
They said, "This one claims that he can destroy the temple of God, and that he can rebuild it in three days."
Then the high priest stood up. He asked Jesus, "Will you not answer? What is it that these men testify against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. Then the high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God of Israel, tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God."
"Yes," Jesus answered, "it is just as you say. But I tell you all, in the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? You have heard the blasphemy with your own ears."
"What do you think?" "He must die!" they answered.
Then they spat in his face. They struck him with their fists. Others slapped him.
They said, "Tell us, Jesus! Who struck you?" He said to Peter, "I do not know Jesus."
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A female servant came to him. "You also were with Jesus of Nazareth," she said to him.
But Peter, before them all, said, "I do not know what you are talking about." "I do not know the man," said Peter.
Then he went out to the gate that leads to the courtyard. And another servant girl saw him there, and said to the people who were there, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
He returned and said that it was not so. And he swore, saying, "I do not know the man!"
A little later, those who stood by came to Peter and said, "Surely you are one of them, for your accent betrays you."
Then Peter began to curse and swear, "I do not know that man!" And immediately a rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.
Judas hangs himself.
The morning came early. The chief priests and the elders of the people came together and decided to put Jesus to death.
They bound him and took him by force. Then they handed him over to Pallas, who was the governor.
Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned to death. He felt deep shame and remorse for what he had done. So he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders of the assembly.
"I have sinned," he said. "I have delivered an innocent man." "And what is that to us?" they answered. "That is your concern."
Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.
Representation: The chief priest holds the fetters. And they say: "Doing so is considered against the law, as the matter concerns putting these funds into the church's box. It is blood money. It has financed the death of a man."
They decided to use the money to buy a ceramic field. People from other countries will be buried there.
That is why it is still called "Field of Blood" to this day.
Then was fulfilled the prophecy of Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "They took the thirty pieces of silver, and they gave them for the price of him, as the Lord appointed me."
"They paid me thirty pieces of silver, as the Lord commanded me." (Zechariah 11:12,13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) Jesus is brought to Pilate.
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus answered.
But when the chief priests and elders brought charges against him, he made no reply.
Then Pilate asked him, "Do you not hear the charges they are bringing against you?"
But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge. The governor was quite amazed.
It was the governor's custom at Easter to release one prisoner. The people could choose which prisoner they wanted.
At that time, they had a famous prisoner named Barqa.
So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Whom do you want me to release for you? Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Pilate knew that the chief priests were jealous. He knew that was why they had delivered Jesus to him.
While Pilate was sitting on the judge's bench, his wife sent him a message. The message said, "Don't get involved in anything concerning that man. He is innocent. I have suffered much in a dream today because of him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas' release and to have Jesus condemned and executed.
"Which of the two do you want me to release?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered.
"What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" asked Pilate. And they all answered, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What evil has he done?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere with them. And since it was customary at the festival to release a prisoner to the crowd, he offered them a choice between Jesus and Barabbas, a rebel whose crimes had landed him in prison.
All the people answered, "We and our children will bear the guilt of his death!"
He released Barabbas to them. But he flogged Jesus, and handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
Jesus was taken to the governor's palace, which was called the Praetorium. All the other soldiers gathered around him.
They bound him and wrapped him in a blue cloak.
Then they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!"
He spat on him. They hit him on the head with a stick once and twice.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him of his robe. They put his own clothes back on him. Then they led him away to be crucified. Jesus is crucified.
On their way out of the city, they met a man from Cyrene named Simon. They forced Simon to carry the cross.
They came to a place called Golgotha, which means the place of the skull.
They mixed wine with gall and offered it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it.
When they nailed his hands and feet, they divided his clothes by casting lots.
They sat and watched him there.
On his head they placed a sign that read, "This is Jesus, King of the Jews." And he wrote, "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews."
And two robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
Those who passed by shouted at Jesus, mocking him. They shook their heads.
And he said, "I see you will kill the sacred mosque, and then rebuild it in three days? Then take your own life! Come down from the cross, if you are the son of God!"
Likewise, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders mocked him.
"Save others," they said, "but he cannot save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
And indeed, he trusts in Allah. Let Allah be his helper now, if He wills. For it is He who said, "Indeed, I am a good companion, indeed, I am a good companion, and the promise is true."
Likewise, the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him. The death of Jesus.
From noon until three o'clock, the whole earth was covered in darkness.
Around three o'clock, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of the bystanders there heard Jesus crying out, "He is calling Elijah."
Immediately, someone ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine and vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
So the rest of the people said to him, "Leave him alone. Let us see if any truth will come from him to bring him out."
After Jesus cried out loudly again, he died.
At that moment, the temple's curtain was torn in two from top to bottom, the earth shook, and the rocks split.
The graves were opened. And many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised, and they came out of the graves after His resurrection, and entered the holy city, and appeared to many.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus was taken up into heaven, they went to the holy city. There, they appeared to many people.
The Roman commander and those guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened. They were terrified. They exclaimed, "He was surely the Son of God!"
Not very far away, many women were watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to take care of his needs.
Mary Magdalene was among them. And Mary, the mother of James and Joseph, was also there. The mother of Zebed's sons was also there. And Jesus was buried.
As evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came. He had become a disciple of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Yusuf took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
He threw him into his new grave which he had dug in the rock. He rolled a large stone in front of the tomb's entrance. Then he departed.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. And the guards who were at the tomb...
The next day was the day after the Preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
Sir, they said, "We remember something that liar said while he was still alive. He claimed, 'In three days I will rise again from the dead.'"
"So when I command you, have them place a log on the mountain, and they shall not enter it. Then they will tell the people, 'Jesus has been moved from one place to another.' And the last lie will be worse than the first."
"Take some guards with you," replied Belat. "Go. Make the tomb as secure as you can."
So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting guards.
Jesus rises from the dead.
The Sabbath had ended. At dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
**A strong earthquake.** **An angel came down from God out of heaven.** **The angel went to the tomb.** **He rolled back the stone and sat on it.**
His body shone like a flash of lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so frightened of him that they trembled and looked like corpses.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.
Not here! He has risen, just as he said he would! Come and see the place where he lay.
Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you."
Then the women fled from the tomb. They were terrified but filled with great joy. They ran to tell the disciples.
Suddenly Jesus met them. "Greetings!" he said. They came to him, seized his feet, and worshiped him.
Then he said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me." The guards went and told the chief priests.
As the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
When the chief priests met with the elders, they came up with a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
Tell the soldiers: "We want you to say, 'His disciples came at night. They stole his body while we were sleeping.'"
If this news reaches the governor, we will pay him and do him a favor. That way, your safety will be ensured.
The soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus' final commands to his disciples.
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they worshiped him. Yet some others remained doubtful.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
Teach them to obey everything you command them. And you can be assured that I am always with you, to the end."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Long ago, the prophet Isaiah wrote, saying: "I will send my messenger before you, who will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
"A voice cries out: 'In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.' (Isaiah 40:3)"
"To that end, God, Exalted and Most High, has commanded us to perform obligations and to speak the truth. God, Exalted and Most High, said: 'O mankind, fear God and be truthful.'"
All the people from the countryside of Judea and all the people of Jerusalem were going out to John. And when they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John wore clothes made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
After me comes one who is stronger than I. I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thongs of his sandals.
"I baptize you with water. But he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." Jesus is baptized and tested.
At that time, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee. He was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
Jesus was coming up out of the water. Suddenly, he saw the heavens torn open. He saw the Holy Spirit descending on him like a dove.
A voice from heaven said to him, "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."
So Jerusalem quickly sent Muhammad, peace be upon him, to the desert.
He was in the desert for 40 days. There, the devil tempted him. Wild animals did not hurt Jesus. Angels took care of him. Jesus chooses his first disciples.
After John was imprisoned, Jesus went to Galilee. He preached the good news of God's kingdom.
"The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God is near. Repent of your sins and believe in the gospel!"
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting their nets into the lake; they were fishermen.
"Come after me," said Jesus, "and I will make you fishers of men."
Immediately they left their nets and followed him.
Then Jesus walked a little further. And he saw Jesus, the Christ, the Son of Mary, and his son, John. He was heading...
Immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after Jesus. And Jesus cast out the demon.
Jesus and those with him went to Capernaum. And when the Sabbath came, he went into the synagogue and began to teach.
People were impressed by his teaching. He taught them as if he had authority. He did not speak like a professor of law.
Suddenly, a man in their group began to shout. He was possessed by an evil spirit. He said:
"What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!"
"Be silent!" Jesus said sternly. "Come out of him!"
The devil threw him violently, and then he emerged from him after great effort and intense screaming.
Everyone was amazed. Some asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching! With such authority! Even the demons obey him and his commands."
The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left the temple and immediately went with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed with a fever. They told Jesus about her.
So he went to her. He took her hand and helped her up. The fever had left her. Then she began to serve them.
That evening, after sunset, they brought to Jesus all who were sick and those possessed by demons.
A large crowd of townsfolk gathered at the entrance.
Jesus healed many of them. They were suffering from all kinds of diseases. He also cast out many demons. But he did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prays in a quiet place.
The morning began very early, and it was still dark. Jesus got up and left the house. He went to a place where he could be alone. There he prayed.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they called out, saying, "Everyone is looking for you!"
أجاب يسوع وقال: "لنمض إلى الموضع الآخر. لأني أريد أن أكرز هناك أيضاً. لأجل هذا جئت."
So he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons. And he healed every disease and every affliction among the people.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus and begged him on his knees, saying, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."
Jesus was filled with deep compassion. He reached out his hand and touched the man. He said, "I am willing to do this." "Be 'clean'!"
The disease immediately left him. He recovered.
Jesus sent him immediately. He gave the man a severe warning.
"Don't tell anyone about this," he said. "Go and show yourself to the priest. Offer the sacrifices prescribed by Moses. This will be a testimony to the priest and the people that you are 'clean'."
But the man went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer enter a town openly. He remained in secluded places, but people kept coming to him from all quarters.
Jesus healed a man who could not walk.
After several days, Jesus returned to Capernaum. The people heard that he had come back to his home.
A very large crowd gathered, until there was no longer room. In fact, there was no room even outside the door. And Jesus spoke the word to them.
Four of those who came were carrying a man who could not walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after digging out the tiles, they lowered the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying.
Jesus saw their faith, and he said to the man, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
Some law teachers were sitting there. They were thinking,
Why is this person talking like this? He's saying something very evil! Only God can forgive sins!
Then Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Why do you think about these things in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say to this man, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Get up, take your mat and walk"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus spoke to the man who could not walk.
"I tell you," he said, "Get up. Take your mat and go home."
The man rose and took his mat. Then he walked away, while everyone watched. All the people were amazed. They praised God and said, "We have never seen anything like this before!" The choice of Jesus for the Pharisee.
Once again Jesus went out beside the Sea of Galilee. A large crowd followed him, and he began to teach them.
And as he walked, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax collector's place. "Follow me," said Jesus. Levi left his place and followed him.
Later Jesus was at a dinner in Levi's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples. They were part of the large crowd that was following Jesus.
Some of the scribes who were Pharisees were there. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. So they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this. So he said to them, "Those who are well do not need a doctor, but the sick do. I did not come to call those who think they are right with God to follow me. I came to call sinners to follow meёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёрёр
The disciples of John and the Pharisees often fasted and prayed. Some people came to Jesus and said to him, "The disciples of John fast often, and the disciples of the Pharisees fast often, but yours do not. Why not?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? They cannot fast as long as he is with them.
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them. On that day they will fast.
People don't sew a patch of new cloth onto old clothes. If they do, the new piece will pull away from the old garment. This will make the tear worse.
O people, I am the Messenger of Allah. Will you follow me or will you follow Yahya, the son of Maryam? Yahya, the son of Maryam, and their mother were not like other humans. She ate with the women of Maryam +/−
On one of the Sabbath days, Jesus was walking through the grainfields with his disciples. The disciples began to pluck and eat some of the heads of grain.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! It is not lawful to do this on the Sabbath. Why are your disciples doing it?"
He replied, "Haven't you ever read about what David did? He and his men were hungry. They needed food."
When Abiathar was high priest, David entered the house of God and ate the sacred bread. Only the priests were allowed to eat it. David also gave some of the bread to his men.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
"So the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath."
Healing on Saturday
Jesus entered the synagogue again, and there was a man with a withered hand.
Some Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They were watching him closely. They wanted to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus spoke to the man with the weak and distorted hand. He said to him, "Stand up before everyone."
Then Jesus asked them, "What does the law say about what we should do on the Sabbath? Is it right to do good or to do evil? Is it right to save a life or to kill?" But no one answered.
Jesus looked at them with anger. He was greatly disturbed because their hearts were hard. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as good as new.
Then the Pharisees went and plotted with the Herodians to kill Jesus. And the multitudes followed Him.
Jesus and his disciples went to the Sea of Galilee. A large crowd from Galilee followed them.
Word of all that Jesus did reached the whole region. People came to him from all over Judea, from Jerusalem, and from the areas across the Jordan, as well as from the region around Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowd, Jesus told his disciples to prepare a small boat for him, in order to prevent the people from crowding around him.
Jesus healed many people. Therefore, the sick rushed to touch him.
When the evil spirits saw him, they fell down before him. Crying out, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone who he was. Jesus appointed the twelve messengers.
Jesus went to the top of a mountain. He called a group of people to come to him, and they came.
He appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles, that they might be with him and he might send them out to preach.
They had the power to cast out demons.
So Jesus appointed twelve, and among them was Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter.
There were James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. Jesus gave them the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder.
And Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot.
Judas Iscariot's betrayal was also among them. He was the one who would later hand Jesus over to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebub
Jesus entered a house. Again a crowd gathered, so large that Jesus and his disciples could not even eat.
His family heard about this. So they went to take charge of him. They said, "He's out of his mind."
Some of the scribes were there. They had come from Jerusalem. They said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul! He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons!"
So let them, that they may know His signs. He said: "How can Satan cast out Satan?"
If a kingdom fights against itself, it cannot stand.
If a family is separated, he won't bear it.
