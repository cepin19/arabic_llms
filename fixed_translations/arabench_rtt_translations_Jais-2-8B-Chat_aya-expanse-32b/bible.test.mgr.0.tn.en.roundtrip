Jesus called a little child to him and had him stand among them.
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."

"Whoever unties a knot in my name, I will untie for them."
"Wasn't he one of those young believers in me who also committed sin? And when he committed that sin, it was as if a great millstone were tied around his neck, and he sank to the bottom of the sea."

If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or with one foot, than to be thrown into eternal fire in hell.
If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. The Parable of the Lost Sheep
"Be careful not to despise one of these little ones. That's what I'm telling you. Their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven."
Tunisian
What do you think? Imagine a man has 100 sheep and one of them runs away. Won't he leave the 99 sheep on the plateau and go look for the one that ran away?
Let me tell you what I need to tell you truthfully. If he had found that sheep, his joy at finding one would have been greater than his joy at not losing the 99.
I am like Papa in heaven. He doesn't like any of these children to be lost. When someone wrongs you...
Your brother did something wrong to you, go to him. Tell him what he did wrong. Keep it between you two if possible. If he listens to you, you might win him back.
"Shouldn't he have listened to you? No, not one or two others with you. For the Lord says, 'Every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.' (Deuteronomy 19:15)"
But what does he do when he refuses to listen to the witnesses? Tell the church. And what does he do when he refuses to listen even to the church? Well, treat him as you would treat a brother. Treat him as you would treat an unbeliever or a tax collector.
How can I tell you the truth? If you hold the earth, you hold the sky. If you release the earth, you release the sky.
"Again, what I tell you, imagine two of you on earth understanding anything you ask for. Your Father in heaven will do it for you."
"Wherever two or three are gathered in my name, I am there with them." The servant who had no mercy.
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."
A greedy king was happy to see his wealth grow as much as he wanted. All the money his slaves needed was given to them.
The king is about to start, they bring him a man who has millions of dollars.
The man couldn't pay. So his master gave the order. The man, his wife, his children, and all his possessions had to be sold to pay off his debt.
"The servant fell to his knees before him. 'Give me time,' he pleaded. 'I'll pay everything back soon.'"
His master felt sorry for him. He forgave him and let him go his own way.
"But then that servant went out and found one of the other servants who owed him a few dollars. He caught him and started choking him. 'Pay what you owe!' he said."
The other servant fell to his knees. "Give me time," he begged. "I'll set you free."
But the agent, Loul, refused. On the contrary, he walked away and let the man go to jail. The man will stay there until he pays off his debt.
And the servants saw what happened. They were disturbed by the noise. They went and told their master everything that had happened.
The teacher called the first servant and said, "O traitor," and added, "I forgive you for everything you had because you asked me."
Why didn't you have mercy on the servant until the end, just as you had mercy on me?
In a fit of anger, his master shook him and ordered the guards to punish him until he returned everything he owed.
This is how your heavenly Father treats you; therefore, you must forgive your brother or sister from your heart.
Jesus speaks about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
The crowd followed him. They are all going to be healed by him.
Some religious scholars came to test him. They asked, "Does the law allow a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator made them male and female?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, 'That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.' (Genesis 2:24)
"They are not dead, but rather alive. As long as the man doesn't divide what God has bound."
They said, "Why did Moses say that a man must write a divorce document for his wife and throw it to her?"
Jesus answered, "Moses allowed you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of heart, but it was not this way from the beginning."
"How can we put it? A man who leaves his wife and marries another is acting lightly. A man doesn't leave his wife unless she fails him."
The pupils said to him, "If this is the case between husband and wife, it is better not to get married."
Jesus answered, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining unmarried. There are some who are unable to live without being married, but they can accept it."
In English: "Some men are unable to father children because they were born that way. Others became that way through the actions of others. Still others have changed themselves in this way for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever can accept living in this way should do so." "Bring the little children to Jesus."
Some people brought their children to Jesus. They wanted him to be the first to lay his hands on them and invoke God's blessing upon them, protecting them from all harm. But Jesus did not approve of such actions. He told them, "Do not do this."
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me. Do not hinder them. For the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
Jesus laid His hands on them. And they were healed. Jesus and the Rich Young Man
A man came to Jesus and asked, "Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
"Why do you ask me what is good? Thus said the Lord Jesus. 'There is only one who is good. If you wish to enter paradise, obey the commandments.'"
"What did he say?" the man asked. "Jesus said, 'You shall not kill. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not bear false witness.'"
Honor your father and your mother. (Exodus 20:12-16; Numbers 5:16-20) And love your neighbor as you love yourself. (Leviticus 19:18)
"I obeyed both of those orders," said the young man. "What else do I need to do?"
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."
How the young man heard this, he walked away sadly. He was very rich.
And here, Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is harder for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven than for a camel to go through the eye of a needle."
Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When the students heard this, they were greatly awakened and deeply moved. They asked, "Then who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter Jabou, "We left everything and followed you! What have we gained?"
"How can I tell you this now? Truly," said Jesus. "When everything is renewed, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. And you who follow me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
Everyone who has left home, family, or land for my sake receives a hundred times more, and eternal life.
Many start on July 1st, and many others end on July 31st.
The Story of the Servant Girl Ful Karima
The kingdom of my Lord is like a man who has a piece of land. He gets up early in the morning to hire workers to work in his vineyard.
He agreed to pay them the usual daily wage. Then he decided to send them to his blackberry patch.
"The morning fog had lifted once more. He saw other people standing in the market, doing nothing."
He told them, "You too, go and work in my vineyard. I will pay you what is right."
They left. "He went out again around noon and at three in the afternoon and did the same thing.
In a tale, exactly at five o'clock, he went out and found that there were still people standing. He asked them, "Why are you standing all day long and not doing anything?"
"Because no one else would hire us," they answered. "He told them, 'You too, come and work in my vineyard.'"
When evening came, the owner of the estate called the manager of the workers and said, "Call the workers and give them their wages. Begin with the last ones to arrive, and then go to the first."
Those who worked had their time close to five o'clock. They each took their usual daily wages.
Every time the first workers arrived, they were expecting a raise. However, each of them received their usual daily wage.
By the time I reached them, they had started complaining about the mall.
These are the people who work now, they only worked for an hour. The one who said: 'They finished us like they finished them. We did the biggest job and stayed under the scorching sun all day.'
One of them answered him, "My friend, I'm talking to you seriously. Have you just agreed to work for me today, no matter what?
Take your money and go. I want to give those who served me their last breath the same treatment I gave you.
Don't I deserve to just spend my own money and make them laugh? I feel wronged because I gave a lot to the valleys.
"Most who are last will be first, and most who are first will be last." Jesus is speaking again about the coming of death.
Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. On the road, he took the twelve disciples with him to speak with them.
"We are going up to Jerusalem," he said. "The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death.
"Othman, your Lord says to you: 'We will drive you out of our land, and you will not find us to be constant.'"
Then a man came to Jesus, kneeling down and saying, "Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic and suffers greatly.
"What do you want?" Jesus asked. She replied, "Grant that one of my two sons may sit at your right hand and the other at your left in your kingdom."
"You don't know what you're asking," Isa said to them. "Can you drink the cup of bitterness that I am about to drink?" "We can," they answered.
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The rest of the ten disciples heard about this. They were very angry with the two brothers.
Jesus called them together and said, "You know that the rulers in the Gentile world lord it over their people, and their high officials exercise power over them."
Don't do that. On the contrary, anyone who wants to be important among you must be your servant.
And he who wants to be first must be a slave to you.
Be like the Son of Man. He did not come to be served, but to serve others. He came to give his life as a ransom for many, to be a sacrifice for the sins of others.
Jesus and his disciples were going from Jericho. And a large crowd followed him.
Two blind men were sitting by the roadside. They heard that Jesus was passing by, and they cried out, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The attendants ordered them to stand up. They were told to be quiet. But the two men shouted louder, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stood still and stammered at them. "What do you want me to do for you?" he said.
"Sir," they answered, "we want to see."
Jesus felt great concern for them. He rubbed his eyes. Immediately their sight became clear. And they followed him.
Jesus walked to Jerusalem.
Even as they approached Jerusalem, they came to Bethphage, on the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two disciples.
He told them: "Walk to the village ahead of you. As soon as you arrive, you'll see a donkey tied up. Her foal will be with her. Untie them and bring them to me."
If someone tells you that, tell them "God needs you." And if the owner says, "We'll send him back soon."
This is to fulfill what they had said in the name of the Prophet. This says,
"Say to the daughter of Zion, 'Behold, your King is coming to you. He is humble and mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.'"
The disciples went and did what Jesus told them.
They brought the donkey and the mule. They put their saddles on them. Then, Issa sat on the saddles.
Many people spread their carpets on the road. Others cut branches from trees and spread them on the road.
Some of the people went ahead of him, and some followed behind. They all shouted, "We are on the side of David!" "We are on the side of the one who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Zechariah 11:8) "We are on the Lord's side, on the side of his throne!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred. The people asked, "Who is this?"
The crowd answered, "This is Jesus. He is the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." **Jesus cleanses the temple**
Jesus entered the temple complex. He began to drive out all the people who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and tipped over the chairs of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer' (Isaiah 56:7); but you have made it 'a den of robbers' (Jeremiah 7:11)."
The blind and the lame came to Jesus in the temple, and he healed them.
The chief priests and the teachers saw the great things he did. They also saw the children in the temple area shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" But when they saw all this, they were indignant.
"Do you hear what those children are saying over there?" they asked him. "Yes," Jesus answered. "Haven't you read," he said to them, "'From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise'?" (Psalm 8:2)
Then Jesus left the disciples and went away from the city to Bethany. He spent the night there. The fig tree remained withered.
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way to the region of Judea and the Jordan. He was hungry.
He saw a vine laden with grapes along the way. He went up to it and found nothing on it but leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" Immediately the vine withered.
When the disciples saw this, they were astonished. "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?" they asked.
Jesus answered, "What I tell you is true. You must have faith and not doubt. Otherwise, you will not be able to do what you see these fig trees doing. You can even say to this mountain, 'Go and throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done."
"If you believe, you will receive what you ask for in prayer." "Jesus' authority is questioned."
Jesus entered the temple courts, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. "By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked. "And who gave you this authority?"
Jesus replied, "I will ask you two questions. If you answer me, then I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
"Where did John's baptism come from? From heaven, or from men?" They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Why then did you not believe him?'"
What if we say, 'from among men'? We are afraid of people. Everyone believes in those who came before.
This is how they answered Jesus, "We don't know." Jesus said, "Well, I won't tell you who I am, but I will tell you that I do all these things." The story of the two sons.
"What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work today in the vineyard.'"
"It's not me," his son replied. But then he changed his mind and left.
Then his father went to his other son. He told him the same thing. The son said, "What can I do, my lord?" but he did not go out.
"Which of the two sons is the more diligent? 'The younger one.'"
John came to show you the right way to live, and you didn't believe him. But the vagabonds and prostitutes believed them. You saw this, but even then, you didn't turn back and believe them. The story of the tenants.
Hear another story. A man owned a piece of land, he planted a vineyard. He put a fence around it. He dug a pit for the wine press. Then he built a watchtower. He leased the vineyard to some farmers. Then he went on a journey.
At harvest time, he sent his servants to hire laborers. And he said to his foreman to gather his share of the crop.
"As for the one who was renting, they tortured him. They gave him a beating. One killed him. They tore apart another one to death."
Then the man sent other servants. He sent even more than the first time. The vine-growers treated these servants in the same way.
"No, he sent his child to them. 'So they will respect my son,' he said."
"But those who were renting saw the son coming. They said to each other, 'This is the one who will one day take all the owner's possessions. Come, let's kill him, and everything will be ours.'"
And they shook him and crushed him outside the gardens. Why didn't they kill him?
When the farm owner returns, what will he do with the intruders?
He will make those evil people stop. He will lease this vineyard to other people who will pay him rent with its produce at harvest time.
Jesus said to them, "Have you not read what is written in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes' (Psalm 118:22-23)."
This is what I am telling you. The kingdom of God takes away from you and gives it to those who will bear fruit.
Everyone who falls on a stone will be broken. But the stone will crush whoever falls on it.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables. They knew he was speaking about them.
Okay, here is the text translated as requested: They could look for a way to arrest him. But they were afraid of the tumult. The people believed that Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Tale
Jesus spoke to them in parables again. He said,
"This is how the kingdom of heaven is like. A king prepared a wedding banquet for his son."
Obido sent an invitation to Lily and Lily to have dinner. They said they would come, but they refused.
"Okay, I've hired a few more workers. I told them: 'Tell those who are having dinner that I've found my dinner. I've slaughtered bulls and fat cows. Everything is ready. Come.'"
"But the people didn't notice. One went to his field, and another to his work."
The rest kidnapped their slaves, treated them with contempt, and killed them.
The king was very angry. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed whom they killed and burned their city.
The king said to his servants, "The wedding bill is ready. But the guests I invited didn't come."
Walk to La Cadria. Call for dinner whoever you find. (Tunisian Arabic Translation) (Note: "La Cadria" is a specific location and cannot be directly translated.)
The servants went out into the streets. They gathered all the people they found, good or bad. Soon the wedding hall was filled with guests.
The king entered to see the guests. He noticed a man who was not married.
"My friend," he said, "How did you get in here without wearing something suitable for a wedding?" The man had nothing to say.
The king said to his servants: "Bind his hands and feet. Shake him and put him in the darkness. People will weep and gnash their teeth."
Many are called, but few are chosen. Should we pay taxes to Caesar?
They brought out the Pharisee. They appointed Pilate to bring down Jesus with his own words.
"They sent their disciples to him. And we, by our Lord, will come to them with the truth. 'O teacher,' they said, 'we know you to be a man of honor. Follow the path of my Lord with truth. Do not let them eat your fruit or your labor.'"
"So, what do you think? Should we pay taxes to Caesar, or not?"
But Jesus knew their evil intentions. He said, "You hypocrites! Why do you want to harm me?"
Show me the coin people use for paying the tax. They brought him a silver coin.
He asked them, "Whose is this picture? And whose are these words?"
He told them, "Caesar." He told them, "Caesar." He told them, "Caesar." He told them, "Caesar." He told them, "Caesar." He told them, "Caesar."
When they heard this, they were astonished. Then they left him and went away. The wedding took place at the time when the dead begin to rise.
On that very day the Sadducees came to him and asked him, "If a woman dies after marrying several husbands, whose wife will she be in the resurrection?"
"Teacher," they said, "this is what Moses told us. If a man dies and has no children, his brother must marry his wife. He must father children so that his brother's name will not die out."
We had seven brothers. One got married and moved away. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened to groups of two and three. It even happened to groups of seven.
And in the end, the woman died.
"Come on, when the time comes for him to die, who will be his wife? All seven of them were married to her."
Jesus answered, "You are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God."
When the dead sit, they do not marry. Their children do not give them away to marry. They remain like the angels in Paradise.
"What are you talking about regarding the certificates of resurrection? Didn't you read what God has said?"
He said, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.' (Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
At the time that the masses heard this, they awoke from what they had been taught. The most important testament.
The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees couldn't answer Jesus. So, the Pharisees gathered.
One of them had authority under the law. Therefore, they brought Jesus before him.
"Teacher," he said, "what is the most important commandment in the law?"
Jesus answered, " 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' (Deuteronomy 6:5)"
This is the first and most important rule.
"You shall love your neighbor as yourself." (Deuteronomy 19:18)
"Everything written in the sacred texts and heavenly books is based on these two matters." "But who was it that gave birth to Christ?"
The Pharisees gathered together. Jesus asked them,
What is your opinion of Christ? Whose son is he? "He is the son of David," they answered.
He asked them, "Why does David call him 'Lord'?" The Holy Spirit spoke through David. David said,
"The LORD said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.'" (Psalm 110:1)
Well, if David says 'my lord', how can he be David's son?
To some extent, they answered with a single word. From that day on, no one ever asked him a question again.
Jesus condemns the Pharisees and the scribes.
Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples.
"Teachers of the Law and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat," he said.
"You need to listen to them. Do everything they tell you. But don't do what they do. They don't do what they say."
They work on the heads of idiots and pass them on to others. But they only like to throw them away.
Everything they do, they do it for people to see. They put small boxes on their foreheads and arms containing verses from the books. Their boxes are very wide. And the stick at the end of their clothes is very long.
"They love to sit in the courtyard in the evening. They also love to take the best seats in the synagogue."
They love those who they meet in the markets. And they like those who call them "Lord".
"You can't be called 'Lord'. You only have one teacher, and you're all brothers."
Do not call anyone on earth 'Father,' for you have one Father, who is in heaven.
You are called 'teachers.' You have one Teacher, the Christ.
The most important one among you will be your servant.
What goes up must come down. And what comes down will go up.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You lock the gates of the kingdom of heaven in people's faces; you yourselves do not enter, and you hinder those who are trying to enter."
Tunisian
"We are almonds, but you are locusts, Pharisees! Locusts! They will bring a Tunisian to embrace their religion. 'Wait, and then they will make more than you, a person who is not even an almond.'
"Woe to you, blind guides! You say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing; but anyone who swears by the gold of the temple is bound by their oath.'
You're blind and stupid! Which is more important? Is it gold? Or is it the sacred structure that makes gold blessed?
Zada says: "There were those who swore by the altar, that's empty talk. But there were those who swore by the gift they were given, they must keep their oath."
Oh my eyes! What's more important? The gift? Or the altar that makes the gift sacred?
"So then, whoever swears by the altar, swears by the altar and by everything on it."
And everyone who swears by the temple swears by the temple and by the one who dwells in it.
And whoever swears by the sky, swears by Allah, the Throne, and by the One who sits upon it.
How blind you are, you teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin—but you have neglected the more important aspects of the law—justice, mercy and faith. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former.
You blind fools! You avoid eating a small almond, but you swallow a whole camel!
"Well, you know, the teachers of the law and the Pharisees! Hypocrites! They clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. You clean the outside, but inside you are full of extortion and wickedness. You blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel."
Zealous Jew! LOL, clean the rim of the glass and the tea. Now the outside will be clean too.
How well it has gone for you, teachers of interpretation and French speakers! You pretenders! Like whitewashed tombs from the outside. They appear impossible in the lounge. But inside, they are not like whitewashed tombs from the outside. They appear impossible in the lounge.
What sets you apart. You seem right from the outside, but inside you're full of wrong. You pretend to be someone you're not.
"Shame on you, teachers of the law and the Pharisees! You hypocrites! You build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.
And you say, 'If we had lived in the times of those who lived before us, we would not have done what they did. We would not have aided in the killing of the prophets.'
That's fine, you can testify against yourself. And admit that you are the one who killed the other boys.
Fine, continue the sins that your predecessors started!
"O den of vipers! How can you escape the sentence of hell?"
حسنا، نعطيك الترجمة بالتونسية: **فأنا مرسل لك الأنبياء والحكماء والمعلمين. تقتلهم هكذا**
Alright, so you can be compensated for the blood of the righteous people that was shed on the earth. I speak of the blood of the righteous Abel, the blood of the righteous Zachariah, son of Berechiah, who was killed between the altar and the temple.
This is the truth I'm going to tell you. This is all going to happen to those who are alive now.
"Woe to you! Woe to you! You kill our prophets and stone those who are sent to you. How often I wanted to gather your people together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you would not!"
Look, your house is empty.
"How shall I say it to you? I will not see you again until you say: 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'" (Psalm 118:26)
Signs of the End Times
Jesus went out of the temple. He was walking, and the disciples came to Him. They wanted to draw His attention to the buildings.
"Have you seen all these things?" said Jesus. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. Then the disciples came to him, each one on his own initiative. "Tell us," they said, "when will this happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end of the age?"
Jesus answered, "Watch out! Be on your guard against false prophets."
Many people will come in my name, saying, "I am the Christ!" and they will deceive many.
In order to hear me, there are wars. In order to hear more, there are also people talking about upcoming wars. Don't worry. This is what needs to happen. But the end is not here yet.
People fight people. States fight states. People walk hungry. There are earthquakes in many places.
All this is the beginning of birth and hungry creation.
"People only give you what you ask for so they can treat you with respect and fulfill your requests. The whole nation will hate you because of that."
At this time, many people will turn away from their faith. They will hate each other. They will hand each other over to their enemies.
Many infallible prophets are encrypted. It prevails over much that is sent. (Note: This sentence seems to be in a dialect of Arabic, possibly Tunisian, and the translation provided is a literal one. The meaning may not be clear without additional context.)
"Because evil will increase, and cold love will increase among most people."
But whoever endures to the end will be saved.
This good news of the kingdom is to be preached throughout the world, to all nations, as a testimony to them. Then the end will come.
The prophet Daniel spoke of "the abomination that desolates" (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11). In those days, as you see it standing in the holy place, let everyone read and understand this.
It's the one who's going to betray that must flee to the mountains.
Until one is on the roof, one doesn't come down to get something.
No one in the playground needs to go back and pick up their coat.
How hard it must have been in those days for pregnant women! How hard it must have been for nursing mothers!
Pray that you will not have to escape in winter or on the Sabbath day.
How anyone could bear those days. How it could be worse than anything else from one day to the next. And how nothing would ever be the same again.
If time hadn't been shortened, no one would survive. But thanks to God's chosen people, it will be.
At that time, someone will say to you, "Look! Here is the Christ!" or "There he is!" Do not believe it.
Liars and false prophets will come to deceive. They will perform great signs and miracles to try to deceive the people whom God has chosen, if possible.
See, I told you before.
If someone tells you, "It's very common in the desert," don't be afraid to go there. Or if someone says, "It's very common inside the house," don't believe it.
The lightning that comes from the east is seen in the west. This will be the same as when a child of man is born.
The starling gathers where there is a dead body.
After what they have despised, "The sun shall be darkened in its going forth, and the moon shall not cause its light to shine. The stars shall be darkened in their rise, and the constellations shall not give forth their light." (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the peoples of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory.
He will send His messengers with a loud trumpet blast. His chosen people will gather from the four corners of the earth. He will lead them from one heaven to another.
Learn a lesson from the fig tree. As soon as its branches become tender and its leaves sprout, you know that summer is near.
And Zada, how do you see all these things? You don't know they're almost gone. They're right in front of the door.
What should I tell you the truth. The people who lived in that period certainly wouldn't have died if all those things had happened.
Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall never pass away. No one knows the day or the hour.
No one knows the day or the hour. Not even the angels in heaven know. Not even the Son knows. Only the Father knows.
Think about how it was in the days of Noah. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people ate and drank. They married. They gave their daughters in marriage. They did all those things right up to the day Noah entered the ark.
They do not know what will happen until the clouds come and gather them all. That is how it will be when the Son of Man comes.
Two men in the village. One takes and the other leaves.
Two women are grinding in Miller's hand. One takes it and the other leaves it.
"Be careful. You don't know the day your enemy will come for you."
You need to understand something. Imagine if the homeowner knew when the thief was coming. Then, he could have been vigilant. He wouldn't have left his house to be broken into.
It's essential that you be present. God's child is coming at an unexpected hour.
The master appointed one of his servants in charge of the rest of the servants in his house. The servant's task is to feed them at the proper time. The master loves this servant because he is faithful and wise.
Good for the servant if he finds my master doing his service when my master returns.
This is what I'm going to tell you is true. The master will leave this servant in charge of everything he has.
We used to say that that servant was a devil. And he would say to himself, "My master is very, very, very strict."
He needs to start beating the other servants. He must eat and drink with the people who drink a lot.
The master had the servant come back on a day when the servants did not expect him. He came back at an hour the servants did not know.
After the mole is cut into pieces, they will be sent to the place where the claimants go. People will cry and grind their teeth.
The Tale of Ten Bridesmaids
Here is the translation into English: "Then the kingdom of heaven will be like this. Ten virgins took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom."
Five of them were cheaters. Five were wise.
The olive pickers shook the olives down and took olive oil with them.
The philosophers poured oil into their lamps with their vases.
The groom didn't come for a long time. As a result, all the guests got tired and fell asleep.
"At midnight, someone called, 'This is it! Get the cable out!'"
Mala, all the bride's friends woke up and prepared their gifts.
The enthusiast said to the miser, "Give us some of your oil. Our lamps are about to go out."
"No, answer them. Maybe it won't be enough for all of us. Instead, go to the oil sellers. Buy some for your needs."
That's how they went to buy oil. But as they were walking, the groom arrived. The girls who were ready went with him to the wedding dinner. Then the door was closed.
"Go, the last brides have arrived. "Go! Go!" they said. "Open the door!"
"As for him, he replied, 'What I see in you now is true. I didn't know you.'"
"So be careful. You don't know the day or the hour the groom will come. The story of three servants."
Again, this is the likeness of the kingdom of heaven. A certain king went on a journey. He called his servants and entrusted his goods to them.
He gave ten thousand dollars to one man. He gave four thousand dollars to another. And Ziyad gave two thousand dollars to the third. The man forgave each servant the amount that the servant was supposed to manage. And then he went his way.
The waiter who shook the thousand dollars out of ten thousand quickly turned around and put his money back to serve them. He brought an extra ten thousand dollars.
The winner of four thousand dollars added another four thousand dollars.
As for the man who took a thousand dollars, he went away and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money in it.
After a long time, Mr. Duke returned with his servants. He wanted to collect all the money that had been given to him.
The man who borrowed $10,000 brought another $10,000. "Teacher," he said, "I trusted you and you lent me $10,000. Look, here are another $10,000 I've made."
My master said: 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful in a few things. I will set you over many things. Come and share your master's joy!'
The man who had $4000 came back. He said, "Sir, you insured me for $4000. Look, I won another $4000.
My master said: 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful in a few things. I will set you over many things. Come and share your master's joy!'
The man who took the $2000 has come. "Teacher," he said, "I knew you were a tough guy. You reap where you sow. You gather the harvest where you planted the seed."
Alright, I was scared. I went out and buried your 2000 dollars in the ground. Look, this is what belongs to you.
"Sir, he replied, 'You foolish and lazy servant! How did you know that I sow in places where I have not sown? How did you know that I gather crops in places where I have not scattered seed?'"
Well, I should have put my money in the bank. On the way back, I would have taken my money and added the interest.
"My lord ordered the servants to others, 'Take two thousand and two hundred dollars, give it to the one who has twenty thousand dollars.'"
Everyone has more to gain. To take more than enough. And who has enough? Until what does he have to overflow?
Out for those who have no purpose. Here in the dark, people are cursing and grinding their teeth. 'Sheep and goats'
"This man, he came with beauty and all. All the damned came with him. So, sit on your throne beautifully in the splendor of Paradise."
All nations gather before him. He separates the people, two by two, like a shepherd separating sheep from goats.
He puts the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
"Okay, here's the text translated into Tunisian Arabic, as requested: 'Mala, el malik yteklem ma' li 'ala yminou. Ykol: 'Ya waldi, bourkta. Aji khod li houwa hakak. Houwa el mamlaka li taharrat lek milli khouk el 'alam.'"
I was hungry. You gave me something to eat. I was thirsty. You gave me something to drink. I was a stranger. You hosted me.
I had my things. And you brought them to me. I was sick. And you took care of me. I was in jail. And you came to visit me.
"Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me." "Teacher," they asked, "when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?"
Where did we see you as a stranger and not give you enough? Where did we see you in need of help and not provide it?
When did we see someone sick or in prison and go to visit them?
The governor replied, "What I am about to tell you is true. Anything you have done to one of the least of these brothers of mine, you have done to me."
Don't turn left, "You are cursed! Go away from me to the fire that didn't burn. It's reserved for the devil and his angels."
I got hungry. But you didn't give me anything to eat. I got thirsty. But you didn't give me anything to drink.
You were a stranger, but you did not offer me anything. I was in need, but you did not give me anything. I was sick and in prison, but you did not care for me.
Ziad replies: "Sir, we tested you to see if you were hungry or playing, and we didn't see you as Ziad. We tested you to see if you were strange or playing, and we didn't see you as Ziad. We tested you to see if you were Sin or playing, and we didn't see you as Sin. We tested you to see if you were Sin or playing, and we didn't see you as Sin."
To respond, "What I'm about to tell you is true. Anything you haven't done for one of the least of these, you haven't done for me."
"No, they will go away to be punished forever. But those who did what is right will have eternal life."
The plan to kill Jesus (peace be upon him).
Jesus finished all this discourse. Then he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is two days away. The Son of Man will be handed over to them to be crucified.
The high priestess met with the elders of the people. They met in the palace of Caiaphas, the high priest.
They made a plan to capture Jesus cleverly, and they wanted to kill him.
"As for those who don't return for the feast," they said, "people might cause trouble." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in Bethany. He was in the house of a man named Simon, who had a skin disease.
I went to our master Jesus with a special bag well-sealed and containing a very expensive perfume. He poured the perfume on his head while he was at the table.
When the disciples saw this, they were indignant. They said, "Why is this waste?"
"This perfume could have been sold at a high price. This money could have been given to poor people."
Jesus knew this. So he said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a good deed to me."
The mallow stays with you always. But I'm not always with you.
Spraying perfume on my body to prepare me for burial.
"May God make you believe in me. She did it so that they would talk about her wherever they spread this good news in the whole world. So that they would remember her." Judas agreed to hand Jesus over to the people.
One of them, named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests.
He asked, "What will you give me if I hand Jesus over to you?" They paid him thirty pieces of silver.
Then Judas watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to the Jews.
The first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread came, and the disciples approached Jesus. They asked, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover meal?"
He said, "Go to the city to a certain man. Tell him, 'The teacher says: "I am about to celebrate Passover in your house with my students." ' "
The disciples did as Jesus had told them. They prepared the Passover meal.
In the evening, Jesus was at a table with a tax collector.
As they were eating, he said, "What I am about to tell you is true. One of you will hand me over to my enemy."
The pupils were sad. One was leaving, and he kept saying, "It's not me, teacher, it's not me!"
Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand with me in the dish, he will betray me.
"A slave is born to live as destined. But how wretched is he who gives birth to a slave! It would be better if he didn't exist."
Judas was the one who would betray him. He said, "Not me, Rabbi, is it?" Jesus said, "Yes, it is you."
As they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and gave thanks, and broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take, eat; this is my body."
Then he handed the cup around, saying, "All of you drink from it."
These are my tears for the new covenant. I shed them so that many sins may be forgiven.
"This is what I am telling you. From now on, I will never drink with you again, unless it is in my Father's kingdom."
This is how they sing the hymn and go out onto the porch. Jesus says that Peter will fail.
Jesus said to them, "This night you will all fall away on my account. For it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)"
"Then, when we are sent back, we will walk ahead of you in the garden."
Peter replied, "Everyone else seems to stay away from you. Not me."
"Truly I tell you," Jesus said, "today, even this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times and say, 'I don't know him.'"
But Peter said, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never say that I don't know you." And all the other disciples said the same thing. Jesus prayed in Gethsemane.
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
Peter and the two sons of Zebedee began to follow him. He told them to come with him, and they became his disciples.
He said to them, "My heart is about to melt. I feel like I'm about to become an angel. Stay here. Watch with me."
He walked a little further. Then he fell, his face hitting the ground. He prayed, "Father, if possible, take this cup of suffering away from me. Yet, not my will, but yours be done."
Then he went back to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Why don't you come and sleep with me for an hour?" he asked Peter.
Watch and pray. That's how you avoid sin when temptation arises. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Jesus walked away a second time. He prayed, "Father, if this cup may pass from me, yet not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned. He found them sleeping. They couldn't open their eyes.
Good, he shook them and went again. For the third time, he prayed for the same thing.
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "You still have a little time left to dive and rest. See the hours and minutes approaching; the Son of Man is about to be seized in sin."
"Come on! Let's go! That's the man who hands them over to me!" Jesus is arrested.
As he was still speaking, Judas arrived. He was accompanied by a large crowd carrying swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
"Judas, who was to betray Jesus, had agreed on a signal with them. 'The man I kiss is the one,' he said. 'Seize him.'"
Fine, here you go: Judas went to Judas Iscariot quickly. He said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "It is finished. Father, into your hands I commit my spirit." And with that, he breathed his last. Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other. But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus' side with a spear, and immediately blood and water flowed out.
At that moment, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
"Put your sword away," said Jesus. "All who take the sword will die by the sword."
"Should we really ask Dad to help me? He'll instantly send a powerful army of over 70,000 angels."
"But how can the books be realized? He says they must be done in this way."
At that time, Jesus said to those present: "Am I sitting here waging war against you with an armed army?" And he asked them: "Do you come out against me with swords or clubs? Every day I sat in the temple courts and taught. And you did not arrest me."
"But this has happened so that the word might be fulfilled that was spoken by the prophet, 'And he was numbered with the transgressors.' And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads and saying, 'You who would save others—yourself you cannot save!' Jesus cried out with a loud voice, 'Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!'"
Then they seized Jesus, bound him, and led him away to Caiaphas the high priest. And the scribes and the elders were gathered together to him.
Not long after, Peter followed Jesus. He went straight to the high priest's palace. He went in and sat with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.
But since they found no evidence, many false witnesses came forward, and finally two other witnesses appeared.
They said, "He said, 'I am the star that destroys the temple of my Lord. I can rebuild it in three days.' "
Then the high priest stood up and asked Jesus, "Will you not answer? What is it that these men are accusing you of?"
Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."
"Yes. Just as you say," Jesus replied. "But I tell you that in the coming days you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."
Umm, here he is. Then, the high priest tore his clothes. He said, "He has spoken blasphemy against God! Why do we need other witnesses? You heard him say this evil thing."
What do you think? He must die, answer.
Then they spat in his face. They struck him with their hands. And they kissed him.
They said, "Tell us, Jesus! Who struck you?" Peter, who did not know Jesus, replied to them.
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A servant girl came and said, "You were also with Jesus of Galilee."
In front of everyone, Peter said it wasn't him. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.
Huka went out to the door that was shaking for the horserace. Then she saw another woman with him. She told the people, "This man was with Isa son of Maryam."
He still says he doesn't know. Under oath, he said, "I don't know the man!"
"A little time, those who are standing there will come for Peter. 'You are one of them,' they told him. 'The plane you are talking about will land for you."
Then Peter began to curse and speak evil of himself. He swore and said, "I do not know the man!" From the very beginning, you can hear the rooster crow.
Peter thought to himself, "Jesus told me, 'This chicken will crow,' said Jesus. 'Before you do it, you will say three times that you don't know me.'" Peter went out. He broke down and wept.
Judas hangs himself.
It was still dark in the morning. All the chief priests and the elders of the people had decided to arrest Jesus.
They tied him up and took him away. Then they handed him over to the palace, which was ruled by a governor.
Judas, who had betrayed him, saw Jesus condemned to death. He felt remorse and regret for his actions. So he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
He said, "I did wrong," and "I handed over a man who is not innocent." They said, "Do you think we are fools?" and "This is your game."
Alright, Judas took the money and left. Then he went and hanged himself.
The high priest shook the coin. They said, "This is forbidden, how can you put this money in the temple's box? This is his blood. This is salvation."
Okay, they decided to use the money to buy a plot of land for a pottery graveyard. People from other countries will be buried there.
That's why they still call it **Field of Blood** to this day.
The words of the prophet Jeremiah have come true. He said, "Take the thirty pieces of silver, the price at which they valued him, and whom they valued him at, the children of Israel."
They used the money to buy the potter's field, as the Lord directed me. (Zechariah 11:12,13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) They brought Jesus to the potter's field.
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus said, "You have said so."
But when the high priest and the elders confronted him, he did not respond.
And so they asked Pilate, "Don't you hear the charges they are bringing against you?"
But Jesus gave no answer, not even to a single word. The governor was greatly astonished.
This story takes place during the governor's reign, at the time of the Easter celebration, he releases one thief from prison. And the people choose who they want to be released.
At that time, they had a well-known prisoner among the people named Al-Barbarb.
Even then, Pilate asked the crowd, "Whom do you want me to release? Barabbas? or Jesus who is called the Messiah?"
Pilate knew that the leaders were jealous. He knew the reason they handed Jesus over to him.
Generally, investing in startups is considered risky, but with the potential for very high returns. **Why is investing in startups risky?** * **Failure Risk:** The vast majority of startups fail to meet their goals. This means a total loss of the investment.
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the people to ask for Barabbas and to kill Jesus.
"Which of the two do you prefer I release?" asked the governor. "Barbarossa," they answered.
"What should I do with Jesus, called the Christ?" said Pilate. The crowd answered, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What has he done wrong?" asked Pilate. But the crowd shouted louder, "Crucify him!"
"Look at what's not working. People started to get worried. So he took water and washed his hands in front of them. "It's not me who caused his death," he said. "You are responsible for this!"
The Tunisians said: "We and our children will bear the blame for his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas to go free. But he had Jesus whipped. Then the soldiers nailed Jesus to the cross.
The governor's soldiers led Jesus away to the palace, which was called the Praetorium. All the rest of the soldiers gathered around him.
Let's try on his clothes and dress him in a purple robe.
Then they twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!"
They hit him on the head with the handle of the stick again and again and again.
After they ignored him, they took off his cloak. They dressed him in his clothes. Then they spoke to him before taking him to be nailed to the cross. Jesus is crucified on the cross.
On their way out of the city, they met a man from Jebel Nafusa. His name was Simon. They compelled him to carry the cross.
They arrived at a place called Golgotha. Golgotha means "place of the skull."
They mixed wine with gall and offered it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it.
The time came to crucify him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots.
Sit down and stick together, that's the way to go.
Above his head they placed what was written against him: "This is Jesus, King of the Jews."
Two accomplices were executed with him. One on his right and one on his left.
Those who passed by shouted at Isa and made fun of him. They shook their heads.
And he said, "So you will destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days? Save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"
In the same way, the chief priests, teachers of the law, and elders mocked him.
"He has saved others," they said. "But he can't save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
He believes in God. If God were to save him now, he would desire it. He is the one who said, "I am the Son of God."
In the same way, those who were crucified with Jesus were also mocked. Jesus died.
From noon until three in the afternoon, the whole earth was covered in darkness.
Exactly at three, Jesus cried out in a loud voice. He said, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" This means "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of the bystanders heard Jesus crying out. They said, "He called Elijah."
As soon as one of them fell, he ran and brought a sponge. He soaked it in wine and put it on a stick. He held it out to Jesus so that he could drink.
The rest said, "Leave him alone. We'll see if he comes to save us."
After Jesus cried out loudly again, he died.
Voltammetry has been performed, has been performed, has been performed, has been performed, has been performed, has been performed, has been performed, has been performed, has been performed, has been performed, has been performed, has been performed, has been performed, has been performed, has been performed, has been performed.
Suddenly, the walls of the tomb broke. Many bodies of religious people who had died were brought back to life.
Coming out of the grave. After Jesus (peace be upon him) returned, they went to the holy city. A lot of people are going to be there.
The Roman commander and those guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that happened. They were very afraid. They cried out, "Surely he is the Son of God!"
Not far away, many women were watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs.
Mary Magdalene was among them. Mary, the mother of James and Joseph, was also there. So was the mother of the sons of Zebedee. Jesus was buried.
In the evening, a rich man from the city of Arimathea came. His name was Joseph. He became a disciple of Christ.
He went to Place Twice and asked for the body of Jesus. They told him, "Place Twice is the one who will give it to you."
Joseph shook the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
They placed him in a new tomb that had been carved into the rock. They rolled a large stone in front of the entrance to the tomb. Then he left.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting opposite the tomb. The tomb guards
The following day was the day after the preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
"My lord," he said, "we remember something that liar said when he was still alive. He said, 'In three days I will rise again.'"
So give the order to make the tomb secure until the third day. If you don't, his disciples might come and steal the body. Then they will tell the people that Jesus has been raised from the dead. This last lie will be worse than the first.
"I have a few guards with you," said Pilate. "Go. Secure the tomb as best you can."
They finished and unlocked the basement. They placed a stamp on the stone and left guards on duty.
Jesus rises from the dead.
"Hoble hoble, good morning hoble hoble, let's go and see the grave together. They didn't make a mistake, they didn't slip, they went to watch the grave."
A mighty earthquake shook the earth. An angel from my Lord descended from heaven. The angel walked to the cave. He rolled away a stone and sat upon it.
His body was as bright as light. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were very afraid of him, they started trembling as if they were dead.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified."
Not present! He's gone, as he said he would! Come see the place where he was lying.
Hurry up! Tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead. He is going ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there.' That is what I have told you.
The woman ran away from the tomb, fear and joy coursing through her. She ran to tell the disciples.
Suddenly they met Jesus. "Peace!" he said. They bowed their knees and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to the north. They will see me there." The guards told the chief priest.
The woman was walking and some of the rebels entered the city. They informed the high priests about what had happened.
How the high priestess met with the accomplices, they came up with a plan. They gave the soldiers a lot of money.
They said to them, "We love you to say, 'His disciples came at night. They stole his body while we were sleeping.'"
If the governor hears about this report, we'll pay him off. That'll keep you out of trouble.
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus' Final Orders to His Disciples
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they worshiped him. However, there are still a few who have doubts.
And so Jesus came to them and said, "I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth."
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And make sure they are always with me, until the end.
John the Baptist is preparing the way.
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
"Behold, I will send my messenger before you, who shall prepare your way before you." (Malachi 3:1)
"A tear fell from his eye, 'Reflect on the journey, in it there is a Lord. Reflect on the mirror, in it there is (your) self.' "
And John came. He baptized people in the desert. And he said, "Repent and be baptized, and your sins will be forgiven by the Lord."
All the people from the region of Judea went out to him. All the people from Jerusalem also went. When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John wore traditional Bedouin clothing. He had a camel hair cloak wrapped around his waist. And he ate locusts and wild honey.
"This is the one of whom I spoke. 'After me comes one who is mightier than I, so strong that I am not fit to stoop down and untie the thongs of his sandals.' "
"I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." Jesus is baptized and tempted.
At that time, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee. John baptized him in the Jordan River.
Jesus was coming up out of the water. At that moment, he saw the heavens opening. He saw the Holy Spirit descending on him like a dove.
A voice from heaven said, "You are my son, and I love you very much. I am very proud of you."
A holy spirit moved Jesus in the desert.
He was in the desert for forty days. An evil spirit tempted him. Wild animals did not harm Jesus. The angels took care of him. Jesus chose his first disciples.
After they had put John in prison, Jesus went to Galilee, preaching the good news of God.
"Yes, it's time," he said. "And God's kingdom is near. Forget all your worries and believe in me!"
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. He saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake; they were fishermen.
"Come. Follow me," said Jesus. "I will make you fishers of men."
At that moment, they cast their nets and followed him.
Jesus walked a little further. When he turned around, he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat mending their nets.
Then he called his disciples to him. They got into the boat with him, and immediately the boat was at the shore where the demoniac had been. But they followed Jesus. Jesus drove out the evil spirit.
Jesus and those with him went to the region of the Decapolis. As was his custom, he went to the synagogue on the Sabbath. There he began to teach and to read.
People were baffled by his teaching. He spoke to them as one with authority. He did not speak like the law professors.
At that moment, a man in their temple cried out loudly. He was possessed by an evil spirit. He said,
What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the holiness of God!
"Be quiet!" Jesus said loudly. "Get out of him!"
The wicked sabkha shook the man with a strong intention. Then they came out of him with a scream.
The algorithm is very good. Why do they start asking each other, "What is this? Something new in learning! And with a lot of stealth! It even gives orders to the evil ones, and they obey him."
Waking up to the news of Issa's stealthy escape surprises everyone in Kerkennah. Issa often surprises a lot of people.
Jesus and those with him left the synagogue. They immediately went with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother-in-law was lying in her bed. She had a fever. They told her about her daughter.
Her owner helped him... shook his hand and assisted him to stand... she left the kitchen... then she started serving them.
On the evening after sunset, they brought to Jesus all who were sick and possessed by demons.
The whole group in the village gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many of them. They had various diseases. He also cast out many demons. But he would not let the demons speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus went out to a solitary place to pray.
Early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house, and went to a place where he could be alone. He prayed there.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they shouted: "One for all, all for one!"
Jesus answered, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages. I must preach there also. That is why I have come."
They traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues, driving out demons, and healing people with every kind of disease and sickness. Jesus healed a man with leprosy.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus. He knelt down and begged Jesus, "If you choose to, you can make me clean."
Jesus filled with great concern. He reached out and placed his hand on the man. "I am ready to do it," he said. "Be 'clean'!"
"The disease is in its final stages. It will soon be cured."
Jesus sent him a sentence. He gave him a strong sentence of warning.
"Don't say this to anyone," he said. "Go and present your offering to the priest. Perform the sacrifices as Moses commanded. This will be a testimony to the priest and the community that you are clean."
But the man went out and began to speak openly. The news reached everyone. That's why Jesus couldn't enter any city openly. He remained in the wilderness and on the margins of life. But people still came to him from everywhere.
Jesus heals a man who cannot walk.
After a few days, Jesus returned to Capernaum. The people heard that he had come to his house.
A large crowd gathered, so that there was no longer any room, not even outside the door. And Jesus was preaching the word to them.
Four men came and brought with them a man who couldn't walk.
They could not bring him to Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus. Then they lowered the man down to him on a mat.
Jesus saw their faith. Then he said to the man, "My child, your sins are forgiven."
A few law professors are sitting there. They are thinking.
"Why is he talking like this? He's saying really bad things! It's not normal! If only God would create and forgive!"
Now Jesus knew what they were thinking, so he said to them, "Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?
"Brother, is it easier to tell a woman this, 'Your sins are not forgiven'? Or to say, 'Get up, take your language and your culture and leave'?"
"I tell you, this man had great faith! Let me tell you something: this man went home justified." Then Jesus said to the man who could walk, "Get up, pick up your mat, and go home."
"Hani told you," he said, "Get up. Grab your stuff and go back home."
The man stood up and swung his arms. He kept swinging and walking, and everyone watched. Everyone was present. They were all amazed. They praised God and said, "We've never seen anything like this!"
My Lord took me back to the sea again. A strong army came to Him. He began to teach them.
As he walked, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus. Levi was sitting at the tax collector's table. "Follow me," Jesus told him. Levi got up and followed him.
Jesus was having breakfast at Levi's house that evening. Many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples. They were part of the large group that followed Jesus.
Some Pharisee legal experts were going. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. So, they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this and said to them, "It is not those who are healthy who need a doctor, but those who are sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance." Jesus questions fasting.
John's disciples and the Pharisees' disciples fast and do not eat. Then some people came to Jesus and said to him, "John's disciples are fasting, and the Pharisees' disciples are fasting, but yours are not fasting. Why are they not fasting?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast."
But then there will come a time when the groom will leave their house. That day they will leave without eating.
"People don't sew a new patch of old cloth onto old clothes. If they do, the new patch will wear out and become detached from the old fabric. This will make the tear worse."
"You don't put new wine in old wineskins. If you do, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins will be ruined. No, you put new wine in new wineskins." Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On a Sabbath day, Jesus was walking through fields of wheat with his disciples. The disciples began to pluck and eat some of the wheat heads.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! It is against the law to do this on the Sabbath. Why are your disciples doing this?"
Reply: "Didn't you read anything about what David did? He and his men were hungry. They were looking for food.
In the time of Abiathar the high priest, David entered the house of God and ate the sacred bread. Only the priests were allowed to eat it. David also gave some to his men.
Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
Okay, here's the translation: "No, the man's son is still the boss even on Saturday."
He reserved a table for Saturday.
At another time, Jesus went to the Sanhedrin. There was a man there with a withered and crooked hand.
Some Pharisees were watching Jesus. They followed him closely. They were waiting to see if he would heal on the Sabbath.
Jesus spoke to a man with a withered and distorted hand. "Rise and stand before everyone," he said.
And some worshippers asked him, "What does the law say about us? What should we do on the Sabbath? Should we do good or evil? Should we save lives or kill?" But no one answered.
Jesus rolled his eyes at them in anger. He was very disappointed because their hearts were crooked. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He did, and his hand was restored whole.
Then the chief priests and the elders met with Herod, and on their plan to kill Jesus. Crowds followed Jesus.
Jesus went to the Sea of Galilee with his disciples, and a large crowd from Galilee followed them.
The people heard about everything Jesus was doing. And large crowds came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan River, and the region around Tyre and Sidon.
In plain sight, our Lord Jesus told his disciples to get into a small boat and go away from the crowd.
Jesus healed many people. So the sick crawled to touch him.
When the people saw the miracles he did, they fell at his feet. And they cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them, "Tell no one who I am." Jesus appointed the twelve apostles.
Jesus went up a mountain. He called to some people to come to him, and they came.
He chose twelve of them and named them apostles. From then on, they were with him. And he also sent them out to preach.
They were ruling, bringing out disasters.
Okay, here's the translation in Tunisian Arabic: باهي، هاك الترجمة باللهجة التونسية: عيسى سمى المجموعة اللي كان فيها اثناش شخص. من بينهم سيمون، اللي عيسى سماه "بطرس".
James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John were called by Jesus as "Boanerges," which means "Sons of Thunder."
And Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot were also with them.
Judas Iscariot was one of them. He was the one who later betrayed Jesus to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebub.
Jesus entered a house. Many people gathered. There were so many that Jesus and his friends could not eat.
"You've heard of this. They took responsibility. They said, 'He lost his mind.'"
A few law teachers were passing by. They came from Jerusalem. They said, "He is possessed by Beelzebub! He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons."
Okay, Jesus said to them and spoke to them in parables. He said to them, "How can Satan cast out Satan?"
If a kingdom fights against itself, don't just stand there.
If the family is dysfunctional, it can't stand.
