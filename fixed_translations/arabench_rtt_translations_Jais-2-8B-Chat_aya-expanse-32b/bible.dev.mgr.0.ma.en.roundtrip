So fourteen generations passed from Abraham to David, and fourteen generations from David to the Babylonian exile, and fourteen generations from the Babylonian exile to the Messiah. The birth of Jesus Christ
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Joseph, her husband, was a gentleman and a scholar... He didn't want to embarrass her in front of people... He planned to divorce her secretly without anyone finding out.
But how could Joseph think this way? An angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
"You will give birth to a son. You must name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."
All these things happened so that what the Lord said would come to pass. He had spoken through the prophet,
"A virgin will conceive and bear a son, and he will be called Immanuel." (Isaiah 7:14) The name Immanuel means "God with us."
Joseph awoke. He did everything the angel of the Lord had told him. He went to Mary, his wife.
But I'm hanging on to her, except when I'm holding hands with a boy, my right hand in his left, and his right hand in my left.
The wise man comes to Jesus.
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the reign of King Herod. After Jesus' birth, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
Solo: "Where is the child who was born to be the King of the Jews? We saw his star in the East. We have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was greatly troubled, as was all Jerusalem.
This is how it is: King Herod gathered together all the chief priests of the people, and also the teachers of the law. He asked them where the Christ was to be born.
"In Bethlehem in Judah," they answered. "That's what the prophet wrote. He said,
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times."
But what you said is true. King Herod secretly asked the wise men and from them, he learned exactly when that star had appeared.
Send them to Bethlehem. He told them, "Go! Search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, bring me news. Then I too can go and worship him."
...Then the wise men, when they heard the king, went their way. The star they had seen in the east went before them until it came and stood over the place where the child was.
When I saw their faces, I was delighted.
The magi went to the house. They saw the child with his mother Mary. They bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But my Lord will provide for them a pure life in this world, and will forgive them. He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.
When the wise men had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. "Get up!" the angel said. "Take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."
Joseph arose and took the child and his mother by night and departed into Egypt.
They remained there until the death of King Herod. Thus, the words spoken by the Lord on the prophet's path were fulfilled. He had said, "I called my son out of Egypt." (Hosea 11:1)
Herod understood that the wise men had come for him. He was filled with great jealousy. He gave orders concerning Bethlehem and its surrounding area. All the boys two years old and under had to be killed. This corresponded to the time when the wise men had seen the star.
In this way, the words that the prophet Jeremiah had spoken were fulfilled. He had said,
"I heard a voice from Ramah, wailing and great mourning. Rachel is weeping for her children, refusing to be consoled, because they are no more." (Jeremiah 31:15) Jesus' family returned to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel. Those who were seeking to kill the child are dead."
... Joseph grew up... the boy stirred and Mary brought them back to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee.
As you know, in a smoky city, there's really not much point in having a clear view.
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Repent to God! For the kingdom of heaven is near."
John is the one the prophet Isaiah spoke about. He said, "A voice cries out in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord. Make straight paths for him.' " (Isaiah 40:3)
John's pants were made of camel hair. He wore a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
They drove him out of Jerusalem, and out of all the land of Judah, and out of all the region around the Jordan.
And the one who sees good, let him follow Zainab's writing with the madmen.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the place where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
I'm eating your face off your picture.
"...Don't say it to yourselves...Abraham is our father...I'm telling you...God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones."
The non-participation in the house, every house has a small one waiting.
"I baptize you with water, calling you to repent of your sins. But one who is more powerful than I is coming after me; I am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire."
"He who has a pitchfork in his hand, let him thrust it into the stack and thus winnow the wheat from the chaff. But he who is not able to wield the pitchfork, let him kindle a fire that cannot be quenched." - Jesus Is Baptized
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. He wanted to be baptized by John.
But Zayd went to Qasrūm before he increased the price of the goods.
Jesus answered, "It must be this way. It is right for us to do this. It fulfills God's holy plan." Then John agreed.
Her hands are full of the evil that she has done, which will haunt her.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Jesus saw it as tempting.
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness, and the devil tried to tempt him.
Either 40 years or 40 years, which is better?
He descended upon him. He said, "If you are the son of God, command this stone to become bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'" (Matthew 4:4)
After the devil, God sent Jesus to the holy city. He stood on the highest point of the temple.
"Unless you are God's child," he said, "be silent. It is written, 'The Lord will command his angels concerning you, to guard you carefully. They will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.' " (Psalm 91:11-12)
Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'You shall not tempt the Lord your God.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
In the end, time came and gave every moron a platform. Praise be to God.
"When you bow down to me and worship me," he said, "I will give you all these things."
Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'"

John had entered the prison. When Jesus heard this, he returned to Galilee.
Jesus came from Nazareth. He went to live in the town of Cana in Galilee, situated by the lake in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
"This is the way, the way that the prophet Isaiah spoke of: 'A voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'"
The world is possessed by demons! White demons! The devil is among us! The world is a disgrace! The world is possessed by white demons!
"The people walking in darkness will see a great light. Those living in a dark land will experience a shining light." (Isaiah 9:1,2)
"...From that time on, the mice started squeaking... Woe to you who mock the mice... Woe to you who mock the mice... Woe to you who mock the mice..."
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. He saw two brothers, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
"Come closer. Follow me," said Jessou. "None of you will leave until you become the people they catch."
They left their nets and followed him.
From there, he saw two other brothers. They were James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, when Jesus called them.
They immediately left the boat and followed Jesus. Jesus healed the sick.
Jesus went throughout Galilee. There he taught in their synagogues, preached the good news of the kingdom of God, and healed every disease and sickness among the people.
News about him spread throughout Syria. People brought to him all who were sick with various diseases. Some were suffering from great pain. Others were possessed by demons. Some were convulsing. Others were completely immobile. And Jesus healed them all.
I come from Galilee, from the region known as the Decapolis, and from Jerusalem and Judea. And they came from the region beyond the Jordan.
Jesus Christ
Jesus saw the crowds. He went up the mountain and sat down. His disciples came to him.
"...and he began to teach them..." he said.
Your obedience to me is worth more than the kingdom of God.
Praise be to God, it's easy to deal with them.
Praise be to Allah for the victory, may He have mercy on the righteous of the past.
Praise be to Allah for the perfection in the creation of living beings, O Lord of the waters.
On one hand, hope is merciful; on the other hand, hope is merciful.
She was dear to his heart, but he left her.
God willing, on the day of reckoning, one will see God's pleasure.
Praise be to God for this successful and comprehensive event.
Masha'Allah, you know yourself and transform yourself from one noon to another, from one noon to another, you transform yourself from one noon to another, from one noon to another, you transform yourself from one noon to another, from one noon to another, you transform yourself from one noon to another,
 Be joyful and glad. Your reward in heaven is great. In the same way, people hurt the prophets who lived long ago. Salt and Light   
 "You are the salt of the earth. But suppose the salt loses its saltiness. How can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything. It will be thrown out. People will walk all over it.   
You are the light of the world. A city on a mountain cannot be hidden.
This is a phrase that no one can figure out, not one from here, not one from there, no one can figure out this phrase.
In the same way, let your light shine before others. Then they will see the good you do and will praise your Father in heaven. Jesus gives the full meaning to the law.
"I don't care about languages or success. I don't care about languages or failure. I'm not going to languages or failure."
What I will tell you is true. Heaven and earth will disappear before the smallest letter of the law disappears. Even the smallest stroke of a serif will disappear from the law until everything is accomplished.
 "Do not break even one of the least important commandments. And do not teach others to break them. If you do, you will be called the least important person in the kingdom of heaven. Instead, practice and teach these commands. Then you will be called important in the kingdom of heaven.   
"This is what I am telling you. You need to be more pious than the theologians and Sharia scholars. If you are not, you will surely not enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Murder."
"Forget about what's been said, focus on this task, don't fear, the company needs you to finish this task."
 But here is what I tell you. Do not be angry with your brother. Anyone who is angry with his brother will be judged. Again, anyone who says to his brother, 'Raca,' must stand trial in the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire in hell.   
Imagine yourself doing your religious duty. And remember that your brother has a score to settle with you.
"First, go and be reconciled with your brother. Then come back and offer your gift."
"Imagine someone has a claim against you and takes you to court. Settle this matter quickly. Do it while you're still on good terms with them. If you don't, they might take you to the judge. The judge might then hand you over to the officer, and you could end up in jail."
I'll tell you what's right. You won't leave until you pay the last penny! Betrayal.
"You shall not commit adultery." (Exodus 20:14)
And for this, you say to me, "You're welcome," as if you're the one who will be welcomed, but the welcome is for you.
"If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. Your eye is just one part of your body. It is better to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell."
"If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. Your hand is just one part of your body. It is better for you to lose it and not have your whole body go into hell. Divorce."
Divorce: A man may divorce his wife. If he divorces her, he must give her a written notice of divorce. (Genesis 24:1)
And I wish I could offer you more than just words, revealing to you the hidden, the mysterious, the escape, the wasted, the return, the destination, the journey, the place, and the goal.
"Once again, you have heard what was said of your ancestors: 'Do not break the promises you make to the Lord. Keep the vows you have made to him.'"
But this argument is not valid, it's just a way of speaking, the name itself is the honor.
Walking in the name of creation, the path of selling that, not in the name of paradise, it's the Mderet Rekabi.
And don't swear by my name. You can't open even a single atom of gold or coal.
Don't let your "yes" mean "no." Let your "no" mean "no." Anything more than this comes from the devil. Be kind to people.
It is written: "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth." (Genesis 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
And if this were for me, I wouldn't be created, O Lord, I wanted to ask you for what I wouldn't be created, O Lord.
Let them iron your shirts. Let them iron your suit too.
Walking with him for two miles together was as if someone was forcing you to walk an extra mile.
Give me some credit, and don't steal my thunder.
"You shall not take revenge or bear a grudge against your fellow countrymen. 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' (Leviticus 19:18) 'Hate your enemies.'"
But this is what I am saying to you: Love your enemies. Pray for those who have hurt you.
Then you will be the son of that evil. "The houses of the dawn see the envious and the good. Send sheep to those who do good and to those who are not mentioned.
Haha, they love you, they love you, what's going on, there's one now.
Besides your age, what exactly is it that you don't want to talk about?
Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Charity to the poor
Clear that they are not suitable in the current situation and God knows best.
 "When you give to needy people, do not announce it by having trumpets blown. Do not be like those who only pretend to be holy. They announce what they do in the synagogues and on the streets. They want to be honored by others. What I'm about to tell you is true. They have received their complete reward.   
In the dim light, you'll find yourself market after market.
Of course your talk will be kept secret. Your father will support you. He understands your talk is secret. Prayer.
"When you pray, don't be like the hypocrites who only pretend to be pious. They love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners so that people will see them. I tell you the truth, they have already received their full reward."
"When you pray, go to your room. Close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. He will reward you. Your Father sees what you do in secret."

And if you do not name the truth in your habit, the truth and hopes will no longer name you.

A place of abundance in the heavens. Indeed, they will not be wronged by a single speck, nor will they be deprived. Indeed, they will not be snatched away by a dog or a thief.
Your heart is where the meeting with Allah is.
 "The eye is like a lamp for the body. Suppose your eyes are good. Then your whole body will be full of light.  
 But suppose your eyes are bad. Then your whole body will be full of darkness. If the light inside you is darkness, then it is very dark!   
Do not serve two masters at the same time. They will both want you and hate the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not increase your worries.
"Do not worry about these things, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or drink, nor about your body, what you will wear. Is life not more than food, and the body more than clothing?"
Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
Can you add even an hour to your life by worrying?
Why worry about clothes? Look how wildflowers grow. They neither work nor make clothes.
But that's what I'm telling you. Even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
If God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
Appointments or meetings, neither eating nor eating nor eating, nor the one's meetings.
People who walk around with a white stick every time your teacher is around.
"But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you."
Don't worry about tomorrow. Tomorrow will be worried enough about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.

"Do not cast your pearls before swine. If you do, they might trample them under their feet, and then turn and tear you to pieces. Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you."
Ask and you shall receive. Seek and you shall find. Knock and the door will open for you.
Everyone who takes part, but does it peacefully, when the night falls, a white rose takes part.
Imagine your child asking for bread. Who among you would give him a stone?
But he who asks for a single need, to whom will he direct the blame?
On the contrary, you are something that pertains to the description of your daughters. Shame on you for the problem you are causing, and shame on the one who advocates it, for God's sake.
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. This is the golden rule and the prophets' teaching. The big door and the small door.
Enter the kingdom of God through the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter by it.
 But the gate is small and the road is narrow that lead to life. Only a few people find it. A Tree and Its Fruit   
Forget about the Moroccan passion, your kindness was enough, you didn't think about the consequences.
You can know a tree by its fruit. "Does a man gather grapes from thorns? Or figs from thistles?"
In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A healthy branch cannot bear a rotten branch, and a rotten branch cannot bear a healthy branch.
Every tree that doesn't bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You can know a tree by its fruit.
Anyone who keeps saying "more and more" will eventually enter the realm of absurdity.
"Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord! Lord! Did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?'"
 Then I will tell them clearly, 'I never knew you. Get away from me, you who do evil!' The Wise and Foolish Builders   
"Yes, that's the one who listens to my words and applies them. He is building his house on the rock."
Singing about the unity of water, it flows and turns in my house, but water stands still on my house, and they all unite for life.
But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.
It rains in winter. The water rises. The wind blows and shakes that house. And it falls with a loud crash.
Jesus finished speaking these things. The multitudes were amazed at his teaching.
Learn in the manner of one who has authority. Do not speak in the manner of their law teachers.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain. Large crowds followed him.
A man with a bodily illness come and lean on me as much as you want, come and lean.
Jesus reached out and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!" Immediately the man was cured of his disease.
...Don't say anything...What's done is done...They're not even worth an onion...We've kept quiet...Don't remind me...What's done is done...They're not even worth an onion...We've kept quiet...Don't remind me...What's done is done...They're not even worth an onion...We've kept quiet...Don't remind me...What's done is done...They're not even worth an onion...We've kept quiet...Don't remind me...What's done is done...They're not even worth anything...
When Jesus came down to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached him and pleaded with him to help.
"Sir," he said, "my servant is bedridden and cannot move. He is in a lot of pain."
Jesus said, "I am going to go and heal him."
The leader replied, "Sir, I do not deserve you to come to my house. But just say the word, and my wishes will be fulfilled."
 I myself am a man under authority. And I have soldiers who obey my orders. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes. I tell that one, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."   
In the name of God, I was walking in the forest when I heard a gazelle calling out to me, saying, "Time and the young men."
 "I say to you that many will come from the east and the west. They will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of heaven. They will sit with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.  
But a single silence in the market raises doubts about their age, as they are both old and young.

Isa put his hand on hers and felt the heat emanating from her. She stood up and started scolding him.
As soon as it was evening, they brought to him many who were possessed with demons; and he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick.
"Surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows; yet we considered him stricken, struck by God, and afflicted. But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed." (Isaiah 53:4-5) The followers of Jesus are precious.
Jesus saw the large crowd following him. So he gave orders to his disciples to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
...Then a law professor came to him... the professor told him, "I'm your mentor... I'll follow you wherever you go..."
Jesus answered, "The fox has holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
One heartened him and said to him, "Sir, the first thing you need or desire, ask of me."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me. Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus rode in a boat. His disciples followed him.
Suddenly, a fierce storm arose on the lake. The waves broke over the boat. But Jesus was asleep.
The pupils who went to wake him up said to the captain, "Save us, we are going to sink."
"...But when you see these things happening before your eyes, can you free yourself or not?... he replied, 'Your faith is too small! Why are you so afraid...?' He got up and commanded the winds and the waves to stop. The sky became completely calm.
The people were amazed. "What is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!" "Jesus heals two demon-possessed men"
Jesus arrived at the other side of the lake, in the region of the Gadarenes. Two men possessed by demons met him. They came out of the tombs. The people were so violent that no one could pass by.
"Walid, what do you want from us? Come on, tell us what's bothering you."
There are no screws to tighten it.
The believers strive for the sake of peace in the market of paradise, O Lord.
Jesus said to them, "Go!" And the demons came out of the men and entered the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake. The pigs ran into the lake and drowned.
 Those who were tending the pigs ran off. They went into the town and reported all this. They told the people what had happened to the men who had been controlled by demons.   
So the whole city went out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who couldn't walk.
Jesus got into a boat. He went to the other side of the lake and arrived at his house.
Some men brought him a man who could not walk. He was lying on a mat. Jesus saw that they had faith. So he spoke to the head of the men, "Do not lose hope, my child. Your sin is forgiven."
Then some of the scribes said to one another, "This man is blaspheming!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to them, "Why do you have such evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Is it as simple as saying, "Forgiveness is for your sins"? Or should it be said, "Get up and walk"?
"I want you to know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he spoke to the man who could not walk. "Get up," he said. "Pick up your mat and go home."
The gentleman got up and went to his house.
One of the doors that the people's problems face is that they rely on police for routine gifts, God forbid that this issue becomes normalized and accepted.
And a man came up at that moment, whose name was Matthew. He was sitting in the tax office. "Follow me," said Jesus to him. And he got up and followed him.
Jesus was often invited to dine at the homes of tax collectors and "sinners." They would sit and eat with Jesus, and listen to his teachings.
"Why does your teacher eat with a group of people who have different religions?"
Jesus heard this and said, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick."
"We will go and learn what this means, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.'" (Hosea 6:6)
One day the disciples of John came to Jesus and said to him, "John's disciples and the Pharisees fast often and pray, but yours go about and eat and drink."
Jesus answered, "How can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
People don't sew a new piece of cloth onto old clothes. The new piece will sag from the old clothes. This will make the tear worse.
"People don't pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst, the wine will be lost, and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins. Then both are preserved." A dead daughter and a suffering woman.
While Jesus was saying this, a ruler came. He knelt before Jesus and said, "My daughter has just died. But come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
Jesus rose and went with them. They too are his.
Then, at that hour, a woman came from behind, touched him, and said, "If I just touch the hem of his garment, I will get well." She had been suffering from bleeding for twelve years. When she came up behind him, she touched the edge of his cloak.
She thought, "All I need to do is touch his belongings. Then I'll be cured.
Jesus turned and saw her. "Daughter," he said, "your faith has healed you. Do not lose hope." And the woman was healed at that very moment.
When this secret is revealed, it will cause a scandal because I am the scandal.
He told you to go away. The girl is not dead. She's just sleeping. But they laughed at him.
...Without her realizing it...he shook her between his hands...and took her to the bedroom...after the crowds had gathered and were dispersed...Jesus entered...took the girl by the hand...and she also stood up.
The news about Jesus spread throughout that whole region. Jesus healed two blind men.
I left here with a sad face, and they were hoping for us and peace.
From the house, the dear one enters the world's story, said Baw the storyteller.
And then I touched their eyes. I told them, "You will get what you believe in."
They could now see again. Jesus strongly warned them, "Make sure no one knows about this."
But they went out and went out into the street as they were told.
As they were going out, another man who was demon-possessed was brought to Jesus. He was blind and mute.
When human experiments were conducted, they followed the right person.
But the joy is great for the joy of the unexpected, a thought for the defeated.
Jesus went through all the towns and villages. He taught in their synagogues, proclaimed the good news of the kingdom, and healed every disease and sickness.
When he saw the mess, he felt his heart sink. They were scurrying around and shivering, like sheep without a shepherd.
And then Jesus said to his disciples: "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few."
"Ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest field."
Isa sent the message to Tony.
Jesus called together his twelve disciples and told them, "Go, cast out evil spirits, and heal every disease and sickness."
These are the names of the twelve apostles. The first is Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. After them are James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
The rest are Philip and Bartholomew, even Thomas and Matthew, the tax collector. And two others are James, the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus.
Finally, Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas was the one who would later betray Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent out the twelve with these instructions: "Don't go among the Gentiles, and don't enter any Samaritan town."
Instead of you going to the Israelites, they are like sheep that have gone astray.
"Walk and tell, here is the news, he has gone to this land, 'the kingdom of heaven is near.'"
The feeling of sickness and the departure of the conquerors, and the blessing of the grateful, and the scent, and the dispersion, and the parting, and the falling apart, and the disintegration, and the disintegration of the conquerors.
Do not take with you any gold, or silver, or copper in your belt.
It's not about the money, it's about the principle, and if it's about the principle, then it's not about the money.
Whenever you enter a town or village, look for someone who wants to welcome you. Stay at that person's house until you leave.
When you enter the house, greet those who live there.
Go home and rest, you're not feeling well.
 "Some people may not welcome you or listen to your words. If they don't, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or town.  
What I will tell you is true. On the Day of Resurrection, it will be easier for the people of Lot and the Gomorrahites than for the people of this city.
"I'll send you out like sheep among wolves. So be wise as a serpent and innocent as a dove."
Watch your head! The men are going to hand you over to the local courts. They will whip you in their temples.
Greetings to the people of Libya and the Middle East, for they share with us the children of God and creation.
"But when they grab you, don't think about what you're going to say or how you're going to say it. At that moment, they'll give you the right words to say."
"...It won't be you speaking...it will be your father's spirit speaking through you."
"Your brother will hand you over to the enemy, your father will hand over his children, and the children will rise up against their parents and kill them."
Everyone is different from me, but which one is married like a choice and still remains from me like a choice.
"When people attack you in one place, flee to another. What I'm telling you now is true. You will not finish passing through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes."
The pupil is not better than his teacher. The servant is not better than his master.
It is enough for the disciple to be as his master. And enough for the servants to be as their lord. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebub, what can the others who live there expect?
"They are all busy preparing the goods for the upcoming sale."
 What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight. What is whispered in your ear, shout from the rooftops.  
Don't trust the one who praises you excessively, and don't trust the one who gives you madness and madness is the effort in the river.
"Are two starlings sold for a pile of bricks? Or did one of them fall to the ground without its father knowing about it?"
Cover every inch of your body!
Lord, don't leave me, I'd rather have you than many tears.
"Would anyone dare to say in front of people that they know me? I'll also say in front of my father in heaven that I know them."
And let someone tell you that with certainty that there is no God with you, there is no God in heaven.
I didn't come here to bring peace to the world. I didn't come to bring peace. I came to bring a sword.
I entered the room and noticed that the description was on her side, and the woman was on her side.
An enemy of a man is one of his own household. (Micah 7:6)
"Neither land nor mother is respected by those who don't respect each other."
And my heart was not worthy of his love, which did not make him give up.
He who spills his own blood, let him spill mine too.
"To see the days of speed, to see the days of speed, to see the days of speed, to see the days of speed, to see the days of speed."
Welcome, O Prophet! This welcome is filled with mercy, and it is filled with mercy.
"I mean, some people are just naturally gifted and others can't help but feel a bit envious."
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus imparted his teachings to his twelve disciples. Then he went to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Jesus was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
Solo Issa "Are you the one who was supposed to come? Or should we look for someone else?"
Jesus answered, "Go back and tell John what you hear and see.
 Blind people receive sight. Disabled people walk. Those who have skin diseases are healed. Deaf people hear. Those who are dead are raised to life. And the good news is preached to those who are poor.  
Praise be to Allah, O Lord, grant me a good dream, O Lord, grant me a good dream.
And Jesus spoke to the multitudes about John, saying, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?"
So what?
So when you go out, what do you see? What's there? Oh, I'm telling you, there's more than what you see.
He is the joy in the village, draw near: "Let us rejoice and be glad for your sake." (Malachi 3:1)
"What I'm going to tell you is true. No one greater than John the Baptist has ever been born. But the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he."
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with power, and the violent take it by force.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
"Who is this person? Why are they talking to me, Lord?"
Those who have ears should listen.
"What can we compare today's people to? They are like children sitting in the markets, gossiping about others. They say,
"We played you a tune on the flute. You didn't dance. We sang a funeral song. You didn't mourn."
When I'm feeling low, I don't want anyone to say anything to me.
But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank, and they say, 'Look at this man! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' Yet wisdom is proved right by all who follow it.
Jesus began to speak about the cities where he had done most of his miracles. The people there had not repented for their sins. So he said,
 "How terrible it will be for you, Korazin! How terrible for you, Bethsaida! Suppose the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon. They would have turned away from their sins long ago. They would have put on black clothes. They would have sat down in ashes.  
But we tell you this: On the day of reckoning, it will be easier for Tiberias and Sidon than for you.
And you, Capernaum? Will you be exalted to heaven? No! You will go down to the place of the dead. For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained until today.
But this understanding of the law will force every veiled woman.
At that time Jesus said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants."
Oh, this is what I wanted.
My father gave me everything. A father is the only one who knows his son. And what the father knows is the son and the group that the son has chosen to know.
Enter the room and tell me how you're doing while you're taking a break.
Become my servants and learn from me. I am cool and refreshing. You will find rest for your souls.
"My introduction is easy, and my burden is light."
**Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath day**
One day Jesus was walking through a field of grain. His disciples were hungry, so they began to pick and eat some of the heads of grain.
Here is the translation: The Russians saw him. They said to Jesus, "Look! It is not lawful to do this on the Sabbath. But your disciples do it!"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him?"
So he entered the house of worship. He and his men ate the sacred bread. Only the priests were allowed to eat it.
What mark does the laws present every day? The laws of nature call every day, but the laws of man don't hear them.
He told me there's something here more important than the temple.
Scripture says, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' (Hosea 6:6) You do not understand what this means. If you did, you would not be condemning the innocent.
"The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
Ghaydoun men had makan, Sayyis entered a synagogue.
There was a man there with a withered and twisted hand. The Jewish religious leaders were always looking for reasons to criticize Jesus. So they asked him, "Does the law permit healing on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "What would you do if one of your friends fell into a well on Saturday? Wouldn't you go down and pull her out?"
*Rachid:* Yes, my lady, you know the news that happened. *Fatima:* Yes, my lady, everyone is talking about it. *Rachid:* Yes, my lady, you know the news that happened. *Fatima:* Yes, my lady, everyone is talking about it. *Rachid:* Yes, my lady, you know the news that happened. *Fatima:* Yes, my lady, everyone is talking about it.
"...when he said to him, 'Take hold of your head...' meaning 'Take hold of your things and don't waste time...' and that's what he understood from the man's words...and after all that...let's go back to their conversation...Jesus said to the man, 'Stretch out your hand...' and he stretched it out...and it was perfectly fine...just as..."
But the land has expenses and costs like any other day for Zine El Abidine the independent.
Jesus knew all the things the Pharisees were doing. So he left that place. Many people followed him, and he healed all who were sick.
But warn them not to say who he is.
This is what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: He says,
She is my sister, and she knows it, and that's why I am tormented by her, and she descends all kinds of miseries on me, and she tells tales about me.
They don't argue, they don't fight, they don't even shout at each other in the house.
What's done is done.
"The nations will see his righteousness, and all kings his glory, and you shall see the steadfast love of the Lord and the majesty of our God." (Isaiah 42:1-4) "Christ and Beelzebub"
One man, possessed by a demon, was brought to Jesus. This man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. After that, the man could speak and see.
Two complete sentences and he says, "What is the beauty of life?"
The audience heard this. At that moment, they said, "This man is casting out demons with Beelzebul, the prince of demons."
Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand."
"A demon has left a demon, fighting with itself. So, how will its kingdom remain?"
You say that you cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. But by whose power do they cast them out? Therefore, they will be your judges.
And as I have treated people with kindness, may Allah treat you with kindness, and may your good be better than all good.
"First, think about this. How can you enter a strong man's house and take only what belongs to the master? You first need to tie him up. Then you can steal his stuff."
"I don't even have one person who understands me. Whenever I confide in someone, they spread my secrets. By God, Amin, I am so disappointed."
This is what I am telling you: Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But speaking against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
May God protect those who speak a word in the palace, but also those in the city's palace, those who make the city laugh, and those who try to save the city.
"A good tree bears good fruit, a bad tree bears bad fruit. You can tell a tree by its fruit."
"Raki madrasa dial al-sharka! Kayfa tahid li li howa al-ism? Qoulak al-qoulayn kayqoul koulshi li fi qalbak." Translation: "You school of the company! How do you define the name? You with the two tongues say everything in your heart."
Krim said that the needs are best for those who strive to fulfill them.
But this is what I am saying to you: On the day of reckoning, people will be held accountable for every careless word they have spoken.
The introduction should be from the name or the place name in the future, like the old example, like the meal, like the meeting.
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem. They asked, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
Jobato: "The wicked and unbelieving seek after a sign! But no sign will be given except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
"John was in the belly of a great whale for three days and three nights. Something like that is going to happen to the Son of Man. He will be in the tomb for three days and three nights."
...And they will be judged by God...And they will be judged by God...And they will be judged by God...And they will be judged by God...And they will be judged by God...And they will be judged by God...And they will be judged by God...And they will be judged by God...And they will be judged by God...And they will be judged by God...And they will be judged by God...And they will be judged by God...And they will be judged by God...And they will be judged by God...And they will be judged by God...And they will be judged by God...
The kingdom of the north will rise up on the day of reckoning against those who are now living. And it will prove that they are guilty. She came from a very distant place to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And now there is one here who is greater than Solomon.
"What happens when an evil spirit leaves a person? It wanders through dry places, looking for a place to rest, but it doesn't find one."
"After that, he says, 'I'm going back to the house I left.' When he gets there, he finds the house empty. The house has been cleaned out, scrubbed, and emptied."
"Then the evil spirit goes and takes with him seven other spirits more evil than himself. They go in and live there, and the man becomes worse than before. That is how it will be with this evil spirit's offspring." - The mother of the Lord Jesus and his brothers.
While Jesus was still speaking to the people, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.
One told him, "Your mother and your sisters are outside. They want to talk to you."
"...He said to him, 'Who are my mother and my brothers?'...Jesus replied, 'Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?'"
Jesus shared with his friends. He said, "Behold my mother! Behold my brothers!"
Anyone who looks at what's inside it will find that it's my sister or my daughter.
The Farmer's Tale
Wakha! Haha, here's the translation of your text into Moroccan Darija: **Dak nhar nite, khrej Issa.
A large crowd gathered around him. He untied the boat. He got in. And all the choir members stood on the pier.
...to convey his idea to them... and how they could easily accept it... then he told them many things... through stories and tales... where he said... A farmer went out to plant his crop...
He cooled the bread. He put some on the roads. Birds came and ate it.
A seed fell in a rocky place where there wasn't much soil. The plants grew quickly because the soil wasn't deep.
When the sun rose, it burned the plants. They dried out because they didn't have roots.
The seed fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked the plants.
...but the other seeds fell on the soil and needed sunlight...and that's what happened...only that other seed fell in the right place.
She has three children.
The disciples came to him. They asked, "Why do you use parables when you speak to the people?"
Jesus answered, "The secrets of the kingdom of heaven have been revealed to you, but not to those outside."
Everything for those who have this future in front of them is indeed a lot, a lot, and even more for those who don't care about the future.
That's why I use stories when I talk to people. I say, "They see, but they really don't see anything. They hear, but they don't really hear or understand."
In them are the words of the prophet Izail, which are true. He said, "You will hear, but you will not understand. You will see, but you will not know what you are seeing.
"The hearts of these people have grown dull, their ears are slow of hearing. They have closed their eyes; otherwise they would see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed." (Isaiah 6:9-10)
And Lord, protect your eyes because they are easy to deceive, and Lord, protect your words
What death is going to show us is what our mother won't see.
Listen! Here is the meaning of the farmer's story.
...People hear the message about the kingdom but don't understand it...then comes the evil one...he steals what is planted in their hearts...those people are like that seed planted on the path.
Others received the seeds that fall in rocky places. These are the ones who hear the message and then receive it with joy.
But many people in the city change as if from this world when they are diagnosed with the disease.
Point me to the people, point the sheep to the pen, and the goats to the wild.
But the seed grows into everything new, like standing and emerging with the seed, matching its pace.
Jesus told the people another parable. "What is the kingdom of heaven like?" he said. "It is like a man who sowed good seed in his field."
But everything is expensive, and I'm just a poor student.
The wheat began to sprout and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
...My master...it...it...nothing...nothing...my lord...no...no...I planted...I planted...milk...milk...in my field...in my field...my lord...my lord...what came...what came...the crop...the crop...milk...milk...my lord...my lord...what happened...what happened...he said...he said...the crop...the crop...milk...milk...my lord...my
"This is bullshit," he replied. "Ask the servants, 'Do you want us to leave and run off with the marijuana?'"
"No," the owner replied. "While you're weeding, you might weed out the wheat along with the weeds."
'Let the two of them fight until it's time for the harvest. Then I will tell the workers what to do. This is what I will say to them: First, gather the weeds. Tie them into bundles to be burned. Then gather the wheat. Bring it to my barn.' 'The Stories of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast'
Jesus told the people a parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. A man took that seed and planted it in his field."
 It is the smallest of all your seeds. But when it grows, it is the largest of all garden plants. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest in its branches."   
Jesus told them another parable. "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast," he said. "A woman mixed it with a bushel of flour. The yeast worked its way through all the dough."
Isa wasted no words with the gathering in Bukhari. He didn't tell them anything without narrating a story.
The words the prophet spoke came true. He had said, "I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter hidden things from the time of creation." (Psalm 78:2)
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
He said, "Whoever sows the good seed is the son of man."
The earth is the world. Good crops represent the people who belong to the kingdom. Weeds are people who belong to evil.
The enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the day of reckoning. And the workers are angels.
"They will be gathered and thrown into the fire. That is what will happen on Judgment Day."
That son of man is going to send his angels. They will remove from his kingdom everyone who practices sin. They will even get rid of everyone who does evil.
They won't forgive me. They'll come back and break their teeth.
Tamazight: "Thimr n imray tmagt, thimzayt, thirstst." translates to English as: "The fruit of the palm tree is date, sugar, and thirst."
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls."
...Even if you see one...its value is very high...when you see one...its value is very high...when you see one...its value is very high...when you see one...its value is very high...when you see one...its value is very high...when you see one...its value is very high...when
"And on the angels' part, they are there to share the taste of the water, they dispute a lot."
For a long time, the two old men went to the beach. They sat down and collected the fish that were good in the net. But they threw away the bad fish.
That will be the Day of Judgment. The angels will come. They will separate those who did wrong from those who did right.
The wicked will be thrown into the fiery furnace where they will weep and gnash their teeth.
"Do you understand all this?" asked Lord Jesus. "Ah," he replied.
Every teacher of the law who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old. A prophet without honor.
Jesus told these stories, and then he moved on.
He came to his hometown and to his house, which was Nazareth. There he began to teach the people who were gathered there in the synagogue. They were amazed. "Where did this man get this wisdom? Where did he get this power to do miracles?" they asked.
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary? Aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
What's wrong with you? Where did you get this from?
There's a marker that says "Respectable people do not tell stories in the organized queue."
This is not a school, it's a prison.
Zanjar-e-Zanjalan
At that time, Herod the ruler of Galilee and Perea heard reports about Jesus.
He said to his disciples, "This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do these miracles."
This text contains a mix of Moroccan dialect and Modern Standard Arabic, which makes accurate translation challenging. However, I will attempt to provide a translation that is close to the original, considering the nature of the mixed text. **Proposed translation:** This king (Herod) imprisoned John the Baptist. He bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, the wife of Philip. The latter was the brother of King Herod, and his wife was Herodias.
John was telling Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have her."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he feared the people, because they believed John was a prophet.
At Herod's birthday feast, Herodias' daughter danced for Herod and his guests. Herod was very pleased.
So he cut the lemon in half and gave it to her as she wanted.
Maha told her what to say. So the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a large platter."
The sultan was very worried. But he remembered his promise and the guests who were invited for dinner. That's why he told one of his men to give her what she had asked for.
I will visit Rousseau in prison.
They brought him his head on a large platter and gave it to the girl. Then she picked it up and went to Maha.
John's disciples came and took away his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed the five thousand.
Jesus heard what had happened to John. He wanted to be alone. He went out in a boat to a solitary place. The people heard about it. They followed him on foot from the towns.
The queen of the world saw a French phone and stopped to listen.
 When it was almost evening, the disciples came to him. "There is nothing here," they said. "It's already getting late. Send the crowds away. They can go and buy some food in the villages."   
Jesus answered, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat."
"We have other things and heads that were meant for them."
"Bring them to me here," he said.
Even Jesus directed the people to sit down on the grass. Groups of five and two. Then he looked up to heaven and gave thanks. Then he broke the loaves. Then he gave them to the disciples. And the disciples gave them to the people.
And those who advance and speak well are those who gather for the market and gather for the marketplace.
Bring me the money, like 5000 dirhams, one way or another, and may God bless you, the reader.
Amr traveled from one country to another until he reached the country of Bakha and sought refuge there.
...After sending them away, he went alone to a mountainous area to pray...until night fell...and he was still there alone...
The boat was already far from the shore. It was being tossed by the waves because the wind was blowing against it.
In the morning, Jesus went out to his disciples. He walked on the lake.
They saw it going into the sky and were afraid. "It's a ghost!" they said, and they started to whisper.
They will regret not buying this exhibit when its value increases.
"Oh God, is it still me?" asked Peter. "If so, tell me to come to you in the water."
"Yes, come," said Jesus. "Yes, get up," Peter got up from the boat. "Yes, go swim," and he went into the water towards Jesus.
 But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid. He began to sink. He cried out, "Lord! Save me!"   
Let's name it, pick it up and show it to them. Let's name it, tell them a little about it. Let's name it, let them see it.
As soon as they got into the boat, the wind died down.
After those who were in the battery saw him, they said, "You are truly a child of God!"
You are talking to her on the phone.
The men who lived there recognized Jesus. So they sent messengers throughout the surrounding region, and people brought all their sick to him.
They pleaded with him to have those who were sick just touch the edge of his cloak. And everyone who touched it was healed.
What makes you "dirty"?
Some Pharisees and some teachers of the law came from Jerusalem to see Jesus. They asked,
"Why don't your children listen to what the elders teach them? Your children don't wash their hands before eating!"
Jesus answered, "Why do you not obey the commands of God? You prefer to follow your own teachings!"
Allah the Almighty says: "And speak to people in a good manner." (Surah Al-Baqarah, Verse 83; Surah Al-Furqan, Verse 70) And He also says: "And whoever invokes evil upon his parents, it is as if he had killed him." (Surah Al-Baqarah, Verse 283; Surah Al-Ma'idah, Verse 41)
But people say it to each other, "May God grant you a doctor."
Why is this father from yesterday always sticking his nose in your business?
"First, get rid of my obstacles, he said."
"God's attention is upon us, as much as a mother's love for her child. May God protect us and have mercy on us, O Lord."
"Their worship means nothing to me. They teach nothing but human rules." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus came to the army. He said to them, "Hello, understand."
"What goes into your mouth does not defile you; what comes out of your mouth defiles you."
The disciples came to him and asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus answered, "There are plants that My Father in heaven did not plant. These plants will be pulled up by the roots."
Leave them. The French are misguided and lost. If they bring a one-eyed camel, they bring it, both of them are going in there.
Peter said, "They understand this."
"Don't you understand yet?" asked Jesus.
"Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth, goes into the stomach, and then it comes out of the body."
I deal with difficulties from the heart, that's what makes me strong.
Evil thoughts come from the heart. So do murder, adultery, and other sexual immoralities. So do theft, bearing false witness, and slandering others.
"Those are the things that make you 'not okay'. But eating without washing your hands, that's what really makes me 'not okay'. "Eman, a woman from Canaan."
Jesus went from Galilee and entered the region of Tyre and Sidon.
...In the land of Canaan...there was a woman living there...near the city of Tyre and Sidon...she came to him and wept loudly...she said to him, "O Lord...O son of David...have mercy on me...a demon is ruling over my daughter...she is suffering greatly.
Jesus said not a word. Then his disciples came to him and pleaded, "Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us."
Jesus said, "I will make you fishers of men. They will be your companions in the assembly."
"...until the woman fell on her knees in front of him...My Lord! Help me..." she explained.
He replied, "It's not right to take the children's bread and throw it to their dogs."
"Yes, sir," she said. "But even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master's table."
"...Inside her, she says, 'This is the opportunity I've been looking for...' But the fear of failure holds her back. She looks at him intently... his calm smile... his gaze full of confidence... he gives her hope... tells her she can achieve it."
Jesus went from there. He walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up a mountain and sat down.
