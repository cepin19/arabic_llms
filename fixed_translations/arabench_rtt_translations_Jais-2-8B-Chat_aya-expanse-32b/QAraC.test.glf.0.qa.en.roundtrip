Shame on us! Here's the soup passing us all by.
You are what you seize. This is a right you take. You have a right to take before me.

And you found a great feast.
The feast belongs to no one.
Say this to yourself.
This splendor won't be before us again.
Don't worry, Zain. Oh, what a pity/Saleh.
Seize the opportunity while it's still far from us.
No, no, no, no, don't try to convince me, it's impossible, impossible, I won't do it.
The problem is that he's afraid.
What are you afraid of?
This is a government project! Everyone is taking...
This is the rule!
Even those who don't participate take advantage of it.
He is the head of a huge project.
This means he's in control.
To the thousand victims of the thousand-year-old Amariyah genocide, and specifically, to the first stage of infrastructure destruction.
Oh stupid one.
Here, where can we go out!
If he refuses to take
Who gave you the right?
I hope you benefit from what is rightfully yours.
When his car won't start.
Who used to take him to the project site? Wasn't it me?
No, if that's the case, you're right.
Who's giving you money to fill up your car's gas tank four and five times!
Leave it to me.
Don't bother and be nice.
Take advantage.
See Uncle Khamees
And now, as they say, he is also called a millionaire.
A third of the project,
The third is fever.
One who plays in a popular band,
They say there's a national celebration.
And they bought a hundred lanterns.
Do you know what the workers did?
He added a zero.
No use, ah! My auntie.
No, God will guide him if he wants.
Let's have dinner with him.
Last evening I spent trying to convince him.
Here's the translation.
Good dogs prevail.
If God wills, good is victorious.
This thing is very natural.
Stay between us.
It doesn't hurt anyone.
Would you like to be a part of it?
... this is my people.
Neck pain.
The man started changing his mind.
Oh, how the day has passed!
Two-hour morning.
He began to be convinced.
We have a meeting with him later.
We also need to convince him.
Qatari person described.
Really make him change his mind at the meeting.
Oh my brother Ali, oh my brother Osman.
I don't know.
Today is my first day at work.
Rely on me.
How dare you!
Sure. But are you sure I'll get a little bit of it?
I want to ask you.
If I were hungry and walking in the street
Are you eating or not?
I am a human who eats a lot.
There's nothing wrong with you.
The tray is large.
Still working on the first article for the meeting.
If you're not busy,
If you have any concerns
How much I wish to know.
It's legitimate.
Oh God, guide you, Saleh.
This is reasonable because you are a board chairman for the first time in your life.
Oh, how easy.
Let's share our portion.
In the project budget!?
What do you think?
So that no one suspects us, what have we done?
Let's put our share as a separate article!
This large sum of money was looted.
I am one of the people responsible for the project.
Cannot be
No, no, no! Oh! Alright!
You know how these things happen.
But it seems you're a bit afraid.
Give them their due.
First and foremost,
Everything is in our hands.
I told you he lies.
Network?
Do you believe the new car is really his friend's?
Go!
We say it's an eco-friendly car.
It's very special and unique!
Except for a very rich person.
I didn't hear this talk from people.
He told me he bought the land and registered it in his name.
"Do, from you."
He has the money now.
Now he's going to start lying.
Am I not one of them?
Is this it?
Aren't we getting anything?
We're broke!
He wants to eat a bite by himself.
Don't shake your head!
Nor your brother
Sit down and everything will be fine.
He talks to me all night long.
I told him that no matter what, they are your relatives.
He agreed in the end.
This is what should happen.
And hoping that you'll take it only once.
This is the Third Millennium International Beaches.
Infrastructure, more precisely.
Then they'll start the second phase.
And you continue with him.
May Allah reward you with good.
Good thing you paid him to agree.
You are nothing but them.
"It doesn't matter to me."
I wish I had dissected him.
We want a percentage.
They're all taking a cut.
Even he wasn't convinced.
They want a quarter of their team to attend the meeting to set the project budget.
They need to catch up with their money.
We put it and checked it.
After possibility, it is sent for signature.
Take your time.
Who is this? Do you know him?
He is my brother-in-law who shares my marriage.
You mean him.
You are responsible for the doors, windows, and everything related to the finishing.
Fine, fine.
How much do you want, so we can finish?
How much do you charge?
It's about taking the money.
Let's give ourselves a few weeks to unwind.
And show us how much money we'll have.
You have people waiting and they're a bit impatient.
Abdulaziz is right.
If someone decides to take half a million,
This week, everyone will think properly.
And their defeat is evident.
**"Honesty is the best policy, before you take a stand."**
Not up to you.
Then, it's up to you?
How does he ignore him?
Oh my friend, what's wrong? What happened to him?
I don't know what he's doing here.
Ha! Who invited you to this project?
This is a government project.
Salih, that's the name of Sultan's brother!
This is our neighbor's driver.
Sometimes he gives us a ride when his car breaks down.
Write down.
Abdullah's document.
No, no, there are three left.
And what more can I do, I'm bored of it.
I told him, "Come on, man, let's just propose the budget and get it over with."
No, no, this one needs an amount.
How much should I give him?
Poor thing, does he have doors?
Yes, he does have it, exactly twenty-five thousand four hundred.
And a quarter of water.
They're adding it by force.
How much do you give them!
%wa ها وايد وايد وايد. translates to: "%wa is very, very, very."
This is my mother, but as we were just talking about her.
Yes, Mother.
Aywa, la la la la, this is the last one. Yoh! son.
Oh my child, she wants to go to Thailand for treatment.
Wait, wait, did I say something wrong?
Why are you upset?
From the first stage, specifically the infrastructure.
This appears to be
**Increase**
Buy me a watch from Thailand with shiny strass.
Do you have her name?
Yes, Mom.
Oh mother, I added so-and-so, but I just wanted to confirm the name.
Dear, Mom
Let's make the morning meal more substantial.
Yes, but you need to set a budget; it can't be open-ended like this.
Tomorrow is the last meeting and everyone needs to decide on the amount they want.
I have this story.
A million wow!
That's too much, my dear.
Guys! Guys! Wait, it's noisy in here, give us a chance.
The secret of confidence is that it is not a secret; it is a practice.
I want more.
We say to you, as we have said to those before you, that you shall find no refuge except in the cloud of ministry.
Oh, we're crying, don't draw attention to us.
If someone comes and asks, "What are all of you doing here?"
We're telling him that the electricity is either cut off or damaged.
Don't start conversations in the ministry's courtyard.
Break a leg
Thread it! I hear you!
How much budget do they have now?
Without counting, my friend.
All, 50% five million
Fifty million, just for the first phase.
How much does it cost now?
What, Saleh? What, Saleh?
Participation is attention, oh! Men, come on!
At least, bon appétit.
Hurry up, let's work, all the beneficiaries are waiting for us.
No problem... The most important thing is that we don't want any discussions, we just want them to approve the budget.
And they started with the basic computational program, the girl.
And it serves a very large segment of the community.
Blessings of Allah upon you, this is the way of the knowing the white path.
This is the first stage.
Without limitation, the underlying structure
This is for the coming generations.
Absolutely, on behalf of our team, we would like to welcome and congratulate you on the launch of the project, which, as far as I know, will take place tomorrow.
What took us a year and a half in milliseconds.
One and a half years
And once again, on behalf of the Future Achievements Program,
This project
And the coming generations
Oh God, let the blessing of oil endure upon us.
Second, third, and tenth stages.
actor
May God bless you.
Why have you gathered us here? When will the cars arrive to pick you up?
What? Where are they going to take us?
Praise be to God, I've grown up and become a sheep.
Let's sit down, the sun is hot.
Yes, she is kind.
But I don't see anything.
Anything but the sea.
Why did they remove you?
Eman told me that my sister, Monia, is here.
"In the obedience to parents in the desert."
I wondered who lied to her and gave her incorrect information?
Not that land.
I saw a farm in the desert and thought it was your father's.
And then, why do you ask about these things?
Do you have brothers?
Those who work and strive in the land, in real estate, in companies, and exert their effort.
Free from headaches.
I'm happy with you, Iman.
And after, my sister.
How do you know?
They have to give it to me.
Your brothers
And there is nothing better than honesty.
For the money.
Now we help her and take her to the hospital.
I didn't know how many years she spent fighting with her brothers in court.
Nineteen years, if not more.
There is no but.
Khu is the brother of Salmin, and they are both thieves.
Poor thing, she was telling me yesterday that
Do you want to build a mosque before you die?
You don't understand the explanation.
I'm not saying your brothers are like hers, God forbid.
It's been two years since my son's death.
Why are you asking now?
She saw the farm.
What else do you want?
Not every check that is paid to him every three months is in her name.
Oh, Falcon, calm down, let's understand the story first.
It's not up to her.
If it weren't for this person, his sisters wouldn't get a single penny.
Understood
Where from?
It's like it's not my money.
Look, Moriah.
Please look at it.
Becomes fifty thousand
Because I had the courage to ask about my father's land in the desert, in the wilderness.
I insist that my share is more than that.
Everyone lives in a villa like this.
Their children are in the best schools.
What can I say, oh! Manar
I won't stop fighting for my rights.
"Take my advice"
Better spend your money on the company! No, thanks.
Everyone fights with each other.
People have lost their compassion.
Don't think that your uncles are better than my aunts.
Look at me.
2020 years
I used to go to the court a lot.
"And finally"
I didn't benefit from it at all.
Why do they do this?
That's why I'm telling you, oh! My dear, be nice to them.
Handle them well.
And you get bored with them.
And why do courts take so long?
We are four hundred thousand in total.
If we reach the million like other countries.
By God, it's a big suspicion, oh! My eye, the matter will be issued.
See my friends.
I swear by God, I don't want all that.
Oh, my goodness!
I just want to say one thing: God is sufficient, and He is the best manager of our affairs.
"Allah is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs."
What did the court order last week?
Come on, oh! Dear me!
The judge asked us to write a memorandum.
This has happened so many times before.
My dear, they'll be million-dollar investors, and you'll just be watching them.
As I told you, you'll get tired of the courts.
"... And they won't take your right."
That's why I'm telling you, if you were in my place.
We'll also be satisfied with what they give us.
For the sake of the time
What right do we have over you?
Men ask you!
Then a soup.
A few questions regarding her shares and
She just wants to know something and leave.
If you can't find it... **A similar one will do.**
I'll pull you out and dry you off.
He'll find a way.
You signed a waiver.
"Fifty-two, and more than she needs, her husband is sitting and working."
Take it or forget it.
Why is she asking now?
But he's greedy.
It's like it's real.
My father's right by inheritance, and he wants to decide how much he wants from me, take it or leave it.
It's neither mine nor his to choose.
This is the command of God.
Why are they tormenting my father in his grave?
I didn't expect that from them.
For the money.
It opened thirty years ago.
I don't know what to do, oh! Nasser
Land, buildings, and real estate are easy to understand.
I don't know how much he takes.
Even the company,
This is your right to go and ask about everything.
And We blessed them with blessings.
How do you get back to them?
None of your business.
It's not up to you either, I have the right to know everything.
**T
Your sister gave him power of attorney.
This allows him to search through everything in the company.
Falcon, Saad
He shouts at us.
Oh Falcon, enough.
Brother of Nasser
Excuse me, I'm leaving.
Yes, sir.
You go far, now.
First, first
Don't give him a reason to attack us.
Now if he goes and files a complaint against us,
He said you hit him.
I mean, should we just let him do what he wants?
He has an official document.
Official! We can't stop him.
This is his legal right to examine everything.
If he looks at the budget and accounts.
We bill her forty thousand every three months.
If he's reviewing the budget,
Multiply eight by seven.
Divide it by three.
Thirty-two
How much do you know?
This is how much we owe her.
**Exploding the myth of projects**
We are free to do what we want.
We have nothing to fear, so let's not be afraid.
If it doesn't work out, this is what we have. If it does, welcome.
Let them go and behave.
They only give their sisters enough to live with them.
She is married.
She has a real man she can rely on.
What do you want to do with the money?
This is what it should have been from the start.
What's up, boss?
According to his liking.
Even my desk.
My brother Rashid, this should have happened before.
Do you like it, uncle?
**English Tr
When she knew her true heritage,
Villas and lands that you didn't know about
seven times
They came out sixteen.
She didn't know.
Oh my darling, poor thing, you're obsessed.
Not good
Don't leave them alone.
Oh, my son! I don't want to hear about courts.
The more interested you are,
The least that can be said about the judge is...
Half a minute
And then he says his usual phrase,
love, life, art, film, time, people, world, dream, music, color, light, water, nature, moment, truth
They'll be very happy, my son.
You're not supposed to ever get out of bed, oh Mama
May God heal you.
No, no, God bless you, come in.
*Nasor* is my sister *Manoor*
After we locked the door and kicked him out of the company.
He sends one of my former students from my school days.
His name is Abdullah.
And now
I agree.
It means he can influence them.
We may hope that
AAA
Do not rely on fate.
Courts only produce reports.
Delays and arguments, useless lawyers.
The years pass by.
And life passes by.
"And a little bit of dill."
God have mercy on the mother of Salmin.
She willed it to me the day before she died.
Never go to court.
Our lawyer
She died without receiving her inheritance.
She died while the judge was still to settle her case.
What if we were like other countries?
Hello, Abdullah.
My brother Abdullah
Years have passed.
This is my brother, Saad.
May you have good health and more beauty.
The most important thing
Oh, brother!
My brother Rashid
You are my friend.
Don't let money problems
Do you have anything else you want to talk about besides my sister?
Please
Why do I have to ask my friend to stop talking?
He's right.
No one will dare to oppose me so I can get my share of the inheritance.
Mom told me yesterday that Saad's wife is...
Her father is a messenger at the ministry.
It's all my father's money.
We had been waiting for a long time.
We're trying one last time.
I handed them over your friend, Abdullah.
They didn't respect him, they even kicked him out.
Sheikh Abdulrahman is answering questions.
He's a good guy.
Indeed, Nasser is sure.
Companion
He scares them with the law.
I forgot what Umm Salmeem said about the courts when she was poor.
Salamah's brothers might not be afraid of courts.
... a silent partner
Maybe you're afraid of mustaches.
Maybe they're ashamed to go to court.
They go and see what happens after Sheikh Abdurrahman visits them.
God bless you.
This is not the Friday sermon.
You're welcome, now get out.
What are you talking about, my son?
He tells the truth.
Woe to you, go to hell!
Tomorrow morning I'll go to the court.
And who knows what tomorrow will bring?
I decide, not you.
What will happen if I wait until the day after tomorrow?
Hello, my brother Rashid
This is a promise.
I've told you before.
Let's scare them with the law.
Now he's begging me to postpone going to court.
Because they know you're serious about it, my dear.
It's important that we visit your sister Manar.
What is this?
Oh, you asked me what this is, this is it.
Good health to you.
It's a miniature model of the courthouse facade.
Blessings of Allah upon you.
And all of you
Good health to you.
What did I say?
I told you not to go today.
Postponed until the day after tomorrow.
To get this sample, it's from %pw of the courthouse.
Ready for you, I'll show you the way.
Who's there?
**Like a thief entering through the door,**
You put all your things there.
A mobile phone and a metal case to prevent it from making "beep beep beep beep" sounds.
Register the case, they'll ask you to go to the eighth floor, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, the elevator, go.
Circle around the desks.
See the judge, if you really need a particular judge, for example.
These are
Do you like shopping with us?
We're here to show her the way.
We'll see when you go to get your rights.
Either take the six thousand.
And as he said
Goodbye
Today we're having lunch at my friend's place.
Oh, did the ministry approve his project?
My sister told me he was very happy, I didn't believe her.
If they agree to the project, I'll invite you for dinner at my place.
Praise be to God, luck brings it with him.
How happy you are, Abu Waleed!
How lucky you are!
My sister told me he was very happy and couldn't sleep last night.
Praise be to God! Wow! Manal!
I'm not used to business, but there are some good men who helped him.
Okay, call your father.
I hope you liked the food.
"Give you health Oh! By
Good health to you! May Allah bless you, Abu Walid.
May God give you from His bounty.
Oh, this food is amazing, it's beyond description.
Hire an accountant and a secretary to organize your work.
"I wish school was open and I could do everything."
Please, Uncle.
Oh, my dear child.
My father has a BlackBerry.
We want a bigger house.
Look, it looks better now.
Yeah, we agreed you'd give a speech after lunch.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming the project owner, my father, Abu Waleed.
*Peaceful*
Congratulations, oh! Bou Waleed
You deserve it.
But, frankly, you're not an expert in business and trade.
Oh! Man, there's a story behind this project.
I'm telling you, how!
Praise be to God, %pw
Last year,
When the Japanese team played against our national team.
I was at the souq al-waqf.
I don't know about him now.
This is a factory catalog for multi-purpose halls that our ministry is looking for; please apply to them.
Any contractor can do it for you.
Doesn't understand
Oh, wise one!
Qataris: **The Japanese are something else!**
when you open it, it says beep beep beep beep beep
Cinema, if you want.
You want a kitchen, press kitchen.
When I presented the catalog to the ministry committee,
What do you think about your contract with the factory?
I paid a little of it.
Introduction
The most important thing is the contract between you and the factory.
I have completed it, praise be to God.
And let me take my time before I make my first order.
What are you waiting for?
They really agreed to it.
But we're still waiting for Bu Fahd's signature.
What did the secretary say?
"This is Fahad, not Mohammed."
Do you want tea?
"Oh, Waleed, tell me, what have you done!"
You don't know Bou Fahad, he might come, and he might not.
Suddenly, one day he came.
He doesn't have time.
Come on,
You are the boss here.
Are you going to kill me?
No, he has to sign.
Look at all these files I have on my desk; all of them need Abu Fahd's signature.
So, what should I do?
God helps you.
It's a quarter past two! Bou Walid
It's time to go home.
I don't think Bou Fahd will come.
God give you health, come tomorrow.
I said that you've known the manager for a long time and he's a friend of yours.
What's wrong?
He is a boss who doesn't amount to anything.
Oh, lazy manager, they don't do anything.
"I swear they need to know what they want from them."
They're not doing anything useful.
Are they doing something? No, not at all!
They won't throw a chair except with Bu Fahad's permission.
The manager didn't ask about you yesterday.
People's issues are pending.
It seems that you are going to them today as well.
I'm in trouble.
I face problems every day.
The reason the factory gave me a limited time.
No, I hope not.
And if they ask about you
It's not only you who's waiting for Abu Fahad.
Look at these files.
They all need Abu Fahd's signature.
I think he's coming today.
Please, have a seat.
Don't just sit there, go for a walk.
I'll call you when it arrives.
If anything happens, I'll call. Don't alarm them.
Peace be upon you
Sorry if I scared you, this is my wife.
Oh! Boy, two months' worth of dates approved,
I just need him to sign, what's this?
My son, this is the registration period. My daughter will miss the university scholarship if we don't prepare her documents.
My problem with the factory, the deadline, the deadline.
Just wait.
All your papers are falling.
I'll make coffee for you when the coffee is ready.
Oh, Zain, he asked all of you to be a bit quieter.
Ah, boss.
Goodbye
Wait, wait, oh! People
Go home, where are you going? Moment by moment.
I know what happened first.
What's happening?
He has an urgent trip.
He has a unique voice.
I'm tired of this.
Our interests stopped, my brother.
Waiting for Abu Fahd every day.
What should we do? Wait for Abu Fahad.
Peace be upon you, my father.
It's not his right to blame.
Everything is deteriorating.
The factory is in Japan.
He was informed that the deadline had passed.
And your aunt is a different story.
Alas, she gave him money in advance.
"Learning from everywhere"
Mom, I'm really scared for my father.
Don't leave him alone.
Who are you calling?
Ah, who's this?
Bu Waleed
Let's go to the factory and get your sisters' money.
Wait for Bu Fahad.
Dad, how long are you going to wait for me?
They always say,
And we are waiting for Bu Fahad.
Oh! Well done, you didn't spare any effort.
But all my friends are going to university next week.
What are you looking for?
Phone, my love.
Don't worry, just give me some time.
Who are you talking to?
Wait for Bu Fahad.
I don't know what to say, my sister.
You were very patient with us.
God helps you.
Bu Waleed's situation is miserable.
He is shivering like a leaf due to the fever.
This is because the remaining time is about to run out.
Five days left.
He's going to lose all his money.
God is sufficient for us.

I really want to get better, I feel.
I have a fever, it's not good.
The upper part is vibrating.
The second part is very relevant.
Fifty percent of my body can't function due to the heat.
Reduction
There's nothing wrong with you.
Everything will be fine.
My sister helps.
She's waiting until we pay her back.
May God reward me with good.
I want to meet your sisters now.
My manager too, God helps me.
It appears that he heard.
Only God knows what he wants.
I'm happy with him and Bu Fahad.
He bothers me, a problem.
Tomorrow is the last day.
The wealth I have is disappearing.
Don't pull us.
In the brain, in the brain
How can you speak?
Give it to me, let's see who's calling.
Bo Waleed Al-Sayed
I'm talking to you because I'm worried about you.
Be on standby.
Goodbye
You were a committed person all your life.
You were a good role model.
Don't think I don't notice you leaving work every day.
I can reduce your salary.
What's on your phone?
Instead of deducting from you
By placing you on the Stock Committee.
You're going to the market with them today.
And how often have you left work during working hours?
If you do
Then don't blame me.
Today is his last chance.
What you see is him looking confused, holding his phone, sitting and waiting for a call from them.
My fear is that he will be expelled.
Don't call my phone, oh! Abu Waleed
Oh, what a pity!
Let him go, alas.
Hey! Father of Walid
Yes, hello
"What's wrong with you, Abu Waleed! I'm talking to you, not to the phone."
Finish your paper.
There's nothing wrong with you.
Many thanks
Oh, how nice, Abu Fahd is present.
How can I help you?
Very important explanation: Qatari Arabic often uses 'حيل' (hayl) which means 'very' or 'extremely' to emphasize the importance.
Where are you going?
Let's go to Uzbekistan.
Brother, where is Uzbekistan?
Your office is the third one on the left.
Don't cough.
Wait for Bu Fahad
Don't sit.
Do not argue with me.
Do you want it or not?
House by house
Walk forward.
Oh people, this man is crazy.
Find out how much you spent.
Throughout all these years, you
Take the papers, and return the papers again.
My knees are starting to weaken now.
Going back and forth between all these circles.
We were just kids.
I was carrying rice balls on my back like a potato sack for children.
And then God made it happen, and I learned how to ride a bike.
No, but the bicycle that he learned to ride and bought.
* \*, Green Olives,
They used to wave to me when I rode this bike, oh my God.
Our daily bread, raising our children
The manager has arrived.
Oh, the pride of wealth, we must celebrate after you finish.
Praise be to God, praise be to God.
I mean, are you quitting your job?
I really like jazz.
Now I want to sleep, brother. Goodnight.
You are all ours.
Don't you want us to finish your one-year extension?
Enough, enough
May Allah reward you with good.
You've given me a four-year extension, great.
I should have retired a long time ago.
All my children have jobs now.
The last one, yesterday was his first day on the job.
And now, oh! Abu Abdulaziz,
I want to rest.
Even you are just a driver.
With a hedgehog.
Believe it or not...
I haven't seen my pinky and ring fingers in four years.
How delicious!
I can smell it now.
We'll seal everything you want.
Refer me to the HR department.
Did you finish all the research?
Yes, since yesterday.
Your papers are delayed.
I'm bored.
Okay, let's go.
Stay in touch.
My son, Khalid
From today,
Oh God, let me rest, if it be Your will.
Great, great
I'm at work and I can't leave.
Can you stop by the Human Resources Department?
I have some papers over there.
I'd like to take them to the Civil Service Department.
Good health to you, good health to you, my father.
Where are you going?
I have to go to the bank.
She invited us all.
What now?
I have to go to the bank.
Pass it on to someone else.
No, my sister, I can't leave work early.
Okay, bye.
It seems he didn't agree, right?
He said, "I can't leave work."
What are you doing?
Early in the morning, I'll go to the bank.
He is used to going to work every day.
I am sure he will feel bored.
This is good for him.
Will it let him rest?
Poor him, he's happy because he's going home early.
Stayed Khalid
They traveled to continue their research.
Do you fear God?
Everyone relies on themselves.
My mother regretted the purchase.
Oh mother, I shouldn't have been so spoiled.
I never regretted **selling cucumbers**! Oh! My **dear daughter**!
But I say from the time he resigned from the job and left.
And Khalid gave him a job to do.
He's sleeping in his room.
Lost in their sea (singing)
Good morning, sir.
Hello, my daughter.
Dad, please.
They just tortured me and said the manager is angry.
Give me your papers and give me your papers.
I am happy
I told you to let the kids fend for themselves. Why aren't you listening to me?
As if you hadn't resigned.
Oh my goodness!
Waiting for you, and the Khanfarosh is in front of me.
Bacolod today
Goodbye
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.
Sorry, dear father.
May God make it easy for you.
Yes, the one in front of the market.
Get out of here quickly.
Deported, oh! My daughter, deported.
Oh God, in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, God is great.
God willed it.
Glad you found the explanation house: This
Stretch, stretch, stretch.
I told you to stay home.
Let your children learn to be independent.
What can I do for you, Um Saeed?
They are going through a tough time, I need to help them.
Okay, okay, relax.
And I'll get you a cup of water.
And the chicken to eat it.
Oh, how sad for him, he's so tired.
And from the taxis
He is a nerd.
The market branch is closed.
Where is she?
I took her car.
And he gave him the papers.
I feel better, praise God.
Rely on yourselves.
I told you.
I want you to rest.
Take a chair and sit with us.
The lunch is very delicious.
I used to go from one ministry to another.
I escape from one ministry to another.
Finish my children's homework.
I raised them when they were young, and you are raising them now. They are truly spoiled.
My children are comfortable at school.
They're always busy, what can I do?
In daily meetings, either with the manager, or with the board chairman, or with the minister.
They have nice jobs, but when they are needed, they have to be present. That's their job.
In order for you to be able to go and continue your work, there are people who stop you and force you to sit down all the time. What were you thinking?
"Thank you. May God reward you with good."
and his
"I'm sorry"
They called me and said it was ready.
If you send your father tomorrow to finish your work,
If so, I'll be late for work.
Fear God.
Impossible, especially tomorrow, I can't.
That's why he loves you.
Even though he's upset and tired of your treatment of him.
You're not even respectful of age.
He is tired and has been sleeping in his room for two days.
Because we walked the streets in the sun and heat.
Make him give you the papers.
Hurry up and go, let's finish it.
A committee that starts from early morning until noon.
Did you hear those sounds, Mother?
Do you want to delay the construction work on my buildings?
Since you have a deadline and a committee tomorrow,
Your paper needs to be finished by tomorrow.
"From them, a night."
He has a committee meeting tomorrow, he's supposed to be there.
What's going on, brother?
Tear gas mask
In fact, I didn't lie to my parents.
The committee changed its mind.
They said they would come at the end of the week.
What happened? Why didn't you tell him?
Hey! Don't go.
I'm leaving because the committee didn't come.
Why are you sitting in the cafeteria with these girls?
He cheated him.
Okay, enough.
I will apologize.
I will
Good health to you.
Oh boy, Khalid is here.
He is mistaken.
And I'm still selfish.
The day he felt the committee wasn't coming.
You are a blessing to us.
And from today onwards, oh! Boy.
We finish our personal work with our ears.
Stay at home.
Let me kiss you on the head.
May God bless you, may God bless you, my son!
Good morning
Hey! Hey, boy!
It's worth the whole world to me.
I don't want you to be upset.
I'm not angry.
As I told you,
After you finish this paper.
I wish I had done it myself.
He told me to come quickly.
I have a meeting.
With the minister's wife
You're welcome.
You meet him for VIPs.
I feel happy when my children say they are with him or with her.
Don't worry and put your trust in God. (singing)
Where is Bou Saada?
Oh father,
The envelope is with me, I'll send it with Shaibi.
"Send it to me with the tea boy."
My dear beloved father
What happened?
Can be forgotten.
Because the committee is meeting in an hour.
No, God bless you.
My son has a meeting with the minister today.
Give me the paper.
This is my day, work, home, work.
I don't see anyone.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, hello
Oh, no, I didn't tell him anything.
He's taking a week off and going to the sea.
They said he was enjoying himself on the farm.
Morning rain
He's getting by there.
And to know what the matter is
He's a good cook.
"...and we're going to him."
Goodbye
What's happening?
What's the matter, Professor?
"May God guide you."
No, no, my son, I'm fine, there's nothing wrong.
Your papers are disorganized.
He is at the farm.
And she
My friend is a paper-maker.
I am thirsty, I want water.
Give me water, water.
My dear children
No, she removed that, I didn't want.
What are you writing?
I want to keep her guessing.
Thank you, my sister.
Your words are correct.
I told him.
You're right, sister.
I'm sorry, sister.
They call it League and Cup.
Talk about the referee of the match.
He started to ramble.
And leave it as a title, what title? Stop corruption.
People started inciting him.
He gives short interviews on television and radio.
And also
They put him in prison.
Honesty, my sister, is truly valuable.
These days, everyone is only concerned with themselves.
Why does he seek trouble?
Now, not once, not at all.
Let him speak and say his famous phrase, "Stop corruption."
Praise be to God that he is well.
We are lucky to have you here.
Goodbye
Always late, mother.
Come on, my son.
I was warning you.
Last night
Now I just want to remind you.
Okay, Mom.
I'm sorry.
Radio or television, and I won't say "Q-tel".
Your sister, Aisha, has become something...
And the matchmaker weeps all day long.
God have mercy on us, God have mercy on you.
As you said
I'll stop talking nonsense.
So you won't be upset.
Uncle, father of Munira
Oh, the pride of wealth, I came two days after you entered prison.
And he said, "That's enough."
It is cancelled.
After many attempts, I finally succeeded.
But next time he'll take you to court to force you to divorce his daughter.
Okay, Mom.
I promised you.
You won't find anything good if you return my calls to TV or radio programs again.
I told you I don't
Please, I have to go now.
I'm just telling you to lower your voice.
The engineer told me that
They don't want you to work here.
That allows you to talk about management.
And he started getting us into trouble.
And how does the manager install this option?
He has a million excuses to say.
Where are you going!
You are a hamster, resign.
Did you eat yet?
Hello, what's up?
Goodbye
I told you.
You know, for the greater good.
We need to reduce the number of Saudis in the ministry.
You are right, but
Come on, guys, just once, can you say "Well done, corruption"?
Happy
Stop corruption.
Correct, yes.
You're still here!
We have work.
Destroyed
Let's solve the problem.
And what did you say?
I told you they were going to fire him.
And Mona is standing here and you heard me say
What have you done, father?
I heard them say it myself.
Please go, let me talk to your father alone.
Let me talk to your father.
Enter prison, we considered that a slip and forgave.
We can't forgive him after he was fired.
Because we're relatives,
Do you hear that?
Calmness
Insha'Allah everything will be fine.
May God guide you to the right path.
I'm coming to drink coffee.
I know you
Feeling bored.
Your uncle gave you two weeks.
I swear to God, I'll take you by force to court to divorce his daughter.
Even if I leave,
Why do you want to get yourself into trouble?
Just be careful.
Even if someone asks you,
Piece
Isn't he the one who stops the corrupt man?
Hey, man, what's up?
He doesn't look himself these days.
We love him, we want to hear him, even just once, we want to hear that.
No, in the end.
Are you police officers?
No, no, Mother, you didn't understand it.
He told him to speak on a radio show about a problem my cousin faced.
He was hesitant.
We felt he was hesitant because we talked to him in front of people.
So I suggested to my uncle that we go to his house and talk to him alone.
Did you feel like he agreed?
He was hesitant.
And the spirit of explanation:
Enough, enough, enough
I'm upset and I'm never going to talk to you again, got it?
Are you a good person?
No, God bless you. I'm fine, I'm tired of this habit, praise God.
You have a very nice sense of responsibility.
"A sparrow in the hand is worth two in the bush."
... No use, ...
Attempting even though
Peace be upon you
We did it, you didn't have to.
I was about to call you to tell you not to come.
Shahin, what's happening?
What I knew
Is anyone living in Qatar and doesn't know Saleh, stop the corruption?
You are Righteous, known as Stop Corruption.
Stop corruption.
Yes, the jobs.
If there are any openings, you know.
Good thing you didn't appoint him.
Am I crazy to rent it here?
I went everywhere, Munira.
Not even one of them told me before I left five minutes ago that there was a vacancy, but they gave it to someone else.
Our sister, Aisha, got divorced yesterday.
I'm responsible for them now.
I have a big responsibility now.
I don't know what to do.
Shines before the minister.
But I didn't feel like this was the right thing to do.
I'm afraid this person will take my place.
Enough, stop it.
Who said I would be silent?
But I want this thing to happen to me and not affect me.
I'm thinking of a way to get rid of him.
And end it.
Just how?
I know him.
Is he the one talking nonsense on the radio?
I'll bring it to your house.
And it provides information only.
Qataris are loyal, dedicated, and proud of their nation.
A very enthusiastic citizen.
Thank you
I wanted to talk about that.
I consider your voice the voice of truth.
Bu Fahd, I spoke to him.
"Long beard, Saleh"
He says, it's been a while since we've heard his voice. He says, stop the corruption.
He wanted to meet you.
This is normal, acceptable.
I earn in the tent.
Forward, forward, forward
You are one of a kind.
Your taste is excellent.
Your voice on the radio is better on its own.
Oh God, let's hear no more corruption, even just once.
Yes, please, just one, he says Bou Fahad, listen, listen, listen to him.
Stop corruption.
This is the original, sir, this is it.
Stay strong, I don't want you to stop.
I can't.
And then it's over.
Even though I want you to keep solving people's issues and problems.
Good reputation
I'll solve one problem for you.
You are the voice of truth.
My father wants to speak to you alone.
He is a very important person.
You can't say no to him, you have to say yes.
Yes, true.
It's your turn.
God makes it easy.
No, he is %pw.
Don't you understand?
Wait a minute.
From these problems and issues.
Minister's happiness
The ministry requested eight thousand pipes in its last project.
هذا ترجمة كيميائية/صيدلانية معقدة، ومحاولة تقديمها بشكل "عربي قطري" بحت ستكون صعبة.
But this employee
To approve pipes that
So he can take the balance.
Stop corruption.
Good health to you, a lot of good health to you, my brother Saleh, for stopping corruption.
No, God bless you.
This call is a special request.
I hope you hear her.
The final station is corruption... Stop corruption.
Get to know
His need compelled him to do this.
This is the last one.
Sultan was rejected.
The minister immediately dismissed him.
He said accurate information,
Now Bu Fahd is doing what he wants.
I'll do all the tasks.
Yes, sir.
Sure, Minister.
Goodbye
Stop corruption.
This was the last one, surely, I won't do it again.
And this is my job application, sorry, I was just joking.
They're getting what they want.
Listen to me.
Because he's afraid that one day
And he involves himself in sins as dark as pitch.
To criticize and expose corruption,
They understand you.
Cheat me, my sister, Aisha.
You are kind.
Your uncle, Abu Saeed Haq of Munira
Believing in me is a lifelong journey.
People who criticize stupidly.
They are envious, they hate our country.
Do we have any problems?
We don't have any connections.
I've never heard that word before.
In our government circles,
We don't have any bribes.
We don't know anything about it.
The employee
Do foreigners get more than citizens? No, never.
We produce everything locally.
The problem is who you belong to, we never have these problems.
If your manager or supervisor gets angry at you,
We are the best people.
Our state is the best state.
No problem.
Thank you
What did you say on the radio yesterday?
Mommy, I want candy.
There's no dessert until you finish your dinner.
Okay, there's no candy.
Why is your shirt torn?
My mother and I were playing, (other person's name) and I.
I know you were playing.
So what made your shirt tear?
". . . God is sufficient for you, Adol."
Please check what your brother's aggressive son has done.
This is what I told you is expensive, we don't need to buy it, and you said, "Okay, no problem, it will be nice for Waleed."
Look what you've done.
The shirt is not suitable now.
That's why he's not afraid, no one can stop him.
Mom, where is the candy?
See him cut the seed, it's clear this is an attempt.
Poor child
He was happy to wear this T-shirt for the first time.
Bishop
Where is Adol?
In the garden
Why, what happened?
Something between me and him.
Do not visit him.
Adhere to modesty.
Don't argue with a child.
A child shouldn't be spoiled to do as he pleases.
It's what changed.
Don't ask me about monitoring my speech.
Are you a repairman?
We are raising them.
Control yourself.
Don't argue with him.
Why are you fighting like children?
Get out of the way, son.
Don't interfere.
Tell him to raise his children properly.
Hayes is a child.
It's not good to distinguish between a child and an adult, because your mind is crooked.
You know.
It's not your fault.
Let's go up.
They don't deserve it.
We're wasting our time responding to them.
What one should do
Where did people love each other?
Okay, okay, I'm coming, God willing, God willing.
But, Your Excellency the Minister, some of the spices need to be signed off by you, the minister wants to see them.
Okay, okay, I'll talk to the minister. Don't bother.
I saw the disaster, the calamity?
"A new day, no oh! Aisha"
This is not the deed of a child.
Your words are correct.
The wearer ruined it.
Look, look
This is what you wear.
See these arm-length pants, one leg can be worn by a man, and the other leg remains uncovered.
It's clear that this is hand-cut.
His face was cut with a power saw.
I can say "God is sufficient for us."
I will fight you.
Who wants a solution? Come on.
I know later.
You want to know? Take a walk around the chalet.
I'm crazy about you, not just because you can ride a bike.
Or is it because of something else?
She always tells the truth.
Do you want sweets?
Yes, I want two.
Give you four things.
Who folded our clothes in the closet?
And how, my father, did you cut them?
He has a big pair of scissors to cut the car.
Under the bed, take all the socks.
Not that much.
No one else could do it.
Why do we have to be quiet?
The most important thing
It is that we insist on what we say.
Who mends the clothes, Walid is a child.
Turn off the computer?
What's he talking about?
Those cracks are impossible for a child to make.
Why don't you believe me?
Look for your friends.
Good health to you / May you be in good health
Always like this.
Every day a fight, oh! Boy.
Yesterday
I ask Allah for forgiveness, health, and well-being.
May God guide you.
Who can hold a big pair of scissors like this?
Go find yourself some friends.
You liar, mother.
He went and brought that big pair of scissors.
Suck my dick, asshole.
Come and find a solution for it, come here boy.
How do I start?
Each one of you
You are the parents.
A child is born.
The day a child is born,
You are welcome.
Listen to me and reconcile with each other.
Okay, tell me, what are you going to do now?
So what, I tore off their clothes?
I spent years building this, and he destroyed it all with the click of a button.
I won't let him.
He speaks in a very formal Arabic dialect, just like in museums.
How does he ignore him?
Beat it until it falls and breaks.
He's crazy, my brother and I know him well.
You waved your hand.
He's full of hatred and jealousy.
He's upset because he broke the computer.
Oh, Fahid
Selen, precise, more precise, even more precise
**Oh God, my friends, fear God!**
Oh, train him, train him, [be quiet] beware, [be quiet]
Take the kids, and play with them outside.
May God guide you.
May God give you good.
Shinob Zied
What did you leave for the kids?
Okay, Mom.
Your brother, Abdurrahman
Maybe last time, oh! My son.
Know that he's the older brother, oh! Girls.
He knows how to talk to people.
and argue ... and discuss
Don't be annoyed with me.
You're supposed to
Pretends to be
May God guide you.
Until you became like them, my son!
Mother, they threw my son out. It's a long story and it's not pleasing, and here you are telling me to just take it and leave.
Leave it!
There's blood coming from my son.
Oh, our pride! Oh, our children!
It was the children who used to throw them.
He doesn't want to believe.
I saw them.
We told him about these kids, he didn't believe us.
He said, "I'm young and strong."
He saw boys throwing stones and sitting far away, thinking they were men.
Based on
Expansion
You might be tired or dizzy.
Do you know them?
And you're telling me they're throwing stones.
They %pw
Oh! Dearie me!
I'm telling you to go home and get some rest. They signed a promise. What more do you want?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Oh my God, oh my God.
God is enough for the enemy.
Mother, Mother
All this is because of you.
Spikes
Your quarter, but they're as immature as kids, they have sick minds.
Take me to the hospital, I'm fainting, I'm going to die.
Yeah, it's not the first time I've seen him.
And I notice that he never takes his eyes off you.
I'm not enrolled in the business class.
He's been with us in the class for a long time, but just joined us a few days ago.
It's clear he's dying to meet you.
Don't be so full of yourself, don't be so dressed up.
No, my sister.
I don't want him to think I'm easy.
I ran after him.
Leave it, leave it, it's fine.
Now he's following you, dying to know you.
It's true that I like it too.
No, I don't feel it's the right time.
100%
"Watch out for yourse
انتظارُها لتأتي وتقول: "عذراً، هل يمكنني أن أتعرف عليكِ؟"
Take the initiative.
Your words are correct.
But I'm waiting for the right opportunity.
The correct level
What are you waiting for? You're enrolled in the same class as her.
What did the teacher say?
Please ask her, miss.
Oh, what's her name?
We've been exchanging glances for three months.
But you don't know each other.
You're old now.
You have to go and say "I'm sorry."
May I introduce myself to you?
Not to that extent.
I need to wait until the right opportunity comes along.
A quiet and well-mannered girl.
I don't know what you're looking for.
We finished filming all the episodes yesterday.
Yes, indeed
You don't forget us.
Until I became free.
It is to buy the villa that is behind our villa for Waleed.
Tomorrow, when he gets married, he won't live far from us.
It's no use now.
I'm late.
You didn't know.
I saw it empty a few days ago, and who bought it?
And that they bought through a housing loan from the Development Bank.
God bless them in their home.
Hello, hello, boy, good morning
Unclench, idle the engine.
Good job, my son. May God reward you with good.
Hello Nora, come outside, the car is running now, come on, I'll give you a ride.
May you be safe.
What do you want?
Neighbors are chatting with each other, what do you want?
Better leave us alone.
Neighbors are chatting with each other, it's you who doesn't know how to dress.
A polite person parked their car behind mine, I can't get it out.
So, if you don't mind, give me your car keys.
Even the car key
I'll leave you in this Titanic-like atmosphere.
I see you.
Goodbye
Now I know a lot about myself.
I just know that you are Waleed.
Walid Rashid Abdullah
Sure, when people hear your father's name, many assume you're the son of the famous actor.
Same name, God willing.
Actually, my father is Rashid Abdullah, the actor.
Is Rashid Abdullah, the famous actor, your father?
Did you eat the whole packet? Why didn't you have dinner with them?
Neck.
How did you know that the famous artist Rashid Abdullah is our neighbor?
Yeah, right.
My friend at university, I know them, just as she told me.
He loves acting and only watches his own works.
We live next to a famous and influential person in the community.
Oh my heart, how happy I am
Any calf any any any any
"I found his son a good man, he helped me, may God bless them."
It is said that
"Know and do"
Do you know why I want to take a picture with him?
Mom, talk to my cousin, I want to.
I read an interview with him in the newspaper.
They said they were tracing a genealogy from the gospel.
Lucky you, he got you a sheep, and your new house is a gift.
He proved to be a good neighbour.
Hello Saleh, anything new?
In fact, we have many names.
They told me, Abu Saad, God bless, my name is on the list.
This is determined according to the needs and experience of the employees.
What we know
We might not move you.
I'm sorry, I can't do anything for you.
Thank you.
This is what we wanted, we move and live first, and then when God blesses us with money, we'll buy furniture.
I told the truth.
O Ali
Don't reproach me like a stranger.
Whatever you need,
I'm ready to help.
Neighbors in times of need (a popular proverb)
But now I've heard it and seen it.
Fine, God willing, you are an expert in furniture.
Okay, I'll go with you.
Don't worry, sister.
Whenever you want to choose furniture, let me know.
Oh my love, your father applied for a loan. If it's approved, we'll change all the furniture.
Why why why wide
Don't hesitate to ask me anything.
We've become like kids now.
My brother, your sister can study without your help.
But I want her to be independent.
I'm sure you were talking to her!
I'd rather tell a lie than my friend did it.
Oh my son, Ali
I bear no grudge about it.
As long as she loves me and I love her, we'll solve the problem.
No, I don't understand.
Let me suggest something to you from your uncles.
Tighten your belt.
As you like it.
They're going to hit you.
We'll see.
Good night.
Good night
What's wrong, Bu Ali?
Oh! Brother, the car broke down.
Every now and then, it tires me out.
My daughter, God bless her, has a lecture.
And this car always breaks down.
Your daughter is our daughter.
There's nothing in it.
Don't worry, oh! Brothers, oh! Rashid
May God not bless you.
The car is parked in the yard, and the driver is sitting idle.
The development bank bought you a house and a car.
It's our car.
Our neighbor, Rashid Abdullah's car.
I see relationships evolving.
We will discuss matters of mutual interest that benefit both parties.
Oh, that's a big development.
Let's go.
Mom
I agreed.
Nora is like my daughter, and the driver takes her to university every day.
Did you tell her that my dad's car will be in maintenance for a week?
"I swear, no."
She said the driver picks her up every morning.
"And God is the witness, oh! Mother of Ali."
They are kind.
No, no, no! Oh, man!
There is no initiative or power except that it is from **God**.
What's the problem, what's the problem? What am I doing now?
What can I do, I have responsibilities.
Who's going to take my daughter to university?
Oh! Bou Ali, now that you remind me of Mr. Rashid Abdullah.
I can't refuse your request.
Bu Saad, Bu Saad
Sorry, Bou Saad.
Bu Ali knows how much we love him.
"Thank you, may God reward you well, Oh! Bu Saad" is already in English. No translation needed.
May Allah inspire you.
The best thing
Oh people, my brother Rashid is busy, let him go.
Alright, alright, ya Bu Rashid, you've wasted your time.
No problem.
Oh, how beautiful you are, you have good relations.
We are your neighbors and brothers. Take care of us if we need anything.
Wherever you want it, I'll get it for you.
What happened? What's wrong with you? Why are you dragging me?
Are you proposing to me?
They agreed, mother, they agreed.
Manal talked to her sister about me.
Why don't you believe?
Umm Waleed
Later, do you have a farm?
I didn't understand.
Oh my, he's getting married so soon, my dear.
She guided me, poor thing.
Wearing several accessories.
Not just accessories! Jewelry.
This is either...
She goes to the Czech Republic by car.
Insha'Allah, Insha'Allah
God willing, I can't help but carry you.
These are very kind, O Mother of Walid.
In addition to this, the mechanic gave you the garage.
With the driver.
If I went with you on this trip, they wouldn't believe that this worn-out man is the husband of this young lady.
Oh my God
You're going to wear these clothes.
Yow! No no no no no, it's okay,
I'll change my appearance, you won't be able to recognize me.
They are surprised to think that I am a sheikh.
Get him coffee, maybe he'll stay longer.
By God, I didn't recognize you, O Ali. I thought he was one of the VIPs, not O Ali, not O Ali.
What do you think?
You have a second chance.
Good health to you, the people for whom we are seeking marriage proposals, may they include me.
They are important figures.
I've arranged everything from headgear to the car.
I'm sure I'll find her with you.
In the last series you acted in.
There was a law, as I remember, about marriage.
Wearing a shiny black bisht.
And also, I want you to teach me how to wear the abaya.
"I promise, God bless you, I will never wear a bisht in my life."
God willing, you look really pretty.
Like that, so when you enter the guest wing
This is not explicable.
My brother Rashid,
Do you have (or) Do you have with you (or) Are you with (or) Do you have?
Good evening
Always with me and with Khulood.
That's why.
Stay, my son.
We became a family.
And we also don't want our daughter Nouf to be far from us.
Nora suits Waleed.
He told me that he sees her at university, and that he won't find a better friend than her.
We are blessed with this.
Her father will inform him, and hopefully God will grant us what is good.
Why did they return it, and for what?
Because my father is an actor.
Ask your father to come.
Quickly, tell him Rashid wants to see it.
Where are you, oh!
I'm screaming from sadness.
Because his father was acting.
May it lean on you.
I am an actor.
Nevertheless, I am acting honestly.
I act on stage for a few hours, and my role is over.
When the acting is over.
You're role-playing.
I'm doing
I illustrate a useful vision.
But you
I wear my abaya and cover up.
**on the pulpit**
but you
It's in the guest rooms.
The role of the rich and jealous woman.
Who is the actor?
Who is the real actor?
Don't be sad, my mother! Oh no! Oh Walid!
Rafaah rasak translates to "Lift up your spirits" in English.
Fragment
The scene was hushed.
I heard her yelling at him, "Don't turn your head, don't turn your head," poor him, he broke my heart.
And it's not fair.
Fine, like a horse at the hour.
"Oh, Thursday, oh my goodness, oh Thursday."
Thursday
Women have no lightness.
She is jealous of other women.
This is not working like this.
So that men don't see women, and no one sees women.
I see how his wife is driving him crazy.
Always, don't turn your face away.
I'll bring it to the office tomorrow.
Thursday, please, please show them the city center.
Thursday, show me the center of the city.
What do you intend to call your wife? Central City Square, see.
Let's go, Thursday
With my soul, I see what Salam wants.
Oh, what a pity!
When are you going to change, huh!
If only you heard the story they're telling about you.
Even my elders say more than that.
Why are you doing this?
She's jealous of the women around me.
Why is she feeling so jealous?
Sometimes I sit in front of the TV.
This is it, it.
And Allah
Okay, no problem.
Hello, peace be upon you, my sister.
See that.
Her words at that moment in front of you, she heard a man's voice.
By God, sometimes I feel like I'm going to faint in the street.
Respect yourself and divorce her.
I feel it's hard to let her go.
No, no, no, no, no
Don't come near me, stay there.
What's on your mind!
There's nothing.
Who are you talking to?
You're wasting your time with these good-for-nothing people.
Especially this fat one, he's the one I hate the most among your friends.
He has chubby cheeks and hair like a baby's.
You shameless creep!
Do you want to torment me in my grave?
Let me talk to her.
Tell me, what happened to you?
You're talking to him!
I can't see anyone here.
Healthy, cured? What happened?!
His friend Thursday went crazy.
After a while, he faced the wall and started talking to himself.
Go crazy
Thursday Real Born
Daimen always remembers his mother and imagines talking to her.
And God protects against her evil.
They say Thursday is with you.
He's busy right now, he's on an international call, very far away, even the signal is weak.
What do you say the letter?
And God will relieve your worries, Thursday.
Why are you awake!
I don't sleep, I can't sleep.
Regarding tomorrow's meeting
With the women's delegation at the ministry
Is it possible if they **turn their faces away from you?**
"God guides you, oh! Thursday"
These names were selected by the Office of the Minister's Happiness, the Minister's Office.
Oh, how beautiful!
Why are you afraid of her?
If you were chatting with Salem, why would you leave then?!
Tell the truth.
Why are you hiding behind the water tank?
Such is the case.
I saw the last caller ID, read it, it's with you.
Last number!
I dialed the last number after I deleted the number of a woman you were talking to.
Tell me, what's her name?
I told you, I told you, I told you.
I told her I was talking to Salem.
My regular customer, Saloom.
You didn't believe me.
What are you wearing?
Are you going on a diving trip?
Damn it! Brother, you didn't let me change my clothes.
I want to call him!
Call my wife.
Call my wife.
Say it, brother, give me the password, a pen, I'll call, I'll give you the number.
You help each other.
Oh men, you're always like this.
You're just like him, a liar. I'll show you.
If you intervene again, I will go to the minister's office.
Damned
He told me and threatened me that he would complain about me to the minister's office.
She is very strong.
She's out to ruin my career.
I made a mistake by listening to you and calling her.
Listen up! Thursday
She complained about me in the minister's office.
Come with me and tell the whole truth, and let me stay away from this subject.
This is my personal business.
You are a coward.
Sisters and brothers
Good morning, everyone.
How beautiful it is that you attended the meeting.
Where's the rest?
Fled
Where is Thursday?
He's coming.
Turn off your phone.
Okay, don't turn it off, leave it in the office.
The meeting will only last for one hour.
This is not my phone.
Bring on the war
Oh my, he's been sitting with you since that day.
Where does he want to go?
He can't go.
And since that day, his situation hasn't changed.
Vindictive, resentful of women's presence around him.
No one else
He sits alone here in the living room at night.
He says she is my mother.
Mother! Mother has died.
That's why you invited me, so we could find a solution to my misfortune.
She asked you to leave the circle where there were women.
Is it a military decision?
Look at the signatures, they're very clear from below.
Brother, I'm sorry, I got excited about the social welfare department.
"!Save department! Are you sure they transferred you to it?"
Why are you surprised?
Good health to you, may God bless you.
You, my sister, Syrian, my brother Thursday.
The minister's office called and informed us.
Are you going to your new office?
Who's with you in the office?
Ice, Saleh, Jasim,
Oh! Thursday, the minister decided to transfer you only yesterday.
And you just got it today.
I explained to you my problem with my family.
The minister decided to transfer you.
I have to go to the minister's office.
He started his annual vacation today.
He will be back in a month and a half.
Oh, disaster!
If you want my opinion,
The minister is telling you the same thing.
Work there until we find you another place. This time we're transferring you because too many people have complained about your problems with your wife.
Blessings upon you for your honesty.
And even what is the religion!
I don't talk when my wife is on the phone.
You never know, they might hear your plea, beg them.
I told them to put the abayas in the car; I put them in the trunk for you.
How many?
I put ten just like you put five in the office, so two for each person.
It seems he is very afraid of his wife.
Imagine he gave us all boys' names.
And he calls me Abdelkader.
What's his name?
He is sweet and handsome, so she is afraid another girl might want him.
In the name of God, what's wrong with her?
Who called me?
Yes, Abdelkader, who is from Hassan, is there behind Khalil.
Here are the abayas, and each one chooses what she likes.
Look at this.
How much is this?
What's the matter? What happened?
Please
Where is the Ministry of Labor office?
There should be five employees.
What's your name?
I am sweet.
Come on, give me a break.
My mistake.
We completed the project ahead of schedule.
And he sat with them.
They said what?
They said.
Munir, make yourself some tea.
I can't.
Do you want me to go back to the kitchen and ruin my clothes?
Come on, go make us some tea.
Come on, you nosy people.
Go listen to what the men are saying.
Don't forget we're close cousins (sons of scorpions).
Go quietly, bring me tea without sugar, go, go, quietly, quietly, quietly, quietly.
The bank said the project is good.
I called him many times, his phone was busy.
Oh, how sweet they are! They have been admiring you for a long time.
My kids are normal as usual.
One of them took a month off, she traveled three months ago and hasn't shown up since.
By the Generous God, goodbye.
And all the changes are in our favor.
Pour us
Yeah, but if you build a garden
It takes up the space of two or three villas at least.
The park is a place for the residents of the complex to relax.
Men don't need women's opinions.
Do it for yourself.
Put the tea and go to him.
No garden.
Just a moment
Sister, you know I love football.
Her uncles and aunts would kill her if they found out she was playing it at school.
What are you planning to do, kill yourself?
See, I told you.
I advise you to forget her.
Don't hurt yourself.
No, no, no, no, I'm happy with you.
"Qada" translates to "destiny" or "fate" in English.
Forgive me, you are our blessings.
Oh Uncle Shahin, where are you?
Inshallah
Isn't this Thursday?
We matured.
Became an adult
I'm tired of looking for a wife for him, I couldn't find one.
I come from a genuine and large family.
Identify,
He makes his marriage story about me.
Is this from Human Resources?
Yes, may God grant you a long life.
Put it aside.
I have a few remarks on his suggestions.
Fine, may God lengthen your life.
Anything else
No, may you live long.
Take care of them, and I'll meet them when I have time.
What did you do about the employees I sent you yesterday?
What's happening?
I'll go now, then I'll call you.
What happened?
I'm stupid.
We are big sisters.
Or we get tired of them.
You know they asked me what I play at school.
I told them you play table tennis.
It's good they didn't kill you.
These are the only ones who started.
Do you know who we are?
What is our root?
Do you know what that means?
This time we broke your face.
Leader of the Hawks
Small scorpion
Oh man, let me punch her in the face.
That was enough.
See you next time.
"Dude, you changed your mind! You told me you wanted architecture and engineering."
Am I stupid?
A Scorpio woman shouldn't work on the street with men.
engineer and build
You're going to make us cry.
Let me hit her head.
No, no, Sultan, no
Sure, Boss Scorpion.
I told you, Fatoum hit her.
Let your brother have his chance, Falcon.
Not good.
Joan of Arc, at least she got a slap in the face.
Look at my face.
Why do they want you to go with them tomorrow morning?
What do they want?
Please enjoy.
I walk, ahead of me.
Where are we going?
What does the word say?
Where are we going?
I told you to shut up, don't utter a word.
... Invest in education ...
Or even nursing, we have no objection.
And then?
You have two options.
So you know we're open-minded.
You never let me say that we paid you to change.
Nursing, or education
Go
Get us a copy of the request.
Walk, go away!
Oh boy! Scorpion leader
The forty-four-year-old herself suggests it to you.
Good health to you, uncle, but when is the engagement?
**Miss Mona**
What you ask for is difficult.
I can't travel, oh! Abu Khalid
I have special circumstances.
Al-Waziri recommends it.
It's difficult.
Think about it again.
Don't decide now, think about it until tomorrow.
How are they making you work still!
This is why they don't say anything.
I have a suggestion.
Ask one of them to travel with you.
Girls don't travel.
This is special.
No shame!
You should be grateful we let you go work.
Go tomorrow and tell them you can't travel.
Shut up, don't argue.
Listen and be quiet.
Thursday, Scorpio's child
He is related to us.
He's stupid, he's an idiot and he doesn't have a degree.
It's just a scorpion.
What are you doing, sister?
What can I do, oh Fatima!
I am weak and bankrupt.
What can I do?
There's nothing I can do.
What can you do?
The engagement is next Monday.
I'll call you when the sheikh arrives.
What a beautiful laugh!
Go to the market and buy a new dress.
Go and get yourself a new dress, my son.
I die from this laughter.
Oh, my brother, I swear to God.
I don't want to hear a word.
Prepare us tea, coffee, and sweets.
Oh, lucky you! Aisha, you're the minister's friend now!
I'm afraid it's a scam! Oh, Abu Khalid.
Manaira is nominated for the position of minister in a new ministry within the new cabinet structure.
Munaira deserves all good.
Oh God, let it not be a story from behind.
Are you going to work tomorrow?
It is our duty to unite and serve this country.
Through the efforts of each one in their place, thank you.
I wish you all the best.
Thank you for your happiness.
Thank you = 'Dhannak'
Thank you
Welcome, please come in.
Peace be upon you
Yes, with soap as you requested.
He is the overall supervisor of the women's football league.
Ask him about Fatima's playing.
Inshallah
Captain Fatima scored two goals like a professional player.
Captain Fatima is talented! Oh, brothers!
Cool, what do you think of Fatima's playing?
She is a good forward player.
She's going to travel to China.
Captain, Sheyna is not a little far away.
God bless you.
Your sister is playing an important game.
She was studying education, but today I went and submitted a transfer request for her.
You will study architecture.
There is no difference between a man and a woman.
Really? Go make coffee.
Where is the explanation: This
I'm tired of waiting.
You are stupid, aren't you?
Go, kiss your mother and tell her you've been fired.
Go away, ***
Oh, fool!
Your coffee in the pot you have has gotten cold.
"For sure, when they find out you're the one who made the series, they'll say"
Hello, how are you, how are the kids!
What did you tell her?
I told her you'd be at the party with us.
Sure, and she'll be the main character.
Look, Ali, Shauli is playing the role of Nouf.
There's something called makeup, which makes her look younger.
Mary's role is only until episode twenty-six or seven.
Let the people benefit.
Give us this lecture.
I'm afraid he's going to give us a headache.
The most important thing is that they don't know your production company, you and Hamed.
I hope I'm not late.
And as for Rashid, he is still present.
The director and the actors are ready.
For the sake of time, let's start the meeting.
Please, tell us what you think.
Hamad, do you want to say something?
Frankly, I think it's the best thing.
You want to know when the maid committed suicide.
You know the most affecting part of me.
When the maid committed suicide.
When she hanged herself from a fan, she spun around and bled to death.
"He made me laugh and cheered me up, my heart, oh my gosh, Mother!"
And he kept calling me until he reached home/the square.
It is enthusiasm.
You hear the police coming, they search the house, and arrest the girl.
"Sweet series, honestly."
I was about to perform the series here on this table.
In fact, it's blackmail of the artistic conscience.
Social dysfunction
It's about unusual events.
Some things are unbelievable.
Seventy-two murder cases
What's the deal with all this crying?
You're known for hindering people.
Come on, Mr. Hamid, let's cheer up.
Let's take a majority vote.
Mr. Nasser, don't claim openness and use justifications as a pretext, these are not suitable for a critical evaluation of artistic production.
You're involved in this because of your government job.
Goodbye
I heard the doorbell ring.
An Indian man had a bag in his hand.
He asked me who I was. I told him I was from Um Hassan's side.
I opened the bag.
The ring was worth around seventy to eighty thousand.
I'm afraid the Indian man brought these items by mistake.
No, it's not a mistake.
It's Sameera
Hamed, the supervisor at the company, got married.
Here's a gift from her to you, may God bless you.
Yes, this is for you.
The ring is very luxurious.
I never imagined a ring of this value.
"God bless you! Oh, Hissa! Oh, dear!"
Yes, that's it, I call it the blessed chain.
Ali and Hamid are owners of the production, but they are employees there, they can't put their name on it.
What do we get besides the ring?
Don't share this with anyone, keep it just between you and me.
I'm crazy to do that.
Your clever husband
What they call magical
Only five percent, it's very little.
No, it's fine, they also agreed to four million for them.
Your husband earns 200,000 Qatari Riyals, no traffic.
I think we're giving the college girl role to Nada.
She played a role, fell in love with the first man and forgot about her studies.
The series we're producing is called **Conscience Extortion**.
They talked to me about the role in the series.
I want to know.
Gulf series are always like this; this year's trend is blackmail.
Successful, O hero of courage, what is my role?
And you too, my dear, your turn is secured.
Don't embarrass me.
I'm coming, coming now.
I've made all this breakfast for you, don't go and leave me.
This is Omar, the manager's secretary.
May God protect us.
He never asks to see me at this time of day.
He told him it would be a weak and silly series.
Don't waste your money on her.
Okay, so what happened next?
By God, I don't know what to say, I'm scared. Rashid told them something bad about the series.
Don't be afraid.
Leave it to me.
One crazy person.
It's a social series.
I saw him on TV.
May God not deprive me of your long life.
The program on TV now is called "Rainbow Blackmail."
Okay, I think the budget they're asking for is way too high.
Requires a high budget
Just don't forget that the producing institution is a local one.
Let's support her.
There isn't any.
Two languages?
We heard they're starting to film the series "Assault of the Conscience."
And that he allocates a huge budget for it.
Some people say the series is weak.
And he said that the serial is made up of schools that teach bad behavior.
They might stop the firing.
Peace be upon you
I hope you are well.
Welcome. May God welcome you, please go ahead, take your seats.
Good morning
Good morning, hello.
I am Eli Monir, a journalist, and I have an appointment with Mr. Hamed, if you don't mind.
Yes, fine, please sit down for a bit, because there's a meeting.
Mercury, this allows us to use a design for the universe.
We also send all the ordinances to the world so they can communicate with us.
Bring this question.
Mercury Media Production Company
He discusses his issues in a way that makes him the best in the history of the world.
Do you believe who wrote this?
He has no shame.
Is there a journalist like this?
Is there a journalist like this?
A journalist should have a moral sense.
We're working.
Are they expecting us here?
I met with His Excellency, the Minister, do you know what he told me?
The situation is very tragic, and its events are unfamiliar.
The first EPC will be tomorrow, I will attend it with Qatar.
"What do you advise, mother?"
Come on, Mom, just the first episode.
I've seen people talk to themselves, but only in Gulf series.
I don't see a mother wanting to kill her children, except in your series.
My son, art is a sensitive feather, not ordinary conditions that you generalize about people and society.
Mom, this is possible to do in plastic arts, but drama is a completely different thing.
It hurts my head.
It seems they are imitating the people of Turkey.
Don't judge yet, at least watch the first five episodes.
This serial failed.
We can't let our kids see it.
Is it that bad, brother?
There are worse shows on TV.
In fact, no one **has** it (Qatari).
Your mistake
For the public, in every house.
I will go to vote to forget, forget, forget, forget, forget, forget, forget.
And you see them with your own eyes.
We are not done yet.
Tell me, what happened?
The minister, accompanied by some guests, toured the explanation.
I stood up to give him my regards.
We agreed to produce the serial.
How does the minister feel happy about this?
Okay, let's hear Nasser's opinion.
My colleague wrote that.
I only publish what has good things to say about the series.
No, no, it's okay.
He reads the newspaper tomorrow and I'll have him publish praise messages from me and have him say that the viewers sent them.
Inshallah
You're welcome.
For this year translates to: لهذا العام
Okay, if they have an agreement with them.
The best series in the history of Gulf drama
They are all in agreement with them.
Okay, let's say they all agree with them.
I'm trying to read the headlines only.
I wish they would bring back the TV series "Mindhunter."
Thank you, Minister of Arts, for this series.
I wish they would do it again.
When the small office management first contacted me
We can come and collect the final installment of the ransom money.
They were right about you, calling you a sorcerer.
That's not everything.
The profits were motivating and we got our money.
And the next serial number for failure.
The very same writer himself told me he regrets writing it.
I'm here to propose a second season of the series.
The minister believed the press hoax I invented.
Mussadik was deluded by the illusory success we achieved.
God willing, he won't be satisfied with the series.
It means it's impossible for him to agree to a second part.
I guarantee you that the minister himself is asking for a second part.
I can only appreciate it.
Say "thank you"
For the public
Who worked on this serial?
A thousand congratulations to them on his success.
Every one of them deserves it.
In fact, winning these awards from distinguished festivals
Proves that there is
This is what's on your mind.
You are excellent
Winning the gold prize for sure.
What was Ashu saying?
Before, the reader and the journalist were deceived.
Yeah, why not have a second part?
As long as Arab and Gulf TV festivals are artistic money laundering.
Art money laundering!
I've heard about money laundering.
Not art.
Suspicious accounts
One real
What can't we do with "one-two"?
Tie the thread.
We didn't sign a contract with them, they should still be obligated.
Write them.
Our products are exported worldwide, bread in all types and shapes, flat, large, small, triangular and varied.
How much did we agree upon in the contract?
Cottonsheen
What did you do with the Australian baker?
He is the inventor of bread.
Did anyone give you a sample of their product?
It's not that great, but just tell me it's bread, but I don't know what's inside it.
Bread with clouds
It is called "Suwaiṭah"
Instead of cutting bread, (samon) as you call it = (semolina bread)
The inventor tried to make it easy.
Jean baked bread.
This is the secret.
Eat bread with the sauce.
Those people do weird things sometimes.
This zipper is amazing, it's made in a way that if you put it in your mouth, it dissolves.
Coffee, tea, strawberry juice, and soft drinks.
Do you know how much money I invested in this project?
Three million dollars, with patents.
Go ahead, please! Forgive me.
Yes, Abu Nasser.
Yes, brother, I am at your service.
Sir, we arrived today.
Tell him "Oh! Forgive me."
We were with your son Nasser yesterday, playing football in his team.
I agreed to it.
To form his team of drivers and security.
And it's also an incomplete team, we only have one goalkeeper, if he gets injured we'll be in trouble.
It is assumed that he is expected to have fans as well.
When I brought in seventeen players,
I didn't say anything.
Important people in the company
Indispensable
What alcohol does, alcohol destroys.
Why do men get angry?
I said he can't, he's a boy from a well-known family, he can't run after the ball and make a fool of himself.
He can do what he wants.
Just don't take what can't be replaced.
And what can I do, Mom? My team has a match and we need four players.
No more excuses.
Okay, what happened, what happened?
Hamdi, oh God, the manager is making his life miserable today.
I went with him.
He said, "Put on the garment."
And they would leave me standing in the penalty area.
The match started.
And then I didn't feel anything.
He hit me and I'm not focused.
Have you ever worked as a goalkeeper?
I only played because Nasser asked me to.
"There is no protector or helper for you besides Him, the Almighty, the One Who deserves all praise."
We're tired of your love for football.
From now on, oh! Nasser
No ball.
You need to disband your team.
And all bakers must return to their bakeries.
What do you think?
Fatih, he
I don't want to hear anything.
Yaah! Bu Nasser
Listen to what he wants to say.
Present, just because you asked me.
Speak, what do you want to say?
Tomorrow we'll have our last match in the tournament.
Don't upset him, oh! Bou Nasser, please, I'm with you.
Okay, oh! Guys
Congratulations, congratulations
Zayn, Zayn, Zayn, Congratulations
Oh! Mr. Nasser, I'd like to speak with you for a minute, please.
Good job, our team was on time today.
Mr. Nasser, it's necessary.
You promised us a party.
Would you like me to call and book a room at the hotel?
And support the correspondents and journalists there.
No way! Rashid is coming to our house.
So my father, when he sees the players and their success, might not cancel it.
They won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup.
God willing.
No, no, I saw him taking photos with the players, he was with them and talking to the press.
It seems that Sami, the sports page editor, is interviewing him.
Picture
Keep it close to me.
Zain's photos
He is happy.
Their pains are eased / Nothing befalls them but good / God increases their pride / And God completes their good fortune and health.
Exalted by the Spirit
... and the effort
And loyalty to the bakery.
Mard, Bo Nasser, we saw the team play 4-4-2.
And loyalty to the bakery and the coach's plan
Good health to you, Uncle Abu Nasser.
Good health to you.
Oh, goalkeeper!
Al-Duwai and Al-Kaabi = journalists who will come to interview you.
Hey, I'm not from the council.
They sent their representative to conduct the interview.
They brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought the cup.
You know, we encourage the youth.
I expect a bright future for them.
Yes, goodbye.
Inshallah your phone always rings, and your pictures are in the newspapers, you are blessed with this ball.
Do you know who was talking to me on the phone?
He reduced the price of engines, said Ok.
Yeah, now I'm famous, under every picture of me in the newspapers, they write: "The first athlete in the world's bakeries."
Were you interested in soccer?
Come on!
Since I was in school
The person who sat next to me loved football.
You say you weren't close to the ball.
Since the person next to me is playing football, I am close to football.
Being close to sports means you are an athlete.
We're not just baking international bread anymore, we're playing international football.
I heard him say yesterday that he's going to the sports club.
And today we meet the first athlete from International Bakeries, Bo Nasser.
To promote football
Before the match, tell us your predictions before you head to the theater.
The game is tough today.
Young people today, the team that controls the center line will be *...* today.
Yeah, if God wills, we are communicating with agents of professional players to develop the International Bakers Team.
They call him Saud, listen, we need commitment.
Yes, he wants the previous deal for the players.
It had no benefit.
When I gave you the prices
I gave you the international price.
So, isn't the Gulf part of the world?
Sure no.
This is none of your business.
Let me know when a buyer from the Gulf arrives.
Open your fax line.
Two of them are defenders, one is a midfielder, and the other is a central player.
Look, these four players
Three of them are equal.
Two million dollars each for the players.
Take them all in one box.
"It's six hundred thousand, I'll give it to you for five hundred and fifty thousand dollars."
Sweet, this is about African players, now, for the Brazilian player.
This player is the one who won the title of Best Player; he alone earns two million two hundred thousand dollars.
They gave me this price but then later I received a fax, I'll show it to you, it's here. Wait, look, look, I received it from a club in the UAE.
The decision is yours.
Thank you
God willing, look at his leg.
How are you?
Elbow, elbow
The knee is beautiful.
We don't want anyone laughing at us, hopefully it's not a false alarm.
Oh, Father of Nasser!
What is this connecting muscle?
Oh butcher! Make a traditional dish of rice and meat.
Frankly, you're lucky to have Brazilian and African players. Congratulations, congratulations.
Thank you
Save for the shop.
Oh God, if it's God's will, you have another trade.
No, no, no, just players.
I see them unloading boxes.
Young players! Ah, their ancestors, from the forests of Africa.
Yes, why like this?
Oh Karim, open one box for him.
He is a human just like us.
Qal: small, but not all of them
They are young.
As long as we exist.
Why don't you give us this little boy as a free gift?
Listen, Abu Nasser, if you take care of him and raise him well, he will be a support and benefit to you in the future.
And there they go, releasing it in the stadium.
Come on, come on.
Go easy on him, he's still young.
Put it in the annex, let it grow.
Don't hesitate if you need anything, all the players are with me.
Your coach needs to understand.
We won 2-0, we controlled the game.
Dad, this is a coach from Spain.
What I like
Successful coach
Playing chess.
And this, the opposite, is the way of the fist.
You need to let your coach do their thing.
He stayed with the team for less than two months.
We need to put an end to this matter.
If he were an expert in football, he would have done what the central players did in the corner, and he wouldn't have attacked from the middle.
Ah, it relied on an ambush trap.
Oh, Mom, don't give me a headache.
He must fly his Malawian flag.
And replace him with Shinamu Hababu Hetawala Hatawa Hawawa.
My father doesn't play.
Forget your talk, my love, it's too late now.
What's the matter?
Execute the plan.
"He sinned and forgot."
Isn't this supposed to be between the coach and the team manager?
Man of the match, team star
Does that mean we're not specialized in football?
Listen, oh! Sultan
Let him go home.
Don't take him in the bakery car, let him go by taxi.
None of your business.
Stay updated
Did you see what my father did?
The coach took off his coat and gave it back.
What does he do?
The team is destroying.
Farewelled the team here with us.
Yum yum
No, that's crazy. He said you're divorced. Tell the truth, what happened between you?
From the very first day I saw him, I told your mother, I don't like this man.
I feel he can't handle the responsibility.
Rant about nonsense, chatter, and talking about the past.
You need to go to his children and find out why your daughter became divorced.
I don't know what to say, oh! Brother Rashid.
Why did he divorce her, then?
There's no justice! Oh, Abu Abdullah. We should know, we have the right to know, why is she divorced?
Oh God, don't interfere. This is none of your business.
What's going on? Should I intervene? The man is sitting in the living room waiting, why did his daughter get divorced?
She knows how to appreciate her husband and respect his feelings.
Who is Barcelona?
It's not your fault. You don't know about the Spanish league.
Barcelona is not a small town.
This is Guardiola's team.
I'm going now to the men who are receiving me in the living room.
You don't go, I'll go. Okay, stay here and leave it to me.
You have to get out and not move your head.
Barcelona couldn't keep its word.
Messi, the football wizard, who scores a hat-trick in every match.
Maradona himself said that Messi will be better than him.
Even your shameless daughter is bullying him. Listen,
Your daughter is not a Barcelona fan, she is not one of us, and she doesn't benefit us (term).
What do you mean!
Listen, may God guide you.
Don't tell me you want my son.
I apologize and beg her.
Yakh.
"And thank God, we have a lot of money."
What's the point of our money if we can't make our son happy?
Don't talk like that again.
Most importantly, I'm looking for a fanatical Barça fan.
Mom, I'm not angry.
She's crazy! Oh, my son, he forgot her.
Drink tea Oh! Boy
Recognize, ya! Ya boy, these are the losers.
A thousand girls want you for marriage.
My father's wishes.
I feel for her.
Poor thing, she got divorced two days ago.
After a month of marriage.
What's wrong with you, do you want me to interfere with him?
I don't want to be involved with him.
Who told you these illogical stories!
Don't listen to her.
Do you know who he is?
What do you want quickly!
Her wealth is modest.
Remember the building I wanted to buy and turn into a part-hotel?
Exists in the inhabited world.
This building belongs to his father, and when his son marries our daughter, he will ask him about this building.
If you couldn't.
Her brother spoke.
Listen carefully.
Your millionaire son proposed to you.
Do you know what a millionaire is!
The chance only comes once.
They are so rich that they bought a palace in Spain so they can summer there every year.
Okay, what about Barcelona?
The girl's family might have spread this rumor to prove her innocence.
Let's say the story is true and the man loves Barcelona and went to Qatar.
Qaimoos's wife should respect him.
Don't mess with the team.
This assuming the story is true.
You're welcome, Your Highness Abu Burjain, because you have two towers on the corniche.
They are designed in a strange way, like twisted ropes.
When people see them from far away, they worry, thinking it's a single tower.
What do you think? It's all yours.
%pw 7welcome translates to: "Welcome"
God bless you. Okay, get yourself something, anything.
Thank you, my love.
And give me the light of my eyes, my son Abdullah, I want you back.
No, it's okay, the light of my eyes, Umm Abdullah.
If I search the entire Gulf Cooperation Council, I won't find anyone better than you.
Tell them to give us their estimates for building the structure.
Yay, you're done, anything else?
Yes, the kids are calling you.
Figure out their needs for the wedding, prepare the check, and I'll sign it.
In the name of God, God is willing, in the name of God, God is willing, with your permission, Your Highness.
Abdullah is getting divorced again!
May your children and money be protected from him (proverb)
"God bless you, oh! Auntie"
He's wearing it because of the cold.
Yeah, but I don't know where my mom booked us?
Where did you book us, Mother?
Mom says she booked us for Malaysia.
What's wrong with Malaysia, it's fine.
Goodbye
What's wrong? Did you hear someone coming back from her honeymoon crying?
What's wrong with you, my daughter?
Tell me what happened, oh! My daughter.
Mom, she's so arrogant.
Why this?
She's arrogant, stay away from her.
I did the right thing when I fired her.
I feel for her.
That's her mother.
Why is she upset?
What's happening to it?
Blessings of Allah upon you, you are a great asset to us.
Hey, Spanish. Where are we going?
Done.
Mom says she booked us a trip to the Maldives.
Okay, okay! Oh! [Girl] The Maldives is nice too.
She also excused herself.
I thought you'd come back happy from your trip.
What really pisses me off is why he took the kids.
Come on! Take the bag.
What's wrong with them?
Come here! Oh! You're hurt?
Shut up! May God give you health, you're telling me about my son's face.
Wow! He's swearing! Why is he upset?
When I see the peels, I get annoyed.
"So many people bother you, oh boy!"
Forget her, divorce her, divorce her. Your father has a lot of money and many daughters.
Be quiet and understand, my child, that anything small upsets him. Why does he live if he's not happy?
Hey! Hey, boy! Come on! Come on! Let her go!
"God's wonders upon her."
Tell her three times.
You're divorced. Don't lock the door, turn left twice.
Divorced, divorced.
I'm very angry / Very nervous.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Oh, trouble.
Just because they saw you at the disco.
Knock on his door, let me talk to him.
Is this my mother? He divorced me a long time ago. He said, "You are divorced, divorced."
Why is he divorcing you? He has no shame.
If a woman goes to a disco, what would she do!
And one if necessary %pw.
What's in it! What has turned the world upside down!
You see, I go to his house, fool him, and he doesn't know who you are?
I, I, my daughter is divorced by Abu Abdullah!
My daughter got divorced!
Your daughter is different.
They are bought and sold in Toys "R" Us stores.
You feel the bad taste in your mouth now, for your daughter, and you feel frustrated.
And they did nothing.
If she didn't bring you the peeled apple, divorce her.
Feel free to let them go as you wish.
And she is still married to a man.
This is good riddance, let him go with the fire!
And you see the same thing in what you did for others.
What you don't accept as a right for yourself, you should not accept for others.
He doesn't like people.
Do you know who owned the land where this mall is?
In a strategic location?
Just leave it to God.
And also at a very cheap price.
Closure.
I need to get Abu Sakr's approval.
Yes, I went to the office late, and I didn't find him.
I went to his office last week and they told me he had traveled.
He has a meeting, come tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, I don't have time and the problem that I need to get Abu Saqr's approval on, I need to.
Go to his office.
No, no, no, no, this is official business.
The office is not home, may God keep you in the right place.
Which one?
What raises the foundation of Abu Saqr?
Everyone has a key.
Say it, O Bu Fahd.
Following
I know, but I only see it on TV, and you told me you saw it in person.
We don't know each other well.
Cool down
God guides you, you came straight away, at least ask about the reason for this holiday.
There's no point in saying that, may God guide you. Explanation: Qatari
The month is ninety-nine days, with fifty candles.
I suggest to Your Highness that they put you in the Guinness Book of World Records.
As the most prolific banquet maker in the world.
By the way, who is this brother with you?
Welcome, this is a blessed time.
Sharifa Sharifa.
So oh! Abu Fula
You are saying that Abo Saqr is hosting a feast every day.
This is what we see.
Oh! I'll stay up late tonight for the special association.
Today, God bless you, bless your son Falcon.
God has willed it, he deserves it, your glory, your glory, for good the explanation: This involves
Here, welcome, my child.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Why?
For this occasion, my son Saqr, he should go to the agency tomorrow and choose the car he wants.
Even though I had waited two and a half years for a response.
I went bankrupt.
But when I reached him.
And give him money.
May God guide you, Abu Saad.
It doesn't work that way.
I told him "well done."
He has to visit the exhibition and choose the car he likes.
Let's buy him five.
I'll take you to him!
Take me to him.
You told me you met him during the Hajj pilgrimage last year.
Today, his young son Shahin
His game is banquets.
This is your chance.
Be gracious to him and bless him.
He deserved to be fine, oh! Your majesty.
"Shahain oh! Abu Saqr."
God bless you, thank you so much! Oh, people!
Praise be to God for the safety of Shaheen, O father of...
Blessings of Allah upon you
By the way, who are you?
Your position
You don't know me.
I can't pull the wool over your eyes.
Your Honor, I was with you on the Umrah pilgrimage last year.
And remember that you bought a red rosary.
God bless you.
I was in the hospital.
You spend time with your friends.
It is an honor to meet you.
So, Falcon, are you still undecided about entering this business, or have you made up your mind?
I'm fed up with him.
Why, oh! Boy, Falcon is a good trader.
Start, open an office and see.
Abu Sakr,
Your place, please say done.
Why?
I have Saqr's gift.
Full floor
Even if trade loves you and is coming your way, you say: No.
Who has everything today like you? Since you got the license, everything comes easily to you, a free car and the best office on the corniche.
Abu Jassim was telling my father that if Saqr wants to join the business, I will make him a partner with 50% share.
Mom, how can I bridge the gap between business and university?
Mom, don't make me do something I don't want to.
And you're lucky that agencies, offices, and cars are thrown at you for free.
Opportunity! Boy, who can start a project at this time without capital?
Your only legacy is the people's love for your father.
Be smart and invest it.
Believe me, [boy], this is your chance in life.
And Rose quickly prepared lunch.
He also reached pickles and pepper.
لم يترك شيئًا، لم يترك شيئًا، أخاف أن يأخذ وكالة السمبوسة.
Your son has a good head for business.
This is what I was excited to see. Do you know what he told me today?
He told me, "My mother wants to expand her investments."
He wants to enter the Caribbean Sea and invest in the islands there.
May God protect him from the eyes of envy.
Abu Sultan told me yesterday, "Your son has just entered the business."
He has twenty agencies, six restaurants, and is a shareholder in two banks.
**T
I think, God knows best, they haven't opened it yet.
Ah, what's wrong with the person in the northern area of our office?
No, I just love him.
Thank you, and God bless you, congratulations Ya Aobas.
In the name of God. Explanation: This is
Good health to you.
There's no need to regret now.
What are you saying, man! A whole year of misery and hard work to get the grocery store ready.
What's going on! I feel like he passes by the shop every day.
I see you're introducing me to your secretary, whose name is Samer.
"This is Saqr, Abu Saqr's son. He wants to be your partner instead of taking the place from you."
Does he still want to be your partner?
La hawla wala quwwata illa billah.
You started talking to him, right?
Ask me who I am, brother?
Business is bad!
Why did you tell him you had an Iranian bakery?
"When you were walking next to this bakery, you had a small sign, what was written on that sign, what was the name written on the sign?"
**The Neighbourhood Bakery.**
No, I want a different name.
"And peace be upon you."
So, how's work going for you?
Welcome, God willing, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow we will be finishing the design of the worker housing plans for the Future Company.
No, no, Mr. Saqr, she is my wife, Elisa. Let me introduce you to Mr. Saqr, the owner of the company.
Hello, how are you?
Let her take a company car.
Good health to you, you've done well, may you be safe.
It's not just cooking, even cooking nowadays is based on science and study.
Today, someone told me they want to work in business. They have some money and want to invest it.
But he doesn't have sufficient knowledge, understanding, or study of economics, or even business.
Oh, like this.
Do you think he'll succeed? I don't think so, he's wasting his time and losing.
Did you hear? Oh! Abu Nasser!
What are those two canaries saying?
What is this?
Give me your son **Sagr**.
See it.
See him today.
Your Highness, we are not talking about your son, Saqr.
We talk about the law.
Your son, Saqr, is a gift from God, and I don't want to envy him; he's an exception.
Good health to you, he's talking about the law.
He taught me, my son Falcon builds himself by himself.
He gave a car as a gift all at once.
He sold it and invested the money on his advice.
And whatever Allah wills, see it now.
Oh! You and I are talking about ordinary people.
A single strike from him, and something Abu Nasr did with him, he took it and threw it into the street.
Sagar has business talents.
Strong economic choices.
Who's supposed to ask who his father is?
I seek refuge in God, astonished.
God willing.
Gulf Business Magazine's Economic Poll
Please.
"Peace be upon you, welcome, welcome, O Salim."
What's wrong with her?
By God, I don't know what to say. Oh! Salim.
Yeah, I remember.
The story was true.
They say the company sends a fax to my parents.
And they said to him
Oh, how sad for him, he couldn't bear it.
And as you see.
Let's see when the news breaks.
He had it in the job and the fax was in his hand.
He did him many kindnesses.
As they say, I taught him how to shoot, and when he became strong, he shot me.
What did the doctor say?
Pray for him! Oh, Salim.
I was shocked.
I can't believe there are people like that in the world.
A man who gives to the poor and does not let his left hand know what his right hand is doing.
Donations from this organization reach all Muslims in Asia and Africa.
But I am also honored that you ask us to clarify your goals and the future steps you intend to take, God willing.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, our goal in "Socotra of Good" is to achieve synergy in this homeland.
In addition to sixty blankets for our brothers affected by the Pakistani earthquake.
Lastly but not least, we also supported seven needy families now.
With a monthly salary of only one hundred and thirty-two riyals.
We won't be late.
And then I'll join you right away.
Who is this pretty girl?
This is Khalid and his wife; they are inviting us to the hotel tonight.
Yes, anywhere, anywhere with you and me together, I'm happy.
My love, may God keep you for me, a popular saying.
Oh! My dear.
These aren't ready. These are mine.
This bakery
Take this money according to your benefit.
Five riyals for broad beans, three riyals for hot bread.

Let's go diving!
The captain is present and having breakfast with him. Explanation: This is a challenging task.
Needs men.
Oh God! Your honor!
So what? So on?
No, no. What I'm asking you is to let me hear a resounding yes in my ear.
Hello, Nora.
Anoud is annoyed with you.
Can I bear your anger?
What do you mean?
Why are you angry?
Noura chose a plain and simple dress.
Don't say that, you'll upset Anood.
My eye, these Lebanese speak properly.
Don't respond too much.
Me too, envy him for his good fortune.
The sweetest valley, the brightest light.
He mocks her and calls her "my little flower."
Let your blood boil, how much will it cost?
I paid twenty thousand, and twenty thousand riyals are remaining.
Congratulations, you're compensated!
God be with you.
Hello, it's a pleasure to meet you, Umm Saleh.
Hello Fadi, you look busy, I don't want to keep you.
At your service.
Hello, hello.
Did the text message arrive yesterday?
Receive it, oh! Silly.
Did you like the joke?
So, are you okay with the design?
I didn't have time to make them. Show me your designs and I'll choose from them.
From the bottom of my heart, your taste is sweeter.
They're leaving us, envy is starting to act up.
When he realized that my project was good and started generating income,
They all depend on God to occupy me in a project.
Boutique for design and tailoring
Women's Clothing
This is Abu Nasser who doesn't know anything about trade.
There are banks.
He will harm his cousin.
That's how it is these days.
Oh, my cousin.
I was sleeping, and suddenly they woke me up and said your uncle wants you.
Perfect! Ask me anything you want!
Everything is fine, everything is fine.
God willing.
You don't have any intention for any project, for example, for example.
Are you coming to look for a bride or what?
I heard you were designed for that, so I thought I should drop by.
May God bless you.
If you want more, we have it.
Praise be to God, the work is going well, praise be to God.
How do I make "Ooh! Abu Saleh"?
Just a minute, they rented it last week.
Yes, they did it.
Okay, that's good, God willing. Goodbye.
This is it.
Are you sure?
And haute couture, yes, you know the big disaster!
What is this?
He rented a shop next to yours.
Oh, hater! Oh, jealous one!
Before you knew the market was open to everyone,
You should know.
That your heart opens to your cousin.
I won't ask you.
You deny, you lie, you mock me, and you told me, me,
I wanted to do my work discreetly.
Taking that is the shop in front, you're going to ruin my work.
But they didn't say come and be a pain in the neck next to my wisdom teeth, you're driving me crazy.
This is envy and hatred, I say, I say your father, your father, your father, your father, your father, your father, your father, your father.
Come on, you're relatives! People?
Shame on you! O Abu Saleh!
Leave him alone, or I'll hit you! You're the one shouting, you are.
I accuse you as I would accuse you of stealing my house.
Come on, people.
Peace be upon you, people.
I swear to God, I swear to God, you didn't do anything.
Tanasah is with me, a friend from the Philippines.
Don't let anyone lie to you.
Why, why specifically a Lebanese person?
They are chatting with him, having fun, laughing, and feeling very comfortable.
That's why Salah brings a Lebanese woman.
He started talking to me sweetly and convincing me.
He's bothering me, bothering me with his talk.
I was convinced and they made me pay twelve thousand riyals.
Two days later, I went to the auction market and found the same cabinet, its twin, for 900 Qatari riyals.
Play time is over.
A Lebanese designer bag.
May I meet with the gentleman? Yesterday you told me it was difficult, and is it still difficult today?
Yeah, today is just too difficult.
I feel that Abu Salah has changed lately.
What's wrong with her?
No, I don't know. What happened?
Abu Saleh is mentally exhausted after his uncle opened a shop and hired a Lebanese designer just like him.
For the past two weeks, the store's sales have been declining.
This is the problem here in Qatar. No Qatari will open a shop unless another Qatari comes along and does the same project, opening the same shop right next to him. Can I go into his shop?
No, no, no, no, the designer Fadi is now thinking with them about a solution.
How are you now?
We're sitting like we ate poison.
If we keep like this, I expect this business won't even cover the rent of the shop.
A place far from them.
This means we'll be giving them a free rein.
"Thank you, how much is the discount?"
It's not possible, why not give an evening dress with every wedding dress for free?
Come on, let's go.
What's wrong? What happened? We're going to the store next to you today. They have an advertisement today: every wedding dress is on sale - two evening dresses for free and 20% off.
Okay, let's go, let's go.
And now wait for two weeks, they will put the same ad: Buy a wedding dress and two evening dresses for free with a 25% discount.
They are my misfortunes.
I think the same, if we leave them, they will destroy us.
Take care of yourself.
How are you?
Oh wow, a truth challenge!
Sure challenge.
Bravo, he deserves it, that thief. He doesn't want anyone to support him.
If she hears the news within a day or two, I'll close his shop.
Well done.
Bro, bro, come on, come on, that's it, bye.
What's the matter?
Saoud says the shop is unbearable and no one can sit in it, he says he doesn't know where this foul smell is coming from.
Smell has nothing to do with the air, impossible.
Its smell lingers in the place for at least six days.
One hundred percent sure.
He came at night.
He cuts the electric wire from the building.
Is Allah just?
Now, will you sign an undertaking, or shall we file a lawsuit and open a case?
Don't do anything for him.
**I'll get him out of this world.**
Oh! Abu Nasser has become very popular; no one comes to our neighborhood.
Abu Nasser, sugar, sugar, there's a customer coming, I'll talk to you later. If he wants.
He is lying on his bed, groaning.
"He insisted on fulfilling the psychological profile, and I was afraid to mention that the bank had been in contact and they needed the documents."
Debts accumulated on him because of his miserly uncle.
What happened to him this time?
Oh my, if they entered by mistake and saw Saad the designer, they would scream in his face and run away from him.
Asleep! Poor thing, he's never felt sleep, his eyes are open and he's staring at the ceiling.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
Saud is at the shop.
He's bewitched, I don't know what he's done to him.
When the women see him, they are afraid of him.
I don't know what made him do that to me!
He made me lose, he made me lose.
I have many debts.
I'm afraid they'll imprison me.
I have no evidence against him, so I can't sue him.
I don't know what I've done, I don't know what I've done.
Forget about him, he deserves it.
Oh brother, tell me what kind of magic you did to him, turning his designer into a monster, making women afraid when they see him.
"The truth came out."
The situation is not good! Oh! People, tell him that the shooting team needs you urgently.
Oh! Oh God, people, may God bless you, may He protect you. They say they need you urgently, urgently.
I swear to God, they're raising my blood pressure, they're killing me, they're paralyzing me. This isn't fair, Abu Abdullah.
How are you, my dear Ahmed? Don't be sad. You're suffering from heart diseases, but this is not your fault, man!
I swear to God, I called him several times, but he didn't answer. Those notifications are driving me crazy, driving me crazy.
You don't do anything, I'm responsible for everything!
Listen to me, I'll give you a penny.
Episode twenty-five, scene sixteen, Ahmed let's finish.
يعني لازم أوقف إطلاق النار لأن واحد زيادة ما يظهر. (Translation: That means I have to stop shooting because no one else is showing up.)
What is this production?
I don't have anything to do with this mess. Ugh! Abu Abdullah, why are you yelling at me like this?
Oh my life, if anyone tries to yell at you,
What happened, Abdullah?
He is too late and now he is in trouble.
Oh! Ahmed, I'm not worried about anyone, Darren.
Find someone who has dignity and can convince people that they can actually become a millionaire, and no one else can.
Bro, just send me the pictures and your order will be ready in half an hour.
Oh, Ala, not just anyone, I was just clarifying for him.
Alright, I'll shine a light on myself with two consciences instead of one.
You are responsible and as a production manager, you are accountable.
What are they going to install now?
They'll do everything, see the director's nerves and the world is chaotic, but they'll find a solution.
Where can I find him now?
Serious?
What did you hear the manager say?
I know one, hopefully you can help with it, God willing it will be suitable.
Saudi Bin Nakhlah !
Saud was! I remember him, he was Saud Buchanan.
Ah, when he was small they called him Saud Bu Shouk, and when he grew up a bit they called him Alib.
Why the cans?
That's very clever of you. Imagine, he walks around the streets collecting Pepsi bottles and sells them by the kilo.
Hey! My brother is rich and respected, not depressed.
The appropriate description, as I recall, is that his body is full and well-proportioned, neither tall nor fat.
Are you sure it's appropriate?
God willing, it will be good. But you have to do nice makeup for him, and I guarantee he will be suitable and has a good sense of humor too.
Come on, what are you waiting for, talk to him!
I don't have his phone number.
Taking Amir with me, I'll go there.
Where was Saud's house?
What's he talking about?
Hush, hush.
Saud Kanz.
We don't have anyone named Saud Kenaz in our neighborhood.
Ah, I'm sure it's from this neighborhood, but I forgot which house.
This house belongs to someone named Saud. He lives here with his mother.
Yeah, right.
But this isn't the sandcat.
This is Saud's laptop.
Sure, that's it, but it evolves over time because laptops are like cans.
He is tall, fat, a bit short, and slightly tanned.
"Come on, let's finish collecting the old laptops. Let's go, let's go, let's go! Oh, men!"
He went to the vegetable market to buy it for me. Am I a cow? Where's the other one?
I don't know, my son.
This is what you always wear.
I have another one, where is the other lineage, where is it?
For the holiday.
This is what I'm looking for.
Vicks and Axe are brands of oil.
Oh my son, iron the shirt a bit before you go out, it has a wrinkle.
But these days, I feel worse.
Mom, God guide you, since yesterday I've been insisting that you take him to the emergency room, but you refused.
Oh, Mom, they said Beyoncé is paying me.
Alhamdulillah, you're working now instead of being unemployed.
Okay, bye bye.
You're going to pull a stunt, you'll be shocked and you'll go too far.
You sit, slowly move, and the camera is with you, moving beside you.
Yes. Gavar! Yes.
Who gave you the laptop?
"Which one is Abu, this is a very famous actor, Abdullah Al-Lamaah."
"This is for you, my friend. How are you?"
How are you, slave?
Act your age, that's what you're supposed to do, act your age little by little in front of people.
Yeah, we're from the same neighborhood.
Calm, calm, calm, calm, silence, silence.
I love acting, I wish they'd give me a role where I get to slap someone, I wish they'd give me a role where I get to slap someone.
Oh brother.
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
Asthma Oh! Brother, may God heal him.
May God heal her.
Your life is just a cherry blossom.
Oh! My goodness, oh! My goodness.
Does he have my mother's asthma medication?
He's a director, not a doctor.
Mind your own business, listen to what he's saying, he's talking nonsense.
What's his mother's name?
Stick it in you, how are you thinking?
I heard what she said about you.
She said you were handsome, you should be more patient.
Give me, give him, give him, give him, give him, give him the half million so he can fix the tires of my flat car.
He gives him three million, he brings me dinner.
I was about to ask you why you're talking like that.
Because I'm awake and based on some people's requests.
I saw, my cousin, Mr. Ghafel, may God keep him for us, in our area, may God bless them, they didn't fall short.
Now excellent, he is suitable for the role.
Okay, I'll help you. I don't have feelings, right?
Did you buy this?
Your life is just a cherry blossom.
Yahl, take the man to the makeup room, apply makeup to him, and tell him that I will teach Salman and he will come to you in the outfit and inform you.
Come on, come on, come on, this is so nice.
Okay, okay.
Brother, leave the car with us until we finish shooting, I'll call you to pick it up.
No problem, but can someone give me a ride?
To lift you! It's okay, I'll ask our driver to lift you. Alright, thanks, brother. Thanks, thanks, wait.
Okay, talk to your friend, quickly, tell him.
Oh! People are calling Saud for the laptop from the makeup room.
Let him brush my teeth.
I have written it down in front of me.
Okay, shall we change it?
It means me!
I didn't expect that from you.
We're fighting, for what!
We're fighting for our rights.
Yes, let.
And you need to know who you're talking to, Abu Abdel Aziz.
Why did you divorce her? Oh! Brother!
Divorce her and that's it.
We don't marry off the daughter of a thief.
No need, what do you think?
He'll do it, but later. The most important thing is for him to get ready because he's going to go into the fitting room to change his clothes, and we're ready to shoot.
My teeth, the toothpaste is too minty.
Oh! All these people were filming this scene, it was postponed.
Why this?
I don't want tea. Oh! Brother, I'm bored and my stomach is bloated from tea. What's this? I've been waiting for an hour, how long do I have to keep waiting?
I can't see anything, that happens a lot.
May God give you health and strength.
They are fast.
Good health to you, may God protect you.
Convey my regards to your countrymen.
Tell them Abu Abdulaziz sends his regards.
Alright, go ahead %PW.
Yay, that was fun, wasn't it?
No one like you, they greet you and kiss your nose afterwards.
The first time someone kissed me on the nose.
Did he punch them in the nose?
Oh no.
"It's like an ice cream stick, it cuts my thumb. That was funny, that was funny."
I didn't laugh!
No traffic.
Can I be an actor?
Is something on your mind? What happened to your voice?
Son, son, I'm very sick, I'm waiting for you.
Come on, quickly.
May God bless you, Sheikh, may God bless you.
See it here or there by yourself, dad!
Hear me oh!
Okay, let's go.
I see a lot of appreciation.
What happened, oh my son!
Peace be upon you, what brings you here?
Give, give, give, give
And don't bother, if God wills it, you will be. Hey, Dr. Hassan, come here, come here.
Ah, oh! What happened, Dr. Hany?
Stay comfortable at work.
Don't worry.
She is the mother of all, if God wills it, she will be fine.
May God bless you, a warm greeting, may God bless you.
Shut up or get out of my sight.
Here my name is Abu Abdulaziz.
Call me, you there.
How are you, teacher?
May God protect you.
Yes, Your Highness.
Welcome, my brother!
God bless you.
With this ugly face
Go with him, Mr. Rashid!
"More blessed in the speech, I know nothing about you, tell me and show me what to do with it."
Hey! Brother, where can I find a doctor quickly, please?
Doctor, my mother is sick!
Take your turn, then wait for the next one.
Hear me oh.
Will you allow me, brother?
Come on! My child, quickly, I am sick.
You go to the hospital a lot, you take your mother every week. You haven't found anyone like them, they are good and agree to anything.
Unlike female citizens.
Don't forget the citizens.
Alright, so look for a bride in the hospital.
Love her.
Sorry! Bro, you're ignoring me.
Okay, try to be close to her, laugh with her, maintain eye contact, give her your number, and have good intentions.
There's nothing wrong.
I made a story.
Either you sit down or stand up. If you don't sit down, I'll call security so they can teach you a lesson.
No, I don't need anything.
Why, brother, you must drink.
My eye, my lord.
No, thank you.
Take it and leave the hospital.
The person talking to you is Fahad Al-Marzouk.
Getting married means getting married.
No, no, I need the car, the clothes, and also the car, I'll rent it from you.
So I can give you your money.
No, no, no, wait.
Let's go.
What a handsome man!
Welcome, welcome, you are most welcome.
The light of my eye got married yesterday.
I wish I had come.
You must be kidding me, she has a big and private party.
One is regular, and the other is diet.
Now you have no excuse.
What is this?
Mom, I promised my colleagues tomorrow at work.
You're taking this to them!
Yes, what's wrong with it?
Noura, come here!
What is this?
He takes this thing for granted.
Don't even think about taking it, you'll make everyone talk about you.
And he'll give you money, tomorrow he'll buy you something nice, and you'll like it.
Yeah, but I've already promised them now.
I also need to take it tomorrow.
No crowd, they're still open. Go change your clothes so we can get something that pleases people.
What's wrong? Let's go.
Therefore, it has a reasonable price and its quality is very good.
More than ordinary, not the sweetest thing!
Of course there are high-end chocolate layers, but I'm sorry, I thought you were looking for the right price.
This is way too expensive, why are you looking for the most expensive one?
This is unbelievable, look at this artistic masterpiece.
This is called royal chocolate.
The same chocolate you always buy.
Give me this.
Congratulations, and by the way, it comes with a warranty.
Welcome, welcome, we are delighted!
Come here, brother. Give us some of these chocolates, brother.
What's the point, man?
No, Saleh Abdul Qader, the one in accounting.
With God's blessing, he deserves it. Give me one more.
And let the coffee come to you quickly.
Auntie, did you go to their daughter's wedding?
Yes, my dear, I went to their wedding, it was embarrassing, disgusting. Believe me or not, sister!
Did you hear what your aunts were saying?
That's why I want to throw you a wedding like no other.
No time, you only have a month and a half.
Organize everything.
He just doesn't let me do anything.
You're not living in the community, you don't see how people put everything they have into their weddings.
Even you saw it yourself.
When you bought something beautiful, I saw how they praised you and your taste.
They told you it's amazing and really nice, didn't they?
True, but how much did we pay?
The money we paid for the chocolate can buy four candles for Eid.
Oh mother of so-and-so, may God guide you, there's no need for all this interference. Mother of so-and-so, praise be to God, knows how to handle herself and solve all matters. Just give her the money and let's be done with it.
This means they accept anything we choose.
Yeah, you're really funny.
What do you think of this theater?
But excellence costs a lot of money.
Why, why, the previous one was good!
And what's your opinion on this?
The first time someone thought of creating a theater in Qatar, it was like the computer mouse.
Excuse me for a minute.
Listen, don't talk about anything except the stage and arrangements. This is where all the women will sit who have nothing but gossip. Shut up.
The man is waiting for us.
We're going to the mouse theater.
A very strange phase indeed.
The latest model in 2011.
We've already chosen the mouse.
Sit here for me, all of this is for your eyes only.
So you need to choose, if it's Noah's Ark, you have to pay an extra twenty thousand, and if it's the rat, you'll pay one hundred and twenty-five thousand.
State your opinion and we're ready.
I'm not the first one to get married.
What have you done to yourself, getting married in the Comoros? That's how things are done in our country.
And we're just at the beginning yet.
Is the game over? Why are you putting the bride in the box?
Iron, paint, and carve the wood.
And the people are happy.
They are taking advantage and lying to us, in other words, they are crooks.
How are you now?
Annoyed and frustrated?
If you want to get married, then go ahead.
I call her mother and tell her that Saleh's condition is very serious.
He doesn't want to get married? He can't afford the wedding costs? That's fine with me. Do you want me to call her? I'm serious, I'll call her.
We received a flower collection from Netherlands.
In my opinion, if you put it on the tables at the wedding,
Are you sure it's your first time in Doha?
Widen the straits.
Put it on the bill.
How much does it increase by?
Seventy-two, okay then,
Oh, Samir, I really don't want to see this gathering in any bride.
You know people's talk.
Fine, they're also reserved.
Your salary is higher than mine.
A problem we can't handle is starting.
And God will make it easy for you! Oh! Saleh.
And come on, God guide you, you should have tried to make things work.
Praise be to God, I've decided to look for a bride in any Arab country.
They say that a wedding costs you only two thousand dollars and have fun.
God bless you, my dear.
God willing, his wedding will be next month.
Just tell me how many cards you want.
If the invitations are sufficient, that's great. The most important thing is that people know they are invited, for what, where, and when, and that's it.
All you care about is your own rights, you don't care what people will say.
People know the standard of marriage from invitations.
Tomorrow when they see these invitations, I know what the ladies will say.
Look at the grooms over there; if these are their invitations, they didn't see the invitations of so-and-so and so-and-so.
We didn't say anything like that, we order it online.
He has a tough cover, made of panda skin with a silver glitter.
No one can blame you, you can't stop me.
I'll be a juicy gossip for the women, they'll demand the drums, they'll demand the drums!
Calculate it for him, oh! Jeez! Man.
Such a shame about him, his family must be putting a lot of pressure on him.
Oh! You're carrying the world's money, bro.
What he said was, he even sold his car.
And he looks like he's twenty years older, this morning I saw him talking to himself.
Don't blame him, man! Poor guy, I don't know when we'll evolve.
Close the door, please.
Sorry, oh! Brother.
Did you try to convince them to have a wedding on your budget?
According to my budget?
Why, am I sitting alone?
The problem our society suffers from is the display and demonstration of illness.
One arrogant person's illness is another's cure.
If you want to live in it.
The mother-in-law once hinted to the bride.
I was struck by her words (editions).
Put your trust in God.
By the way, tell me, the explanation: This
How did you get married?
I don't want to get married, I'm not crazy.
Even if you decide, my brother, to get married.
I am thinking of marrying a foreigner or even an Arab.
It's the one who says it on your behalf!
We decided to get a DJ for the music.
But Mother Nasser hired a famous singer for her son's wedding.
He's a very famous singer, but I forgot his name.
Why are you so upset?
As if you didn't like what I was doing!
It's enough that he sold his car, and every Sunday one of his friends gives him a ride.
Previously, I entered the room and found him talking to himself.
Okay, now you've changed your mind.
Because my brother Saleh is tired, Mom is just done.
I had no idea about you or him.
I am no less than others.
Don't get us wrong.
Oh my God! Mom, please stop, my brother has spent all his money and borrowed from everyone.
Oh God, be quiet.
My mother has a new demand for the wedding, and my brother said he doesn't have money, so she started screaming at him, and he said he will call off the wedding, he doesn't want to get married.
Where is she now?
She's inside, and they're giving her first aid.
I think it's better if you go to the hospital right away.
Shame on you!
Rest, my sister.
The doctor told you to be quiet, and he gave you an injection to make you sleep.
How can I rest while he wants to tell us a story about good and evil?
I told him to bring Abdullah Ruischad with them, and he said he didn't have any money.
I feel like your mother.
Watch out for her.
Go to her, go to her and kiss her head.
And say that we'll do what you want.
I want to meet Abdullah Roishd.
Bu Yusuf is kind; I don't think he will refuse to help me.
It's not fair, I couldn't find anyone but Abu Yusuf.
What's wrong with her!
Dry bread! Saleh?
But the minister kept him because he was old and happy besides being organized and honest.
In my opinion, if you say the same thing you told him, there's a good chance their hearts will stop.
Yes, I did.
It's not right to ask Abu Youssef for money, especially from the ministry's funds, during this financial crisis you're facing.
"And none knows them except Allah. Do you know that Allah knows what is in the heavens?"
And if the auditors come and ask him about the money,
Sure, there might be a problem.
No one knows, not even him, what to do about him.
It's up to you. You're the man in his office, and you're supposed to be the one in charge if anything happens to him.
Stealing in my final days!
Come on, it's called theft.
At the first roundabout.
In, in a white box wrapped with a blue ribbon and a circle with a picture of a dove's wing on it, get it, get it.
Oh Uncle Abu Youssef, it's me, if I didn't have difficulties,
With love and affection.
They call me Abu Yusuf.
And I came in my final days.
Corrupt me, Thursday!
Salih, Salih.
Alright, listen to what I'm saying. If it were anyone else, they would have been slapped or something bad would have happened to them! Oh! Oh! Oh! Khalid.
Salih, Salih.
All the methods I've tried are useless, Uncle Abu Youssef. I'm drowning.
I can't change my mind about the marriage.
And you don't know them all bald.
Network?
No, no, the second one, the horror disc, the horror disc.
In the drawer, in the drawer.
Uncle Abu Youssef, the stairs are full of discs, what do you want?
Bro, what's going on? This picture is of a guy who looks terrified with another man. What happened?
We've already booked two rooms for hair and makeup, just for us.
And he will be there from tomorrow.
We brought Abdullah to his senses and separated him from the group.
You'll see, dear.
No, I won't tell you.
It's the season for that.
We are the first people in the world to use it.
Yummy, yummy.
Goodbye.
There is no caller except Allah.
My son, don't forget to read the book of Al-Mu'awwidhat when you enter the dance hall.
The children who are with the women have eyes.
Brother, I've already told you it's awesome.
The best perfume you have, may God preserve you, I don't want to envy you.
Umm, the police are knocking on the door.
I was wrong to obey you, O God.
It's not fair, today is my wedding day.
The presence seemed.
And now you're solved, you become a prisoner, oh my God.
Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf!
It's bedtime.
But that's not fair if that happens!
The company offered a three million contract, two million for materials only.
Wrote a memo to the minister.
We know there is corruption, but it doesn't reach this extent.
As if you don't live in this world.
"Who, sir, is the minister that they are talking about?"
And why didn't our manager object? They say he was with him!
I don't know about him, truly I don't know.
Where are the crazy people?
Right has become wrong and wrong has become right!
Oh! Saad, I'm sure the minister fired him, oh! People, what's happening in the world?
Just leave!
What next?
It belongs to the minister's sister.
That girl is talking to the minister.
What a wonderful world (eloquence).
What's wrong with you men, don't you know who she is?
This new employee that the minister hired to replace the unfortunate Uthman.
Secret, secret, secret.
What do you want me to do, Saleh? Oh God, oh God! Oh God, oh God! Oh!
You're crazy!
"Curse him, men!"
We have knowledge, we want to live.
Let's live
What's happening?
Haniya is standing next to the elevator.
This is the reward for loyalty and honesty, O righteous brothers.
I hope there's something we can do for you. Oh! My brother.
Praise be to God, praise be to God for everything.
What's wrong? Oh! Saleh?
It's one of the strange things we see in this world.
We see things that are unbelievable.
I'm at your service.
I'll stop by the grocery store after work to get you some vegetables for the salad.
"I'll try my best, okay. Bye."
Who lets my sister into the house?
It's a very old rule, you laugh and talk to him, who is this?
This is a colleague of mine from university. What's wrong with him giving me a ride home? It's fine.
Oh my God, I can't believe it, why does he look just like his old self!
What do you say?
Don't you hear what we're saying?
You're antique.
An old and new god of right and wrong!
Right is right and wrong is wrong.
Life has evolved, and we are living in the age of technology.
International variables have outpaced global coordination, and no one can keep up.
The more I live, the more I see.
Don't blame me, oh! Manira, it's against my interests to be nervous and angry.
This is one of the things he sees in his day.
Her word is "Sorry."
Life doesn't work the right way.
Don't be sad, he'll come back and have lunch.
Let sleep combat stress.
Pride isn't angry at you.
Is pride a sin?
No, he's not angry, go wash your face and eat lunch.
All right, dear.
I'm very excited to meet you on my first day of work.
Sharifa Sharifa.
Sure, sure.
I'm sure you don't need anyone to remind you of the work principles.
But at the same time, it's very important.
To recall some of the values and principles that works uphold.
For the public.
This is what should be your honor.
We all have to.
Lute is very important for your dignity.
To be thieves
Thank you, thank you all.
And what else do I want to say?
I quit on my first day of work.
One of you is an employee.
Who is the truthful, sincere, and loyal one, and who are the ones who do these bad things?
Only a doubt
There is a dedicated employee.
So we can take the necessary legal action against him in our ministry.
No, it will be the way you want it to be.
Praise be to God, we're all thieves.
"Oh, how I've been waiting, I'll say it in front of my friends and behind their backs."
Where is Khalid?
Yes, Your Highness.
Khaled, you praised me a lot, may God bless you.
"Well done, your
Oh! You choose this. Explanation: This requires...
May you be well.
Why did you let the devil play with your mind?
I thank God it was only about honesty.
Mom, why is Dad in prison?
Shut up, you girl!
No, no, I won't do it again.
Mom, why is my father in prison?
Enough.
It means he became honest.
It's very sad to say that your father is truthful.
This is his cloak!
You're all exposed.
What do people see?
And I hope you're not looking for a job, no one will hire you like this.
In a respectable unit, do you cover your body and charms?
She's covering her chest, she's wearing linen here, and she's choking herself.
I'm sick of it, boy.
She wore a tight top and pants that revealed her midriff above her navel.
She's just being stubborn, she doesn't want to do what's right.
I'm telling you!
You only blame yourself.
I'm asking for the hand of your daughter Sarah for our son Rashid.
One of us is still looking for suitable men for his daughter these days.
Let me tell you, Rashid, my son.
One is enough.
He has no willpower.
It is fermented for 24 hours.
Drunk, squeezed, and sober all day.
And don't ask about the seasoning.
He is a good teacher.
And let me say, he's a hypocrite.
How's the theft?
This is what I expect from you and how are the medications?
It's clear that it's over. I'll give you five riyals if you find his pupil and make a competition out of it.
By the way, oh! Abu Sara, let's go ask for her hand.
You're learning to walk and sit.
We know she comes from a noble family.
Oh my son, oh son, this is how the world goes round, oh my son.
I'm drunk.
I can't walk.
Alive, come.
Okay, bye.
Okay, tell your father to come and pick it up.
Why do I need to call him?
So he can come and get you.
Where is he?
See, there he is, hiding in the bush with his little friend.
Indeed, your father walks straight, enjoying his time.
Oh, my darling daughter Mona!
Majid! His name was Abdulaziz.
Yeah, right.
You confuse me, my daughter.
And you know that the establishment of the State of Palestine, with its capital in Jenin, was in 2090, after signing the comprehensive peace agreement with the State of Israel.
And Israel continues to practice terrorism, pressure, and siege on it.
Finally, the claims raised by the Israelis and their Arab friends against the Palestinians.
They smuggle plastic knives through the tunnels.
The second articulation, the clause and the thousand, which indicates the Palestinian nationalism that they divide their loyalty daily.
Let's go now to the crucial meeting.
Oh cheap lord,
When Israel agrees to establish the State of Palestine,
Oh! Men, what are you saying, oh! Men? You're ruining our reputation, mind your own business!
Please!
Forgive me, Mr. Tiger, forgive me, Mr. President.
Can you give me a chance to speak?
Complete the interaction with the Comprehensive International Agreement.
What is the Israeli delegate saying?
Spin on a fixed object, like a stone or a plastic peg.
Oh! Man, even our homes.
What do you call it, people of the Gulf?
In Palestine, everything is made of wood.
American companies under the agreement settle for us wooden cars.
All our houses have doors made of thermally treated wood.
"We have conversations."
Don't change the subject.
Mr. President,
This is a very crucial point, and I wish to cast my vote on this matter because nail growth is a violation of the agreement.
If agreed, raise your hand.
I just had a very strange dream.
So you can control the students.
I got tired of explaining it.
This is the fourth school you'll start working on tomorrow.
Because I asserted my strong personality as a teacher from the beginning.
The boys follow him and tear his clothes, and he does nothing.
How many times have I told you without Jotta.
My boss told me.
Rashid is good and we don't want to expel him.
The kids throw chalk at him.
And they taught him in front of everyone.
They said this teacher is reluctant and ruins everything.
Should I tell him the ketchup story?
Come on, Mary.
What's the deal with ketchup? This is something new, no one told me!
They poured a whole bottle of ketchup on the chair.
He gets himself into trouble and then cries.
He had no idea.
But when he saw the kids laughing at him in the schoolyard.
Enough.
By the way, your new boss whom you'll start working with tomorrow contacted me.
Alright, there's nothing wrong, we'll give him a chance.
Because I'm waiting to tell you.
Kindness and weakness have gone with age.
Hey! My cousin! Hey! Abdullah!
You see Rashid again.
And even remind you of the important educational quote, explanation: This response provides
You are a graduate and I am a graduate.
And we all know the quote,
The teacher is a first-grade boy.
You see the strong young man.
And if anyone commits a mistake,
He's in a bind.
When you start talking, he said to him, just be quiet.
I'll see what I can say to him.
Who among you mocked me and said, "Just be quiet"? Who?
You're the one who told me to just shut up!
No, not me.
You, the one next to you!
Revolt is the spirit of the teacher.
And tell him that Mr. Rashid fired me.
I don't want to see your face here, hear me!
What do you think of my anxiety?
It's not just the first day, you need to be here all year round.
Beware of the consequences.
If I hear someone's voice
While I am explaining or speaking.
Know what?
So what does that mean, what's the definition of a woman?
Tense
Do you hear what I'm saying?
I heard him, too.
Get out of the class.
Go to the manager.
Take your stuff and get out now!
Take your stuff.
It's none of my business.
It's clear he's still looking for him.
Doctor, we haven't seen this person.
By the way, ice cream with milk is really sweet if it has strawberries inside.
Dear Abdurrahman.
Everyone makes mistakes, and that's human.
I ask you, my son.
But the most important thing is that your father doesn't find out about it!
I don't want it, I want chocolate in my bag.
Okay, where is your bag? Where is your bag? Where is your bag?
In class.
I'm at your service.
You are saying that he is happy with you.
You can't tell the difference between a rich kid and a poor kid.
Oh my disaster, does the disaster look green or red?
Come on, where are you going?
In the toilet.
Are you still in the bathroom?
Knock on the door quickly and tell him that the first class started half an hour ago, quickly.
I was before all of them, one juice and one chips.
I left him before anyone else, he's precious to me. My friend Abdulrahman, and by the way, he's very healthy.
Okay, now go to Saud and get the PlayStation CD from him.
So, what can we learn from this story?
That man: **That man**
He should have had morals.
This is my PlayStation charger, and he told me to also bring the entire PlayStation at once.
Okay, do you want something else, brother Abdurrahman, brother?
Okay, now.
We learn from the story.
You all know I'm leaving this week because I've been accepted to graduate school.
So, I thought I should submit the event file before I travel.
How can I pick you up in the afternoon? Abdulrahman told me, and I don't know where he wants to go, but he didn't tell me when!
Since his father came back and didn't say anything, God bless you, guarantor and keeper.
Let's say I didn't take it this afternoon, and he got upset and told his friends, "No, no, no, this is a disaster, no, no."
Oh, my friend Abdel Rahman.
God helps you.
What is this woman doing?
Is it good, is it good like this?
Today, oh! Kids, we're going to have a new lesson in science.
Peace be upon you too.
Thank you.
I need water.
Whatever you ask, whatever you ask for, I am at your service.
Doctor, doctor. How do you ask a doctor for water?
Is there a doctor who can get water for a student? Are you serving him like that? This won't be tolerated, I'll write it in the report.
And how provoking you are to me.
Don't raise your voice or disobey me, did you hear me or not?
How much?
Fine, how many cars is this for?
From four to five cars.
Excellent, this is excellent, sweet, excellent.
What is he doing?
As you can see, he's creating a parking spot in front of us at the expense of our comfort.
"What remains to me are the days of Abu Nasser."
Abu Nasser is very tall.
He studies abroad.
Okay, you broke the table.
Don't be afraid, brother.
Why this?
Are you different?
Change your behavior towards me.
Me or you?
We didn't say anything, yo! Bro.
What is this?
Listen, leave everything as it is, it's better for you.
It's not a threat, oh! Brother?
So it's not necessary and I want to rest from you?
What do you say?
Instead?
It seems you want to.
You want this, by any means necessary.
Faster, faster.
Is this beautiful?
Not like he wants, that's not right!
He who possesses the state of being bare (term).
We come to Uncle Nayef to discuss, not to vote.
Who is Rashid to do what he wants with the neighborhood?
Did you give me a chance to speak?
People, be quiet and let's hear what Uncle Abu Naif has to say.
Now this worthless scoundrel is playing with your nerves!
Leave it to me.
If I didn't slap him in the face, he wouldn't stick to the headscarf he's wearing.
The game is played by its players (proverb).
What's up?
%Pw iiee iiee.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
Oh, do you know that he now has a jewelry store!
That's why I see him wearing all these rings and chains here.
God compensates us.
Just walk, are you going to sit in this heat?
He couldn't believe that the naive and poor Rashid had become like this.
Became the vice president of the Global Education Center.
Let him tell you, let him teach you. You are a teacher and he is a teacher, but look where he is now and where you are now.
There's nothing.
No problem, Abdullah.
I'm telling you what the secret is.
Doctor, doctor.
Doctor, I didn't do anything!
Doctor, do you know who this is?
Oh, dear, I know who this is.
First of all, I tell you, we don't have good luck like this.
I'm looking for a job! It's funny, really funny.
Brother, the job is in my pocket.
Thank you for everything you've done. Thank you, thank you.
Convey my regards to him.
Mom will take you there. Greetings. May God protect you, she will tell him that she will deliver the greetings.
Okay, goodbye dear, may God protect you.
What else do you want, your brother is going to be a minister, but believe it, boy!
Oh! We work, we work at a high level.
Oh my son, if you work with him, won't they say anything?
He handed it to you as he received it.
This thing is okay, right?
Perfect! This is fully automatic and without a doubt.
Oh my love, please let my dream come true.
Before your dream, my dream.
He is building a tower between the Corniche towers.
Come on, what are you waiting for!
Good health to you, good health to you, good health to you.
You can do it, man! Abu Saleh.
It seems that your friend is upset.
Oh, that's not how it looks! Oh, brother!
You can do it, man! Abu Saleh.
"Qatabit Shatrah: Soft, faced, took the mobile, and gave it to Abo Saleh."
Look, there's something behind this, and I'm a million percent sure that Abu Sultan has something against him.
His relationship with Abu Saleh wasn't good.
No, Sultan wouldn't do that unless he's planning to do something else.
Really, to this extent?
Aww, he opens the car door for him!
Finally, he is working on opening the minister's car doors.
Hey! My son, don't break my heart, don't break my heart.
For your information, all the stories we hear in cafes happen in the countryside.
I just can't believe what I heard!
My mind is a blank, my mind is a blank.
I'm scared! Oh girl, the women are starting to talk about it and they don't mention Latuf, the complex's diwaniyah, she spreads rumors about me among the women. Oh girl.
"Brother, tell Sultan to speak up. I'm surprised by his silence."
Please, I know what I'm doing.
What's wrong with your dress?
Manair, I am sitting by the light of a quiet fire.
By opening the door for him, this is the beginning of the plan in my head.
I deserve to become a minister, not him.
Let me work, I have the plane.
Let them walk.
Yes, there's a plan.
I should have trusted myself from the beginning.
They told me we should make him a minister, as he was appointed two months before I was.
Because I'm very sure he's going to get fired from his job.
Magic can be undone.
What is this?
What's this now?
And as many events he attends, the photographer will take several pictures of him until his photo becomes very widespread in the newspaper.
And he kept sinking until he floated on his back.
Are you sure?
Just wait. Let me handle him and you'll see.
"On the head, Your Highness."
Oh, happy sheikh.
Alright, tell me,
Did you thank him for the sheep? By the way, the meat was very delicious.
The man is outside, go see him.
Don't be foolish, people want to give you respect and you want to humiliate yourself.
Minister, just come in, come in.
No, no, no, don't take my picture. But Your Excellency the Minister, just one photo, please.
Take also.
Wow! Brother, I really like your plan.
I'd like to take it for her.
Picture, picture, picture.
He is a minister; he has it too.
Alright, I say, wait a moment!
Go to the second-to-last page.
Do you see his big picture with the groom?
There is no god but God!
Yeah, he has a picture or two every day.
"He says he wants to go, go, go, but then, then, then, he says, says, says, no, no, no, and then, then, then, he says, says, says, yes, yes, yes, and then, then, then, he says, says, says, no, no, no, and then, then, then, enough, enough, enough."
You are full of love, but I don't know what's wrong with you.
Wherever you look, there he is (proverb).
They are jealous, they envy you. But only the fruitful tree is stoned (proverb).
Take me to the market!
Isn't he ready?
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Hello, peace be upon you, hello.
You're very famous.
Yes, your name is Abdulaziz Abdullah, right?
This is my husband.
How many times have I told you?
Three hundred and fifty.
For this famous person,
You're home today, what happened?
Leave me alone, I have a headache today, my head hurts, I feel pain all over my body, and my colon is getting worse.
I feel so good, truly I feel so good. It's been a month and I'm still spinning with him.
Let me rest today.
Hello, Umm Sultan.
Can you say something?
Oh! I just want to be held.
He started to like it.
"See for yourself what fame has done!"
I know. Thank God you're convinced.
From the heart,
Your minister is worried, he seems to be happy about this case.
I'll send you my brother Saad.
No, I didn't follow up on anything and I didn't read the newspapers, I don't know.
We are at your service, goodbye.
If God wanted the ant to perish, He would have given it wings.
"Peace be upon you, brother, don't you have a conference here in the hotel tonight?"
Zafah?
Is there anything going on, like a party, birthday, or wedding?
I don't know, but you can see the hotel behind.
Ah, there's a hotel behind you, right?
No problem, you can see me in the car and then go into the hotel and ask?
"Flee, hasten, hasten and seek refuge. Hasten and ask, hasten."
God helps everyone.
This minister is making us sleep and rest?
It means he didn't find a party, a wedding, or any trouble to get him drunk.
He took him to sixty thousand hotels and couldn't find anything for him. He has bad luck, just like his face.
Just shut up, okay?
I didn't find any birthday party invitation or anything.
Hurry, maybe you'll make it to the second half!
In every issue, he has a hundred pictures.
He doesn't sleep! He doesn't get tired. Oh! My brother.
Hey! Man, the newspaper editor says first we need to prepare his picture, and then I'll prepare the newspaper.
She said my children had a contest based on your husband's ministerial photo.
How many pictures of the minister are in the newspaper?
The winner gets a prize.
The story isn't like that. You have to come to the café and listen to the comments every day about his pictures in the newspaper. It's endless gossip.
Wow, its end is very near.
They say, if a butterfly comes near you, it means someone you love is going to die, because they are drawn to the light.
People are leaving you and greeting him.
He became one of the most famous people in the village.
Don't mention the subject and who is it?
How ugly your faces are in my presence.
God bless you and bless her.
She said that all of us got married except for Amal, who is the only one among us who didn't.
This is my fate.
It's not my fate to get married.
And We sent down water from the sky, and We brought forth...
God is sufficient for the future.
Saw these guys sitting here?
Yes, what's wrong with them?
Did you see the guy playing with his hair?
Is this a boy or a girl?
After my father died, he killed him.
I saw it, and it grew. What is it?
It's wrong to leave him to deal with the servant.
Go make me some tea.
I'm tired of talking to my mother. But she doesn't have just one, she has two servants.
I've told you a hundred times not to interfere; Khalid is my son, not yours.
You only talk about this topic, nothing else but Khalid, the servants, and the maids, only Khalid.
Mom, this isn't good. Khalid is with the maid 24/7 and doesn't want anyone else.
Get out. I want to rest, I want to sleep. How?
For God's sake, Saud, your brother, Khalid, has changed a lot.
Be patient, I won't tell my father about you.
Go, go, go, go, Khadija, what's wrong? What's wrong with Khadija?
Saoud says Khalid is wearing makeup and doing girl-like movements. What's going on? What's going on?
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God! Saud.
Khulood puts makeup on his face! Just a little bit of makeup. A boy saw it and played with it.
I've heard about a very small spot, and even that wasn't clear.
He is kind, handsome, and light-hearted.
Shout at Saud.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
The last time I asked you, Saad, what you wanted to be when you grow up, you didn't tell me. Now, tell me, when you grow up, what do you want to be?
"And you, my dear Khaloudi, my dear Saad is going to be an office worker, and what do you want to become?"
This year we're going to London, just like last year.
Yes, I gave the complainant in Bahrain.
He said he would bring along Susn, Khulud, and Fahd.
And tell Samoura to greet you.
I seek forgiveness from Allah.
Today, my father told me to choose.
Do you want me to build you the land overlooking the sea or the nearby land?
I said I don't want to choose.
I can live with you, my love, wherever we are.
Thank you, my love.
And you taught me how to fish?
Wow! Amal, I want to open my eyes and they tell me that you've graduated from university.
It doesn't seem to be a men's perfume.
I don't know, but it smells really weird.
Oh no, what's happened to me?
Your behavior has become kind.
I forgot you were a man.
And I hope you don't talk to people like that outside?
I can't believe it, Willie! Khalid!
Get out of my room, please.
How is this possible! خالد!
You disappointed me.
Come on, don't hurt my feelings, I'll tell Mom.
This is my son, and I know him well.
Oh, dear Khaldoun, my light, may you see all children with your kindness and feelings.
And when you only see someone who is kind and calm, you say this must be like me.
It's a sin for you, it's a sin for you to say such things about your brother.
Enough, it's not worth it.
Such a shame about him, he only wears very nice perfume. Now, what's the difference between the husband's perfume and the lover's perfume?
It's for you, don't say this in front of your father.
I have.
I'll show it to you, but be quiet, so Mohammed doesn't notice anything.
And how do these children gather these children?
It's a shame that a beautiful woman does this!
Don't look at it for too long, don't look at it for too long!
My fear is that he felt something was connected to him.
Make yourself comfortable.
I know you've seen the Bluetooth that's been going around lately.
I'm waiting for Saad, let him come.
How are you, Saad?
God bless you.
We were waiting for you, we didn't play table tennis.
Yes, why?
Would you like something to drink?
I'll see him now sleeping here in your apartment for two days!
Because of the Bluetooth story.
Yes, his older brother threatened him.
He is afraid of him.
Don't try, I told you not to try.
"God is my witness, and He is sufficient. Oh, boy, me! Goodness gracious!"
Booked before
I'll go and distance myself. How can I face people? I can't!
What should I say to you?
I speak with him.
Oh, these kids only bring trouble.
This is the end, mother.
Mention when Khalid was young,
Sure, this will be the result.
Enough, please leave.
The truth always hurts.
The jar was broken.
I can't live in Doha.
I can't face people.
My mobile has been off for a while.
And you accuse me, oh! Hopes?
You're a girl and you spend all day at home.
How do I say, as a man, that I meet people outside every day?
The topic is difficult, yes! Hopes.
I can't live with my head, my day, my life always down.
He feels that something is not right in the house and that there is a change.
How long has my father been absent from events held at home?
Sometimes I blame the father, and sometimes I don't.
I don't blame him, oh! Rather, I admire his dedication and loyalty to his work, so that we can live with dignity among people.
Even I blame him.
When he leaves the house, the responsibility of the children falls on the mother.
We don't want to open up the past right now.
O enemy of God, does he know or not know?
But I'm ready for
Turn on his Bluetooth.
I just won't give it to him.
I don't want to see the shock in my parents' eyes.
Eggplant on the head
Whatever, Amal.
He knows how to throw at us.
It's better to know from a second person.
Alas, our home has come to this.
Because a dirty bomb named Khulood exploded in her.
And the customs and traditions.
You see them getting angry, getting angry, getting angry, getting angry.
They stop their ears from him.
And they don't want to hear it.
Yes, I listen only to his voice.
What is dirtiness and strangeness?
They are ungrateful for every good deed.
What's on your mind?
She suddenly decided to study abroad.
We can say only that God will facilitate for you, my son.
God helps you.
The people of the return brought the gift, not the people of the journey.
Your words are correct.
Yay law.
Every law has its exceptions.
Come on, hurry up and join us.
Did he see her, my daughter?
I don't hear anything.
Abu Saad!
Abu Saad.
Abu Saad, what's wrong with you?
Dad, what's wrong, Dad?
Come on!
Don't be sad.
You are a wonderful person.
And how many men would want to marry you.
I didn't divorce you because of something in you.
I divorced you.
Because it's impossible.
I accept that he be my children's uncle.
One like me is like your brother.
So beautiful, my darling.
They are here every day.
Before you never come.
I was hiding underground.
We were underground the day before yesterday.
This is a very strong word, can you handle a word like this?
You'll get a thousand and two hundred, you'll make a lot of money!
Say, "With God's will."
Secret, secret.
You've only been here for seven months. Stop crying and hurry up, let's go home.
"How ugly and shameful! Every time he takes me to so-and-so's house, he asks the driver, 'How much do they pay you?' Nothing satisfies him, and today he's asking for a raise."
The driver is insulting you.
And it came before seven months.
You bother me, my son, you bother me.
Send it to him, so we can get rid of it.
Give it back and get another one!
"Tell your son, he doesn't know what lies behind this word! He doesn't know how much this time, this money, will cost him."
And driving training. Let's get it over with!
The first time I came here to Lynn's place was six months ago.
Okay, later I'll tell you something new about you.
Petrol is now $125 a barrel; the kilo that used to cost half a riyal might now cost five riyals. Everything is becoming expensive, leader.
Open your mind and listen to what happened to me?
Who gave you the authority to do this?
Seven hundred you gave me.
You're still new, very new. I came six months ago, and this 8000 salary is a lot.
I need money.
Those drivers you were talking about are experienced, very experienced, you're new.
This seven hundred has now become eight hundred.
Walk!
I'll give you only 100 riyals.
There's no use in the three hundred.
Is what I told you correct?
No, no screen. I tire myself out when I escape.
No, I'm scared. What should I do?
Who escaped from his shepherds?
Why are you afraid?
The reason behind the sponsors supporting these people
He pays them between six hundred and seven hundred in salary. Do you know how much they make?
How much do you earn?
So, why are you afraid?
I'm not afraid.
. . . God . . . is enough . . .
I woke Nasser up and told him to go see it.
No one was.
And he even stole the phone that I bought for him.
What did you do?
What I did!
Do everything they can, take his passport, and put it with them.
You go, oh! My brother, you're excused.
We're looking for him everywhere.
That is the problem, that is the problem.
And after all this, they escape.
They put us in a bind and hurt us.
I told you to return it.
But what do you think I'm going to leave it?
I'll find him no matter what.
He will return, which means he will come back.
For me, I'd rather pay for his ticket and send him back home than have him keep the money here.
I put it here, I wish I could find it.
Go inside now, no one is buying now.
At the beginning of the game, you seemed nervous, as I noticed.
But why are you afraid? We were afraid our team wouldn't score goals.
Okay, if it's not three, then it's ten, twelve, fifteen.
You made me feel before the match that you were afraid, you were scared of the opposing team.
I'm not afraid of the opponent, I'm afraid of our team. And I'm afraid they'll score more than three.
This is our team's level, I know that. I'm talking about our team's level.
This is a lot of trust from you.
The second team has nothing.
Wow! The Falcons just scored a goal, you striker and with the first goal.
Where are you going?
I'm going home.
Do you have a car?
Join us, and I'll give you a hand.
Thanks, dude.
You are a thief, but you don't know how to steal properly!
Your glorious match has just started and the league has just begun.
Did you hear what he said?
Qal, 'This is a big problem.'
Oh Hamad, bring the tea!
Now my friend is coming to pick me up to go to the stadium, quickly.
Take it, oh! My friend Sajid.
Take that, you bastard! Boss.
What has he done to himself?
Yes, he is Indian.
Yeah, oh! Man, he's football crazy.
Don't talk smack about my team, the Foxes.
"Bikspo, bikspo." Explanation
Come on! Sajid, come on! Sajid, hurry up, hurry up, the match is starting, hurry up. Bring water with you, the fox is playing today.
Dear viewer, we have with us one of the most famous fans of the Foxes club, nicknamed **Thaaloub**.
They say you beat them because they weren't complete.
What they say, what they say is not true.
What's missing? Every team has dozens of players.
Whether you're one or two, it doesn't change anything.
This fox is very clever.
This is the best fan we have.
Alright, on the occasion of the win, oh! Fox, a final word you'd like to say to the foxes.
All the words stop.
When they say the name of the prey.
Her name is high in the sky.
This fan is beautiful.
"Curse me, O brother!"
You can find him as enthusiastic as this.
Yay! Sweet.
Oh uncle, where's the Indian guy who cheers for the football?
How long has it been since I've seen him?
Oh! He's become a big star now, he won't come here.
I saw the man a few days ago and didn't recognize him. He was sitting in a coffee shop in the lagoon area, it's called Starbucks or something like that.
I remember this boy, he came and sat with us at the café and didn't have money for a cup of tea.
Give the boy twenty riyals as a tip in front of me.
Why did he leave it like this?
Hey! [Hey guys], he sits with the elders in the club, they help him and do everything he wants.
Can you say something in fox?
What's up, man?
My uncle says: Whether I go or come.
I don't know why you support such a bad and weak club.
This fox team is my heart.
When you open my heart
He found him catching foxes and liked him a lot.
I haven't heard the poem "Your Highness" that he wrote about governance.
When we used to meet them.
Oh wow! A fox improvises, improvises this poem, improvises, improvises.
My uncle. Oh, weepy, who knows my secret.
My soul aches.
I never sleep at night.
Know that I am Neville Fox Van Clip.
You can't say the winner's name, so I can get the scoop.
We will have a press conference, God willing.
Who spends.
The fox is well-known, this fan who was honored today by the Fox Club's management in a kind, rare, and amazing initiative.
Really!
Congratulations, fox, on this sweet honor and this wonderful gift, of course.
What do you see? Is it a pen or a watch?
This parent, by God.
It's a sign.
I tell you, this is it.
We must inform the police.
Don't go anywhere!
The whole audience, all of it, the entire audience.
No, no, no! Oh, it's not him, it's just his similar appearance.
I'm telling you, that's not him.
I'm late.
I don't know when the matches are, oh! Brother.
Now how are we going to catch him?
We just have to wait until the FX team plays their next match.
Hani is here, Hani is here, I saw him.
Okay, let's follow him.
Hey! Brother, it's already late.
Here, here, here, here. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
The truth is behind him, the truth is behind him, the truth is behind him, the truth is behind him.
The problem we're not sure if this is it or not?
I say to you, behold! Father, this is it.
I speak the truth, and the wisdom is that we go to them and ask them, saying, "Your driver, where is he from? And where is he going? And when will he arrive?"
"You always complicate things."
We tell him about it, I'm sure of it.
Earth, God protect it. Yes, it is mine.
Yes, it's registered in my name, yes.
And the second earth that is facing it.
"Your father, Abu Abdulrahman Al-Subji, sends his regards to you, may God bless him, may God bless him, may God bless him."
No, no, God bless you, but I think we made a mistake. Oh, my son! We were looking for a friend and we thought you were him.
Go ahead, sir, may God bless you. This is the correct meaning of the original phrase in its context.
Good health to you, good health to you, good health to you, your highness, good health to you.
No, no. God bless you. Sorry, sorry, and thank you, thank you.
Okay, no problem, I'm here to help. Bye, God bless you, bye-bye.
And you say you're sure!
I have no idea what your father will say! I'm so worried.
What did you do? Oh! Walid.
When, when, when I was, I was walking and my handle was stuck in it.
And try to solve the problem now!
Go to your room, go.
Oh God, let nothing good happen.
Oh God, let nothing good happen.
Now try to make your father understand this matter!
Will my father find out?
It broke into a million pieces.
Okay, Mom, let's buy something like that as soon as possible.
Before my father came.
Yes, yes! Mother.
You know your father, when he gets angry, he goes crazy.
Go to your room and don't come out.
He didn't do anything.
He hit the vase with his bag and made it fall and break.
Mom, I'm worried about him.
I don't know where it is.
No, no, no, no, his father is crazy.
Why are you doing this in the street, Oh! Girl.
You've confused him and scared him, do you want the boy to faint?
Can you say something, my daughter?
Where do you think the boy went?
Okay, if he's coming, I'll call you.
Oh God, let nothing good happen.
Auntie, I know where Waleed is.
Come with me, and I'll take you to the place where it is.
Let's go. God willing.
He is here.
Oh no, I don't want to go home.
I'll be in your place.
I didn't see the vase.
I swear to God, I don't know.
This is how your father, may God guide him, scares you.
Oh, my child, come with me.
My child, don't be afraid as long as I'm in the house; just do your thing.
I have the solution. Explanation: Qatari.
We didn't say anything, yeah! Abu Walid.
O Abu Waleed, O father of Waleed
This time, I'll forgive him for your sake.
What did you find in the house?
Where is he? Where did he go?
Where is he? Where?
Oh my child, my son, your father won't do anything to you.
Are you sure, Dad?
Oh, my child, oh.
Are you leaving it here? I'm afraid one of the kids will bump into it and break it.
I asked him and he told me that I need to get him one like the one you got me that Waleed broke.
هذا ترجمة النص المقدم إلى الإنجليزية: **He wants the exact same thing. I go and find this option only, the last one in the shop. He's so lucky. Where?**
In the room, he studies.
Okay, pay attention to the work.
Just this game and that's it, I'll stop.
Sweet!
Okay, let's study!
Dad, this game is helping us study.
Oh father, don't tell my uncle.
Oh father, don't tell my friend, oh father, this is the last time I swear.
Let's talk.
And you, in particular. You insulted me, your friend at the café?
I'll tell my friend about you if you don't listen!
Okay, I'll call. This phone is in my pocket if you study well.
Daughter, why don't you become a doctor?
God guide you, mother.
He scares him to death so he can pick on him all the time.
How lucky the boy is.
My patience is wearing thin.
Mother, where are my things? I don't see them with you today.
And you go with her.
I have a sister who is not convinced by abayas.
Oh oh! My daughter, I didn't tell you the story of Manira and her son Naif.
Her son is the age of Waleed. May God bless him.
And the same height.
Tomorrow she would say she didn't know what to do with her son.
She wants to take him to the hospital, but her husband, Youssef, doesn't.
I found out about the story yesterday.
He argued with her and shouted at her.
He says, "Why didn't you tell me?"
This is a psychological condition.
This is against the boy's will.
He needs to take his son and put him in the middle of the garden.
And then he told him to do it again and shit in your bed.
Much talk about nothing (proverb).
What did you say, oh! Um Mona?
I was telling her, "Come on, come on."
Eat and enjoy.
Oh no!
Mom, Mom.
It's good that your father doesn't know about you.
They will kill you slowly, second by second.
Okay, go to the bathroom and take a shower before your father wakes up and you're in trouble.
I don't want to hear what you have to say.
Alas for them.
Their hearts are willing, but they are not able.
I'm afraid something might happen to my children.
I have to take them to their uncle to discipline them.
I'm nervous.
They didn't have a failure, they had a success.
Why are you taking them to their uncle?
Nasir got forty-eight out of fifty.
Why don't they take fifty on fifty?
There their uncle warned them.
And as for me, I agree with the prevailing opinion.
Forget the feelings.
And he must punish them.
Okay, I'll get it, I'll get it.
This is it, this is it.
Fifty out of fifty.
We spent time assuring them that he was our son.
Why don't you get fifty out of fifty?
Shut up, shut up, shut up. I warned you, but you don't listen to me.
You're not listening to what I'm saying.
Shame on you, boy!
Hit him more, let me punish him.
I'm so angry! My uncle put it there.
So next time, when you review, review properly, review again, review!
Okay, enough.
Do you know what I'm going to do?
Your stomach makes you jump up and down, and you'll be like falafel.
Be careful when going to public places with your family.
He creates misunderstandings for us.
Doctor, Waleed is bleeding to death.
Do you understand me?
This is an excellent sign.
It's strange that you're sitting and crying.
You're supposed to be happy.
Hey! My son, they're all gone, even the buses are gone. You're just sitting there waiting for someone to come and pick you up.
At the school entrance, which means he is waiting for the bus. The bus arrived and the children got off.
Did you hear about the boy who committed suicide today?
They gave him his certificate.
His father threatened him if he didn't get full marks.
Walid, Walid. Come back, boy. Come on! Come back, Walid.
Welcome, welcome, it's good to have you with us in our new episode of our program "Without Borders."
Oil makes up more than thirty-five percent of the total and various energy sources.
Although the rest are turning to natural gas, coal, and hydroelectric power.
Therefore, oil is considered the primary source of energy in the world.
The Gulf countries and Iran alone have 867 billion barrels.
Iran follows with twelve percent, then Iraq with ten percent, and Kuwait and the UAE with nine percent.
Each of them will then come to Venezuela with seven percent.
And then Russia with five percent.
The Gulf countries and Iran account for two-thirds of the world's reserves.
Prices have never been this high and have somehow exceeded $109 for the first time in history.
In this episode, we try to understand the many complexities surrounding oil.
And the problems facing oil-exporting countries.
Despite its prices soaring dramatically
and the difficulties faced by citizens and residents in these countries
Due to inflation and unprecedented rise.
What appears after that on the screen or they can write to us through our website "www.aljazeera.net"
Because today the market is the main factor.
And those not from the producing countries.
The day that determines the price is market strength.
Not just OPEC
Surely supply and demand play a part. Explanation: This response provides
But the second factors are
Other factors skewed political tensions.
In the world
Real estate market
And the stock market and others.
Speculation drove prices up.
"Commodities" like oil, for example
And tomorrow, God willing, $1000 will arrive.
Oil in 2004 increased from $44.
And today we saw even the prices of gasoline.
He changes from day to day.
Oil prices fell below $90.
And increased in the second quarter.
Especially with the return of spring, secondly because most of the world's filters are under maintenance.
Always, for the second quarter.
Seasonal demand for oil is declining.
In winter, it drops below ninety.
All of them indicate that speculation has a strong influence and control over the market now.
Things have changed a lot since we used to go to the traditional market in the past.
The market was influenced by supply and demand.
Supply and demand by seasons
Today, we see that economic growth is
Today or yesterday, General Fallon, the leader of the Central Command in Afghanistan and Iraq, resigned.
And his resignation sparked strong reactions due to its connection to what is called the expected American war.
Political or Geopolitical Effects
Whether negatively or positively, it could impact the oil market swiftly.
The effect is certain, and it is coming.
Even speculators are affected by politics.
Those who can confirm, he says, some tell you that the American war on Iran is coming soon.
What's going to happen to the market? The market will be optimistic in a way.
This question, Madam Speaker, now lies in what is the White House.
And this matter brought tension to the region.
This is the mystery.
But maybe Fallon saw this situation.
He has a quick glimpse of the oil market.
Today we proved, with numbers, that there is no shortage.
Let me give you an example: in the past seven weeks.
In the United States of America, their oil reserves have increased to more than half in the past five years.
Today, no, I mean...
It's not just for the upcoming war, I'm telling you today that the world has profitable warehouses.
Even today, in any country you choose, you'll find long queues in front of gas stations.
This is something else.
What are the risks arising from this problem?
What number do you think it will be? I don't know.
A hundred or maybe two hundred dollars, maybe less, but...
You can cope if these tensions become real tensions.
As you said, the Gulf represents sixty percent.
In a country, even if it is far from oil-producing countries.
You'll see how the effect hits you like a boomerang.
You can get to three hundred dollars.
And he moved from stocks and other markets to the oil market. Today you will see more than two trillion dollars.
Today we see printing.
Trading more than a hundred in a single day means...
These tensions in the region and what lies ahead.
April, as they say, is the month that will mark the beginning of this war.
God knows, I'm not, I mean, Chinese.
In the area because now.
This is an election year.
And the current American administration only has a few months left.
George H. W. Bush launched a war on Somalia and sent thirty thousand Canadians in his final days in the White House.
We'll see, but let's not jump to conclusions.
But I don't think this scenario will happen.
Because this situation is very expensive.
America won't pay anything, you and Iran and the consumer countries will also pay.
America today
Now it depends on Africa's oil, and there are many alternatives to it.
What is it, let's talk clearly.
In your introduction, you stated that sixty percent...
oil reserve
...but now they are doing it in 2022...
About the oil they bring from Africa.
I'm from West Africa, and no matter what they export from any other part of the world.
Oil production
Because this is a difficult number, a reserved constant, and reserved.
What's the story about deep oil or deep-sea production from the deep ocean?
That's why the Gulf will remain a tough number.
And the Caspian Sea oil.
And I see them as dreams because they do not represent reality or truth.
They destroy it and they destroy it.
The important way means there is.
Today, Qatar is the world's largest energy exporter.
LNG, because these countries are a tough number.
And countries their energy needs
So there must be something called a security shelf.
And despite internal objections within the United States, even at the level of General Fallon
But there are still some concerns.
Bush is the one who protected us.
Try to notice that political risks don't come from the Gulf countries.
It means no, no, no, it's not about stinginess because none of us deal with stinginess.
No, I'm dealing with a lot of generosity.
Not "in the current domain"
We're not part of a charity.
or being generous
Just ice cream with the Westerners, not with anyone else.
With America precisely.
Where is the market?
Where do we find economic benefits?
Let it not be.
Like oil and gas
You're descending for generosity.
I have the proof.
I have the proof.
It's just between sixty and seventy dollars.
It's the rise in prices.
But the decline in the value of the US dollar that you insist on
You are in the first place among the Gulf countries and OPEC.
That the export is in dollars and you refuse.
Exchange the currency even though the currency has collapsed upon him.
Even if the return were in your favor.
No, I said it should be 70.
The story is with the experts, not with me.
In Doha, the price of oil rose by more than the 30% drop in the dollar.
So if we take the base year as 2002?
We see that oil prices range between thirty-five and thirty-six dollars.
Of course.
Hallzeit raised its price.
But a small increase, Your Honor.
It means, if we take it.
We'll see him now.
Even at these prices
That is, if we compare it to 2004.
It even exceeded the rate of decline for the value of the US dollar.
The exciting is **the thrilling is**
Deals with the depreciation of the dollar.
As the dollar falls, oil prices rise.
This is also something the market has started to feel.
Our concern now is to reduce.
The situation has changed now, and it might have been true initially that there was a reduction. They were saying TLK two years ago, but the situation has changed now.
The dollar began to lose value against other major currencies like the euro and the pound sterling.
So the question is, why do you peg your currency to the dollar?
His work is weak and lacks coverage.
This is a historic age.
Oil and its derivatives are priced in dollars, even for European production in the North Sea, Russia, and Norway.
It is said that America in the mid-1970s
The gold standard that was tied to the U.S. dollar was abolished.
Not true
Present, now tell me what's correct.
the OPEC organization includes:
Four Gulf states
Qatar, Kuwait, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia
Today, OPEC's share of the global market
It's forty percent.
Today, if we say that the world consumes eighty-five million barrels
Those who deal in dollars for oil pricing.
If you set a price in another currency, everyone will.
There's nothing wrong with you.
All oil-producing countries must agree.
You, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf countries, oh my!
Who has 66% of the world? It's the elders and the owners of the world.
Reserve, but I think it's for export.
including Venezuela, Libya and
Cameron, Angola, and these countries are organized under OPEC.
The market share does not exceed forty percent.
Produced and exported from outside the OPEC
And that's what you can't associate with the two quarters.
"What can be measured alone only"
Some countries tried.
Not a real attempt.
You're the one rejecting because of US bonds.
From one dollar to another.
All oil-producing countries
Before, only one barrel was produced.
It's a pity if they imported it.
Something I did became very expensive.
He sells his oil in dollars.
On his device or yours, receive it, take his money in dollars then convert it to his local currency.
It's not tied to the dollar.
true but he
But that's still your problem; you sell in dollars, but if your currency isn't pegged to the dollar, you don't have a problem.
The main question is fuck now.
What are the concerns and implications of pegging your currency to the dollar amid the dollar's depreciation?
It has been associated for many years.
Especially in the 1970s when the dollar was used as a very strong currency with a huge impact.
This chapter is not that easy.
Divorce is easy.
They're not here.
Divorce has its costs.
This benefits these countries and does not harm them.
Profit and loss
Dow Jones announced yesterday that there are 4 countries, including Qatar.
But there is also a report on Gulf financing stating that there are four Gulf countries, of course, since Oman withdrew from the unified Gulf currency.
I read a statement in the Wall Street Journal, and I don't think it's a genuine statement.
This is the former governor of the Central Bank of Qatar.
He said yes, and said it would be a study, but also all the Gulf countries are needed.
Profit and loss must be looked at very carefully, apart from conventions.
Leave the matter for inspection until they come.
What do I tell you? I'll bring you more economists who can provide another study.
This contradicts this study.
A global house said something very simple and organized, and it appeared in a report dated March 8.
Four days ago.
The world needs a simple solution, and it requires political will.
The political decision can be summarized in two things.
First thing
His intention or the five with Kuwait, about its intention in two thousand and ten to issue currency or study the issuance of a unified Gulf currency
The second point is to issue a decision to resolve the breakdown from the dollar.
Firstly, regarding the single currency.
From my personal view
To see the unified Gulf currency
This real will be strong.
it will be **being**
One of the strong currencies in the world, as you said.
And who comes from the reserves and the huge returns?
Therefore, this is what the Prime Minister emphasized when he said...
Gulf countries, because no single country can do it alone.
Only with strong economic content
Even today, economic growth up to the euro, we see it.
Certainly, you shouldn't forget that the central bank plays a major role.
Upon evaluation
Calculation of profit and loss
From all these news
A delicate situation
2008, as the observers said, the Globe House said that this inflation will continue.
A long period of time in the Gulf countries, but the solution is in the hands of the government.
Some countries have raised salaries by seventy percent, such as the UAE.
...what has caused prices to rise continuously,
And here's my question now: When will the salaries of these poor people be increased?
After a short while, I will call you.
Today's episode is about: Oil reserves and daily production of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Saudi Arabia.
He has sixty-four billion reserves.
And two out of ten barrels.
And nine out of ten are produced daily.
One million, one hundred and one and a half, multiplied by one billion, equals two hundred and seven million.
Qatar, with fifteen and twelve billion, produces eighty-five thousand. Oman, with five and sixteen billion, produces seventy-seven thousand.
The ring is worth one hundred and twenty-five million and produces thirty-five thousand.
The total annual revenue was 38 billion.
From 2003 to 2007
Europe one hundred billion
Sixty billion in the Middle East and forty billion.
In Asia and other countries
while the total local production of the GCC countries in two thousand and six was seven hundred and seventeen
Total revenue in 2007 is expected to be 799.7 billion.
It will be in 2099, in the year 2110, and one of ten billion.
The inflation that constantly devours the salaries of employees and people working in this field.
But it increases by two thousand and eight thousand and eight from ten.
Doha is the center of economic and political gravity in the country. Kuwait accounts for about 15% of GDP. In 2008, Kuwait's contribution to GDP was expected to reach around 8.9%. The United Arab Emirates plays a pivotal role in promoting sustainable economic growth and diversifying income sources across the region.
It will be ten, Saudi Arabia was six and a half, and it will be six.
"And eight of ten"
Prices are being eaten up.
So, what are the amounts and percentages you give to the poor people here?
If we want to solve the problem
Correct solution
Always increasing salaries.
This is not the solution.
My patience has run out.
Not true, I, not true
Daimon
Of course, there is **a belief**.
In the case of an increase, increasing without controlling inflation makes inflation consume all these increases.
To solve the inflation, a high committee including all experts and specialists is needed.
...and the committee puts it...
For salaries to increase in the world
And surely the golden economic rule says:
It ended.
"Even if it happens"
A raise in salaries, no matter how small.
Inflation is rising.
The solution is wide and vast and expansive.
With a scientific study here at the bait.com institute, which specializes in employment, a study was conducted with the help of the British Yougov siraj.
They conducted a survey on fifteen thousand employees working in the Gulf countries in twenty key sectors.
Especially experts and those who have jobs there, there is no job satisfaction.
Because of the inflation we have here, it's starting to devour everything.
"Chose one from the five."
He's thinking of moving from this country where inflation is rampant.
Now you will lose.
"And make it very easy and put the easiness and try to apply it."
The solution to inflation is to increase salaries.
Confidence exists.
Here
We are worried, the state is worried, and we are doing what we can.
Solve this problem with a real solution.
Temporary solutions never solve the problem but rather exacerbate it.
"Zoodha" means "too much" or "excessive" in this context.
I hope we have more time before this committee finishes.
All requests
This is boring, Your Highness.
Boredom, Age
True, the state tried to offset the increases with a 40% raise.
There is an important point here regarding increases.
"With a bit of extra pay, you only want Qataris, as if non-Qataris work for Bangladesh and Zimbabwe."
Consider Qataris and do not consider non-residents.
"while the highest percentage is in it" would be translated to English as: "while the highest percentage is within it".
Oh Ahmed, you live in Qatar, not in Germany.
It's all talk and suffering.
Her salary is much higher than in the public sector.
And likewise, we saw.
In the public sector
And conversely, the public sector becomes
To improve units and competencies that have started.
And I also read a report, as you know, we are in the oil field.
Hand job
Adorn our experts
Engineers and workers who come from outside Qatar
So that we also interact with the global market.
Gently, these poems, what has changed in the meanings? What h
Hope is in God Almighty, but we say...
The government has a plan.
And I say, self-control is more important than education.
A better solution than a temporary fix.
"Webn shouf w ana mutakid" translates to: "I will see and I am sure."
To be there
First
Bacon is on the edge of fifteen percent.
Okay, the second report states that you will receive fifteen billion riyals from oil and thirty-six billion riyals from gas.
No comment, what is the spraying process?
His way and of course we
But talk of economic growth must also reflect on the people.
Today, however, it reflects no economic growth, as Qatar has the highest economic growth in the world.
And this applies to all thoughts.
The large "carriers" in the state are also part of it.
...And if it weren't for this big "move" and the massive projects
In this country, it won't be part of inflation either.
Led to some inflation
This also led to a significant liquidity in the market.
First, regarding the link between the dollar and oil.
They whiten oil for protection.
I am from the USA, hence the stability in governance.
Good health to you.
Saad al-Ghamdi from Saudi Arabia, your question, O Saad.
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God.
"Zina's ring and Zina's title"
What I want to talk about is that the region is now under American policies.
American policy in its current war, in addition to the cultural war it is trying to wage against Islam, there is a global economic war.
Now in China
The U.S. deficit with Japan also reached sixty-one billion dollars.
Even Japan has invested heavily since 2000.
With America, the line is equal to nine.
Billions, and it is investing now with the European Union and more than seven and twenty billion dollars.
To keep up with American politics and make the dollar an inevitable currency for the whole world.
Brother, I say buy now.
And the gulf will become
In the sense of (place)
Good health to you, my brother Saad.
Mohamed Alosef from Egypt
Welcome, Your Excellency, your deputy is with you.
Middle Eastern dictators, Your Excellency, remind me of...
When there is
When there are calls for price adjustments.
Adjust salaries in returns to match prices, as you said, Your Highness.
In Qatar, we saw you as a role model.
And continue not to promise an increase. This is the Arab style.
We consider Qatar like a brother.
He's entitled to say what he wants. Do you have a question? Of course, it's his right; he's responsible for this policy.
"Yay, first thing"
His happiness needs to be put under study.
This is the second time he should respond to public opinion.
With the poor, as I said, because they are the people of countries that need special care.
Arab leaders who don't care about the poor.
Peace be upon you
I hope you are well.
Good evening to you and a good evening to His Excellency.
I want more of you.
Salaries are excellent and good, which is great.
The subject we need and suffer from.
I stand with the poor, and God knows best. We know there is no poverty in Qatar, and we know.
And to say that Qatar is as he said, the money goes to the ruling family and the ruler.
And this is the important question now.
Let's first answer the brothers.
Can't rule
And what happens to wealth?
Now there are new cities that are almost like pearls, such as Al-Luwayl and other places, meaning even Qatar is investing.
This is not the case; the case is.
A suitable urban town
In short, because we still have two minutes, tell us where Qatar is going.
Qatar now, there is a post-oil and gas Qatar.
There is a clear policy of the state.
Because who is he?
Non-renewable origin
Because it is a non-renewable resource.
Therefore, today's direction in the State of Qatar.
Doha is the capital of the Middle East in education.
Today we see the Education City.
Today, this Education City includes some of the best universities in the world.
He builds medical cities, media cities, and financial cities.
curse the oil and gas today
Of course not, we don't imitate anyone.
Second satellite
It's not just the island, it'll become a hundred islands, and we're not stopping at the island of course.
Because my brother, these are our countries in the Gulf now.
In the boom years of the seventies, everyone remembers the boom years of the seventies.
Now let's see what Qatar has in terms of growth.
And this calls for a special episode about Qatar in the post-oil era.
With our vision regarding oil, it is a future and a resource in the region, especially in Qatar. In conclusion, my regards to the Team program.
I am Ahmed Mansour, and I greet you without boundaries. Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Peace be upon you, with the mercy and blessings of God. These are the weekly greetings, from the heart of the Qatari capital, Doha.
And here we present to you a new episode of our program "Without Borders."
At the same time that Qatar is hosting the largest US military base outside the United States, Al Udeid Air Base.
With enemies of the United States in the region.
Like Iran and Syria
Its doors are open to leaders.
In fact, Hamas leaders enjoy special relations with the Qatari leadership.
If you see when the Emir of Qatar is alone, he is the first power in the world.
Who visited the southern suburbs of Beirut, destroyed by Israel during the Lebanon War in the summer of 2006?
And we will continue to provide unlimited support for the reconstruction of what Israel destroyed in Lebanon.
And at that time, when Qatar's interests aligned.
With her older sister in Saudi Arabia about two years ago.
**This is a difficult translation due to the non-sta
Like the Lebanese file that succeeded when the others failed.
When the Lebanese leaders gathered in Doha, they signed an agreement, and this agreement was the reason for their safe return.
I have the final say.
Here's the translation.
The one that wanted to become the engine of these files is not Qatar.
The smallest Arab country
And this is the end of today's episode.
We are trying to understand the foundation and principles upon which Qatari foreign policy with foreign countries was established.
And for the good
Qatar, the smallest country geographically and demographically, plays these significant roles.
What are the qualifications that enable him to do that?
And that will be in a direct dialogue with the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister of Qatar.
And for our viewers who wish to participate, they can contact our presenters by calling the viewer numbers that will appear on screen.
The visit made by the Emir of Qatar.
Al Jazeera's screaming is like cannons for improving communications with Saudi Arabia.
From the past like Saudi Arabia's attempt to control the Qatari government with the help of the Al Murrah tribe.
In its edition published on June 20th last.
What is the nature of this secret transaction?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
A lot of things are not like that.
I think it's correct.
In many interviews on this program, I always say that accuracy is
And we consider it the backbone.
I am from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
There was a misunderstanding.
And Zayd, the
Even different viewpoints
It's true that the border issue is over and it was a major obstacle.
The historical Saudi-Qatari ties were special.
These buttons, if we look at them.
Between the two countries and the two families.
Disappointed due to misunderstanding
Neither from us nor from them.
Since there are no conditions between brothers.
It's good and timely, and the relationships in place, I can assure you they are excellent.
For the sake of the Cooperation Council
But how did relations between Qatar and Saudi Arabia improve when Qatar was the obstacle and the reason for the crisis in 2002?
At an important point
I won't say it again, I'm done with all these programs.
Not just the large ones, I was saying that our reliance in the Cooperation Council is on
That Arab kingdom is an important country in the region.
And we value our relationship with him.
There were flags, some of them exchanged in a heated manner, and this was clear to both sides.
these countries find themselves
The day the brothers agreed, we succeeded.
Especially the Saudi-Qahatani house.
Instead of finding themselves in conflict.
Wherever the camel is valued.
And who thinks it's a strategy of anyone in this conflict.
My sheikh allowed me, so allow me to put the shiak or da above the letters.
Many observers see that the island has changed in recent years.
At that time, the situation that was criticized on Al Jazeera's screen.
What's happening inside Saudi Arabia?
Or the rest of them are standing?
The island stood still addressing these issues.
Al Jazeera's coverage of the Hajj season turned into
He praises the system and what the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques is doing in a time of change.
First, you can ask the island management about this matter, don't ask me because I...
What connects the two countries.
For the stability of the region.
This strategy continued and enhanced the stability of the region.
The area you're referring to is the Gulf region.
United Arab Emirates
There are many cases around the Gulf region.
And the call of the guardian of the two holy mosques in Mecca and Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.
He influenced all the listeners and the entire Arab world.
He who sows discord among the Arabs and ignites it.
Not just perspectives
No, not in politics, politics are points of view.
In the Arab world, it is considered
A war of a special kind
When the developed countries of the world...
He talks about the same interest.
How many years are left now?
The situation now
Listen first.
There is a difference between this topic and the second topic.
The idea of a small country facing larger ones and making them feel weak.
Any difference or misunderstanding
He had his reasons.
And even his reasons have ended.
For the wisdom of our Crown Prince and our Emir.
Is there anything included in the insurance for the future?
There are guarantees between the two parties.
Based on the bonds of brotherhood, love, and mutual interest that unite the two countries.
And the leaders, their speech is considered more than a document.
Between Qatar and Saudi Arabia to develop this relationship.
And, God willing, there will be many more such Saudi-Qatari positions to develop.
For the best and there are many fields.
For this relation, like what we have with other Arab countries and other Gulf countries.
For Qatar, it is an important country.
Yes, meaning the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is an important state.
What is Egypt to Qatar? Why is it bad that you reconciled with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia at the same time?
And three organizations, namely Hezbollah.
Al-Jazeera is a channel.
Are you pro or against the regime in Egypt, the largest Arab country?
First, let me start with...
Egyptian people
And we respect the Egyptian nation.
And her interest
On various Arab issues and the sacrifices of the Egyptian nation.
... In both cases
No one will believe that we are trying through this case to reach an understanding with our brothers in Egypt.
According to what you're saying, you respect Egypt and the Egyptian people.
And we think he is a kind person.
We disagreed with Egypt on two points.
Or one
We were accused of planning to remove Gaza, and I don't even think about it.
And we are afraid.
In cases where they are owned by other countries.
Interference in the affairs of any state is only justified if there is room for reform.
It means you intervened with those who were expelled and the enthusiasm Hamas was generating against the authority in Gaza.
Sure, I don't deny it. We really didn't know about this particular thing any more than the others who found out from the media.
We have relations with Hamas and we have relations with others.
What made Egypt differ or have a disagreement on this point?
God willing, this will be clarified.
Hezbollah conspiracy
Hezbollah
But I speak on behalf of my country.
We were very impressed by this topic.
Benefit to others in Qatar
What did the pyramids say?
They said the pyramids.
Attacking Egypt and its position.
Can you reply?
Let's go back to the conspiracy they mentioned.
Time will tell.
The start was from the Gaza Conference.
I exempt the Egyptian people and President Hosni Mubarak from that.
If we go back to the Mina conference
After the Madrid conference, do you remember the port that was in Doha?
And that was an agreement, and the day of the conference was going to be held with us.
They said they didn't want to hold the conference.
Oh people, we know you are coordinating with Israel.
"Towards Qatar, and that is it."
What are we trying to understand why?
We sat and chatted, and conversations are always good.
You have two parts.
And what are they?
In disagreement
In political orientation
If we look at the Doha conference that took place
His Highness Prince spoke with all the presidents, including his brother President Hosni Mubarak.
We received news from a foreign state.
The brothers in Egypt have a viewpoint on the subject that it shouldn't be touched.
And people are killing each other while we're waiting.
If you want us to leave it in Doha, we can leave it anywhere in the Arab League.
And it would be shameful and disrespectful to discuss the Kuwait conference through play.
From Israel and the Western world stand and watch what's happening.
When we say "agree" (okay), at this very moment, there is neither power nor strength except in Allah. As Arabs, we cannot stand against it, nor has any great nation stood against this battle.
Egypt's statement called for a halt to the fighting in Gaza, and an hour later, the fighting stopped.
Even we
We don't want to insult the Arab street with such naivety. Our disagreement with the Muslim Brotherhood is on one point.
And this is in accordance with international rules.
And there are not enough hospitals and doctors to be found at the borders.
You were the ones standing at the border.
No one can enter.
Brothers don't accept it easily.
Since Gaza is next to Egypt and is considered part of the national territory.
When we talk about any human issue anywhere in the world, we are talking about a human issue and nothing else.
And we respect sovereignty in Egypt.
And we know what happened, but that doesn't harm Egypt's position.
And, God willing, we will bring a lot from Egypt.
It is the largest Arab country.
And we believe that it can convey our voices and the voices of others from the Arab world.
For all the other parties
Even the rescue mission that followed Gaza.
The thing the Europeans tried to save
What happened in Gaza?
It's a high conference to present this and I consider it a rescue for the government.
They invited us to a conference, they invited us to coordinate among the Gulf countries.
And we were gathered in the Cooperation Council.
These amounts will not be disbursed to any party.
But rather it will be released for
Those affected in Gaza
directly and this was
As it is forbidden to enter and exit from every direction.
"Go to Egypt and to the Egyptians; go to Egypt, for Egypt will be the place of refuge."
Egypt's victory in political matters is important to us.
But you expect
Who doesn't like to eat? (Explanation: This is a rhetorical question, implying that everyone enjoys eating.)
One of the ministers was posturing, but he was denied and discredited.
And whoever harms Egypt, we cut off his leg and break his arm.
Frankly, I expect that this official misused his position towards his country.
In fact, they didn't fail, and they didn't talk about anything except themselves.
What helped them in this matter, and I said this to our brothers in Saudi Arabia, the Saudis intervened because the king has wisdom in this matter.
To grasp the finale in the Arab world
We agreed.
The king will decide that this is in everyone's interest.
We accepted King Abdullah's decision because we respect him and trust him.
But to say that they stopped is an insult to those who actually did stop.
As if they were students in a school.
I think this is it.
"He had already arrived."
He thinks it necessary to assert his strength.
Sorry, sorry for all this.
If you think that a small state doesn't have the right, its rights are taken from it.
And you come in and impose your voice on Darfur.
This is an Arab decision at the Arab League.
An African decision and a United Nations decision
I think the main issue is
"Hazibout Allah orders from above, cut it out."
Conspiracy, what does he know? In Qatar. Explanation: T
If it became prevalent after the swine flu, the appearance of a Qatar somewhere is the reason behind the spread of this virus.
Qatar is a peaceful country that knows its size and capabilities.
But Qatar has a point of view.
Qatar has a separate policy.
If Qatar can solve any Arab issue, we consider it an honor.
For any Arab dispute
Let's see if any Arab issue can weaken our stance on our main issues, which are Palestine and all the other issues we are facing.
The Arab world has become independent.
Even our analysis became like theirs.
Tails Insight
But there's a story we know, we know what happened in Pakistan.
In the way that I want, someone to receive me and roll out the red carpet for me in Washington.
Is there anyone who blames Qatar?
Has Qatar wronged any Arab country?
I tried to contribute money.
These contributions are controversial.
I say "Salam alaikum" and you say, "You're saying 'hi' to provoke me."
This is another matter, meaning you have a problem or you have a shortage.
This case doesn't concern me, it concerns you.
But if you have internal problems
We always tell him that.
Especially following Crown Prince Salman's speech
In Kuwait, and I know this is a real man.
The man speaks something that isn't in it.
"My heart, I always say these words."
I always say that.
I always say, even in the midst of our dispute with Saudi Arabia, I used to say that
...You can access all the documents you have on **the island** but...
The matter is different, no, no.
From one part we said no, there's no salvation, this is the stop at this situation.
And we tried as much as we could.
I don't want to get into this topic.
So they could see their own affairs and how their mistakes were.
And when we see our mistakes doesn't mean everything we have is right.
Are you referring to this, Your Excellency Sheikh?
To the existence of internal problems in Egypt.
They want to get out of it.
Deny that Qatar contributes in any way to any conspiracy against Egypt externally and attempts to dismantle its relationship with Turkey and any other country?
As if he has superpowers with us.
And seventy million if we can, not eighty million.
They still have a problem that needs to be solved.
Oh brother, you played a role in the Shalit soldier case, even though you know this file is important to the Egyptian government.
And I asked with the Franks.
We received a call from a dear country.
"There's an issue we need to deal with. We said, 'Brothers, this issue is the Egyptians' responsibility.' They said..."
We want to treat this issue as a request.
I'm from Israel and a second state, we want to see a second part to see this.
When we saw this, we told them that if the same conditions applied, the brothers should speak to the brothers in Egypt.
And publicly, this means, is there an official who can say "we" - meaning he mocked the Arab League.
This means he is a poor man.
How did he let it pass by us?
To make President Mahmoud Abbas stay.
And we supported this.
He addresses his people. He addresses us. He addresses the Arab world.
The problem is from you.
I think this is a healthy phenomenon.
I don't own the island as they accused me.
The island must enter the media competition, as there are many media outlets in the West.
There are many media outlets, and they are still in their teens, all cursing each other.
But after a while, they reach maturity.
It might be or it might not be
First, our situation with Saudi Arabia is different.
Even if we concede to Saudi Arabia, we accept it in Qatar.
Important relationships
And Egypt is an important country, but there is a particularity in the relationship with Saudi Arabia.
This text seems to be a combination of directives and a section intended for translation.
This is true, but we have a history with Saudi Arabia and the relationship is different.
A personal matter between some officials here and there.
We respect the President of the Arab Republic of Egypt.
I hope it's limited to a disagreement in policies or viewpoints.
I told you about the problem when there was an attack on Gaza.
The second problem is that they have issues with us, and we still don't know what Qatar did to cause this.
Why don't you try to arrange a meeting between the Egyptian president and the prince now?
Saudi Arabia intervened in this matter.
And from there it leaked to the newspapers, and they initially said it was a secret meeting, but we found out about it the next morning.
If there was a meeting between me and Omar Suleiman.
In Saudi Arabia
There's no going back on it.
And I can't tell you that we agree on everything.
Let's say no one interprets it, and you shouldn't compare yourselves.
But dignity is dignity, whether with the young or the old.
The minister said that if Egypt received the appropriate satisfaction.
Satisfaction among the children
I think it's not like that. Egypt is bigger than that. I think he didn't find the right expression.
Do you have a vision for how to solve the problems with Egypt, or are you like the Egyptian people who wait for divine intervention?
Oh brother, I don't want to talk about any divine intervention or otherwise, because only God knows who lives and who dies.
And He has
Someone pampered him and said there would be a way.
And our pride in Egypt.
There must be a specific way.
Either you're with me, or against me.
And even any pain felt by the Arab citizen
In the Arab world, we have to deal with him, and this is the policy of His Highness the Emir.
Nations rely on energy sources from which they derive their strength.
The United States has the resources of China, the resources of France, and the resources of a small country like Qatar.
Our faith in God
Which is very clear.
Damn it.
We're just a small country and we've put it under study.
And I'll repeat it a hundred times.
So no one can say we're sensitive.
No one's going to take us.
"With Israel, you're joking with you
Walking before I go to Israel.
How can you solve the problem with Egypt?
What's going on now?
And every day they make up a story about America. If I could tell you, the biggest countries you were talking about.
They deal with us according to their interests, and we do the same.
All complaints and all
To ruin the relationship.
I think any great nation that does that will affect its image.
It also affects our Arab pride when we start complaining about each other.
Everything is coming and we know everything.
Our solution is based on Arab interest.
And we're here for them if they need anything.
Are there upcoming steps to repair the relationships?
But I know there are good relations between the President and His Highness the Prince.
If anyone is doing something behind the scenes.
At the expense of the cohesion of the two countries and the two leaderships, he will find himself a loser.
No, it could be tomorrow. It could be in ten years. To be honest, I don't know, but from our side, if anyone invites me to a conference, I'll be there.
Whichever one invites us to a conference, we attend it, and if we have a point of view, we express it at the conference.
We can't
Because Egypt is like the older sister, but we have our own opinions and discuss together.
This is all that is required. Whenever the time comes, we will be more than happy.
What was canceled because of this policy.
And as I said, we respect the Egyptian people.
"Who told you how many contracts were cancelled? And ask how many Egyptians came to Qatar at the same time?"
But as a state policy, as I told you, the Egyptian people in Qatar are very close to our hearts.
Now, on the fourth of last June, you teased Arab sentiments when you closed the Israeli office. This was published in the Arts section on June 4th.
Why say we beat them when we wanted to be close to them? We wanted to bring them closer, we'll shut it down for 12 years.
When everyone was campaigning for reconciliation with Israel and before there were secret meetings between Arab states and Israel.
And after the interests of most Arabs
With Israel, either under the table or above it, or talk to her in any way.
If we wanted to play with emotions, we would have done so at previous Islamic conferences.
At the United Nations, Nasser's ally hosted a dinner at the residence of Israeli Ambassador Gabriela Shalev.
He was among many guests who attended the party, and I don't know what made the ambassador throw it.
Because at the United Nations, we sit next to Israel, and no one can deny that.
Or we find a glimmer of hope that relieves the hardship of our Palestinian brothers.
Now the management has changed, and I had a small place for the Egypt issue, but unfortunately...
What was I was you.
My translation for your question into Qatari Arabic is: **"سؤال يخص الولايات المتحدة والإدارة الجديدة وتأثيرها على علاقتكم أنتم القطريين مع الولايات المتحدة، مع وجود أكبر قاعدة عسكرية في قطر."** **Translation:** "A question regarding the United States and the new administration and its impact on your relationship as Qataris with the United States, with the presence of the largest military base in Qatar."
There are differences in opinions.
My grandfather is involved in resolving many issues in the region.
And if they're serious, we'll help them as much as we can.
We look forward to a special relationship or a solution to the problems that existed between you and the Bush administration.
Many of these cases have been resolved.
His Highness the Amir of Qatar spoke yesterday in Paris about the situation in Iran.
And you have special relations with Iran even if its relations with the United States are bad.
First of all, we need to put it in the context of internal affairs, because we must respect every country and its internal affairs.
Lebanon after the elections
Before the elections, Saad Hariri said in this program that the Doha Agreement ends with the establishment of elections.
Is this your vision as well, or do you not see the agreement still standing, and you're the one who will be leaving the new agreement?
The Doha Agreement was for a phase that would allow them to hold peaceful elections.
A year and a half has passed since the Doha Agreement.
We followed him day by day, minute by minute, until they reached the elections in agreement with "Dahwa".
Gradually recently in one of the constituencies to correct some misunderstanding that occurred.
But you still have things to do in the arrangements in Lebanon.
We're always close to Lebanon. You know how much Qataris love Lebanon and enjoy visiting there.
The first country I visited after a Western country was Lebanon.
Do you understand Kurdish? If you understand, respond, so I know you understand and can comprehend.
You interfered in the Htin case, and there are accusations that you supported them.
Or your involvement has put them face to face with the state, and currently there is a greater danger, which is the danger from the south.
"We have suffered a lot, and this is the reason why we are standing here and not there in Qatar."
We did face a lot of pressure, but this was our vision and the position of His Highness the Amir.
"The topic concerning the Houthis"
His stability had a positive impact on us, and his instability had a negative impact on him.
We acted and hindered an honest and fair mediation between two parties.
And we signed an agreement.
But I understand if this is supposed to be used for other reasons.
And that He be with them, and that He guide them in all circumstances.
It is built on falsehood.
I don't see the point for us.
We sell it.
I say this with an apology, as I know there is a large Arab audience who will disagree with me.
Dear viewers, thank you as well for listening, we hope that we have explained to you some of the foreign policy of the State of Qatar.
In conclusion, greetings from the program team, and this is Ahmed Mansour greeting you from the "World Beats" (Without Borders) organization.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
To all the viewers, peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God. Welcome to this special interview.
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani is the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the State of Qatar.
Why do I say it's a special and exceptional interview? The reason is that
Qatar and this man were major sponsors in particular.
Brother, just one simple and direct question.
I think this happened because there was an Arab consensus from the beginning.
And we tried that when we went to the United Nations.
Arab consensus was important, and Lebanese management from both sides was important.
To achieve results
**very important that external interference** is crucial to prevent further complications.
Plus opinions and suggestions from outside.
Arabs, Lebanese, and internationals if you want to say.
Go ahead and finish the stages, but with meaning.
That nothing exists except that these stages have been present.
Means that the complexities in Lebanon
From the Time of Truth
I mean when you were all gathered and immediately switched to the Lebanese line and the Lebanese file.
I discovered that the Lebanese community is huge?
The Lebanese Arabic dialect is an international and regional language that requires significant decoding.
Oh people of Qatar, the matter involves twisting and turning, but what escalated the situation was foreign interference.
Because we know that Lebanon is a beacon for journalism, a beacon for culture, a beacon for tourism, and a beacon for many things.
A Lebanese phone must allow it.
It affects peace and security in Lebanon.
Problem number one
It is the external reflections in Lebanon.
It was suddenly decided after twenty-four hours that everyone should be put on a separate plane.
I'm coming straight from the plane to meet the Emir of Qatar. Evil.
They didn't even expect it, they didn't close their eyes for a minute unless I was kind and let them.
The secret is to let them relax and think a lot.
You make a lot of calls.
Let's propose the idea of inviting them to create Doha, because we need an atmosphere.
Or that you gather them with a lot of difficulties.
And often
We moved them from these situations to ones where they could find a solution.
If we want to succeed, we need to let them out of this mood.
... and "quickly"
And God guides us towards success, whether as a beginner or an expert.
And we succeeded because they agreed to go to Doha.
The parties decided to go to Doha.
Some thought that Qatar might be more biased towards one side than the other.
And from Beirut only.
The policy of His Highness is that we are in the middle.
In this news
Okay, frankly
Did you seriously consult?
And with the main parties concerned at least interested in what is happening here in Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Syria.
Especially the brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia spoke with Prince Saud.
And offered his support for the idea.
We benefited from Sheikh Saud bin Harib bin Khalifa Al Thani.
They all need a solution.
His justifications are flimsy.
If we rely on logic
His justifications are flimsy.
It had to be removed due to the tension in Palestine.
There is the case of the Iranian nuclear program.
The Arab League must have a mechanism to resolve issues.
Is the African Union better than us at solving issues?
And gather the limbs.
How can they hold conferences to find solutions later? Why can't Arabs with old ties manage to do so?
Unite the Arab groups or unite the party groups if there is intervention to support the... the... oppressed.
Is under study
If we wish, there should be a wake-up call for the Arab League, not for the university of the Arab world.
Arab committees are merely a tool for implementation.
One of the officials was here, and that is Speaker Nabih Berri.
That all depends on the situation.
Now the Lebanese seems to have agreed.
We heard everything.
And above them are layers of clouds.
What did one day lead to?
For Arabic benefits
Bacon is considered a strength for Arabs.
We have tried.
At the United Nations hall when we went to the Doha Agreement.
Agendas made for resolution, not other reasons.
There is no doubt that
A more important role in the entire Arab world.
**lands**
God spared us the evil by our understanding each other.
For others to come and help us
...That's why this is a serious matter but...
Why have we reached a point where everyone is playing in our garden?
In our yard.
It is of utmost importance to put the interests of our people first.
Now we want an Arab university after this agreement and let's see what we will do with our Palestinian brothers.
What are we going to do about Somalia?
What should we do about Somalia not being a member of the Arab League?
Sudan is not in the Arab League! Iraq is not in the Arab League! Why don't we try?
We are part of the Arab world and small.
I hope this isn't a suggestion, this idea.
Qatar has good relations with Syria and Saudi Arabia.
I think first, if we're not asked to do something, we do it as much as we can.
...Sultan of Najd and Hijaz, King of the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia...
Governor of Saudi Arabia
And his ally is his brother, President Bashar.
Because historically, Saudi Arabia and Syria had an agreement.
It could just be a phase.
And we will meet, God willing.
With all due respect, I'm still proceeding according to the principles. I'll ask you again, is this permissible with you? And is it possible to take a step in this regard?
Even if it's not public right now, it's like you don't quite have confidence.
In it lies our interest.
And Mayoun this session from where only this story.
What happened in Lebanon indicates that the region is on the verge of serious changes?
Or what happened in Lebanon is a local and a Lebanese affair, the affairs of the region are still ongoing.
I'm not involved in this situation.
I wish the opposite were true. I wish this were the case.
The beginning of a new phase in the Arab world.
We can do it.
It happens somewhere else.
Your Excellency, are you afraid that the escalation that existed a period ago...?
At least until the end of **George W. Bush**'s term.
There is no doubt that I still have concerns about Palestine, now the Gaza issue.
My father, I want to ask.
"I will not do that again."
I asked you to focus on the humanitarian aspect in Palestine.
We can't get them the medicine.
No one else.
Electricity for the patients in the hospital
He who dies when the power cuts.
I wish
The Arab League agrees on an amount for this matter; food and medicine we call food and medicine.
We don't want the Red Crescent to deliver it.
Let him deliver it in red.
Excuse me, but the Arab side is committed to this Israeli siege.
I don't want to go into details, but I'm saying that as Arabs, we should deliver medicine and food, even if we don't agree with Hamas.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has made a huge effort and pledged in the Holy Kaaba.
Because this disagreement will only benefit the other party.
Don't tell me to deal with these people because they will provide you with an incorrect solution.
... and I
So far, there are no signs of a solution.
I'm afraid of an American-Iranian meeting in the coming period, or I'm not expecting one.
Of course, this is possible.
At least I'm talking about Qatar.
Iran is an important neighboring country to us.
We might not agree with all their policies, or they might not agree with our policies in Qatar.
For example, they tell us not to establish relations or communicate with Israel.
It might be that those who see you have to be part of it due to the American rules present there.
We know how to handle this.
There are those who said that after the visit of the Emir of Qatar to Saudi Arabia.
Can I meet, consult, or speak with the Saudi host?
In Istanbul, negotiations between Syria and Israel.
And I can only say that it was a coincidence.
Brother, on the second matter, Saudi Arabia was keen to find a solution, and I was in contact with Prince Saud.
What happened in the last few hours?
Change the tactic, change the negotiation methods.
Either from your side or from other parties.
We are the ones responsible for
And from all sides we locked the room on ourselves.
... And in the end, we found ourselves... Then, His Highness the Prince's intervention was crucial.
And through it, the works of intervention come out.
Without mentioning it now, it's settled.
And his summary was clear when he said, "We know our size, our place, our role, and other things," as if...
I wanted to take a role without disturbing any other party.
Qatari Arabian, National, and Sekizomi
But nevertheless
Became a responsibility
What do you want or not?
The phrase "Qajri: Qajri: Qajri: Qajri: Qajri: Qajri: Qajri: Qajri: Qajri: Qajri:
It's these countries.
You flatten / You flatten (feminine form)
I think this will be the profitable merger.
Last question, your relationship with Washington, is it long-term, is it normal or special?
I can say that our relationship with Washington is good.
It doesn't mean we don't have different viewpoints in situations.
But this is our right, if they talk about democracy, this is democracy.
How is Zain? How can you explain him on Earth?
If we're talking about the economy, it's excellent. If we're talking about education, it's excellent.
Your health is good, but if we're being political, I can say it's fine.
In your opinion, and keep it clear in the next phase.
From my perspective, let's set aside the confrontation with Israel for now.
Even if we were to stop playing in the Arab court,
Correcting the hostility between the Palestinians.
We are united in one opinion to be a respected force.
I believe in her.
To be something effective
Thank you, our dear viewers, for watching. God willing, we will meet again.
Welcome to our viewers in this dialogue session with the Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani.
In this dialogue
We are trying to explore the political reality of the Arabs and Arab efforts.
Greetings, son of lords.
For an investigation into what is happening in Gaza.
And I hope through this dialogue that we can
Highlight some of your questions.
The brutal Israeli incursion into Gaza
Our goal was to have a unified Arab stance.
Solve problems with friendly nations
Sister countries
How can we find a clear and strong Arab stance that this country can rely on?
And then, we find areas of agreement.
From our perspective, we know that more than one Arab country has been violated.
In an offensive manner
...and no one was punished.
They share everything, whether intentionally or not.
We are the specialized experts.
In the world, they are the only ones who are always targeted.
Always disciplined in a way.
I think
As much as we try, we can't.
Leadership-level meeting
To stop the discipline campaign
We didn't want to create a rift in the Arab world.
And there were five other verbal agreements.
At the rate of two-thirds
But the purpose of the meeting isn't that.
Some people want to be right and for our perspective to be wrong because of the goal.
The solution to the problem is not the summit.
But is the solution being achieved at the expense of Palestinian blood?
What we are asking about now is whether the minister will not cancel Qatar's request.
And His Highness also emphasized this.
So the speech he gave, which we insisted should not be in Qatar if it was going to cause any embarrassment, we did not insist that the summit take place in Qatar; it could be anywhere else.
An Arab stance where others respect us.
And yes, and the minister's right.
We need to make it clear to them that the Security Council resolution was issued.
and Israel
He had nothing to do with the decision, and the decision continues to kill and destroy in Gaza, and that's the situation.
And we need to ask the Arab what we should do about this matter.
What are we going to do?
When will Israel end?
To implement the remaining provisions of the Security Council resolution
Or there will be a stand since Israel did not stop.
"We have neither ridden nor slept."
This leads to a decision that is considered an explanation.
few chicken eggs
We're talking about the ministerial meeting.
I'll support this in the end.
Of course we support the convening of an Arab summit, this was our idea, and some other countries also requested the summit. Syria, Yemen.
The Arab horse is there.
Or we'll isolate them in a camp of moderation.
And the tents that have no good in them.
And what do they mean by "no virtues"?
This was arranged from the West.
Like the appointed and non-appointed Arabs.
You won't find an organized country or an unorganized country.
I want to know what moderation is and what immoderation is. Does moderation mean following Israel's plans?
And let the matter end in a humiliating way.
Or we just keep the matter open.
I mean, this is an important question.
What are these countries?
Following Israel's footsteps and seeking to solve problems in their ways.
I just want to say that this follows Israel's scheme, and I don't want to accuse anyone.
But I say
If we call it a coexistence camp
In the eyes of the West, moderation refers
Do we agree to the slaughter of a certain category of Palestinians?
Of course, there were elections.
No one supported it and no one opposed it, but something is there.
The current situation is that there is
Idea
Some people call it an extreme move.
But we need to ask ourselves what this radical move demands.
It's not fair to deny someone their rights, nor is it right to ask for more than one's due.
Or we'll arrange them.
And make other suits after that.
"We resist because..."
I am an Arab and cultured internally.
And it started to happen.
He doesn't want to wage war on behalf of others.
Yes, Your Highness Sheikh, in brief.
Who prevented the Arab summit?
I can't say there wasn't some effort, and the subject was somewhat known.
The subject concerns prevention.
But as I said, it could have been ours.
Vote and choose two out of three.
But that wasn't the goal because this isn't a matter of challenge as much as it is a matter of urgent need, and that's what we believe.
And others were saying it's not an urgent need.
We went to the Security Council.
Or is there a Security Council resolution?
But the decision will be up to the Security Council; Israel said it will act later and study the matter.
All I want to focus on again.
We're not trying to enforce the decision on the weaker party.
What will make it different from the first meeting?
For your information, sometimes disagreements happen.
bad day
We will be ready to have a clear Arab stance.
Humanitarian aid
Our brothers support us greatly.
also to address the Israeli party and tell them...
I don't expect everyone to be ready for this, we should investigate this matter.
Why don't we freeze it?
Two and eighty, and we were inclined towards peace, two and eighty, but the Israelis were not inclined towards us.
It's natural for arguments to happen in meetings, but in reality, these arguments...
"Reflects their attitudes and what's in their hearts."
One of the disputes she reported was
If anyone described Hamas' actions as distraction.
Not even a little
This situation has arisen and we have responded to it, and I am one of the ministers involved.
And I also feel this talk that the West is saying.
These are extremist movements, sectarianism, and other names.
And we don't want to be the quarter men.
And that's why it always means me, and I don't mean anyone else by it.
Any foreigner they find.
"Whether a Western country or Western countries, you will find..."
I am Arab.
His Excellency Sheikh /
Request for a Second Ministerial Meeting
His agenda has to be one thing.
Where are the Arabs, people, from all this, and what is the position of the nation, a nation of three hundred and something?
One million Israelis shopped.
What was issued following the decision 1608?
The issued judgment.
Israel didn't do, they just left after finishing the mission.
And there is no doubt that the Arab delegation made an effort.
This is something you should be thankful for in this decision.
In order to demand Chapter VII, because Israel is above the law, Israel.
If asked, they will say, "We understand."
Are the Arabs the ones who made a mistake if they did?
If so, Israel won't be questioned.
And this is above international law.
This is realistic.
Why did you go to the Security Council? And why did you link the Arab Summit to what comes out of the Security Council?
At the top, the Security Council is trying to help us.
A firm decision is needed.
decision-making
You can make an official appointment and he will knock on your door.
We were terrified of the West.
And we'll work fairly after they decide.
I don't want to get off topic.
Those who carried out the attack to rebuild all of Iraq at their own expense because they were the ones who destroyed it.
Let's not demand from the Iraqi government, and let's not demand from the people who left.
No compensation.
The same thing happened in Sudan when they started the trial of Bashir.
Happiness
Happiness Sheikh
A major Arab diplomatic victory at the Security Council.
Listen, they had some difficulties in the Security Council because the first item was about a presidential statement.
The consequences
Israel didn't go with it.
It runs out in two days, after a week, after the mission is complete.
So they didn't assemble it with him.
Sorry, but people need to gather.
Because Israel agreed after the mission was completed.
Do you have an alternative to the decision now?
All I did
Some brothers, unfortunately, with some efforts.
They participated in the siege of Gaza.
I'm very cautious with the West and I don't care about any relationship with them.
Against the West, not against America.
But these people know the language of interests.
Your quarter is like you are strong.
Or if you have a point of view.
In the end, they take one percent of our perspective and say we are the ones who won.
What is victory?
Why
I can't say anything about precautions now because the decision wasn't made.
The council is master of itself.
I participated in the formation.
Yes, we participated in the formation a bit.
But I wasn't invited to the meeting of the Arab Foreign Ministers and the US Secretary of State.
But I think the brothers who went are enough.
Who paid for your attendance at the Arab parties?
In this regard, His Excellency Sheikh
When the time comes
Listen, I don't want to talk about accusations.
I can't claim that we knew everything.
If they are the kind of people who
There was Israeli rejection and international rejection, and we also participated in this rejection.
And from there the conflict began and the siege started.
And last month, Israel killed twenty-eight Palestinians during the ceasefire.
And we left them hungry until they were scorched, because we didn't want them to be in power.
Those parties are your happiness, O Sheikh.
Clearly state that the Palestinian conflict
"That is, if there was"
Who caused the Palestinian rift, there might have been a Palestinian rift.
Wow, there's no doubt about it, it's 100% correct.
I don't mean that Hamas is 100% right.
I don't claim that and I don't say that.
But, the intermediate stage is usually in the middle and equidistant from everyone.
And not only that, but we Arabs are also equally distant from everyone.
But I don't want him to be present, so we need to get rid of him by any means necessary.
He drills the soldiers right and left.
And once when we besieged them and did not give them money or salaries.
And once we create a positive model in the West Bank.
So that the people of Gaza can see how others live.
the luxury living ... **the luxurious life** ...
In Gaza, the opposite is true.
Present, present, present, present, present, present, present, present, present, present, present, present, present, present, present.
"What's the story? The talk is still revolving around it between Hamas and the Turks, it's final."
This meeting I was invited to attend seems to be revolving around
It would be tricky to launch another initiative.
We have no initiatives.
In this issue
Because Egypt is an important Arab country.
The request is to take a role, and we support any Egyptian effort made to reach an understanding.
But the important thing
Don't come.
Tomorrow with a party it looks like what it was before a second party.
No path leads to harmony.
Balanced Egyptian Initiative
Between international requirements, Arab requirements, and humanitarian requirements
And the requirements of Egypt's role, which is an important role.
A leading Arab state that we all respect and appreciate.
According to your statement, this is what is required from Egypt.
**Now the proposals, the initiative currently doesn't meet these requirements, Your Excellency the Minister.**
I have a vision for the initiative.
We hear some information from time to time.
I can't comment on something I don't know about.
With all due respect to the Palestinian government or presidency that is supposed to be there, and we all recognize the Palestinian presidency.
But there are also people.
Who are the injured on the other side whose perspective we should also consider?
To perform these intermediate tasks
By the way, take the viewpoint. Explanation: Qatari Arabic often uses "bal 'l mansabah" which means "by the way".
Hamás' position was clear that this decision did not take our viewpoint into account, so how could it be issued?
"They have chosen to engage in Arab struggles in their own right, rather than connecting with or merging their views on the fundamental concept of jihad relevant to the issue."
We just want, of course, to deal with the Palestinian state as a state.
And we deal with the entity as a single party.
But now, there's something very different between two parties in one place, and two parties in another place.
This doesn't mean that if we deal with people from Gaza, we have to stop dealing with people who are either in the bank or in the Palestinian presidency.
We deal with the Palestinians as one people and one government.
They ask for someone from Gaza to be with them.
And now we'll start coordinating with each other.
What did they announce?
First of all, regarding the resolution, he did not specify a mechanism. He welcomed the Egyptian initiative and any other initiative.
And some considered it as a mechanism.
This is an explanation, but from my reading of this decision, it welcomes the Egyptian initiative.
Oh God, may the Egyptian initiative succeed in its work.
Whoever stops the fighting.
I have no doubt about my brothers in Egypt.
Because Israel did not accept the Security Council resolution.
And it is also considered that this decision no longer exists because Israel did not accept it.
Even if he agrees later, the situation on the ground will change.
Indeed, Your Highness, in talking about the efforts of the Egyptians.
in cooperation with the Turkish efforts at the same time and it
"Oval 'uzr min al-'Arab" translates to "A first excuse from the Arabs."
Or Arab disputes that cannot reach a solution, which is why they fill the void.
Supposed to be filled by Arab parties
I welcome his position as a Turk.
A bench that deserves appreciation from Arabs and Muslims.
Turkey is an Islamic city.
Therefore, this is a natural role.
And indeed, people must follow him.
No Arabic pronoun can fix the situation.
It's said, let him finish the task.
There must be a clear Arab stance, a firm position against all this aggression, its continuity, and procrastination.
There will be an opposing Arab stance.
Israel can prolong the decision, I am not seeking an Israeli-Arab war, and peace is always our goal.
And we are a country that loves to live in peace.
I don't call for an Arab war, I call for...
A clear Arab stance
In the context of initiatives and proposals, you are definitely following what is happening.
Even the suggestions and even the conditions set by Hamas
Do you think so?
Now as a spectator, I am on the ground.
And the political process that emerged from the military operation, God willing, will make Hamas set its conditions.
0130808 does he have to be
We agree on this point, but we disagree on this point.
the second thing
I don't know about this understanding since I told you they aren't there. Oh, now we understand each other.
the second thing
Okay in the required places for Arabs.
this Arab reality
We witnessed after the start of those operations.
It's as if he's in a very advanced position within the Arab street.
about us as governments
Surely you feel sorry for people who describe the gift of nations.
They keep telling me about this problem.
Expresses the views of the people.
The presidents now
That means if they want to.
At least they see what
The request certainly has a high ceiling and a modest ceiling.
Cease normalization and diplomatic relations with Israel.
Doha
The Israeli representative office in Doha was closed.
Qatar, which takes this stance.
They think that the Arab side must be extreme and take extreme positions.
Whatever is agreed upon by the Arabs will be a collective agreement.
Never, if we had an Arab agreement.
Xi's Treaty and Xi's Relations
We are ready.
Walking with our Arab brothers
If only there was a clear Arab decision and credibility.
They treat others, not just countries with which they have relations.
But these countries also don't have anything.
This thing is very important.
Don't act as an agent for anyone else.
He says why can't Qatar be an example in this field.
If this is the only model, then we are ready to be in it.
but we also want
Qatar's Arab models are committed to part of their Arab commitment.
What should I do?
One doesn't sell to the other.
Our problem is that trust between Arab countries is missing.
Unfortunately, I don't want to say our secret, I don't want to say intermediaries.
That's why it's extremely important.
For formal occasions, wherever it is, because we need to rise above this.
Some called the ambassador, others staged protests, and some expelled the ambassador, like Chávez.
It's part of the difference.
What Allah wills, some of them called for the ambassador, and those who called for states in a permanent capacity, and all of these are films about our people.
We talked about the modest ceiling of the people's demands.
For high expectations, there is one demanding the opening of fronts, some demanding that Syria open its fronts with Israel.
Listen, I told you that we demand peace and we do not demand fighting with Israel.
And we don't want to fight with Israel.
Treat Israel equally.
And they forgive, how?
This is also a problem.
What brings us together, and overcomes our differences.
What you said, Your Highness, caught my attention.
This is on the condition that countries don't sell to each other.
What do you mean?
That means
The street doesn't spare us.
Happiness Sheikh
Is what is happening today the completion of a project that started in the 2006 Lebanon War?
Or there is a disagreement.
No, I think there are differences in the goals.
Lebanon had free land.
still some parts of course or maybe it's just a small deposit to the United Nations
"Or something like that"
Lebanon means we have dealt with the Lebanese issue to a great extent.
Israel, of course, needs weak states around it.
So you can be in control and he has the upper hand.
Surely there are countries that were taken by force and became foreign.
He wants to remain the only power in the region.
And now they want
To change this example with "ghaza"
In northern Lebanon, do you speak with how many sects?
And how many sides does it have?
In Palestine, there is only one side.
But I can assure you again that the problem in Palestine is that they listened too much to some Arabs and foreigners.
And from here the gap began, and each one thought he was controlling the other part.
From your perspective as an observer and a viewer
As planned, it ends with broken bones.
Oh Arabs, do you accept this talk? This talk could be repeated to those who are disobedient.
Or he expresses his opinion.
In the future, Israelis or others.
And we gave a sufficient example.
In obedience and assistance in breaking the bone
We have a moral proverb that says: "I and my brother against my cousin; I, my brother, and my cousin against the rest."
Now, in any dispute with Hamas, I'm not saying Hamas or anyone else is infallible.
They all have mistakes.
Now we have to forget about this matter.
She provided her passengers with snacks.
Because here, failure will not be a failure of the group.
Your Highness, Qatar, usually, that is, before this period, was trying to come up with proposals.
And initiatives to find solutions that happened in Lebanon.
I'll do that in Darfur later, even if I'm in a hurry.
that we
Between us and our brothers, there is trust, because sometimes feelings are involved.
One country is taking all these initiatives, we have no problem as long as there is a solution.
Our goal now is not to make Qatar a top headline.
What were among His Highness the Prince's lofty goals?
One of his goals was how to stop the bloodshed.
End the dominance.
It surpassed imagination.
"And we are in Qatar."
Mother, we know something they don't know, I don't think so.
But the most important thing is pure intention.
add this to the list
Wasting time on initiatives is useful to know what happened to the initiative regarding the resolution of the Darfur issue, achieving justice and equality.
And the government of Sudan in Khartoum.
And it will primarily be about solving the Darfur problem because it started with the Darfur problem.
The Arab helped **helped the Arab**.
But what we heated up was a case that we made an international issue.
Based on a revenge from the system and currently we are trying to solve the problem and we don't know how.
And we always strive, as mentioned before, to implement decisions. We are the best people at implementing decisions.
How can there be competition when there is no competition in the Darfur issue?
I don't want to get involved in this.
Before we summarize the conversation, Your Highness, there is an economic summit.
Are you attending the summit that's going to be held?
No, we're preparing for the summit.
I hope it was held in a non-Arab atmosphere, but it was programmed.
It will be a great mistake.
Acceptable if the Arab leaders attended this summit.
When Palestinian blood is shed in Gaza, they gather for financial and economic reasons.
Thank you for helping to warm up.
But it seems no one is afraid of these streets.
Not knowing the circumstances means I certainly hope nothing happens to us, but safety first.
According to the precautions
But no one carries anyone in their small pocket.
Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, may God give you good health.
My beloved, wherever you are, may peace be upon you.
So, what is the point of this celebration and the statements of sincere intentions by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights?
People with disabilities are the most neglected in the world.
What is her opinion about our Arab region and to what extent is she interested in this issue?
We'll be asking these questions and more to our guest on today's episode.
A former United Nations employee, concerned with disability issues.
And removes the shake and virtia and thought, part of the conventional and historical tools, including birth software, defined by
Master's degree in Social Planning and Social Policy from Helwan University in Egypt
And I've worked in many places in the field of disability.
She was a founding member and general coordinator of the National Committee for Disabled Persons.
In nineteen eighty-nine
And the vice president of the National Committee for Affairs of Disabled Persons from one to two thousand and nineteen.
two hundred and thirteen
Helped establish a center for people with Down syndrome.
For people with disabilities in Qatar.
The guest we have oversaw the launch of numerous campaign programs, projects, and media outlets.
Activities and events for people with disabilities in the Arab world.
Also contribute to delivering lectures and participating in meetings, conferences, and forums.
Welcome, Ms. Hessa, to this episode.
That's very good food.
Of course, we started using the term 'disabled' in the eighties and before.
The most educational concept
Who provides them with this education?
In a significant United Nations document that emerged in ninety-three.
Regarding the term, before we delve into the details
From second-tier regions, although there are regions that are not classified as developing countries or are classified as poor countries.
And thus America became our special friend, but our greatest friend remains America itself.
But the statistics proved the opposite.
The movement towards legal rights exists in the Arab world and exists in many countries.
There are available resources and political will exists as well.
Please let me tell you some statistics you might already know about...
Eighty percent are from poor countries.
UNESCO says that around ninety percent of children with disabilities from poor countries do not go to school.
Professor Hessa, how can you comment on these statistics?
He is very realistic.
I have seen it in Darfur, in Gaza, and in areas exposed to such events, which are wars and conflicts.
You can't distinguish between a person with a disability and a person without because they are in large numbers.
In fact, children suffering from female illiteracy, for example, are almost three or two dozen.
In these other countries
There are many barriers that prevent these children from getting to school, even without disabilities.
Oh my, the city lacks infrastructure, imagine if this child found this school.
It's not meant to reach him.
For the benefit of children and other residents
These meetings and projects are great, but we rarely hear about them.
Except for the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, which the world celebrated a few days ago, what is the benefit of this celebration?
The situation in the world
Better than people who don't have a disability.
In organizations, she reached and settled many projects.
Implements a very important health strategy.
...through this strategy
There is an overlap between humanitarian affairs and working with marginalized groups such as people with disabilities.
Now there is a little awareness in the Arab world, and it is the best.
At the point of awareness, we pause to take calls and continue our conversations.
Good health to you.
I have two questions I'd like to ask her, since she has been to the United Nations before.
The second explanation:
United Nations laws that call for combating systems that hinder society, such as the Syrian intelligence system, are now in effect for the child.
I wonder if there is a law that allows for demanding the trial of the regime, especially with the abundance of regimes in Syria?
Yes, Suleiman, your question is clear. I'm from Syria, peace be upon you. Thank you very much. With us, Nayef Saeed, from Kuwait. Hello, Nayef.
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.
May you be safe.
Good evening
Good evening, welcome.
If you don't mind, I'm one of those who suffer from mental and intellectual disabilities.
Arabs say, "The wise understand hints."
And there is a verse in the Quran that says: "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Allah, who has given us this discourse, we praise and glorify Him who has given the discourse to all things."
I sat for thirty years without saying a word or two a day.
Bear witness that there is no god but God and that Muhammad is His Messenger, and thank God for this blessing, for it is He who enabled me to speak these words.
I was referring to the Quran, and I found...
I want to use the Quran as a guide, and they will see me as a heretic.
These people attack me and don't know they are at the bottom of hell.
All I got was defamation.
And what is the truth?
Your house is made of glass, don't throw stones at others.
And surely psychological disabilities
Regarding Brother Suleiman's inquiry, it also falls under the same definition.
United Nations programs or how their responses address the causes of disability, such as political goals or otherwise.
Go for a walk and visit different institutions.
They will not be asked about their sins, for they are forgiven.
There are disability issues and cases on their work agendas.
UNESCO, the International Labour Organization, and UNICEF, and the fact that these organizations do address disability.
This is one of the programs that try not to lose children with disabilities.
With Zaine's opportunities and schools
From various environmental aspects
UNICEF matters
But there are shortcomings. We must acknowledge that there are deficiencies in the United Nations as well.
What are the most prominent weaknesses and imbalances you've mentioned?
United Nations
The issue of routine and bureaucracy
I was in my country, the State of Qatar.
But there was a routine and internal bureaucracy that hindered it.
The work I have myself sometimes during periods of restrictions or shortages.
Don't exhaust yourself or try to fight people with disabilities for recognition.
Until he reached a somewhat satisfactory level, unless he puts it in a separate article because the global movement of people with disabilities wants it.
But she took a little more suitable part.
Unfortunately, there's no coordination between them.
This is one of her most notable flaws.
Eradication, as applied by the Special Rapporteur and implemented by states.
Among the employees or people working on these programs
Unfortunately, we only received three responses from forty-eight organizations and agencies, and only three responses were received.
He doesn't put.
The issue of disability is permanent, stable, and ongoing for many years, even though it is primarily a human rights issue.
**In the past period, God willing, two or three years ago.**
The issue of disability has become at least raised through events such as seminars and others.
May you be safe.
Welcome, Your Highness. Why aren't there binding laws and decisions for Arab countries? Who is responsible for enforcing these international laws?
For Arabs, countries, and salary distribution, for example, distributing salaries to people with disabilities.
In specialized boxes of the United Nations?
Does the money go to governments or to offices specific to the United Nations, and will this assistance actually reach the disabled?
The final observation: If there were not binding decisions for the Arab countries.
Good health to you, Ahmed Halabi from Greece.
We have Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia. Welcome, Ibrahim!
May you be safe.
Peace be upon you, and you are well.
This hypothesis depends
Which is to write directly to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
To be transferred to this fund.
It's a manufacturing plant.
Allocating only one percent of the annual net profit
Return our guest's right to answer the callers' questions.
He said the doctors advised him to have surgery.
Waid is overburdened and cannot manage, so where can he get help?
He is from Algeria.
I think it's important that we meet Naji's needs.
Like any other rights, the rights of persons with disabilities
All these rights and duties are necessary for the citizen to obtain.
Two women are talking in a displayed lane.
And fulfilling the rights and needs of the people within the national scope.
Not even at the non-governmental sector level
It is binding on all nations, and is limited to ensuring the application of these laws.
At least at the level of the officials, there primarily needs to be awareness.
It has to be at least this way if we're working on these treaties like this.
Even if there's no significant commitment from him.
In response to the follow-up reports you prepare, was there any interest?
Just don't forget the basics. This is a morally binding document, not legally.
Have a commitment and make it systematic.
And I understand that these issues are resolved, discussed, or fall within the context of a society suffering from many problems.
Naji Zakarneh, Manager, Qatar National Center for Sign Language Expert in Al Jazeera
First, Mr. Ali would like to express his sincere gratitude to Al Jazeera.
They've now broadcast this episode live.
Now Ali is speaking and saying that he is very proud.
...She was a servant to all those in need, where she was and still is.
We stand with her and are always in her corner.
I also say that there are many people with special needs.
Some of them are unaware of this agreement because there were no training sessions.
To them, especially in schools or hospitals or in public and private institutions.
Long live this agreement!
As a legal intermediary dealing with people with special needs in all countries of the world.
"...and I was more insistent and keen that these countries..."
Adopt and sign this agreement.
A state like Qatar, and other countries that signed the document, aims to serve people with special needs and benefit us.
Good health to you, colleague Nagi, and you speak on behalf of Ali.
Many thanks
Your answer might make a decision.
The former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, we can start with a proposal submitted by caller Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
Establishing a fund to support
A fund for donations, accepting any contributions from countries.
This means the fund is supposed to spend it on activities undertaken by the Special Rapporteur when he is engaged in
Even the Arab countries did not make donations except for one: Syria.
Fulfilling those obligations is a problem within the United Nations, therefore
The Box
Lack of commitment and, unfortunately, lack of interest on the part of member states.
And unfortunately, many people boldly say that this means we don't care about the current situation.
It's actually a matter of obligations.
Regarding human rights.
With its overall wide shape
the marginalized especially
But for this reason, some of them have covenants.
For the sake of this country, they fulfill their duties, but the brothers did a good idea.
On that note, there should also be no standalone box, meaning one that is independent in its form, but rather organizations that are already present in the region.
Who are the ones who have it in their budgets?
Provide us with special projects for people with disabilities in Gaza.
Assistive devices for the disabled
The problem is always dealt with superficially.
His state or government has guaranteed significant support.
Unfortunately, this number is decreasing.
With token amounts
The parent is a judge.
Sure, he's a foreigner.
They took her friend... her...
Sometimes from
Education problems
Through travel or exploration, we gain knowledge.
Peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
"...and we appreciate it."
They rebuilt themselves, aware.
Oh, if only Arab countries would allocate a portion of their budget.
You're welcome, Behjat Kranon from Kuwait.
Aisha Mohammed from Qatar, welcome!
May you be safe.
May you be safe.
Good evening to you and Sheikhah Bint Khalifa.
Just send her a message of thanks and appreciation, and that's it.
In the past years
With our sincerest wishes to you; parents of children with special needs.
For the continuous support of the Sheikhah of Haisa.
A noble standard-bearer from Tunisia, welcome.
On another level, it's genetic.
I think there's a genetic level of care that reduces the percentage of disabled people.
It is our Arab custom for a cousin to marry his cousin.
In this way at this level, a level of disability and thank you.
Can you comment on the viewers' comments?
That's basically what you said at the national level.
I know there are programs for guidance and support.
Falls under healthcare services
Which also falls under the umbrella of Hamad Medical Corporation.
I believe within the psychiatric clinic and also programs in the Supreme Council of Education.
**Special Education Administration** **To be honest, I don't know if it still exists.**
But it is certainly part of healthcare services. Yes, there is support and there are medical services.
Providing the necessary rehabilitation for these cases.
Prevention is better than cure, pointing to the genetic factor and consanguineous marriage, are there any campaigns?
To raise awareness
This area
Certainly, this is a very important and serious point.
And what are the things that concern me and others in many words and many posts?
Yes, there are awareness campaigns, and they are not just directed.
Implemented by the World Health Organization
Also UNICEF
Now in many Arab countries, including Qatar
And surely Tunisia
There is now a binding decision for early inspection.
And what he led in the international modern literature.
All of this is on the preventive side.
And do such campaigns lead to any positive response?
Especially when the topic goes against customs and traditions.
Sure, the difficulty arises when it clashes with societal culture.
To have a decision, to have strategies, to have the will to deal with that, and to make commitments.
The issue of early detection, for example, because this is a very important issue before marriage.
They ask you if there are any statistics on people with disabilities.
Especially people with disabilities from the Arab region.
For the Arab region.
Especially
With the recent events that happened in the region
Regions and conflict zones, especially in wars and conflicts, etc.
This is with every person who dies, three disabled people die.
And what happened in Lebanon, Durban, and Darfur, and many other lands.
It's never enough of a problem, and basically the whole point.
With the principles of human rights
Certainly, there's something due to those with disabilities and their programs and plans.
**Meeting agendas in institutions within government and non-government ministries**
In circumstances such as war or unrest
Only to your words High Commissioner for Human Rights at the United Nations Nafi Bilay
Demography is the most powerful and effective tool to ensure that persons with disabilities fully enjoy their fundamental rights and freedoms on an equal basis with others.
To this extent, the disabled are not included in statistics, which are discontinued for residents.
What they always announce.
In the State of Qatar, when the statistic was taken, I think it was more than five years ago.
Frankly
In collaboration with the Planning Board and with
Establishing the Council as a reality and engaging with bodies such as the Special Rapporteur's office
Add more categories for disabilities.
He needs things that he should find.
The types of those needs, all these important details that should lead you to a conclusion.
She or he was disabled.
... or at least
Statistics are in some way making progress in this regard.
May you be safe.
Madam, thank you for this program, and thanks to Sheikhah Hessa.
That's why I thank God that I'm from Qatar and can obtain this degree from my country.
"And the daughter of a student is currently in a prestigious school and receiving a good education, praise be to God."
And I am not like Ahmed Issa.
هنا ترجمة النص المقدم إلى العربية القطرية: **دورها التحفيزي ودورها اللي خلانا**
Praise and thanks to God, and thanks to her and everyone who relies on this classification.
Thank you a thousand times, Fatimah Al-Dubais from Qatar. You are still in Qatar with Latifa.
May you be safe.
May you be safe.
My dear sister, reality, expectations, and what we anticipate is the solution to our children's problems.
Where is the role of our Qatari children's sheikha?
Oh God, I hope you can answer this question.
Hello, peace be upon you
Something that proves what the State of Qatar has provided as a service, particularly for the hearing impaired.
We had a program for early detection of hearing loss.
There is a Supreme Council for people with disabilities.
For people with disabilities, regardless of the type of disability.
Even assembling civil society, MGOs, or other communities.
"Because reality and what we hope for, if I compare them after five years."
What was offered to people with disabilities five years ago and what is offered now?
Thank you very much, Kareem Naseem from Jordan. Now we'll go back to our guest.
Sure.
Society as a whole, with its individuals, and especially its prisoners who have
Children with disabilities have great ambitions and expectations.
At the planning level or at the operational level
But with respect to the point you mentioned, which is a very important point.
Children cannot obtain documents or other things, whether in Qatar or anywhere else.
An international convention is like many international documents.
We committed to translating it into plans and strategies.
To provide those services automatically
Based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, regardless of religion, race, colour, sex, sexual orientation...
Okay, Sheikhah Hessa, you previously worked as a Special Rapporteur, interested in disabilities at the United Nations for six years.
What?
Perhaps the time wasn't sufficient or the financial aid wasn't adequate.
There are many achievements accomplished, and I am proud of that.
Through my participation or through existing organizations and via government institutions in many countries.
Especially in the Arab region
Insha'Allah, there will be more research and broader studies.
We started with a global survey and had more than one report.
Raising awareness is an ongoing process that needs to be worked on continuously and extensively.
Coordination among Arab states
Among the people are some with disabilities and their organizations because they are part of the community.
It's their responsibility and they have a duty to do it.
They have to fight for
Many thanks
Good health to you.
Dear viewers, at the end of this episode, I would like to thank everyone who shared their opinions and comments with us.
Tomorrow, God willing, we will meet a new guest.
And with you, your messages and communications, in a new episode of "Live" (Direct). Stay safe.
Good morning
Welcome, I'm glad you're here with us.
First of all, before we start, we'll ask you different questions and chat in the morning.
You're welcome, Shima. Maybe I was congratulating you.
The entire Middle East deserves this international achievement.
Qatar has really pinned itself on the global football map.
Thank you Qatar
Ali, may God bless you! Oh, Ali!
First, I'd like to say "SabaHak Allah bil Khair" to
And extend my congratulations to him and to all the Qatari citizens for the hosting.
"And if God wills, just like what Sheikh Mohammed said,"
It was a dream, and if God wills, it will become a reality. Work starts today or during the announcement period.
Did you see Qatar hosting the 2022 World Cup?
And despite having strong files like the United States, Japan, and Australia, aren't you afraid in this area on this specific topic?
No, look, to be honest with you, I said seventy percent of it would go to Qatar.
Love Hamid
He has global and competitive plans.
We were competing.
Why are we afraid?
Certainly, by the will of God, he had authority and deserved it.
True, the 2022 file, the World Cup and hosting in Qatar.
So, what do you think athletes themselves feel?
They are in the field, of course they feel great happiness, God watches over them.
I want to see the %pw, we were talking outside, but we want to hear it inside.
The moment of the announcement
Where were you? How did you hear the news? Were you surprised? Tell me, and tell the audience.
Through the ether
And then everyone joined us.
They heard about the announcement.
How did you find the international media?
On the level of sports channels, everyone was supportive, especially the Arab channels. Praise be to God, everyone offered their support to us.
As soon as they announced Qatar's win and hosting,
All Arab countries have announced their full support for Qatar, through media, human resources, and volunteers, in the future.
The Arab state is known for its generosity.
Even at the level of international media, the characteristic of ...
I went this time to celebrate Souq Waqif.
Even the French News Agency was filming there.
"We asked him a question."
Everyone cooperated, Qatar now, daily, is being mentioned.
A hundred times a day, in the Garad, which is the smallest spot on Earth.
I assume everyone knows Qatar. Even online.
To host the 2022 World Cup.
I mean, any footballer dreams of serving his country, being on the team.
Sure, any player, whether in the Qatari league, wishes to represent the team.
It's a good thing to work hard.
He is in the league, even when he is in the league he dedicates all his efforts.
In training or playing, because the league logo is on his shirt, so he has to dedicate his energy.
Look, the officials have made a lot of effort to take care of the young players; they are teaching them professionalism from a young age.
Eating, sleeping.
Regarding your experience, you've played at several age levels. How was your experience, and what was the most important stage for you?
Was, surely.
He gradually progressed through the ranks, from the youth team to the first team.
The camp is with the club and with the dip.
Each stage has a specific mark.
Yes, Lana, God willing, you were moving between
We're used to you, Sporting Lana.
We always see you as a sportswoman, we love to follow you, and get to know sports through you. Now, what sports are you into?
I can't engage in conversations that deviate from the prescribed programs. In these prescribed programs, we encounter viruses in their fields, and like athletes in the sports arena, we confront powerful viruses.
Like Ali and the others in their athletic field.
On the contrary, the sports field is active.
Especially since we are the capital of sports.
Qatar has now become the capital of world sport and football.
Instead of presenting various talk shows on social, economic, and cultural topics.
Here are different fields, volleyball, basketball, different champions.
But there's still sports left.
Fantastic, wonderful
I'm tired of wishing so hard.
I wish I were ten years old now, not twenty-five.
Brother, I think the young players got a great opportunity this time.
I hope they make the most of this opportunity.
This is great, Ali. What would you like to say to the players?
God willing, the young players who will have a bright future in the coming days.
Sure, I told you it's an opportunity, they have to take advantage of it.
And here is a golden opportunity.
They have a big advantage from this.
What's new? What have you been up to? What new programs are you going to present? I know we asked you when you were on vacation.
So, let us know about your news, God willing.
Always following up on events, we are preparing for the Asian Cup which starts in January.
"How many days until we finish the Gulf Cup? By the way, I'd like to say congratulations to the Kuwaiti league."
The newsletter is also available to cover events.
My first appearance in the media was through Qatar TV, of course. My roots are from Qatar TV.
I'm grateful for their kindness.
He carries the message of the media on various channels.
On the channel that is specific, whether sports or otherwise.
So, thank you Qatar TV.
We wish you better luck, we're still on the same topic.
First of all, I would like to thank the management of Al-Wakrah Club.
...and its fans, I was at the Al-Wakrah Club.
Childhood memories
The sheikh was with me yesterday, Sheikh Nasser was with me.
He's still at the club.
"Izzay alwakra" does not translate directly
Right, but as I told you before the program starts, professionalism.
Every individual in Qatar belongs.
We know that young people love and are addicted to sports.
How to make sports a social thing.
Media, primarily, plays a crucial role in promoting sports across various aspects of life.
I said that youth are addicted to it, and also schools have become aware of the importance of sports in school.
For example, a sporting event is celebrated.
In Qatar, you see signs on the streets, reflecting the awareness of sports.
Allocating seats for women in stadiums and everywhere.
This also indicates the awareness and participation of women in the sports field.
And now we have a national women's association, for athletes.
I think sports are evolving.
I believe also that this time period
To produce massive projects and spread sports awareness, I assume this time period is sufficient.
If considered and ordered with care and caution.
It's enough and more than enough, but it needs to be used thoughtfully as I said.
And also, there's a point about how the young generation utilizes the league.
Everything is available, resources, expertise, equipment.
The important thing, Alhamdulillah, we are in Qatar, and as you know, Arab and Gulf societies are known for their passion for sports.
How do you attract this audience to follow sports news, football matches in Qatar?
And he goes to the matches at the same time.
Most of the Qatari people love sports, especially football, but the problem is that they don't attend.
When you browse web forums, you find that there is a great deal of interest, especially in most club forums.
There is great interest in the football league.
Oh, fellow citizen, in your opinion, what's the best way to attract people to attend, instead of being athletic and playing sports?
How can I get the audience to attend, for example, your friends?
It depends on the individual themselves, there's no general concept.
Some people like to watch it on TV with their family at home.
For example, Japan, Japan made an excellent plan to attract the public in a big way.
When you attend matches, you collect points or something, they are looking for solutions, so, hopefully.
And Arabic
The most important thing is that every player will be here in Qatar, especially in 2022. Lana, what do you think we need?
Aside from financial support, in your opinion, what do we really need?
Providing the capabilities to make them ready as a Qatari league and participate in a major tournament, the World Cup.
I was really surprised at how quickly the butter sold out with the good people. When the producer told me that the butter was finished, I said to him, "By God, God willing."
Dima achieves what seems impossible. She deserves the dream that seems impossible. Praise be to God, we are living the reality.
As His Highness Sheikh Mohammed said, it was a moment of celebration, but the serious work has begun.
And if God wills, in 2022 there will be an event named after the State of Qatar.
I congratulate all of you who reside on the land of Qatar, and frankly, the State of Qatar has become a global landmark.
To host 2020 and 2022
Thank you a thousand times, @Lana_a, brilliant presenter. I wish you success, and I will always watch your shows to keep up with sports news.
Good health to you, surely joy.
Young Qatari talents
They are singing a new genre, and it's popular now.
But in the form of repetition with music and a fast rhythm.
And also an amateur rap band, God willing.
Stay with us, we'll start now and good morning.
We're trying to get an idea about it.
We can simply define rap as fast music.
A repeat tool, but not a fast rhythm for singing the lyrics.
It is represented in a large number of poems, covering a variety of topics and issues.
Sometimes it can be personal.
It has nothing to do with society, emotions, or politics.
He is often controversial.
And how liberated he is to a great extent.
Rapper, viewers singing the lyrics,
He just repeats it.
He babbles to her because of her voice, which is considered a melody.
Generally, the voice isn't important in rap songs.
For this reason, he is not called a singer, but a rap performer or rapper.
Rap artists focus on the following elements in songs: explanation: T
For example, the flow, the flow of voices, synchrony, and delivery.
They have flowers, fans, and followers.
They have a unique style of rap.
And I think they'll give you a better idea than I personally can.
Good morning, hello.
First of all, it was a period when we wanted to do something new.
To be exceptional at something.
So we said, why don't we rap?
Rap is also an art present in all countries of the world.
So, why isn't it available in Qatar?
We mean we're inventing something new.
We gave him an idea that contained a message.
We talk about the advantages and disadvantages that occur in society.
I mean, delivering a message, first and foremost, is an art.
As one of the various arts, this is for the dear viewer, has radically addressed many social and psychological issues among youth.
Time changes, and I believe this has something to do with the changing of the times.
In the past, there was a simple acceptance.
We've been singing since 2005. Acceptance was very weak at first.
We can say that our new beginning was in two thousand and ten.
I am more accepted and popular.
People love to sing and do things like rap style these days, have you noticed that?
Of course, a high percentage of people.
"Then there's something we want to say, you were the foundation of many teams."
It's a nice band, and I think you have concerts. Can we talk about this band?
How was it founded, how did the idea come about that a person could form a band, and how many of you are there in this band?
Initially, before the band was formed,
Rap arrived in Doha starting in 2005.
This means that anyone who loves the idea of rap and can rap, can record and upload their songs on the site.
I can go down, Salman can go down, anyone can go down, that's why it was a competition.
We met some people.
So, they started to compete with each other.
After a while, after all these years, we reached 2010.
Before 2010, it was a group system, meaning this group on its own, and every three or four of us would be together.
So we said, "Why don't we unite as one community under the name 'Rapperz Qatar'?"
Or in English, "Q Rappers".
As we agreed on this, we said under one name and we are all together as one hand.
And with us we come to present this thing and say the same idea.
Around twenty-five people.
Twenty-five, God willing! If God wills it, this is a great gathering.
So, one of you plays or... or... or you all rap?
Arranges and composes.
You can say something personal.
Excellent, how are these twenty-five organized? How is this number organized in the band?
Everyone has their own personality.
Everyone in the band can write a whole song.
Without any help from someone else.
But capacities can vary; for example, if Salman is better than me,
He listens to it and tells me about these words, nothing else.
It's likely that each one changes for the other.
We help each other a little.
Or a company that accredits you, so that an official body can accredit these works.
And they will be the right distributors.
To make the work look luxurious and elegant, and for it to be formal for you.
Frankly, we hoped for support, and we got support from a company that came and adopted us by producing our own album.
We don't have any problem.
Some things are a bit difficult.
Why don't you consider taking the first step?
The individual recognizes the first CD.
So, if you can later attract companies, what do you think?
In about two years, around 2007, I made my CD.
I distributed to my neighbors.
How was the order?
I think.
Keep walking, because in 2007, rap might not have been dominant in the Gulf.
But it's not as popular now.
We were talking to each other before we went on air, like there are big differences between teams like Valencia and Castro.
Shall we talk about it?
They said they would organize the party for you.
They covered all the costs and procedures, coordination, and work; we didn't expect the level to be honest.
Frankly, we were surprised and it was an amazing performance.
But there was a bit of pressure because there were no advertisements and nothing before the show.
No ads, nothing two days before the party.
We assumed no one would go due to the short notice.
When we were inside, before the party started.
That was a beautiful point.
It means that our voice reaches families, not just young people.
We assume that the idea only attracts young people.
But at this stage, we discovered that there were many age groups listening to us.
Is there a specific song that the audience particularly likes?
The audience interacts with most songs.
Yes, most songs, but there were a lot of songs and we were many.
The whole group
What are words, how do they address different issues?
We're talking about the current situation.
At least, even if it was *
Even if they speak, before *
It has to be like this.
I mean, there's a rhyme.
We think about every word and try to find better synonyms.
Okay, how many songs do you have? Let's listen to one of them.
One of the songs I produced.
Let's hear it and see the public's opinion.
I hope they like the speech.
Good health to you, Ali. I liked the intro because my program's name was written on it.
This is a KDI and EDHR project.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This is Mrs. Bobo with a hot body from SKT.
Don't forget, the show starts at 9:30, everyone must watch.
Produced by Hasan Naama, Presented by Shima Al-Hamadi
Director Nasser Al-Maliki, and guests Qatari rappers, definitely.
"Because there really is a name of the program, thank you guys, oh! Guys"
I have to applaud you and the team in the control room.
We broadcast it yesterday.
And when he wrote the words, or was it?
Everyone writes their words.
In case you write to Youssef.
It's not just this thing, the love of singing and passion.
I think you should write about the 2022 World Cup and the Asian Cup, I think if you can.
Sure, I personally am making a song about this topic.
No, I don't think he can be formal at this stage.
It is important to include in the national anthems.
Through the art of rap
Yes, indeed, today, everyone.
Qatar
The cup has arrived, and Doha's streets are adorned. Explanation: This is a reference to the FIFA World Cup 2022, which was held in Qatar.
Hello, dear viewers, as we've seen, Doha is adorned to celebrate the Asian Cup.
Participating entities have made all the arrangements for hosting.
And it's even more crowded.
I think they're going to the corniche.
Sure they're ready to host this important sporting event.
Are there any gatherings during this period?
In an offer, they promised to organize a party for us.
But still, there are some complications.
Chatting and some problems, that's why we can't say.
We try, if I meet Joseph and see him.
I have a song theme.
If we find that it goes along with the song.
And the possibility of implementing it.
When I am at home
And then send it to Youssef via email.
This part of the song is for Joseph.
There's something else, do you travel abroad?
In this field, those with millions of fans.
Don't try to imitate, but we're listening to people who are pioneers in this field.
But we try to be competitive.
Why don't we benefit from some ideas and imitate certain things?
Just flip it, I take the idea and apply it differently to my song.
Who made a difference and has more than one CD?
One named Abdullah Al-Dail
He has the experience and capabilities to discover groundwater.
This talent is the ability to detect underground water sources.
One of the residents of the city of Mesaieed.
There are many experts.
What determines groundwater before drilling?
This needs or some wells can be drilled in places where there is water.
Since it's the same copper rod and in the same cromany
Or a date palm tree, through which he can locate water tanks.
What tools are used?
To discover groundwater.
That was in the olden days.
Just now, copper bars were placed instead of them.
Yes, we aligned the two heads parallel to each other.
And walked on the plain.
We noticed when we walked along the stream.
The sticks are blooming.
Now, we'll pass by Wadi A'ar.
That's how it's done.
As we crossed, it starts.
Now we are in the middle of a waterway.
And here, the text is in the middle.
So, in this way, we can determine the path of water, or groundwater, in the ground.
And the process is repeated more than once in more than one location to find the site with the highest concentration.
Abu Ibrahim confirmed.
This leads to an advanced stage of this journey.
So his discoveries become accurate once.
In Marth, outside Marth, in the blonde, harsh and tender.
More than 150 wells have been discovered.
The error rate does not exceed five percent.
Requires training, experience, and God-given talent.
Relies on modern equipment and laboratories
In a short time
Abdulrahman Al-Marshed
Doha Morning Show
Two times, northwest of the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
We look forward to this report and promise to increase reports from Arab countries and international countries.
And the Gulf countries, if the weather permits.
"...and we reached the destination with different names but with the same goal..."
This question
I assume there is a large group of Gulf youth in the Gulf.
Which particular people do you follow as examples?
What you follow is better than what you imitate.
A general connection between all Gulf rappers.
It's not a competition, it means if I produce a song.
This addresses a specific topic.
We can say it's a meaningful competition.
We have acquaintances, but there's no one like you.
In Saudi Arabia, there is a strong belief in destiny and the will of God.
He has fans and CDs.
Many companies want to adopt.
You've reached this stage, you can surpass it more and more, God willing.
We wish you good luck through this band.
Here, in the reception area, we can show you some views of the corniche.
And in addition to a group of Qatari youth
That, even if borrowed from the West, is manifested in a Gulf pattern.
There are also rap songs about love and a unique band of twenty-five people.
It's important to stay in touch with you so we can know your news.
Assuming you have an email, a website, or a forum.
Where can people reach out to you?
We had our own website.
But there were a few problems with the hosting company.
He would sometimes get drunk without any apparent reason.
So, we faced many problems and eventually solved them.
No use, the site is definitely closing.
So, what's the solution, what are the alternatives, to solve this problem?
The UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, and even Morocco and Egypt.
Stay in touch with them to get the latest updates. Songs are released from time to time during the explanation period.
Oh dear, what's the alternative now?
We're going live now on beautiful pages like this one.
Under what name
Successful, when you search for our name on Google.
Qatar's rap or Qatar's rappers
You can produce your own video clip.
For the program, I worked on it yesterday.
We uploaded a lot of videos to YouTube.
Songs with pictures
Song and the same thing, with pictures
I think we need to see you improving more.
I want a centralized location for everything instead of having equipment in every house.
Piano, computer, and marrow.
Frankly, I wish we could get some support.
For example, a company.
So disk
And they allocated us a place in Parviz.
We work for ourselves.
Oh God, at the end of the day, we're still working on this project.
We don't want that.
It's nothing but what Joseph said.
We need a video clip.
"And the owl"
Music videos help wisdom spread quickly.
It conveys the ideas clearly.
If there's support, everything else will fall into place eventually.
And let your sweet voice be everywhere.
Arts deal with various issues and problems.
Thank you for coming, Youssef Al-Nemi and Salman Al-Abdullah.
Let's meet them and invite them on behalf of our program, and wish them all the best, guys.
These projects were, yes.
There's also a project that's almost ready, but it needs some minor technical development.
Expiry Date
When you go to the warehouse, you already have the total and all the details.
He identifies the goods instead of reading the components of each item.
He went and didn't come back until evening.
Attached to the trolley, so that one can choose the material they want.
Most projects are a reflection of children's feelings towards a problem.
There are many activities and goals.
The center offers a variety of programs and activities that focus on one central idea.
Ten goals did HH Sheikha Moza set in establishing the center.
Type it, also yeah
This takes him directly to the underground train from his house.
I just thought it was for clothes.
All stores in Qatar that sell t-shirts will appear.
And likewise with the remote, I press the button.
It finds the things I lost and takes me to the key.
Okay, let's get back to the projects the center is working on.
What is early childhood education?
Developing skills and nurturing talents
It varies among children according to their different skills, media, and research skills.
Personal skills, such as public speaking, persuading audiences.
Skills vary, and we've developed a special program to cater to them.
We started with **Future Media**, we did a **really great** job on this project, we've **reached the conclusion**, the project is **complete**.
And we also took the numbers of the children and the young speakers.
... and their creativity ...
You have young presenters.
For the sake of television, it's important for them to air children's programs.
We are preparing them for the TV.
Through their television, Qatar TV
We prepare them until they turn eighteen.
We welcome them wherever they are.
This is also the national television.
نحتاج نكتشف ونستقطب المواهب هاي ونطورها.
We saw if magma, albihath
Intellectual dimensions
Reading and other diverse fields
Collaboration? Exchange of ideas?
In all regions, like the Promising Preachers Program, sponsored by the Ministry of Awqaf.
Our exhibitions, the exhibition generation is also
The Science Club played a crucial role in improving projects and also provided technical support.
The main role was the Higher Education Council, through supporting schools and partnerships.
Mr. Abdullah, you are moving to a building like Katara.
Those who also embody a range of activities and clubs.
Imagine?
Along with moving to a separate building
Regardless of the enormous size
Making the interaction with the public easier.
These are entrepreneurial and excellent projects.
And in receiving the guest and introducing him to the programs presented to the child.
This is our main project for the next three years.
National Reading Development Project
Under the patronage of Sheikhessa Hessa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani
I adopted and supported this project.
A big project, which is reading development, writing stories and developing children.
Cultural changes in reading specifically
There are programs for everything.
We moved the deadlines.
And let's organize some activities.
Its design and development are tailored to suit Katara visitors.
We wish you success through this center.
This contains very important ideas.
First, I'd like to thank you for your hospitality.
The most important thing is that the more we deal with children, the more we discover that
Today's childhood is different from ours.
They need more care, focus, and longer time.
Listen to his inclinations, his imagination.
Talk to him.
They ... treat their children like a hotel, providing accommodation.
Or like a bank, it saves money.
The kids really need someone to listen to these ideas, the imagination.
In the last few days, they transferred us to Two Three Zero.
At this exhibition
I wish success to the projects that won.
Thank you for your presence, Professor Abdullah Al-Jaraimilli, Director of the Cultural Child Affairs Center. We wish you success.
For these projects to become a reality and not remain a lifelong dream.
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. The Qatar Cultural Center for Children was launched last night at the Diplomatic Club.
Closing ceremony of the exhibition "The Future Generation and Its Dreams" under the slogan "Dreams of a Generation, Facts or the Nation of Tomorrow"
Organized on the occasion of Qatar National Day, with the participation of more than seventy children from Qatar.
There were a lot of activities and some competitions at the exhibition.
And creative projects from children
Praise be to God for your safe return. Welcome, Sheikh Abdullah Al Ali, Director of the Children's Cultural Center. May your morning be blessed, and a warm welcome. It is a great pleasure to have you among your family and loved ones.
Good morning, my dear sister.
First, I'd like to thank you for giving us your time.
He talks about this exhibition, that's really distinctive.
We are happy to have you here with us on the program to cover as many activities of the exhibition as possible.
This is the homeland's exhibition for generations of their dreams.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, this exhibition.
At the Cultural Childcare Center's contribution
To celebrate the National Day
"Who was"
In an attempt to calm the children
Coexist with antipathy.
With the project
This project or dream
Children's imagination is very vast.
So well-made it is not limited to three to three.
And other major areas in Qatar's Vision, 2030
We started training children in four stages.
And then, I thought about the brainstorming mechanism and the tools that expand the scope of thinking.
What exactly does this term mean?
Facts, not tomorrow's nation.
What the child dreamed about today.
It's growing and the project is growing.
In fact, this was the true explanation of the vision, that the children will live from today.
With a big dream
Qatari development, health, human development, or any other field
Who serves the country.
I think when we know there are children somewhere.
Or at a specific exhibition
All that was available via
The exhibition also featured guest of honor.
Children learn from them, they are role models.
Yesterday, a day or two ago, there was *
There were also two more winners of various awards in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
There was a schedule to present their projects.
Yes, and the pictures are the best proof of what you're saying.
A collection of photos for the exhibition and various activities.
Here too is the last project, the forest.
We want to talk about the colored ball.
As a good circle, we can make it simpler for the viewers. This is one of the children's inventions.
What exactly is this topic, the colored ball, let's talk about it.
Suddenly, there are four or five projects dealing with this subject, one of them is the colored ball.
And they called him the Smart Professor, and also
After the ball goes out of the field.
Colors differ.
"Benefits are wide in proverbs."
What's coming, after all these dreams?
And related to things within his field of interest.
I specifically assume, when there are commissioned people taking these small projects from small minds, taking into consideration. Explanation: The translation aims to capture the nuances and specificities of Qatari Arabic, including appropriate vocabulary and conveying the intended tone.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Think about the idea of a colored ball.
Does he love her?
Yes, he visited projects related to football.
"We endorsed and adopted these projects as soon as we saw them."
And also adopted these projects.
This is what our children have done, people voted for many projects.
Okay, what were the core projects that received the most votes from people?
There is an evaluation committee that has a way to evaluate projects.
The first, second, and third projects that won the awards.
The forest, took first place.
He was very precise in the details of the projects, and the project was ready for implementation.
Surely it needs many administrative elements.
There were very detailed descriptions in the brochure distributed to visitors.
Surely the pictures we see now are the ones you're talking about.
This is part of the big projects.
They might be trying to do what they see in movies and cartoons.
True indeed, part of it is taken from the institutions.
We call them projects, what are these projects?
Collect it, use it, and put it in the recycle loop.
Two hundred and forty-seven students
The Qatari community celebrated yesterday the graduation of 2407 students of the 33rd batch.
And His Excellency Dr. Khalid bin Mohammed Al Attiyah, Minister of State for International Cooperation
Many relatives and teachers
And the university is celebrating today the graduation of seven hundred and seventeen female students.
We would like to thank our colleague Salman Al-Majidi, and we will remain in the same artistic atmosphere. We will have a very dear guest today.
I am from the family of the series "Tasnif", the actor Abdelhamid Charchni.
He stands out through many works such as "Hearts for Rent."
And they worked hard to prove their worth in the art scene.
Especially since the field of art does not know flattery.
What does that mean?
Good health to you and good morning. I'd like to say good morning to the viewers.
No, I'm a fan of the cast in the show.
We'll see a very short scene from one of your works, and then we'll start talking to you.
Are you messing with me?
Take the beaten coat and the original pocket.
Go to hell.
You have the cloak, bring it.
What? Give me the bisht, bring it! How can I bring it?
The ram has already ground it in his stomach, damn it.
I am a member of a committee of five members.
On the conference's steering committee.
I agree with you.
I don't have any objection.
This is a quick look, a very short part of the "Classification" series that we'll be watching the second part of.
We would like to ask you about your participation this year in Part Two.
Can you tell us about the parts where the series "Tesaneef" has a different topic in each episode?
What's your contribution? Can you tell us about it?
Sure, later.
She went through a tough time.
Famous times later on the mountain.
The comet that the poet described long ago
When history is a witness and a memory in the cities.
It shows how old its history is.
Mina is seventy kilometers north of the capital, Riyadh.
Many believe it was named after Imru' al-Qais ibn Ka'b.
It is distinguished by its monuments, the sweetness of its water, and the purity of its air.
The slogan, inspired them, were amazed, became famous, by their famous mountain, Kumait.
They call it Comete Broc.
He strayed from the religion, but the truth is in the Quran.
Founded before Islam
There were some old items with unknown histories, such as the well of Khalid ibn al-Walid.
Who are we in this?
The Prophet's companion Khalid ibn al-Walid (may Allah be pleased with him) ordered, during the time of the Ridda Wars, the digging of this well.
Still remaining until now.
The proverb says, "In unity there is strength," and I guarantee you success.
If you see a comet, then you can see a meteor.
Other effects include Cometa Brook.
It's a spring that has flowed over the years.
A whole year is enough for the city.
From the beginning of the rainy season to the start of the next season.
And the date of establishment of these ruins is unknown.
And among them is the bride, and they are...
The Komait or Mountain Komait is considered one of the main landmarks of the city of Merir.
There were many proverbs based on this mountain, poetry, and sayings.
Many people from different places in the kingdom are coming to him.
One of her important works is **Oasis of the Parents**.
These are because he stayed in Medina during the Wars of Apostasy and was on his way to Yamamah.
He camped there and ordered men to dig this well.
Who still drinks from its water and swims in it?
Yaqut al-Hamawi mentioned in his dictionary of places that Khalid passed through Mara.
An old mud-brick house was restored to its original condition.
It consists of different sections reflecting the architecture, heritage, and antiquities of the region.
The poet once said of her: "When we passed by the water, we found no water."
We come from the Andromeda Galaxy, not the Milky Way.
Aymen, whatever is decreed by God, there is cooperation between the family, guardians, the center, and also the child.
And I think that various defrosting options can be used during the process, allowing it to be one unit and utilizing all these defrosting options.
Generally, to facilitate the training process.
Whenever anyone comes to us, whether it's an intern, a student, or a child,
This record contains his full personal information.
Even his monthly marks, for example, he has an evaluation every month.
We were responsible for a minds program.
Every four sessions, there's a report.
Guards via a password and username,
We gave it to him, he can reach up to?
Yeah, he can see the level he's reached since he's still registered at the center.
Ah, we have different models that we see.
We have a daughter.
With Mr. Ibrahim, who will be connecting with us later,
We see different models, I wish we could expand the space enough.
However, we brought a model of a girl.
You see a different test before you go live.
We ask her math questions and various questions.
We have a short break and then we'll be back with you to see this clever person. Stay with us.
The actor's performance, the audience is very smart now.
If any show catches his interest from the first, second, or third episode, if he feels he has no interest in the show he's watching, he'll use the remote.
He doesn't stop talking; he has twenty-one thousand other series.
Okay, twenty thousand Syrian pounds, final offer.
Twenty thousand episodes. Some people don't do that, they focus on one work.
He can see the other jobs.
True, that's the majority.
I always watch TV in Ramadan.
Welcome, welcome! May God bless you and keep you with us. It is our duty and your right. We can't do without you, nor can you do without us.
Do you want to say something to the viewers, or to the people who love you? I'm definitely one of your fans.
Do you want to say something?
I tell them, "May you be well and healthy every year."
You're right, we don't go out much, we don't show up much, and we don't act much for the reason, I mentioned the reason before.
What's coming is better.
God willing, we wish you every success in your endeavors this year.
God willing, if Allah permits, we will have another interview with you so that we can discuss these plays.
Everything leads to the other.
Fashion shows are very popular among many people and are anticipated due to the new trends they love.
Welcome, dear viewers, to Sabah Al-Doha. We are live with you.
Surely today we are talking about the Skills Development Center and a group of students who were registered at this center.
This center offers a diverse range of sciences.
They are certainly focusing on developing the second capabilities.
And also to make their minds fully work.
Nasma's aunt and Ayman's uncle made me the CEO of the Skills Development Center.
Welcome and good morning.
Welcome to be with us.
And with us is the sweet Amani, good morning, Amani.
Good morning.
How old are you, dear?
I am in the seventh grade.
Oh God, what a wonder, we wish you all the best.
What are the resources available for our sons and daughters?
This has been clarified with Mr. Ayman and Ms. Nesma and was specifically directed for the benefit of our children.
Which is the Minds program for mental math.
By fingers and abacus.
To achieve certain objectives, we attempted to demonstrate a portion of it.
I don't understand what you're asking. That appears to be a series of letters without forming a coherent word or phrase in any language I recognize. Could you please rephrase or clarify your request? If it's a code or abbreviation, please provide context.
And after that, maybe three or four months?
Whether taught in public, private, or even independent schools,
In short, the program scientifically works on specific methods.
After completing the first level of the program,
Where does it show you the missed opportunities or what you need to keep developing?
Has it reached a certain level or what updates have been made to the child?
So, we're working on a scientific method, a scientific program.
It's not just methods and mechanisms that are applied in a routine way;
But in a scientific way and in an organized manner.
Before the program starts and after he completes this course or the levels he has passed.
Mr. Ibrahim is with us now, as you can see, viewers, Oumaya is one of the students who registered at this center.
We wanted to do this live today to show you, our viewers, how important this is.
If you'll bring back the Besht, I don't have any objection.
So this is a very fast clip and a very small part of the "Classification" series, and we'll see the second part.
But as we've seen, this part of the series wasn't as good as the first part.
Can you tell us a bit about your roles in the series "Tasnim," where each episode covers a different topic?
This year, focus on doing it.
Negligent Fazil
Those who are encouraged by giving opportunities.
You have six rings on your fingers.
He will be a director in an episode, an episode that will feature an old man and an episode that will feature a baker.
This means various episodes.

We learned
Rashid and Mohamed Adel's faction.
You, surely
Without me, the young actors won't move.
In Qatar now, how many jobs do we have? We have two jobs per year.
Qatar Television, after producing dramatic works, what else can we say?
Qatar Television provides an executive producer.
Qatar Television did their best, but with only one show a year, all Qatari actors want to work.
And that was the reason.
My response to you was: It's just one series, and all the Qatari actors want to work on it.
"That means if someone finds a scene, they should praise God."
Praise be to God, for everything.
Oh God, let's go back to the beginning.
Sure, I'd like to say thank you very much.
I consult him on various matters.
Sure, the actor Abdulaziz Jassim from The Human Judgment, after the disk even yes or no.
I started writing to him in Twitter when he became the first Arab actor to join Bollywood. Abdulaziz Jasim, but we saw him on TV and in Twitter.
He is the one who raised us, taught us, and cared for us.
I won, yesterday I entered a competition on souls, I paid seriously in the winner of the Touche 2000.
So that he gives us opportunities as youth.
They work from thirty to thirty-two hours a week.
We have two jobs a year, so thank you, thank you, Tara.
The Deadly Feeling is also produced by Tara Arts.
The director of the series is Mr. Monir %PW.
We're back, dear viewers, and today we're talking about reflexology.
The message is in the palm, the palm of the hand.
This treatment was indeed practiced, since ancient times.
We have a guest.
The examination method is as follows.
The pain is increasing, how severe is it?
You can feel inside the hand that there is something like sand or broken veins inside the hand.
Let go of my hand.
My brother is feeling stressed.
Pressure calculation with Facebook: Reduce, reduce.
The gang, the northern side.
Now, dear viewers, we are examining the left side of his body.
So they know what we're doing.
Any health problem would be obvious, now we know about his headaches and dizziness.

Pain means problem.
Problem! What does this problem mean in this case?
In this case, the cavities of the nose, ear.
Eng: Hey, what's up? Is there a problem with the signals or any other issue? Eng: Hey, what's up? Is there a problem with the signals or any other issue?
I had surgery, but that was a long time ago.

He gains weight without eating.
Okay, your left shoulder.
These are nerves; when I told him he had tense nerves.
Ten years ago today, he walked barefoot on the beach.
We know that when someone walks on the beach, they expect it to be empty.
Any land that is tilted is not just the sea.
Negative energy can %PW.
And perhaps he was surprised that you discovered these things through massage.
Sure, the kids are the most important thing.

Then, you'll see the gases suddenly rise.
What are the discoveries you are making, Mr. Abdulaziz?
But it's less than the other problems, now people suffer from rheumatism, bones, headaches, thyroid and obesity.
The second thing is period cramps or period pain in general.
Focus on a stone or stones, press here, you give orders Allahu Akbar, the lower back and menstrual problems. If you have pain,
In seconds, if God wills, it will disappear.
The pregnant woman
Delivery has become easier for her.
Either here or there, God knows best.
If they tell her there's a chance she could give birth in the seventh month, or she might give birth in the ninth.
Against your will, sand will become glass.
If you walk on sand, it's fine, but if you walk on rocks, no.
You have to break your fast with seven soft dates, the soft ones are better.
If she doesn't have dates, dates are enough.
As Allah, the Most High, says, "I seek refuge in Allah from the accused Satan." My discovery is from the Quran.

Praise be to Allah, and we seek help from His Word.
You need to get some small rocks or balls.

Make charity a habit and also take care of others. You were created to worship God and then
To serve people, that's the first thing. Second, I'm not a cleric or a sheikh, I'm an ordinary person.
I would like to thank you, Mr. Abdulaziz, for this wonderful interview, and I also thank our guest.
Thank you for coming, and I wish you all the best.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al Thani, Director of Public Affairs at the Ministry of Health and the Supreme Council of Health, will elaborate further on this.
Good morning, Sheikh.
Let's start and see these activities.
The Health Program: Steps Towards Qatar
Program and what happened and obesity and national and
Several Gulf states are among the world's highest in obesity rates.
We have launched a strategy at the Supreme Council of Health, of course with the participation of the Ministry of Education and other authorities, to combat obesity.
His fears of its spread are growing and growing soon.
One of the programs that protect against obesity is Healthy Steps for Qatar.
We can organize this competition together, so it becomes an international one.
The program consists of weeks.
Every week has a different taste from the next.
To introduce seventh and eighth-grade students to the importance of health at this age,
Because this is the first time there is self-awareness.
The first week, what do you remember it was about? Like, what was your favorite fruit?
The second week is walking.
Walk! Every step you take, he gets points.
This is a difficult task as the provided text appears to be in a dialect of Arabic that is not easily recognizable. A rough translation attempt would be: "It's hard to succeed and everyone who tries very hard goes very far, attends very good schools, and achieves a lot."
So, a beautiful competition among the students is created.
In the second week, Mai drinks water, we don't drink Pepsi.
We tell him to drink water, there's no need to drink that much 7UP every time you feel thirsty, don't drink water!
Then, in the fourth week, your favorite game.
There are games in school, some don't like them,
Let's watch sports because he loves it.
So we can force him to exercise.
The children are eating a healthy meal.
And his family knows they should let their children eat a healthy meal.
And Al Jazeera Academy, an academy for girls and young people, so we can take.
Surely this is a model, and with its success, God willing, we will expand the experiment in the coming years.
The students are happy and feel more energetic.
We need more games, we enjoyed a lot with our colleagues.
The girls say their skin is better now, the pimples have decreased.
True, true, and this becomes awareness.
Parents know about their children.
And their peers in different classes, asking them how are you? And learning from their peers.
And also, praise be to God, this large number of schools are beginning to spread, eager to participate next year from now.
Insha'Allah.
Qtel was the official sponsor in supporting this.
We had Aspire Zone, which provides sports competitions and awareness.
He was born in a dairy.
And we, praise be to God, have many authorities, some of whom I mentioned and promised.
But praise be to God, everyone participated in part.
And secondly, the brothers were doing it in the form of separate lessons, a curriculum, or
There was variety.
We tried to do different types and involve as many people as possible.
Future Generations
To distribute and spread this experience as much as possible in Qatar.
When you move in, there's something you need to fix.
After its spread and now with satisfactory results,
Insha'Allah we will publish because there are people asking us why we weren't there.
Eat, eat healthy food and you'll get there, you don't have a problem.
When we are at this age, and when it starts from a young age, it reaches those who want it by the age of twenty or twenty-five.
You mentioned a series of titles, each group has a title.
If we return, we'll try to make our segment today about the conclusion of the activities.
If we mentioned people a second time in our program, we had more than one guest.
Let's repeat and **what were the details for each week that we wanted to convey to the student?**
Okay, first of all, of course, the first weekend of your favorite fruit.
Every lesson was about fruits and their benefits.
What are the benefits of vitamin C fruits?
He started to like some fruits, not all fruits are his enemies.
He might be allergic to one or two, but why doesn't he eat the rest?
The second week is walking, people think walking is just for big kids, and why should young people walk?
So when I grow up, I'll walk.
On the contrary, you walk because it soothes your heart and mind.
It eases the person, meaning they walk with a clear mind and their condition improves.
I let the students walk around.
Yes, they were all required to walk, whether at home or at school.
They verify their points through the subject teacher.
Treat those who walk in it every day.
This was an event, where people organized a march, and the girls' school also organized a march.
Our parents love this, it's creative and has unique ideas.
The competitive spirit and teachers need to think outside the box; we don't want them to be given ideas that they have to cling to.
Everyone has their own expertise in this area.
Sure, the third week is about drinking water. We constantly try to get them to drink water so they don't feel thirsty and don't crave cola.
Sure, the fourth week is your favorite sport.
If we can find out his favorite sport and support him in it,
Bacon is interested in sports.
Their love for sports is through play; he engages in sports unconsciously.
We said before that we are talking about the Qatar Multiple Sclerosis Society.
Welcome and greet our guest who is with us today in the studio.
Thank you.
We are happy to have you here at this exhibition.
And part of it is this disease that some of us may not have heard of.
Initially, as the Egyptians say, we go straight to the point.
It is a chronic disease.
This effect on the nervous system in the person's body.
The duration is from twenty to forty years.
This disease remains untreated, and the cause of suffering from this disease is unknown.
It affects the active group in society, which is usually the youth.
The treatments that deal with carcinogenic patients, may God protect you from any harm to the head or other diseases.
This disease is an inflammation of the brain, nerves, and spinal nerves.
What is the central nervous system in the human body?
The entity implicitly assumes that a foreign entity is entering the entity.
A neuron is
Cover this wire.
White cells or white blood cells start to kill or dissolve this insulating layer.
Which lead to the lack of access to the nerve signal, or weakness, or interruption.
Leads to paralysis, may God protect you.
Despite advancements in medicine, there is still no cure for this disease.
Okay, apart from the solution, we want to know how to get it.
He should have protection from this.
The main reason is, quality of life, nature of food or life cycles?
Or what is the direct cause that makes a person suffer from this disease?
Everything we have now is theories.
Even through marriage.
They are trying to solve human health problems.
Yes, yes.
All these topics can be controversial in some way within society.
So far, we know its causes.
Okay, the age group that can have this disease, multiple sclerosis.
Of both sexes.
Certainly, after forty years, the disease starts to calm down with the person.
So far, we haven't been able to find a cure for this disease.
Is that an indication of a large population in the Gulf, the Arab World, or specifically in Qatar?
In Saudi Arabia, statistics indicate that they have twenty-five thousand cases.
And Qatar.
In the past two weeks, specifically last week, I was informed of approximately three to four diagnosed cases.
Currently, we have one hundred and twenty-five patients, and that's what's recorded in the files.
Many people, when diagnosed with this disease, go to other countries for treatment.
Oh, Mr. Abdulaziz, what are the symptoms of someone who has this illness?
Are there specific signs that indicate the patient or their family may have multiple sclerosis?
And how many people does this virus, for example, kill.
We should be clear about this, it's not a virus.
Due to the nervous disease, nerves control the whole body.
In providing a specific reason for a particular location, the nature of the food, or the lifestyle.
