"Hishakkiah was the father of Azariah. Azariah was the father of Amoz. Amoz was the father of Uzziah."
Joshua became the father of Jekuthiel and his brothers. In those days, the Jewish people were taken captive to Babylon.
Then the family line continued through Rehoboam. Rehoboam was the father of Abijah, and Abijah was the father of Asa.

Jacob is the father of Joseph. Joseph is the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Christ.
So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the carrying away into Babylon fourteen generations, and from the carrying away into Babylon to Christ fourteen generations. Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband, Youssef, was a pious man. He didn't want to humiliate her publicly. So, he planned to divorce her quietly.
But while Joseph was considering this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
"She will give birth to a son. You shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."
All this has come to pass to lead to what the Lord said would happen. He said it through the prophet,
The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel, which means "God with us." (Isaiah 7:14)
Joseph woke up. He did as the angel of the Lord commanded him. He took Mary into his house as his wife.
But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And Joseph named him Jesus.
The wise men visit Jesus.
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in the land of Judah. This happened while Herod was king over the land of Judah. After the birth of Jesus, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem.
They asked, "Where is the child who has been born to be the king of the Jews? When we were in the east, we saw his star. Now we have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was greatly disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
Then Herod called the magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared. He sent them to Bethlehem and said, “Go and search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him.”
He said, "This is what the prophet wrote, and he said, '"
"But you shall have a house in the land of Judah, and you shall not be among the chief cities of Judah. Neither shall you come up among the princes of Judah. But a younger son shall come out of you, and he shall be a ruler over the people of Israel."
Then Herod secretly summoned the wise men and learned from them the exact time the star had appeared.
He sent them to a house that belonged to them. And he said, "Go! Carefully examine the child. And when he is born, bring me word. Then I too can go and worship him."
After the wise men had listened to the king, they went on their way. And behold, the star that they had seen when they were in the east went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, they were filled with joy.
The wise men traveled to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They bowed before him and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures. They gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their homeland by another route. The escape of Jesus' family to Egypt.
When the wise men had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child to destroy him."
Joseph arose. During the night, he departed for Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.
They remained there until the death of King Herod, thus fulfilling the words of the Lord spoken by the prophet: "I called my son out of Egypt" (Hosea 11:1).
Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him. He became very angry. He issued orders about Bethlehem and the surrounding area. All boys two years old and under were to be killed. This was in accordance with the time when the wise men had seen the star.
In this way, the words of the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled, for he had said,
A voice is heard in Ramah, wailing and great mourning. Rachel is weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted, because they are no more. (Jeremiah 31:15) The family of Jesus returns to us.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise! Take the child and his mother. Go to the land of Israel. Those who were seeking to kill the child are dead."
Joseph got up, took the child and his mother Mary, and returned to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee.
He has this, in the city which is called Nazareth. So were the words of the prophets fulfilled concerning Christ. They said, "He will be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days, John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Repent from what you do! The abode of heaven is near."
John is the person of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke. He said, "A voice cries out in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord. Make his paths straight.' " (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes were made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
The people came out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and from the region of the Jordan.
When they acknowledged their error, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Bear fruit in keeping with repentance.
Do not think that you can say to yourselves, "We have Abraham as our father." I tell you, God can raise up children for Abraham from these stones.
The axe is already laid at the root of the trees. All trees that do not bear good fruit will be cut down. They will be chopped up and thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water, calling you to the Torah. But after me comes one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will bring you the Spirit and fire.
His pitchfork is in his hand to clear the straw from his threshing floor. He will gather his wheat into the granary, but he will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire."
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. He wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to prevent him, saying to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you. Why do you come to me?"
Jesus answered, "Let it be so now. It is proper for us to do this. It fulfills God's holy plan." And John agreed.
As soon as Jesus came up out of the water, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him.
And a voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
**Yusuf is tested.**
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert, where the devil tempted him.
After forty days and forty nights of fasting, Jesus felt hungry.
Indeed, the tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'" (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple.
"If you are children of God," he said, "cast yourselves down. For it is written, 'He will give his angels charge over you, to guard you with care. On their hands they will bear you up, lest you dash your foot against a stone.'" (Psalm 91:11-12)
Jesus answered, "It is also written: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
"When you bow down and worship, you say to me, 'Give me all this,' he declared."
Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
Then the devil left Jesus. And angels came and attended to him. Jesus begins to preach.
John had been imprisoned. When Jesus heard about it, he returned to Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and went to live in the town of Capernaum, which was on the lake in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
In that way, what the prophet Isaiah said was fulfilled. He said,
Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where the Gentiles dwell. Land along the Mediterranean Sea! Region east of the Jordan River!
"They will see a great light. For those who live in a land of deep darkness, a light will shine." (Isaiah 9:1,2)
From that time on, Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Then Jesus called his first disciples.
One day, Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There, he saw two brothers, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake; they were fishermen.
"Come after me," said Jesus, "and I will make you fishers of men."
Immediately they left their nets and followed him.
Moving on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and he called them.
Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed Jesus. Jesus heals the sick.
Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every affliction among the people.
His fame spread throughout Syria. People brought to him all who were sick with various diseases. Some were suffering from severe pain. Others were possessed by demons. Some were violently shaking. Others were completely unable to move. Jesus healed them all.
Large crowds followed him. He led people from Galilee, from the regions known as the Ten Towns, from Jerusalem, and from Judea. Others came from the regions south of the Jordan River.
Christ bestows blessings.
Jesus saw the crowds. So he went up a mountain and sat down. His disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them, saying,
"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
Yes, those who mourn, will be comforted.
Blessed are those who are freed from pride, for they will inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for what is right. They will be filled.
Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. And they will persecute you.
They are the blessed ones, whose hearts are pure. They will indeed see their Lord.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
Blessed are those who suffer for doing what is right. The kingdom of heaven belongs to them.
"Blessed are you when they revile and persecute you for my sake. Blessed are you indeed when they say all kinds of evil lies about you for my sake."
Rejoice and be glad. Your reward in heaven is great. Likewise, people have persecuted the prophets who lived a long time. Salt and light.
You are the salt with which the earth was created. But suppose the salt has lost its saltiness. How can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything. People will throw it out.
You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden.
Likewise, a lamp is not brought to be put under a bushel basket, but to be put on a lampstand and to give light to all in the house.
Similarly, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven. Jesus clarifies the full meaning of the law.
No one should think that I have come to abolish what is written in the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. Heaven and earth will pass away before even the smallest letter of the law passes away. Not even the smallest stroke of a pen will disappear from the law until everything is accomplished.
Do not break even the least of these commandments, and do not teach others to break them. For if you do, you will be called the least important person in the kingdom of heaven. But if you keep and teach these commandments, you will be called important in the kingdom of heaven.
"This is what I tell you: You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you are not, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. Murder."
I have heard what was said to the people who lived long ago. They were told, "You shall not murder." (Exodus 20:13) Anyone who kills will be punished for it.
But this is what I tell you. Do not be angry with your brother. For everyone who is angry with his brother is liable to judgment. And whoever says to his brother, 'You fool!' is liable to the Sanhedrin. But whoever says, 'You idiot!' is liable to hellfire.
Suppose you are presenting your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you.
Lay your gift before the altar. First go and be reconciled with your brother; then come and offer your gift.
"If someone has a right against you, and he takes you to court, settle the matter quickly. Settle it while you are still together on the way, or that person may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison."
Here is the requested translation: **What I'm about to tell you is the truth. You're not leaving until you pay the last penny!** **Adultery**
You have heard that it was said: 'Do not commit adultery.' (Exodus 20:14)
But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
"If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. Your eye is just one part of your body. It is better for you to lose one eye than for your whole body to be thrown into hell."
"If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. Your hand is only one part of your body. It is better to lose it than to have your whole body go to hell. Divorce."
It was said: "Suppose a man divorces his wife. When he does, he must give her a certificate of divorce." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
But this is what I say to you: Anyone who divorces his wife causes her to commit adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. The only grounds for divorce are unchastity. Oath.
Once again, I have heard what was said to your people long ago. They were told, "Do not break the promises you make to the Lord. Keep the vows you have made to him."
But here is what I say to you. Never make any such promises at all. Don't make them in the name of heaven. This is God's throne.
Do not do it in the name of the Earth. That is the chair for the feet of the God. Do not do it in the name of Jerusalem. That is the city of the great King.
"Do not let your name enter your head, not even a single hair, neither white nor black."
Compel "yes" to mean "yes," and "no" to mean "no." Anything more comes from the devil. Be kind to others.
You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
But here's what I tell you. Do not resist an evil person. "If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek to them as well.
Let him take your shirt, then let him take your coat as well.
I was forced to go one mile. So, I went two miles with him.
Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away the one who wants to borrow from you. Love your enemies.
لقد سَمِعتَ أَنَّهُ قيلَ: "أَحِبُّ قَرِيبَكَ وَأَبْغِضْ عَدُوَّكَ." (اللاويين 19:18) لَكِنْ أَنَا أَقُولُ لَكُمْ: أَحِبُّوا أَعْدَاءَكُمْ وَصَلُّوا مِنْ أَجْلِ الَّذِينَ يَضْطَهِدُونَكُمْ.
But this is what I tell you: Love your enemies. Pray for those who persecute you.
"Then you will be sons of your Father in heaven. "He makes the sun rise on both the evil and the good, and sends rain on both the righteous and the unrighteous.
"If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Even tax collectors do the same."
"O Muslims, when a man greets his people until he makes room for them, he should do that. Is there anything equal to it except what is better? For it may be done by the people of hypocrisy."
Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Giving to the needy
Beware of doing good deeds in front of people. Do not do them for others to see. If you do, your Father in heaven will not reward you.
"O you who have believed, spend from the good things you have earned and from what We have produced for you from the earth. And do not aim for the defective when you give, unless you would only give up to people in need. And be not miserly when giving; indeed, Allah does not like the miserly. And those who spend their wealth in the night and the day, secretly and publicly - their reward is with their Lord. And no fear will there be upon them, nor will they grieve."
"When you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing."
Then your giving will be in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you. For He sees what you do in secret. Prayer.
"When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, who love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners, so that people may see them. I tell you the truth, they have already received their reward. "
When you pray, go into your room. Close the door and pray to your Father who is unseen. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret.
"When you pray, do not babble as the hypocrites do, for they think that they will be heard because of their many words."
Don't be like them. Your father knows what you need even before you ask him.
This is how you should pray: 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
Your kingdom come. May your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we also forgive those who sin against us.
Keep us from sinning when we are tempted. Save us from the devil.
Ask forgiveness for the believing men and women, and do not be swayed by those who are wrongdoers, even if they be your kin.
But if you do not forgive people their offenses, your Father will not forgive your offenses. Lent
"When you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces to show others that they are fasting."
"But when you go without eating, put olive oil on your head. Wash your face."
Then others will not know that you are fasting. Only your Father, who cannot be seen, will know. And he will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret. Take your treasures to heaven.
"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal."
"We will live on the path of the martyrs. Just as death and victory are not to be feared, do not pursue cutting [ties] and do not fear to shed blood for life."
Your heart will be where your treasure is.
The eye is like a lamp for the body. So, if your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light.
But suppose that your eyes are bad. Then your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. He will hate one and love the other, or be loyal to one and hate the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not be anxious.
I tell you, do not worry. Do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink. Do not worry about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?
"Do you not look at the birds in the sky? They do not sow, nor do they gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?"
Can you add even an hour to your life by worrying?
"And why worry about clothes? Look how the wildflowers grow. They don't work or spin clothes."
But here is what I say to you: Not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of these.
If God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
Don't worry. Don't say, "What will we eat?" or "What will we drink?" or "What will we wear?"
"For all these things the wicked strive. Your Father in heaven knows that you need them."
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
"Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."
Judge others kindly.
Do not judge others, and you will not be judged.
You will be judged by the same standards by which you judge others. You will be measured by the same measure you use to measure others.
You look at the speck of dust in your friend's eye, but you pay no attention to the plank in your own eye.
How can you tell your friend, "Let me take the splinter out of your eye," when there's a splinter in your own eye?
"You hypocrite! First, remove the plank from your own eye. Then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your friend's eye."
Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Ask, seek, knock.
Ask, and it will be given to you. Search, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you.
Everyone who asks will receive. And he who seeks will find. And to him who knocks, the door will be opened.
"If any of you asks for bread, does anyone give him a stone?"
Or opens for him the door of hunting. So who among you will give him a dream?
Even though you are evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will your Father who is in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!
In all things, do to others what you would want them to do to you. This is what is written in the Law and the Prophets. The great and small gates.
Enter the Kingdom of God by the narrow gate. The narrow gate is strait and the way is broad that leads to death and hell. Many people go that way.
But the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life, and only a few find it. A tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
Can you know their true nature by their actions? "Do people gather grapes from thorns? Do they pluck figs from thistles?"
Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree does not bear bad fruit. And a bad tree does not bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You can distinguish every tree by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father in heaven.
"Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord! Lord! Did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?'"
Then I will say to them plainly, "I never knew you. Depart from me, you who do lawlessness!" The wise and foolish builders
"Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock."
The rain falls. The water rises. The wind blows and beats against that house. But it does not fall. For it is built on the rock.
"But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand."
It rains. The water rises. The wind blows and beats against that house. And it falls with a loud crash.
Jesus finished saying all these things. The crowds were amazed by his teaching.
He studied like a gentleman. He did not talk like their scholars.
Jesus healed a man who had a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain. And great crowds followed him.
A man with a skin disease came to him and fell on his knees before Jesus. "Lord," he said, "if you are willing, you can make me clean."
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. He said, "I am willing to do this." "Be clean!" Immediately the man was cleansed of his leprosy.
Then he said to him, "Do not tell anyone; go, show yourself to the priest, and make the offering that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." A Roman said, "A Roman has believed!"
When Jesus came to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached him and pleaded for his help.
My lord, he said, "My servant lies in his house, unable to move. He suffers greatly."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
The commander replied, "Sir, I am not worthy to have you in my house. But just speak the word, and my servant will be healed."
"I myself am a man under authority, and I have soldiers who obey my commands. I say to this one, 'Go,' and he goes; to another, 'Come,' and he comes; to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed. He said to those who followed him, "Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with faith like this."
I tell you, many will come from east and west and take their places at the feast in the kingdom of heaven. They will sit with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
"But those who think they are of the kingdom will be cast into darkness, where they will weep and gnash their teeth."
Then Jesus said to the Romans, "Go your way; as you have believed, so let it be done to you." And his servant was healed in that very hour. Jesus healed many people.
When Jesus came to the house of Peter, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to wait for him.
And when evening had come, many who were possessed with demons were brought to him, and he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick.
He did it to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah had spoken: "He bore our sufferings and carried our diseases." (Isaiah 53:4) The cost of following Jesus.
Jesus saw the large crowd gathering around Him. So, He gave orders to His disciples to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
Then a man came to him who taught the Book. He said, "O teacher, I will not follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
Sir, let me first go and bury my father.
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me. Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus got into a boat. His disciples followed him.
Suddenly, a terrible storm swept across the lake. The waves crashed against the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
The explanation followed, and they awakened him. They said, "Master! Save us! We are believers!"
He replied, "You of little faith, why are you so afraid?" Then Jesus got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm.
The disciples were amazed. They asked, "Who is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!" Jesus healed two men who were possessed by demons.
Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake in the region of the Gadarenes. Two men possessed by demons met him. They came out of the tombs. The two men were so violent that no one could pass by on that road.
"Son of God, what do you want from us?" they cried. "Have you come to punish us before our time of judgment?"
Not far away, a large herd of pigs was feeding.
The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" And the demons came out of the men and entered the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.
Those who were tending the pigs fled and went into the town, and told everything, and what had happened to the demoniac men.
Then the entire town came out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they pleaded with him to leave their region.
Jesus healed a man who could not walk.
Jesus got into a boat. Then he crossed to the other side of the lake and arrived at his hometown.
Some men came to him, bringing a paralyzed man, carried by four of them. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
Then some of them said to one another, "This man is saying something great."
Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said, "Why do you have evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Which is easier to say: "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say: "Get up and walk"?
I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. Then he said to the man who was paralyzed, "Get up, take your mat, and go to your house."
The man stood up and returned home.
And when the multitude saw this, they were amazed: and they glorified God, which had given such power unto men. Jesus chooses when.
As Jesus walked on from there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting in the tax collector’s booth. “Follow me,” he said to him. And Matthew got up and followed Jesus.
Later, Jesus was at a dinner party at Matthew's house, and many tax collectors and "sinners" came and ate with Jesus and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus knew this, and said, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick."
"He goes away and learns what this means, 'I desire mercy and not sacrifice.' (Hosea 6:6) I did not come to call those who think they are righteous with God to follow me; I have come to make sinners follow me." Jesus is asked about fasting.
One day the disciples of John came to Jesus and said, "We and the Pharisees fast often. Why don't your disciples fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
People do not sew a patch of new cloth onto old clothes. The new piece will pull away from the old garment. This will make the tear worse.
Evening and suffering
While Jesus was saying this, a ruler came. He knelt before Jesus and said, "My daughter has just died. But come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
Jesus got up and went with him. So did his disciples.
Suddenly, a woman came up behind Jesus. She had been suffering from bleeding for twelve years. She touched the edge of his clothes.
She thought: "I only need to touch his clothes. Then I will be healed."
Jesus turned and saw her. "Daughter," he said, "your faith has healed you. Go in peace." And the woman was healed at that very moment.
When Jesus entered the ruler's house, he saw the flute players there. And he saw the mourning crowd.
He said, "Stand back. The girl is not dead. She's sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After the multitude had been sent away, Jesus entered. He took the girl by the hand, and she arose.
News about what Jesus had done spread throughout that region. In that area, news about what Jesus had done spread. Heals Two Blind Men
As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, calling out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus went indoors, the blind men came to him, and he asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" "Yes, Lord," they answered.
Then he touched their eyes and said, "Your belief will be granted to you."
They were able to see again. Jesus sternly warned them: "Make sure no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They talked about it all over that area.
As they were going out, another man who was demon-possessed was brought to Jesus. He was blind and mute.
When the demon had been cast out, the man spoke. And the crowd was amazed, and they said, "Never has anything like this been seen in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons." There are only a few workers.
Jesus went through all the cities and villages. He preached in their synagogues, and proclaimed the gospel of the kingdom. He healed every disease and infirmity.
When he saw the crowds, he felt deep compassion for them. They were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
"Ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest field."
Jesus sends the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples and gave them authority to cast out evil spirits and to heal every disease and every sickness.
Here are the names of the twelve apostles of Christ. First, Peter Simon and his brother Andrew. Then comes James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
Next are Philip and Bartholomew, also Thomas and Matthew, the tax collector. And two others are James, son of Alphaeus, and Thaddeus.
And those who followed him were Simon the Cyrenian, and Alexander and Rufus. And he was delivered up to the Gentiles.
Jesus sent out the twelve with these instructions: "Do not go among the Gentiles," he said. "Do not enter any town of the Samaritans."
You lead yourselves to what is good. They are like a lost sheep.
Believe, as you go, proclaim this message: "The kingdom of heaven is at hand."
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.
Do not take any gold, silver, or copper in your belts.
Don't take a bag for the trip. Don't take extra clothes or sandals or walking sticks. The worker must be given what he needs.
"Upon entering a town or village, seek out someone willing to host you. Stay in that person's home until you leave."
When you enter a house, greet those who live in it.
If that house welcomes you, grant it your blessing of peace. If not, do not grant the blessing.
Some people may not welcome you or listen to your words. If they don't, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that house or city.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. On the Day of Judgment, it will be easier for the people of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town.
I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as prudent as serpents and as innocent as doves.
Beware! The men will hand you over to the local courts. They will whip you in their temples.
You will be brought before governors and kings because of Me. You will be witnesses to them and to the Gentiles.
But when they arrest you, don't worry about what you will say or how you will say it. At that time, the right words will be given to you.
It is not you who will be speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.
"The brother delivers up his brother to be killed. The father delivers up his child. The child rises up against his father and orders him to be buried alive."
Everyone will hate you because of me. But anyone who stands firm to the end will be saved.
"When they persecute you in one town, flee to another. Truly I tell you, you will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes."
The heart is not better than the tongue, nor is the neighbor better than the king, nor is the slave better than his master.
"It is enough nobility for a person that you are just, and enough for a servant that he resembles his master. If the master of the house is called 'Antique,' what do those who dwell there hope for?"
So do not fear your enemies. Everything will be by the opening. Everything will be by the breaking. Everything will be by the closing.
What I tell you in the dark, utter in the light; and what you hear whispered, proclaim on the housetops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father's care.
He even counts every hair on your head!
Don't be afraid. You deserve more than many birds.
And what about someone who says in front of others that he knows me? I will also say in front of my Father in heaven that I know him.
But what about someone who says in front of others that he doesn't know me? I will say in front of my Father who is in heaven that I don't know him.
Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
I have come to turn "sons against their fathers, daughters against their mothers, and mothers-in-law against their daughters-in-law.
A man's foes are those of his own household. (Micah 7:6)
"Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. And anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me."
"And whoever does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me." Explanation:
If anyone finds his life, he will lose it. If anyone loses his life because of me, he will find it.
"Whoever welcomes you welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me."
Let's assume that someone welcomes a prophet as a prophet. That person will receive the reward of a prophet. And let's assume that someone welcomes a righteous person as righteous. That person will receive the reward of a righteous individual.
Let's suppose that someone, even if it's just a single cup of cold water, gave it to a little child who follows me. What I'm about to tell you is true. That child will certainly be rewarded.
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus finished teaching his twelve disciples. Then he went to teach and preach in the cities of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked Jesus, "Are you the one who was supposed to come? Or should we look for another?"
Jesus answered, "Go back and tell John what you hear and see."
The blind see. The disabled walk. Those with skin diseases are healed. The deaf hear. The dead are raised. And the good news is preached to the poor.
"Blessed are those who do not place their faith in what I have said, for I have only said what God has said."
As his disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John. He said, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
If not, what would you go to see? A man dressed elegantly? No. People dressed elegantly are in the palaces of kings.
So what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
He is the person who was written about in the Bible. It is written, " 'I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.' (Malachi 3:1)"
"What I am about to tell you is true. No one born of woman has ever been greater than John the Baptist. Yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he."
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with power. And the violent take it by force.
All the prophets and the law they were prophesied with, until John came.
If you are willing to accept it, John is the Elijah who was to come.
"Those who have ears, let them hear."
"With whom can I compare the people of this age? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces, calling out to one another, saying, "
We sang you a dance song, but you didn't dance. We sang you a sad song, but you didn't cry.
When John came, he neither ate nor drank as you do. And people say, "He has a demon."
But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank, and they say, "Look at this man! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and 'sinners.' Those who practice wisdom prove that wisdom is right." Cities that do not repent of sin
Jesus began to denounce the cities where most of his miracles had been done, for they did not repent. He said:
"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes."
But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
"And what about you, Capernaum? Will you be exalted to heaven? No! You will go down to the place of the dead. I tell you, if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would still be here today."
"But I tell you this: On the Day of Judgment, it will be easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for one of you to enter the kingdom of God." - For whoever tires.
At that time Jesus said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants."
Yes, Father, this is what you wanted.
"My Father has given everything to me. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him."
"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."
You have become my representatives, so learn from me, for I am merciful and do not associate anyone with you. You will find comfort in doing so.
"It's an easy task for me, and my burden is light."
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On one of the Sabbath days, Jesus was walking through wheat fields. His disciples were hungry, so they began to break off the heads of wheat and eat them.
The Pharisees saw this and said to Jesus, "Look! It is against the law to do this on the Sabbath. But your disciples are doing it anyway!"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and his men?"
So he entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the sacred bread, which was not lawful for him or his companions to eat, but only for the priests.
Don't you know the law? It explains how the priests in the temple are to do their work every Sabbath. But they are not considered guilty.
I tell you that there is One here whose authority is greater than that of the temple.
The Bible says, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice' (Hosea 6:6). You do not know what these words mean. If you did, you would not bring charges against those who are innocent.
"The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
From that place, Jesus went to their synagogue.
There was a man with a withered and twisted hand. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
A man is worth more than sheep! Therefore, the Law permits us to do good on the Sabbath day.
Jesus said to him, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out, and it was restored, just like the other one.
But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus, the chosen servant of God.
Jesus knew all his disciples were aware of the ways of the Pharisees. So Jesus left that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But he warned them not to tell anyone.
This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah. He says,
My servants, I have chosen him. He is the one I love. I am very pleased with him. I will place my spirit upon him. He will proclaim to the nations that everything will be alright.
He will not argue or shout. No one will hear his voice in the streets.
It will not break a bent branch. It will not quench a flickering flame. It will put everything in its right place.
"The nations will put their hope in him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Biblical Zebbub
A man possessed by demons was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed the man. Then the man was able to speak and see.
All the people were amazed and said, "Could this be the Son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man drives out demons only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons."
He knew what they were saying. So he said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined. Every city or household divided against itself will not stand."
If the devil casts out the devil, he is divided against himself. How then shall his kingdom stand?
"He said, 'I cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul! Then by what power do your people cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.' "
But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Contemplate this. How can you enter the house of a strong man and take what the man has? You must first bind him. Then you can rob his house.
"He who is not with me is against me. And he who does not gather with me scatters."
Here is what I tell you: Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But speaking evil against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Whatever one says against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, neither now nor in the days to come."
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. Each tree is known by its fruit.
"You are a den of venomous snakes! How can evil people say anything good? Your mouths speak what is in your hearts."
**The good word and the latent good** Indeed, the pious utters good, and it springs from the good latent in his heart. **The evil word and the concealed evil** As for the wicked, he speaks evil, and it springs from the evil concealed in the depths of his heart.
But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken.
"With your words, you will find a guilty or innocent person." A wonderful sign for Leon.
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus. They said, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
He replied, "The evildoers and disbelievers ask for a sign! But they will not be given a sign except for the sign of Prophet Jonah, peace be upon him."
Jonah was in the belly of a huge fish for three days and three nights. Something like this will happen to "the Son of Man." He will spend three days and three nights in the grave.
"The people of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation. And the people of Nineveh will prove this generation guilty, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah. And behold, one greater than Jonah is here."
The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn them: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
What happens when an evil spirit comes out of a man? It passes through the dry places seeking a place of rest. But it does not find one.
He then says, "I will return to the house I left." And when he gets there, he finds the house empty. The house has been swept and put in order in the best possible way.
Then the evil spirit goes and takes with him seven other spirits more evil than himself. They go in and live there, and that man is worse off than he was before. That is the way with this generation of evil people." - Mary and her brothers
While Jesus was speaking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.
He was informed and told, "Your mother and brothers are outside, and they want to speak with you."
Jesus answered and said to him, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus pointed to his disciples and said, "Here is my mother! Here are my brothers!"
O you who have believed, every matter of obedience is specifically for Allah, His Messenger, and those who have believed. They are the ones who will receive blessings from their Lord and mercy. And it is they who are the successful.
The Farmer's Tale
On the same day, Jesus left the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
A large crowd gathered around him. Then he boarded a boat. He sat in it. All the people on the shore stood up.
Then he told them many things through stories, saying, "A farmer went out to sow his seed."
He sowed the seed in the ground. Some of it fell on the path. Birds came and ate it.
Some of the seed fell on rocky ground, where there was not much soil. The seedlings sprouted quickly, because the soil was not deep.
When the sun rose, it scorched the plants. They withered because they had no roots.
Another fell among the thorns. The thorns grew and multiplied, overwhelming the plants.
Other seeds fell on good soil. They produced a crop a hundred times, or sixty times, or thirty times as much as had been planted.
"Those who have ears, let them hear."
The pupils came to him. They asked, "Why do you use stories when you talk to people?"
He replied, "You have been given the opportunity to understand the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven. It has not been given to strangers."
Those who have that kind of knowledge will be given more. In fact, they will have too much. As for those who do not have that kind of knowledge, even what little they have will be taken from them.
That's why I use stories when I talk to people. I say, "They look, but they don't really see. They listen, but they don't really hear or understand."
In them the words of the prophet Isaiah come true. He said, " 'You will hear, but not understand. You will see, but not know what you are seeing.' "
Say, "He is the Most High, the Unique, the Omnipotent. He has power over all things, whether they exist or not. To Him belongs the command, and He deals with His servants as He wills, endowing them with varying abilities, some great and some small, and some invisible and inaudible, without a sound like that of a mule. Some are beyond the grasp of keen perception. And it is not possible for a human to know what was or what will be, for a human cannot know what was or what will be, cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause cause
"But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and blessed are your ears, for they hear."
What I am about to tell you is true. Many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you see, but they did not see it. They wanted to hear what you hear, but they did not hear it.
Listen! This is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message about the kingdom, but they do not understand. Then comes the devil and steals what was sown in their hearts. Those people are like the seed sown on the path.
Another sowed on hard ground. These are those who hear the word and immediately receive it with joy.
But they have no roots. Therefore they do not last long. They quickly fall away from the faith when troubles or persecution come because of the message.
Other seed fell among thorns. These are the ones who hear the word, but the worries of life, the seduction of wealth, and the desires for other things come in and choke what was sown, and it produces nothing.
But others received the seed that fell on good soil. These are the ones who hear the message and understand it. They produce a crop 100 times, 60 times, or 30 times what was planted. - The Parable of the Weeds
Jesus told the crowds another story. "This is what the kingdom of heaven is like," he said. "A man sowed good seed in his field."
ولكن بينما كان الجميع نائمين، جاء عدوه. زرع العدو بين القمح أعشاباً ضارة ثم ذهب. **Translation:** But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. The enemy sowed weeds among the wheat and then went away.
Wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
And his servants came unto him, and said, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? whence then hath it tares?
"An enemy did this," he replied. "The servants asked, 'Do you want us to go and pull the weeds?'"
"No," the owner replied. "While you're pulling the weeds, you might pull up the wheat with them."
Let them grow together until the harvest. Then I will tell the workers what to do. This is what I will say to them: 'First, gather the weeds. Bind them in bundles to be burned. Then, gather the wheat. Bring it to my barn.' " Parables of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast
Jesus told the crowd another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field."
It is the smallest of all your seeds. Yet when it grows, it is the largest of all the plants in the garden. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest in its branches.
Jesus told them another parable. "The kingdom of heaven," he said, "is like yeast. A woman took some yeast and mixed it into a large amount of flour. The yeast worked its way through all the dough."
Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables. He did not say anything to them without using a parable.
Thus was the prophet's prediction fulfilled. He said, "I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter hidden things, things from of old" (Psalm 78:2). Jesus explains the parable of the weeds.
Then Jesus withdrew from the crowd and went into the house. And His disciples came to Him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the tares in the field."
He answered, "The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man."
The field is the world. The good seed represents the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are those who belong to the evil one.
The enemy who sows it is the devil. The harvest is the day of judgment. The workers are the angels.
"The weeds are uprooted and burned in the fire. So it will be on the Day of Judgment."
The Son of Man will send out his angels. They will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.
They will throw them into the blazing furnace. There people will wail and gnash their teeth.
Then the people of God will shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom. Those who have ears, let them hear. Parables of the hidden treasure and the pearl.
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls.
He found one that was very valuable. So he went away and sold everything he had. And he bought that pearl. The parable of the net.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net. It was cast into the sea. It caught all kinds of fish.
When they were full, the fishermen drew them to shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish in baskets. As for the bad fish, they threw them away.
This is what it will be like on the Day of Judgment. The angels will come. They will separate those who did wrong from those who did right.
The wicked will be thrown into the blazing furnace, where they will be tormented and gnash their teeth.
Do you understand all these things?" asked Jesus. "Yes," they answered.
He said to them, "Every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure both new and old." A prophet without honor.
Jesus finished telling these stories. Then he left.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth. And there he began to teach the people in their synagogue. They were amazed. "Where does this man get this wisdom? Where does he get this power to do miracles?" they asked.
Isn't this the son of the stone mason? Isn't his mother's name Mary? Aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
"Aren't all his sisters with us? So where did this man get all these things?"
They were not at all pleased with him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home."
He performed few miracles there only because they were not believers.
John the Baptist's head severed
Herod, the tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, heard about Jesus.
He said to his disciples, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to perform miracles."
John was arrested. He was bound and put in prison because of Herodias, who was the wife of Herod's brother Philip.
John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have her."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he was afraid of the people, because they believed John was a prophet.
On Herod's birthday, Herodias' daughter danced to please Herod and his guests. Herod was delighted.
So he returned and vowed to fulfill all her wishes.
Her mother told her what to say. And the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very angry. However, he thought about his promise and his dinner guests. So he ordered one of his men to give her what she asked for.
Herod had ordered John's beheading in prison.
His head was brought in a large dish and given to the girl. Then she carried it to her mother.
John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed the five thousand.
Jesus hears about what happened to John. He wants to be alone. So he goes in a boat to a quiet place. The crowds hear about this. They follow him on foot from the towns.
And when Jesus came to the shore, he saw a large crowd. He felt deep compassion for them. So he healed their illnesses.
When it was almost evening, his disciples came to him and said, "This is a remote place, and it's already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves."
Jesus answered, "They need not depart; give ye them to eat."
"We have five loaves of bread and two fish," they answered.
"Bring them here to me," he said.
Then Jesus directed the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, and gave thanks. He broke the loaves into pieces and gave them to the disciples, who distributed them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. And the disciples picked up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and fish that were left over.
The number of men who ate is estimated at 5000. Women and children also ate. Jesus walks on water.
Jesus immediately directed his disciples to get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side of the Sea of Galilee. Then he dismissed the crowd.
After sending them away, he went up into the mountains by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.
The boat was already a long distance from land. They were being battered by waves because the wind was blowing against them.
Early in the morning, Jesus came to the disciples. He walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and were terrified. "It's a ghost!" they said, and wept in fear.
Immediately Jesus called out, saying, "Take heart! It is I. Do not be afraid."
"Lord, if it is you," Peter asked, "tell me to come to you on the water."
"Come," said Jesus. And Peter, getting out of the boat, walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid. And beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, "Lord, save me!"
Immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and caught him. He said, "O you of little faith!" "Why did you doubt?"
When they boarded the boat, the wind died down.
Then those on the ship worshiped Jesus, and said, "Truly you are the Son of God!"
They crossed the lake and landed at Gennesaret.
The men who lived there knew Jesus. So they sent a message throughout the surrounding country. And people brought all their sick to Jesus.
They begged him to let the sick touch the fringe of his garment. And everyone who touched him was healed.
What makes people "dirty"?
Some Pharisees and some teachers of the law came from Jerusalem to see Jesus. They asked,
لماذا لا يتبع طلابك ما يعلمه المعلمون؟ إن طلابك لا يغسلون أيديهم قبل تناول الطعام!
Jesus replied, "Why then do you not obey God's commandment? You prefer to follow your own teachings!"
Ask that your parents forgive you, and that they show mercy towards you, and that they be proud of you, O Lord, and that they be a source of strength for you, O Lord, and that you forgive your parents, O Lord, and that you be patient with them, O Lord.
But you allow people to say to their parents: "Any help you may have received from us is a gift specifically intended for God."
They do not need to honor their parents with their gift. You are making the word of God of no effect in order to follow your own teachings.
"O you who are called by the name! Isaiah spoke truly about you when he said,"
"They honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me."
"Their worship means nothing to me. They only teach human laws." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand."
What goes into your mouth does not make you 'unclean'. What comes out of your mouth is what makes you 'unclean'.
Then the disciples came to him and asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus answered, "There are plants that my Father in heaven did not plant. They will be uprooted."
"Leave them alone. They are blind guides. If a blind person leads another blind person, both will fall into a pit."
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Do you not yet understand?" Jesus asked them.
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes to the stomach. Then it comes out of the body.
But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these are what defile you.
أَخْبَاثٌ تَنْبَثِقُ مِنَ الْقَلْبِ. فَكَذَلِكَ الْقَتْلُ وَالزِّنَا، وَغَيْرُهُ مِنَ الْأَعْمَالِ الْمُشِينَةِ الَّتِي تَجْرِي minor minor minor minor minor minor minor minor minor minor minor minor minor
Those are the things that make you "unclean." But eating without washing your hands doesn't make you "unclean." "The faith of a Canaanite woman"
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Sidon and Tyre.
And a Canaanite woman, who lived near Sidon and Tyre, came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon."
Jesus said not a word. His disciples came to him and pleaded, "Send her away. She is following us and keeps crying out after us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the people of Israel. They are like lost sheep."
Then the woman fell on her knees before him. "Oh, sir! Help me!" she said.
He replied, "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to their dogs."
"Yes, sir," she said. "But even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
Then Jesus answered, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour. Jesus Feeds the Four Thousand
Leaving him there, he walked along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up into the hills and sat down.
A large crowd came to him, bringing with them the blind, the lame, the paralyzed, those unable to speak, and many others. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them.
The people were amazed. Those who had not spoken began to speak. The lame received their strength, the mute spoke, the blind saw, and the people praised the God of Israel.
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have compassion on these people; they have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."
His disciples answered him, "There is nothing here," they said, "but five loaves and two fish." "Where shall we get enough bread to feed this great crowd?"
How many loaves do you have? asked Jesus. "Seven," they answered, "and a few small fish."
Jesus told the crowd to sit down on the ground.
He took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples. The disciples distributed them to the people.
All of them ate and were satisfied. Afterwards, the disciples picked up seven baskets of remaining pieces.
The number of men who ate was 4000. Women and children also ate.
After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
Jesus asks for a sign of a miracle.
And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and testing Jesus, they asked Him to show them a sign from heaven.
He replied, "In the evening, you look at the sky. You say, 'The weather will be good. The sky is red.'"
In the morning you say, "Today will be stormy. The sky is red and cloudy." You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you cannot understand the significance of what is happening now.
**O you who have believed, it will increase you in faith and prefer you over the disbelievers and those who were given the Scripture before, they were wrongdoers. And when Moses said to his people, "Indeed,
The disciples crossed to the other side of the lake. They had forgotten to bring bread.
"Beware," Jesus said to them, "of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The disciples talked about this among themselves, saying, "He must be saying this because we didn't bring any bread."
He knows what you say. So He said, "Your faith is weak! Why do you talk among yourselves about the lack of bread?"
Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets you gathered?
Do you not remember the seven loaves for the four thousand? Do you not remember how many baskets you gathered?
How can you not understand? I was not talking to you about bread. But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not telling them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees. And Peter said that Jesus was the Christ.
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They answered, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
"But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you think I am?"
Gabriel, the angel of revelation, informed me that Allah, exalted and glorified be He, has said:
Jesus answered, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
Here is what I tell you. You are Peter. On this rock I will build my church. The gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Then Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Jesus speaks about his coming and his death.
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples what would happen to him. He told them that he must go to Jerusalem, where he would suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and teachers of the law. He would be killed and raised again on the third day.
And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. "Never, Lord!" he said. "This shall never happen to you!"
And Jesus said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus spoke to his disciples, saying: "If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself. He must take up his cross and follow me."
If he wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for my sake, he will find it.
"For how many a person has the whole world acquired, yet lost himself? Or what can anyone exchange for his soul?"
"The Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father, and his angels with him. And then he will reward each one according to his works."
"What I am about to tell you is the truth. Some of you standing here will not die before you see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."
Jesus' appearance changed.
After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John, his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
There before them, his appearance was changed. His face shone like the sun. His clothes became as white as light.
Then Moses and Elijah appeared to them, and they were speaking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
While Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them. A voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love. I am very pleased with him. Listen to him!"
When the disciples heard this, they were terrified and fell on their faces.
But Jesus came and touched them. "Get up," he said. "Don't be afraid."
When they looked up, they saw no one but Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. And as they were going down, Jesus commanded them that they should tell no man what they had seen, till the Son of man was risen from the dead.
The disciples asked him, "Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah has to come first?"
Jesus replied, "That is true. Elijah is to come and restore all things."
But I say to you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also will the Son of Man suffer at their hands.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus healed a boy who was possessed by a demon.
As they approached the crowd, a man came up to Jesus. He knelt down before him.
Oh sir, have mercy on my son. He trembles violently and suffers greatly. He often falls into the fire or into the water.
I brought him to your pupils. But they couldn't cure him.
"O you unbelieving and wicked people!" said Jesus. "How long must I stay with you? How long must I bear with you? Bring the boy to me."
Jesus commanded the demon to leave the boy, and it did. He was healed instantly.
Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why could we not cast it out?"
He replied, "Because your faith is so small. What I'm about to tell you is true. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, that's enough. You can tell this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."

جاءوا معًا إلى الجليل. ثم قال لهم يسوع: "إن ابن الإنسان يسلم إلى أيدي الناس."
"يقتلونه. في اليوم الثالث يقوم من الموت." ثم أتقن التبرئة.
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. There, the tax collectors came to Peter and asked him, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
"Yes, he does," you replied. When Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "From whom do the kings of the earth collect customs or taxes? From their sons or from others?"
"From others," Peter answered. "Then the children should not pay," Jesus said to him.
But we do not want to make them angry. So go to the lake and cast your line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. There you will find the coin you need. Take it and give it to them for my taxes and yours.
