Jesus called one of the children to him and had him stand among them.
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
 Anyone who becomes as free of pride as this child is the most important in the kingdom of heaven.   
May you always have someone who loves you in secret and calls you by your pet name.
But if someone leads one of these little ones who believe in me to sin? If he does, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and be drowned at the bottom of the sea.

 "If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It would be better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with only one hand or one foot than to go into hell with two hands and two feet. In hell the fire burns forever.  
From the heart's depth, I call out to Him, and He grants me what I seek and bestows upon me abundance in the great sanctuary.
"Don't mess with one of these kids. That's what I'm telling you. Their angels in heaven can go at any time to see my father in heaven."
Sorry,
"What do you think? Imagine a man has 100 sheep, and one of them wanders away. Will he leave the 99 sheep on the hills and go look for the one that wandered off?"
I know that what you've done is wrong, but I hope people will forgive you and things will get better.
It is the same with your Father in heaven. He does not want any of these little ones to be lost. When someone sins against you
 "If your brother sins against you, go to him. Tell him what he did wrong. Keep it between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won him back.   
"But what if he refuses to listen to you? Then take one or two others along with you, for a matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses." (Deuteronomy 19:15)
But what if he refuses to listen to the witnesses? In that case, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen to the church? In that case, don't associate with him, brother. Treat him as you would treat someone who does not fear God, or someone like a tax collector.
"What I'm going to tell you is true. What you close on earth will be closed in heaven. What you open on earth will be opened in heaven."
Again, here is what I'm telling you. Put two of you on the ground, agree on anything you ask. My father in heaven will do it for you.
"Wherever two or three are gathered in my name, I am there with them." The waiter had no mercy.
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.
A king wanted to gather all the money that was owed by his servants.
When the king saw what he was doing, they brought him a man who was worth millions of dollars.
The man was unable to pay. So his master gave an order: the man, his wife, his children, and all his possessions must be sold to repay the debt.
The servant fell to his knees before him. "Give me time," he pleaded. "I'll pay you back everything."
His master felt pity for him. He forgave him for what he owed and let him go free.
"But then the servant left and met one of the other servants who owed him some dollars. They started arguing. 'Give me back what you owe me!' he said."
"The servant fell to his knees. 'Give me time,' he pleaded. 'I'll pay you back.'
But the boys stopped and went out, leaving their friend behind.
The other servants saw what had happened. It troubled them greatly. They went and told their master everything that had occurred.
Then the master called the first servant who came in. 'Wicked servant,' he said to him, 'I forgave you all that you owed me because you pleaded with me.'
You should have shown mercy to the servant as you sought mercy.
 In anger his master turned him over to the jailers. He would be punished until he paid back everything he owed.   
"This is how your father will treat you in heaven, even if you don't forgive your brother from your heart."
Jesus teaches about divorce.
 When Jesus finished saying these things, he left Galilee. He went into the area of Judea on the other side of the Jordan River.  
"He's too big to follow. Promote them there."
Some of the Pharisees came to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus replied, "What did you read at the beginning that the Creator made them 'male and female'? (Genesis 1:27)"
He said, "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife, and they will become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
She's coming, but he doesn't see her.
"So why did Moses command that a man could give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?"
Jesus replied, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard, but it was not like that from the beginning.
...What I'm telling you is...a man who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery. A man can only divorce his wife if she fails to fulfill her duties.
The disciples said to him, "If that's the way it is between a husband and wife, it is better not to get married."
Jesus replied, "Not everyone can accept the idea of remaining single. Only those who find help to live without marrying can accept this idea."
In Moroccan Arabic: **بعض الرجال لا يستطيعون الولادة لأنهم يولدون هكذا. البعض يولدون هكذا من قبل آخرين. والبعض يخلقون أنفسهم هكذا لخدمة مملكة السماء. ومن يقبل العيش هكذا يجب أن يفعل ذلك.** الأطفال يأتون إلى يسوع كثيراً.
Some people brought little children to Jesus, wanting him to place his hands on them and pray over them. But the disciples rebuked them.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me. Do not hinder them. For the kingdom of heaven belongs to people like them."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he went away. Jesus and the rich young man.
One man came to Jesus and asked, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to have eternal life?"
"Why are you asking me what is good?" "The answer: There is one who is good alone. If you want to enter the kingdom, obey the commandments."
"Who are these?" the man asked. Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness."
"Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) "Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
...the little boy...the little boy...the little boy...the little boy...the little boy...the little boy...the little boy...the little boy...the little boy...the little boy...the little boy...the little boy...the little boy...the little boy...the little boy...the little boy...the little boy
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell all you have, give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me."
And what person is it who is always welcoming and in need?
Then Jesus said to them, "What I'm telling you now is the truth. It is hard for the rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
"Again, I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."
When they heard this, they were truly amazed. They said, "Then who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter replied, "Hannah, we'll do anything to follow you! What reward will you give us?"
"What if death comes to you? The master
Everyone was deprived of life, mixed life, balanced life, harmonious life, and balanced life.
Eat more than the heat and more than the heat returns to the side.
**The Story of the Open-Minded Camels**
"The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard."
...He agreed to give them their salaries as always, a day before the service...Then he sent them to his grape garden...
"...He came to talk, and when he looked at his watch, it was around nine in the morning...He left again...He saw other people standing in the middle of the market...Some were standing, some were walking around...And there were those who stood still, doing nothing but standing in their place..."
He told them, "You too, go and work in my vineyard. I will pay you whatever is right."
"He went out again at noon and at three in the afternoon and did the same thing."
...At five in the afternoon, he went out and found them still standing there...He asked them why they were standing there all day doing nothing.
"No one is working for us," they answered. "He told them, 'You too, go work in my vineyard.'"
"When they came in the evening, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, 'Call the workers and give them their wages. Begin with the last ones hired, and then pay the first ones.' "
"The workers who work with the five o'clock shift have almost all arrived. Each one received their daily wage as usual."
Eva, when those who worked for the first ones came, they were expecting to get more. But each of them also received their regular daily salary.

'Those people who came later only worked for one hour,' he said. 'You paid them the same as us. We did most of the work and were under the scorching sun all day.'
The boss replied: "Agreed, I will treat you fairly. Are we agreed that you will work for the same salary as that regular day?"
Take your money and leave. I want to give the person who did the work for those first ones the same salary I gave you.
Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Do you feel inferior because you gave without measure to others?
"So the last will be first, and the first will be last." Jesus repeated about his coming to die.
Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. On the way, he took the twelve disciples aside to speak with them.
"We are going up to Jerusalem," he said, "and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death
Then they hand him over to a people who are not Jews. They deal with him sparingly and at intervals, they shackle and whip him, then strike him on the head. Then on the third day he rises from the dead!" And a mother asks for a favor from the Messiah.
Amirah and the boys entered the garden to enjoy themselves and play with Huday.
"What do you want?" asked Jesus. "She said, 'Grant that one of my two sons may sit at your right hand and the other at your left in your kingdom.' She asked that one son might sit on his right and another on his left."
"I don't serve her, she's asking for it." This is a slap in the face, a clear dismissal, "Ah," that's all.
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
...others heard about this...and they started getting angry at those two brothers.
Jesus gathered them all together and said to them, "You know who the rulers of the nations are, the ones who hold power over their people. Their chief officials are the ones who give them orders."
This is why everyone who comes after me will be dependent on you.
And whatever you may have, share it.
"Be like the Son of Man. He did not come to be served, but to serve and give his life as a ransom for many."
Jesus and his disciples were going from Jericho. A large crowd followed him.
Two blind men were sitting by the roadside. They heard that Jesus was passing by. So they cried out, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The crowd was ordered to stop. They were told to be quiet. But these two men shouted at the top of their voices, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stood up and called out to them. "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.
"Hand," "exhaustion," "we wash."
Jesus felt deep compassion for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately they could see. And they followed Him.
Jesus entered Jerusalem.
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them,
He told them, "Go to the village ahead of you. When you reach it, you will find a donkey tied up. Her foal will be with her. Untie them and bring them to me."
O Lord of the worlds, bestow upon them a special reward for their patience in the depths of darkness.
This is what was said by the prophet coming true. He says,
Say to the daughter of Zion, "Behold, your King is coming to you; He is humble, and mounted on a donkey, And on a colt, the foal of a donkey."
The students went and did what our Lord Jesus, peace be upon him, told them.
They brought a donkey and a stick. They placed them on top of their coats. Then Isa sat on top of their coats.
Some people spread their blankets too much on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
You argue with each other, and He gathers you together at the appointed time.
When he enters, she serves him. They are ashamed of each other.
The crowd answered, "This is Jesus. He is the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus drove out the merchants from the temple.
Jesus entered the temple area. He began to drive out all those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "You write, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer' (Isaiah 56:7), but you are making it a 'den of robbers' (Jeremiah 7:11)."
**Information and warnings are written on their labels and packages.
The big boss and the teachers saw the wonder that they did. They even saw the children in the area of the big one shouting our name for David's son. But as soon as they saw all this, they put their hands over their mouths.
"Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," answered Jesus. "Have you never read, 'From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise'?" (Psalm 8:2)
Then Jesus left the people and went outside the city to a solitary place. They followed him there on foot. He got into a boat and went to a secluded place. Apples dry up.
Lord, my daily bread was the food of the poor.
A man saw a tree by the side of the road. He went up to it and found nothing but leaves. He said to it, "You will never bear fruit again!" Immediately, the tree began to wither.
When they saw all this, they were astonished. "How did this fig tree wither so quickly?" they asked.
Jesus replied, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done."
"If you believe, you will receive what you ask for when you pray." The authority of Jesus is questioned.
...He entered the temple courtyard...while he was studying there...the kapapa and the elders of the people came to him...they asked him...By what authority are you doing this?...And he answered...Who gave you this authority?
Jesus answered, "I will ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
The beginning of goodness is to direct oneself to the Lord, whether one is standing or sitting.
But what if we said, 'of men'? We're afraid of people. Everyone thinks that John was a prophet.
So Jesus answered them, "I do not know him." Then Jesus said, "If I do not know him, I will not tell you how I do these things." The story of the two sons.
"What do you make of this? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first son and said to him, 'My son, go work today in the vineyard.'"
"No," the boy answered. "But then he changed his mind and went."
The father went to the other's child and said the same thing to him. The other replied, "I'm coming, my lord," but he left.
"Which of the two sons did what his father wanted?" "The first," they answered. Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
...The narrators...Once upon a time, in an ancient city filled with prosperity and splendor, there lived a wise and just king, renowned for his sagacity and discernment. He had three sons, each possessing unique qualities...
They heard another story. There was a man who had some land, and he planted a vineyard. He built a wall around it. He dug a winepress in it to press the grapes. He also built a watchtower. He rented the vineyard to some farmers. Then he went away on a journey.
As the harvest time approached, he sent his slave to the field. He told the slave to gather for him a portion of the crop.
...And the servants caught them...They beat one...They killed one...And they threw a stone at the third to kill him.
...That man sent more servants to the house...he sent more than he did the first time...and they dealt with them in the same way.
"Finally, he sent his son to them. 'They will respect my son,' he said."
"But the thieves saw the boy coming. They said to each other: 'This is the one who will take everything from the homeowner one day. Let's kill him. Then everything will be ours.'"
They gave him a drink from the bowl. Then they killed him.
"Where is the owner of the generosity going to come back from? What is he going to do with those people?"
"Those evil people will be destroyed," he replied. "Then the vine will be planted again in its own vineyard. They will give him his share of the produce at harvest time."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
Here is what I am telling you. The kingdom of God will take away from you and give it to those who will produce its fruit.
Everything that falls on this stone will break. But the stone will crush anything that falls on it.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard the parables of Jesus. They knew he was speaking about them.
"...they were going to arrest him...but they were afraid of the people...those people believed that Jesus was only a prophet."
The Wedding Story
Jesus told them other parables. He said,
"This is what the Kingdom of Heaven is like. A king prepared a wedding feast for his son."
Sala invited them to dinner. They told him to come. They said no.
"After that, he sent his servants. He told them, 'Tell those who are having dinner that I have found my dinner. I have slaughtered my butcher and fat sheep. Everything is ready. Keep eating the wedding dinner.'"
But humans are afraid, one said about a plate or the plate of happiness.
The fields are different because they have doors, palaces, and success.
The king was very angry. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed those murderers and burned their city.
When the king said to his servant, "The wedding feast is ready. But the people I invited were not worthy to come."
Walk to Rakan's place. Call someone to have dinner with him, you might find him.
...The servants went to the alleys...All the people they found, good and bad, gathered...They immediately started filling the wedding hall with laughter.
The king entered to see the guests; he noticed a man there not wearing wedding attire.
Peace be upon the school, and what were you like when you entered it this time? And how do you rate it?
"After the king told his servants, 'Tie his hands and feet. Leave him outside in the dark. People will trample on him and gnash their teeth at him.'"
Many are called, but few are chosen. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
They expelled the Pharisees. They made a plan to capture and kill anyone who preached the word of God.
"Send for his disciples," they said. "Send for the Herodians." "Teacher," they said, "we know you are a man of integrity. You teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't swayed by those who are popular or important."
"Yeah, tell us now, what do you think? Do you think you'll pay taxes to Cassius or not?"
But they neglected the other law, so the problem persisted.
Show me the currency with which the tax is collected." He brought him a silver coin.
Who is this picture of? And who is this speech by?
"Caesar's," they replied. "Then he said to them, "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's."
When she eats, they are amazed and leave her. When she speaks, they are amazed and leave her. When she speaks, they are amazed and leave her. When she speaks, they are amazed and leave her. When she speaks, they are amazed and leave her. When she speaks, they are amazed and leave her.
**The same day, the Sadducees came to Jesus with a difficult question. "Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote that if a man dies without children, his brother must marry the widow and have children for him. Now there were seven brothers. The first one got married, and died without children. The second brother took the widow and died without children. The third brother did the same, and all seven died without children. Finally, the woman died. So tell us, whose wife will she be in the resurrection since all seven were married to her?"**
"Tell your father to give me a bank check. Your father should give me a bank check. Your father
There were seven brothers among us. The first one got married and died. Since he had neither children nor anything, he left his wife to his brother.
Second, second, and second again, second, second, second time.
In the end, man dies.
"That's how it goes at the funeral, who will be his wife? All seven of them were married to her."
Jesus replied, "You are wrong, because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God."
In their death, the balance tilted against the children of adversity. They were not afraid in the face of evil. What matters is good in the gardens of good. What matters is good in the gardens of good. What matters is good in the gardens of good. What matters is good in the gardens of good.
"What about the dead when they rise? Haven't you read what God has told you?"
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." (Exodus 3:6) He is the God of the dead; he is the God of the living.
One of the best ways to learn this science is by practice.
The crowd heard the cry and did not want to answer Jesus. The crowd dispersed.
One of them was a man of authority, so he tried Jesus with a question.
"World," he heard, "is the ancient name of the free people?"
Jesus answered, " 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' (Deuteronomy 6:5)
This is it, and its importance.
"And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' (Matthew 19:18)"
Everything written in the Sharia and the heavenly books is based on these two commandments. Who gave birth to Christ?
Free at last, my prayer has been answered.
"What do you think of Christ? Who is his father?" "David," he answered.
I said to them, "Then why does David call him 'Lord'?" The Holy Spirit spoke through David alone. David said,
"The Lord says to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.'" (Psalm 110:1)
So if David's son is 'Sir', how will David's son be?
I have no future without you from this moment on.
Jesus condemns the Pharisees and the teachers of the law.
Jesus spoke to the people and to his apostles.
"The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat," he said.
"That's how you lose them. Say everything to yourself. What you don't say at all, they won't say either."
Oh God, let them keep their money and focus on their own needs, but they still have things they need that they can't afford.
 "Everything they do is done for others to see. On their foreheads and arms they wear little boxes that hold Scripture verses. They make the boxes very wide. And they make the tassels on their coats very long.   
They love to leave them in the food or love to leave them first from the sea in the ceiling.
They love them in the unknown, and they love them from whom my Lord draws near.
If these two were your children, wouldn't you be proud?
Don't call anyone on earth "Father." You have one Father, who is in heaven.
You're right, but he's your teacher and he's your boss.
You are the best, you always have good things in store for me.
Whoever seeks for a woman to marry, if he marries her, he marries her, and whoever seeks for a woman to marry, if he marries her, he marries her.
 "How terrible it will be for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You pretenders! You shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. You yourselves do not enter. And you will not let those enter who are trying to.   
Sorry,

 "How terrible for you, blind guides! You say, 'If anyone takes an oath in the name of the temple, it means nothing. But anyone who takes an oath in the name of the gold of the temple must keep the oath.'  
What are you babbling about? Are you blind and crazy? Which is more important? Is it gold? Or is it the temple that makes gold sacred?
It also says: 'If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing. But if anyone swears by the gift that is on it, he is bound to fulfill his oath.'
Oh, you blind ones! What is more important? The gift? Or the altar that makes the gift sacred?
"Oh, anyone who marvels at the name of the Most High, the Most High, and all that is in it."
And whoever enters it on the right path, he has entered it in peace, and whoever enters it on the wrong path, he has entered it in error, and it is easy for the wrongdoers to go astray.
And whoever turns to the right, the sky is also turned to the right, and it is called the Throne of God, and it is called the One seated upon it.
 "How terrible for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You pretenders! You give God a tenth of your spices, like mint, dill and cummin. But you have not practiced the more important things of the law, like fairness, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the last things without failing to do the first.  
You idiots! You can't even get a fly out of your food. But you swallow a whole camel!
 "How terrible for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You pretenders! You clean the outside of the cup and dish. But on the inside you are full of greed. You only want to satisfy yourselves.  
You fool! First clean the inside of the glass and the plate. Only then will the inside be clean too.

And you say, if we had lived in the time of those who came before us, we wouldn't have done what they did. We wouldn't have assisted in the killing of the prophets.
"And He has subjected to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth - all from Himself. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought. You are the best nation produced [as an example] for mankind. You enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and believe in Allah."

"You're a real pain! How do you manage to be so annoying?"
Therefore, just as I have told you beforehand, I will send you the prophets, the wise men, and the scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city.
"You will surely bear the burden of the blood of all the righteous people that has been shed on earth, from the blood of the righteous Job to the blood of Zechariah, son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar."
What's dead to you is not dead to those who know.
 "Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and throw stones in order to kill those who are sent to you. Many times I have wanted to gather your people together. I have wanted to be like a hen who gathers her chicks under her wings. But you would not let me!  
Look, your house has been left empty.
 I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord.' " (Psalm 118:26) 
The hour marks
Jesus went out of the temple. As he was going, his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple.
"Do you see all this?" asked Jesus. "What I am about to tell you is true. Not one stone here will be left on another; every stone will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. Then his disciples came to him privately and said, "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end?"
Jesus replied, "Stay awake! Be careful, lest you fall into temptation."
In the morning, they walk with the name of the views and share the views and the child who is like them.
You will hear about wars. You will even hear people talking about future wars. Don't be afraid. Those things have to happen. But the end is not here yet.
Nations will fight against nations, and kingdoms against kingdoms. People will be hungry. There will be earthquakes in many places.
This word is Ramadan of the mercy.
"And after that, people will grab you and take you to be treated badly and killed. All nations will hate you because of me."
Then there will be a time when many people will turn away from their religion. They will hate each other. They will hand each other over to their enemies.
Be human, as if you were human, as if you were human.
Where the weak are increasing, the love of most people will grow colder.
But he who endures to the end will be saved.
This good news of the kingdom will be preached throughout the world. It will be a witness to all nations. Then the end will come.
The prophet Daniel spoke about 'the abomination that desolates.' (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11) Someday you will see it standing in the holy place. The reader should understand this.

Think about the children who don't have to go to school in the winter or on a snow day.
There was one very bad tyrant in those days. He was worse than anyone from the first days until now. And nothing like that will ever happen again.
I wish I had time to eat something, but in reality, you're too expensive for me to eat.
For that time is coming when anyone who says, "Look, here is the Messiah!" or, "There he is!" should not be believed.
False Christs and false prophets will arise. They will perform great signs and wonders. They will try to lead astray God's chosen people, if possible.
See, I told you before.
"If someone tells you, 'He's way out in the desert,' don't go there. Or if someone says, 'He's inside the house,' don't believe him."

Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory.
O Allah, protect them from the harm of the dust and shield them from every complete death, and after that, from the punishment of the Fire.
"Learn a lesson from the fig tree. When its branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near."
In the same way, when you see all this happening, you know the end is near. It's right in front of the door.
I met a man who seemed to be lost, so I helped him find his way.
You and time fade away, and my words fade away, but the day and year know not.
A case or a year is not the first migration in the vast sky of the future.
"...think about how it was in the days of Noah...it will be like when the son of man comes..."
In the time before the flood, people would eat and drink. They would marry. They would give their daughters in marriage. They did all these things until the day Noah entered the ark.
 They knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be when the Son of Man comes.   
There will be two men in the field. One will be taken and the other will be left.
The woman is cooking a traditional dish.
"That's how you should be careful. You don't know when your master will come."
"...Now you understand...you need to understand something...imagine if the homeowner knew when the thief was coming at night...at that time, he would be watching...he wouldn't let his house be broken into."
So you too must be ready. Man will come at an hour when he does not expect it.
God willing, we will leave the respect of the patients' dignity in their rooms, the dignity of the patients in the hospital, the descriptions of the patients in the hospital.
It would be good for the servant if he found his master doing his work when he comes.
This is the end for me, I've been lying to you. It's all my fault, I've been neglecting everything I used to care about.
"But let's assume that servant is evil. Let's assume he's thinking to himself, 'My master has been gone for a very long time.'"
I wish the companions would just laugh and have fun with those who have a lot of fun.
He who owns the property enters the future at noon.
We hope that the need will go away so that she can solve the problem of the place, where is the place, the place gives it, gives it, gives it, gives it.
**The Tale of the Ten Elderly Men**
"Behold, what the kingdom of heaven will be like at that time. Ten virgins took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom."
Five of them were fools. Five were wise.
Creation serves him honey, but not oil.
The wise ones took oil in jars along with their lamps.
The groom hasn't come for a long time. That's why all the brides are tired and want to sleep.
"So on the eve of the wedding night, you hear a whisper: 'Here comes the groom! Go out and greet him!'"
They all woke up, the girls standing next to the bride, and found their rosaries.
The two of you, at the time of the massage, are when the woman reaches the peak of your heart's desire.
" 'No,' they replied. 'It might not be enough for all of us. Wait, go to those selling oil. Buy something for yourselves.'"
They went to buy oil. But on their way, the groom arrived. The girls who were present went in with him to the wedding party, and then the door was closed.
Later, the other sisters of the bride also came. "Salam, salam!" And she was greeting them: "Salam, salam!"
But he replied, "I'm not going to tell you the truth. I don't know you."
"Just stay alert. You don't know the day or the hour the groom will come. The story of three maids."
"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a man who was going on a journey. He called his servants and entrusted his property to them."
A man gave ten thousand dollars to one person. He gave four thousand dollars to another. And he gave two thousand dollars to a third. The man gave each servant an amount of money that he knew the servant could handle. And then the man went on his way.
The servant received $10,000, quickly invested it, and made an additional $10,000.
I had $4000, and when I saved more, I had $4000 extra.
But the Lord for the year 2000 came and went, leaving the world in disarray.
"From the best sources on the subject, it has come."
The man who had received $10,000 brought the other $10,000. 'Master,' he said, 'you trusted me with $10,000. See, I have made $10,000 more.'
...My servants replied to my master... Well done... Good servants... Honest... Loyal... Honest in everything... I will entrust you with a lot... Come and share my master's joy!
"The man who had $4000 also came. 'Mister,' he said, 'you trusted me with $4000. Look, I've made another $4000 in profits.'
...Your servants responded, my lord... Well done... Good servants... Indeed... My lord... I was loyal with few things... My lord... I will carry you on my back with great things... My lord... Come and share the joy of your uncle with his son...
"Then came the man who received two thousand dollars. He said to him, 'Sir, I knew you were a capable man. You sow wherever you sow. You gather crops wherever you scatter seeds.'"
"...I walked out, hid your $2000 in the ground... See what's there for you."
"Sir, answer him, 'You devil, you lazy servant! So you know that I reap where I did not sow? You know that I gather the harvest where I scattered the seed?"
Alright then, you should have put my money in the bank. When I returned, I would have taken it back with interest.
"After Mr. Diallo, the other servants were ordered, 'Take $2000 from him. Give it to the one who has $20,000.'"
Everything I have is an hour and good luck, or who is with me even a message no matter.
"Throw that worthless servant outside. There in the darkness, people will sob and gnash their teeth." - Matthew 25:30 (New International Version)
"If a man is born, he comes with all his might. All the angels come with him. At that hour he sits on his throne in the glory of heaven."
He will gather all the nations before Him. He will separate them into two groups, just like a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
He will make the rams face his right side and the sheep face his left.
"And after that, the king will speak to those on his right hand, saying: 'Come, you whom my Father blessed. Inherit the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.'"
I was hungry. And you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty. And you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger. And you took me in.
You came and you were beautiful and you were kind to us and you were a daughter of ours and you were a daughter of ours.
"Then the righteous will answer Him, saying: 'Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You a drink? When did we see You a stranger and take You in, or naked and clothe You? When did we see You sick or in prison and visit You?'
And when I die, will you forget about me? And when I die, will you be different and at peace?
Why don't we go together and see?
"The king will answer him. 'What I am about to tell you is true. Anything you have done to one of these least brothers of mine, you have done to me.'"
"Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.'"
I got hungry. You didn't give me anything to eat. I got thirsty. You didn't give me anything to drink.
...I was strange...but you didn't offer me anything...I needed some things...but you didn't give me anything...I was sick and in prison...but you didn't care about me.
"They will also answer: 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty and did not share with you? When did we see you a stranger or in need of things or sick or in prison and did not visit you?'"
"...They'll answer you... 'What I'm telling you is true... and anything you didn't do for someone less important than them... you didn't do it for me."
"And then they will go to be judged forever. That those who did what is right will have eternal life."
**The Plan to Kill Jesus**
Jesus spoke these words, then lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter will be in two days. The Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
When the chief priests and the elders of the people met, they did so in the palace of Caiaphas, the high priest.
In your face, visit and control the long road to Agadir.
And it's not the time of the holiday, they said, "People might cause problems." "One is pouring perfume on Issa."
Jesus was in the house of Zacchaeus. There was a man named Simon who had leprosy.
You are a genius, Salmi Jabrin, after mandih and kharajat sitting.
When they saw all this, they got angry and started asking why there was such a waste.
"The spices could have been sold at a high price. The money could have been spent on those in need."
Jesus was aware of this. He said to them, "Why are you causing trouble for this woman? She has done a good thing for me."
And you know your business well, but don't mess with me.
The smell of death clings to my body, preparing me for the grave.
"I will tell you the truth. What she did will be told wherever it is told, this good news will be told all over the world. It will be told in her memory." "Judas agreed to hand over Jesus."
From the account and left for the pain a serious name, a name, a name.
Solo, "What will you give me if I hand over Jesus to you?" So they paid him thirty pieces of silver.
"...Then the whole multitude arose and led Jesus to Pilate. And they began to accuse Him, saying, 'We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar, saying that He Himself is Christ, a King.'" (Luke 23:1-2)
This generation is the company's support and the world's hope in the face of illness.
...He replied, "Go to the town and find a certain man, and tell him, 'The Teacher says, 'My time is near. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.'"
So the disciples did as Jesus had told them and prepared the Passover meal.
When they came in the evening, Issa was on the drum with the tanbur.
"...and as they were eating, he said to them, 'What I am about to tell you is true. One of you will hand me over to my enemies...'"
The disciples became very sad. One after the other, they began to say to him, "It's not I, Lord, is it?"
Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand with me in the dish, he will betray me.
This is the speech that the leader of the people will give. He will proceed as written. But alas for those who will give the leader of the people! I wish he had not been born.
Judas was the one who was going to betray him. He said, "It is not me, Lord, is it?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is you."
 While they were eating, Jesus took bread. He gave thanks and broke it. He handed it to his disciples and said, "Take this and eat it. This is my body."   
Then he poured out the cup. He praised and handed it to them. And he said, "All of you drink from it."
This earthly life and the world are constantly changing, and many things that exist in the sky and on earth.
"This is serious. From now on, I will never drink wine with you again, until the day comes when we drink together at the gate of my father's kingdom."
This is what you know, and what you don't know, you don't know.
Jesus said to them, "This very night, before the cock crows, all of you will have denied me because of me. For it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)"
But who knows what will happen to you tomorrow?
"... Peter can make anything go away because of you... but I can't."
"What you are about to say is true," Jesus answered. "This very night, before the cock crows, you yourself will deny me three times that you know me."
But Peter said, "I will never deny you, even if I have to die with you." And all the other disciples said the same. Jesus prayed in Gethsemane.
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
God appeared to Peter and the sons of Zebedee. And he began to grieve and be anxious.
Here he told them, "My soul is very sad. I feel death is near. Stay here. Keep watching with me."
He went a little further. He fell to the ground again. He prayed and said, "Father, if it is possible, take this cup of suffering away from me. But not what I want, but what you want."
And he came to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Could you not watch with me for one hour?" asked Peter.
"My brother, leave me alone with your nonsense and your worldly desires, you daughters of misfortune."
Jesus went away a second time and prayed, "My Father, if this cup cannot pass unless I drink it, may your will be done."
And then he returned. He found them sleeping again. He couldn't open their eyes.
Every time he comes out of them, he wants something else. The first line prays for the same thing.
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand. The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of sinners."
**Yahya!** **Ya Allah!** **Here he is!** **I'll convert them to my faith!** **Jesus is arrested**
While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. A large crowd was with him, carrying swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Judas, who was to betray Jesus, was identified to them by a kiss. "This is the man," he said to them. "Arrest him."
So Judas went to Jesus immediately and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
"...he told them, 'Come on, follow me...' They walked until they reached an empty place with a few trees. They stopped. He said to them, 'This is what I wanted to bring you to... This is what I wanted to show you.'"
Then one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it, and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
"Put your sword back in its place," he told him. "Everyone who takes the sword will die by the sword."
And you think I can't ask my father for help? He would immediately send an army of over 70,000 angels.
But how is that going to be achieved? They say it has to happen like that.
At that time Jesus said to the crowd, "Am I leading a rebel army against you?" he asked them. "Do you think I came with swords and clubs to capture me? I sat in the temple courts each day teaching, and you did not arrest me."
But the word "this" presents the whole matter in a different light and casts doubt on the religious teachings of Dar.
They seized Jesus, bound him, and led him to Caiaphas, the high priest. With him were assembled the scribes and the elders.
"Truly, truly, I say to you, Peter will deny three times that he knows Jesus. He went out and wept bitterly."
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.
But for even more property disputes and finally settling the matter between the partners.
Salo said, "I can't help but feel jealous. I can't help but think about her and want to be with her in three days."
Then the high priest stood up and asked Jesus, "Will you not answer? What is it that these men testify against you?"
But the shepherd said, "It doesn't matter, just read it to them," said the crow, crow.
"Yes," Jesus said. "It is as you say. But I tell you all, in the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Almighty. You will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? You have heard the blasphemy with your own ears."
What do you see? He needs to die! Answer them.
They hit him after he fell. They gave him a beating. They kept hitting him.
They said, "Hail, Christ! Who struck you?" Peter said he did not know Jesus.
...Peter was sitting at home...he had a servant...you were there too, you were with Jesus of Galilee...
But in front of them all, Peter said he was going. "I don't know exactly what you're saying," he said.
"...and he went out through the gate leading to the courtyard. There he saw another woman. She looked at him and said to the people, 'This one was with Jesus of Nazareth.'"
He went back on his word and said it wasn't him. He even swore he didn't know the man!
 After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter. "You must be one of them," they said. "The way you talk gives you away."   
Peter looked confused and started cursing. He swore and said, "You don't know the man!" Suddenly, he let out a "cock-a-doodle-doo."
...and he went back in...and he went back in again...and he came out again...and he sat on the ground...and he started crying and sobbing...until he calmed down...and he got up and went out again...and he went back in...and he went back in again...and he came out again...and he sat on the ground...and he started crying and sobbing...until he calmed down...and he got up and left.
Judas hanged himself.
It was early morning. All the chief priests and elders decided to put Jesus to death.
They bound him, and led him away, and delivered him to Pilate, the governor.
Judas, who had betrayed Jesus and seen him condemned to death, felt ashamed and deeply regretted his actions. He realized how wrong he had been. He returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders.
"I made a mistake," he said. "I gave it to someone who's not a criminal." "Our market is empty," they replied. "That's your problem."
Judas saw the stable and the cellar and went away. Then he went and hanged himself.
The priestly chiefs scoffed at the money. They said, "It is religiously forbidden to put this money in the temple's box. It is blood money. It is what paid for a man's death."
They decided to use the money to buy a summer vacation plot of land. They bury people from other countries there.
That's why it's called the Field of Blood to this day.
No one can change the past.
"I will no longer have mercy on them; I will scatter them like a cloud, and they will be devoured by the wind, as I have commanded." (Zechariah 11:12,13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) Jesus is brought to Pilate.
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked, "Are you the King of the Jews?" "It is as you say," Jesus answered.
But in the world of control and discipline, they say it doesn't work.
Even so, don't you hear the accusations they've leveled against you?
But Zabá's hand was even more powerful, and the king was defeated.
It was the governor's custom at Easter to release one prisoner. The people chose who they wanted.
At that time, they had one famous prisoner named Barabbas.
When the people were gathered together, Pilate asked them, "Whom do you want me to release? Barabbas? or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Pilate knew that leadership was about jealousy. He knew why they handed Jesus over to him.
Oh, he was a handsome guy, and his wife was a mess, and his wife was a mess.
But the future and the past interact to bring me peace and bring me solace.
"Which of the two did you want me to release?" asked the governor. "Barbarba," they answered.
"What shall we do with Jesus who is called the Christ?" asked Pilate. They all answered, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What has he done wrong?" asked Pilate. "But they shouted all the louder, 'Crucify him!'"
Belat saw that Beli wasn't coming. The gang started to scatter. That's why he turned on the water and washed his hands in front of them. "I'm not involved in this man's death," he said. "You're responsible for what happened!"
Everything is back to normal, we're right on schedule!
Pilate released Barabbas, but he had Jesus crucified. He was handed over to be crucified, the Son of God, the Son of Mary, Jesus Christ.
The governor's soldiers led Jesus to the palace, which was called the Praetorium. All the rest of the soldiers gathered around him.
They took off his clothes and dressed him in a purple cloak.
...until the thorns gather together...until they form a crown...it is formed from the thorns that gather together...it is formed from the thorns that gather together...it is formed from the thorns that gather together...it is formed from the thorns that gather together...it is formed from the thorns that gather together...it is formed from the thorns.
Peace be upon him, peace be upon him who is above in terms of one existence.
After they had made him a scapegoat, they took away his garments and led him with them to crucify Jesus Christ, who was crucified.
From the years, the face of the months of her crop is a very cloudy sky that often rains on the palace.
They went to a place called Golgotha. Golgotha means the place of the skull.
Mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix mix
When they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots.
You answered and clarified it to him here.
Above his head they placed the written charge against him: "THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
With him were two thieves. One was on his right side and the other was on his left side.
Prudence is better than excess and is accompanied by deliberation.
...and said, "So you will destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days...then you will save yourself! Come down from the cross to the ground if you are the Son of God!"
In the same way, the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him.
"He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
Ktisst Allah al-Manṭūr into Baghaw dirw huwa li-l-qalbi az-zawj illa ana az-zawj.
In the same way, the thieves who were crucified with Jesus also mocked him. Jesus dies.
From noon until three, the whole earth was covered in darkness.
Around three o'clock, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of those who were standing there heard Jesus call out. He said, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?"
 Right away one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar and put it on a stick. He offered it to Jesus to drink.  
The rest said: "Leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to save him."
...after he let out a loud, piercing scream...he died...
At that moment, the temple's veil was torn from top to bottom. The earth shook. The stone was split.
Their graves were opened, and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus had been crucified, they went to the holy city and appeared to many people.
The Roman centurion and those who were with him, standing near Jesus, saw the earthquake and what had happened. They were terrified and exclaimed, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
There weren't many people following me from January to June.
Mary Magdalene was there. Mary, the mother of James and Joses, was there also. And the mother of Zebedee's sons was there. Jesus is Buried
As the evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea came. His name was Joseph. He was also a disciple of Jesus.
He asked for the body of our Lord Jesus. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Joseph buried the body and covered it with pure salt.
And he rolled a big stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away.
...The men who were at the door...there were two of them...one was tall and burly...and the other was short and a bit stocky...they looked at each other and said in a voice...
The next day, after the Passover, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
"Yes," they said, "we remember something the liar said while he was still alive. He said: 'In three days, I will rise again.'"
"...Do the things so that the grave remains hidden until the third day... if you don't do it... his nerves might come and take the body... and then they will tell people that Jesus, peace be upon him, has risen from the dead... and this last lie will be bigger than the first one. ...Uhm... Listen carefully... From today... this conversation I've had... will remain only between us... Understood? ...Understood... Just us, we need to listen carefully so they can understand themselves first... Haha."
"You have a guard," Pilate answered. "Go, make the tomb as secure as you can."
So they went and made the grave ready and rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb, and they assigned guards.
**Jesus rises from the dead**
Sugar is harmful to the first stage of life.
The earthquake was very strong. An angel of God descended from heaven. The angel went to the tomb, rolled away the stone, and sat on it.
His body shimmered like lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The women were so scared of him that they were trembling and remaining motionless, like the dead.
The automobile said to the woman, "Don't be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.
Come here! Get up like he said he would! Come see where he was sitting.
"Go, tell his disciples, 'He who has died has risen. He will go before you to Galilee. There you will see him.' I have told you."
...So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell the disciples.
Suddenly they met him. "Hello!" he said. They went up to him, grabbed his legs and beat him up.
...After listening to Bah and his brother's words...he decided to go to them...without hesitation...he started the journey...with his brothers and relatives as the destination... ...After bidding them farewell and giving them advice...
As the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city. They informed the chief priests of everything that had happened.
In the shade with the shade of a rose for the deceased.
They told the soldiers, "We want you to say, 'His disciples came during the night. They stole his body while we were sleeping.'"
"The problem is that these details will exclude us, even if this is the one who is there."
...The soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus' last command to his disciples was...
Yes, eleven disciples went to Galilee. They went to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they worshiped him. Some are still doubtful.
Then they came to him. And he said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
"So go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."
Teach them to obey everything you have been commanded. And be at ease, I am always with you, until the end.
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Lord, this is the peace that I give to you, and the joy that no one can take away from you.
"A voice in the wilderness cries out: 'Prepare the way for the Lord. Make straight the paths for him.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
And John came. He addressed the people in the desert, saying that they should repent and distance themselves from their sins, so that God might forgive them.
All the people from the Judean countryside went out to him. All the people of Jerusalem also went out to him. When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John wore clothes made from camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
Here is what John was preaching: "After me comes one who is more powerful than I; I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals.
"I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." Jesus is baptized and transformed.
Then Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
Jesus was coming up out of the water. And he saw the heavens opened, and the Holy Spirit descending on him in bodily form like a dove.
A voice spoke to him from the sky. It said, "You are my son, and I love you. I am very happy with you."
"Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness."
Jesus spent 40 days in the desert. The devil tempted him. Wild animals did not harm Jesus. Angels attended to him. Jesus chose his first disciples.
After John was put in prison, Jesus went to Galilee. He preached the good news of God.
"The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God is near. Repent of your sins and believe in the gospel!"
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. He saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
"Come near. Follow me," Jesus said. "For I will not leave you until you become the working people."
They left their nets and followed him.
...After all, he knew what he wanted...he knew what he wanted...he knew what he wanted...after all, he knew what he wanted...he knew what he wanted...he knew what he wanted...
"A man named John was also there with them, whose father was Zebedee. He was one of Jesus' disciples. Jesus called him." - John 21:2 (Aramaic to English translation)
Jesus and those with him went to Capernaum. When the Sabbath came, he went to the synagogue and began to teach.
He taught them as if he had authority. He taught them like someone with power. He didn't speak as the scholars of the law do.
...Then at that hour a man who was possessed by an evil spirit cried out in the midst of their synagogue...
"What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Are you coming to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the saint of God!"
"Shoot!" Jesus said to the demon. "Come out of him!"
The evil spirit possessed the man hysterically. Then it left him with a scream.
 All the people were amazed. So they asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching! And with so much authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits, and they obey him."  
The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout Galilee. Jesus cured many people.
Jesus and those with him left the center. They quickly went with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
The woman is her daughter's mother-in-law. They told Jesus about her.
He went to her. He took her hand and helped her up. She dropped her teapot. She only then started working for them.
That evening, after sunset, they brought to Jesus all who were sick or demon-possessed.
Everyone is responsible for their actions.
Jesus is the son of God, and he is the savior of the world.
It was very early in the morning and still dark. Issa got up and left the house. He went to a place where he could be alone. There, he prayed.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
Where did they find him while they were gossiping about everyone looking for you?
Jesus replied, "Let's go somewhere else. I want to go to the nearby towns. I must preach there too. That's why I came."
... He went through the whole region ... He was preaching and teaching in their synagogues ... He was casting out demons ... Jesus healed a man who had a skin disease.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus, knelt down, and begged him. He said, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."
Jesus was their hope. He reached out and touched the man. "I will make it happen," he said. "Be 'clean'!"
