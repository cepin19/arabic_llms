The genealogy of Jesus Christ
environmentalA record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
Abraham was the father of Isaac. Isaac was the father of Jacob. Jacob was the father of Judah and his brothers.
And Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar. And Perez was the father of Hezron. And Hezron was the father of Ram.
Aram was the father of Aminadab, and Aminadab the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon the father of Salmon.
Salman was Booz's father. Rahab was Booz's mother. Booz was Obed's father. Ruth was Obed's mother. Obed was Jesse's father.
And Jesse was the father of David the king. And David was the father of Solomon, whose mother was Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah.
Solomon was the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam was the father of Abijah, and Abijah was the father of Asa.
Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat was the father of Jehoram, and Jehoram was the father of Uzziah.
Uzziah was the father of Jotham, and Jotham was the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh. Manasseh was the father of Amon. And Amon was the father of Josiah.
And Joachim was the father of Jeconiah and his brothers, at the time of their deportation to Babylon.
And after that, the genealogy of the family continues. Heniah was the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zechariah was the father of Abijah, and Abijah was the father of Azariah. Azariah was the father of Jehoram.
Sadiq's father visits, Sadiq is the father of Aqeel, and Aqeel is the father of Eilaud.
Eleazar was the father of Phinehas, Phinehas the father of Abishua, Abishua the father of Bukki,
Jacob is the father of Joseph. Joseph was the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Christ.
So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, and fourteen generations from David to the Babylonian exile, and fourteen generations from the Babylonian exile to the Messiah. Jesus the Messiah was born.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph. But before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband, Joseph, was a righteous man. He did not want to expose her to shame before the people. So he planned to divorce her secretly.
But while he was pondering these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.
All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet.
With great compassion a wife gives birth, and she bears a son, and she calls his name Immanuel, which means: God is with us.
Joseph awoke and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him. He took Mary as his wife.
But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.
The coming of the wise men to visit Jesus
Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of King Herod. And behold, angels came to shepherds and said, "Behold, I bring you good news of great joy..."
They said, "Where is the king of the Jews who has been born? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was greatly disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them the time of the star’s appearance, and he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, “Go and search carefully for the child. When you find him, report back to me, so that I too may go and worship him.”
In Bethlehem in Judea they answered him. This is what the prophet wrote. He said.
"And as for you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, Too small to be among the clans of Judah, From you shall come forth for me One who is to be ruler in Israel, Whose coming forth is from of old, From ancient days."
So the king secretly called for the magi and asked them about the time of the star's appearance.
He sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him."
And when the wise men had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.
When they saw the star, they were filled with joy.
The wise men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They knelt down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures. They offered him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
And God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod, so they returned to their own country by another road. The flight of Jesus' family into Egypt.
When the wise men had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child to kill him."
Joseph got up, and during the night, went to Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.
They remained there until the death of King Herod. Thus was fulfilled what the Lord had spoken through the prophet: "Out of Egypt I called my son" (Hosea 11:1).
Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him, and he became furious. He issued a decree to kill all male children who were two years old or under in Bethlehem and the surrounding area, in accordance with the time he had learned from the wise men when they saw the star.
Thus were fulfilled the words which the prophet Jeremiah had spoken. He said,
A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and weeping and great mourning. Rachel weeps for her children, refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream in Egypt. An angel of the Lord appeared to him in the dream.
The angel said, "Take your child and his mother and flee to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead."
So Joseph took the boy and his mother and brought them to the land of Israel.
But he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, and he was afraid to go there. So, in a dream, he was warned to go instead to the land of Galilee.
He lived there in a city called Nazareth. Thus, the prophecy of the prophets about Jesus was fulfilled, for they said, "He will be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Repent of your sins! for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
"John is the one of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke when he said, 'A voice cries out: "In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God."'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes were made of camel's hair, and he wore a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
The people went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the region of the Jordan.
When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to him for baptism, and he said to them, "You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
"Bear fruit in keeping with repentance from your sin."
Do not think that you can say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.
The axe now lies at the roots of the trees. All trees that do not bear good fruit will be cut down. And they will be thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water for repentance, but after me comes one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
"His shovel is in his hand to clean his oven of straw. He gathers his wheat into the barn, but the straw he burns with a fire that never goes out." Jesus is baptized in the water.
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan. He wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to prevent him, saying to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you, and yet you are coming to me?"
Jesus replied, "Let it be so now, for it is proper for us to fulfill all righteousness. May the will of God be done." John agreed.
As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him.
And a voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."
Jesus is tempted.
The Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness, where he was tempted by the devil.
And after forty days and forty nights of fasting, Jesus was hungry.
The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.' (Deuteronomy 8:3)"
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city, Jerusalem, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple.
"If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down below, for it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you, on their hands they will bear you up, so that you may not strike your foot against a stone.' (Psalm 91:11-12)"
Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain. He showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
He said, "If you worship me and bow down to me, I will give you all this."
Jesus said to him, "Away with you, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came to him and were ministering to him. And when Jesus had risen from the intense fasting, He began to preach, saying:
John was imprisoned. And when Jesus heard of it, he withdrew into Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and made his home in Capernaum by the Sea in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
Thus was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah.
The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, Galilee of the nations, by the Sea of Galilee, beyond the Jordan.
"Those who walk in darkness will see a great light. They dwell in the land of deep darkness, in the shadow of death. Upon you a great light will break forth." (Isaiah 9:1, 2)
From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." And Jesus, turning around, saw them following him, and said to them, "Follow me." So Jacob and John, the sons of Zebedee, immediately left their nets and followed him.
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers, Simon, who was called Peter, and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
Come and follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.
So they left the fish and followed him immediately.
He went on from there and saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John, in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. Jesus called them.
They quickly ran to the boat, leaving their father behind, and followed Jesus. The healing of the sick by Jesus' hand.
Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
The news about him spread all over Syria. People brought all those who were sick, those suffering from various diseases. Some were in great pain, some were possessed by demons, some were convulsing violently, and others were completely paralyzed. Jesus healed them all.
A large crowd followed him, including people from Galilee, the Ten Towns, Jerusalem, and Judea, as well as from the other side of the Jordan.
Jesus blesses.
Jesus saw the crowds, went up the mountain, and sat down. His disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them, saying:
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
"Blessed are the merciful, * the compassionate."
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. Rejoice and be glad, because your reward in heaven is great. This is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great. So it was with the prophets before you. You are the salt of the earth and the light of the world.
You are the salt of the earth. But if salt loses its taste, with what can it be seasoned? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden.
Likewise, no one lights a lamp and puts it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house.
In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven. Jesus fulfills the law by completing it.
Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. Heaven and earth will pass away, but not the smallest letter or stroke of the Law will pass away until everything is accomplished.
Do not break even the smallest commandment, and do not teach others to do so. For whoever does and teaches will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But work on these commandments and teach them. Then you will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
This is what I say to you: You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you are not, you will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Murder.
You have heard what was said to the people of old: 'You shall not kill.' (Exodus 20:13) 'Whoever kills shall be liable to judgment.'
But this is what I tell you: Do not be angry with your brother. Whoever is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment. And whoever says to his brother, ‘You fool!’ will be liable to the Sanhedrin. But whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be liable to the fiery gehenna.
If you are bringing your gift to the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,
Leave your gift there before the altar. First go and be reconciled with your brother, and then come and present your gift.
"Let your attitude toward your enemy be like that which you have toward yourself. Until they become dust, and even if you are on equal footing, they deny the Hereafter."
What I'm about to tell you is the truth. You're not leaving here until you pay the last penny! Bastards.
You have heard that it was said, "Do not commit adultery" (Exodus 20:14)
But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman to desire her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
"If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell."
If your right hand should stray towards disobedience, cut it off and cast it from you; for the loss of a part of you is better than the loss of your whole self in the Fire. Divorce.
It is written: "When a man divorces his wife, he must give her a written notice of divorce." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
But I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. It is not lawful for a man to divorce his wife except for sexual immorality. And keep your oaths.
Again, you have heard that it was said to those of old, "You shall not break an oath you have made to the Lord, but you shall fulfill your vows to him."
But that is what I am telling you. Never make such promises. Do not take the sky as a witness to your promises. For that is God's throne.
Do not make it in the name of Earth. That is reserved for the feet of God. Do not make it in the name of Jerusalem. That is the city of the great King.
And do not swear by your head, that the gray hair will turn white or black.
Say, "The truth is from my Lord, not from me. It is from God, and I have been commanded to submit and to direct my face to Him."
You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." (Exodus 21:24, Leviticus 24:20, Deuteronomy 19:21)
But this is what I tell you: Do not resist the evil one. "If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek to them as well.
If anyone takes you to court and wants your shirt, let him have your coat as well.
If someone is compelled to go with you for a mile, go with him two miles.
Give to him who asks you, and do not refuse him who wants to borrow from you. Love your enemies.
You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor (Leviticus 19:18) and hate your enemy.'
But I tell you: Love your enemies. Pray for those who mistreat you.
"So be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect. For He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust."
If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Even tax collectors do the same.
If you only greet your family, what are you doing more than others? Even ungodly people do that.
Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Giving to the needy
Beware of doing good deeds in front of people to be seen by them. Do not do them to be praised by others. For if you do, your Father in heaven will not reward you.
When you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
If you give to the poor, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
Then pray secretly. Your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by people. Truly I tell you, they have already received their reward.
When you pray, go into your room, close the door, and pray to your Father who is in secret. For your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
When you pray, do not babble like the Gentiles, for they think that by their many words they will be heard.
Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.
Thus they prayed: "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name."
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Athena provides us with our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we also forgive those who sin against us.
Deliver us from sin when we are tempted. Save us from the evil one.
Forgive people, and your Father in heaven will forgive you.
"If you do not forgive the slips of people, your Father will not forgive your slips." - Fasting
When you fast and do not eat, do not look gloomy like those who pretend to be holy. They make their faces sad, wanting to show people that they are fasting. What I am about to tell you is truly sincere. They have received their reward in full.
But when you fast, anoint your head with oil and wash your face.
Then it is incumbent on you to conceal your fasting, so that no one but your unseen Father may know it. He alone knows what you do in secret, and He will reward you for it. Your Father who sees in secret will reward you. Store up for yourselves treasures in heaven.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
Your heart will be where your treasure is.
The eye is like a lamp in the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light.
But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. For either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Therefore do not worry.
I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
Look at the birds of the sky, they neither sow nor reap, nor gather into barns, and your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much better than they?
Can you add an hour to your life by worrying?
"Why do you worry about clothes? Look at the lilies of the field, how they grow; they do not toil or spin, 10 yet even Solomon in all his splendor was not dressed like one of them."
But that is what I am telling you. Not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these.
If God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
Therefore do not worry, saying, "What will we eat?" or "What will we drink?" or "What will we wear?"
The wicked pursue all these things. Your heavenly Father knows that you need them.
But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
"Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble."
Be fair when you use reason to judge others.
Do not judge others, lest you be judged.
You will be judged in the same way you judge others. You will be measured with the same measure you use for others.
You see the mote in your friend's eye, but you do not notice the beam in your own eye.
How can you tell your friend, "Let me remove the splinter from your eye," when you have a splinter in your own eye?
You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.
Do not give what is holy to the dogs, and do not throw your pearls before pigs, lest they trample them under their feet and turn and tear you to pieces. Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.
Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.
Everyone who asks will receive. He who seeks will find. The door will be opened to those who knock.
"Suppose your son asks for bread. Would any of you give him a stone?"
"Or if he asks for a fish, will any of you give him a snake?"
"If you, then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!"
In everything, do to others as you would have them do to you. This is what is written in the Law and the Prophets. In every matter, both great and small.
Enter the Kingdom of God through the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction and hell. And many are those who enter through it.
But the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and only a few find it. The tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
You can tell them by their fruits. Do people pick grapes from thorn bushes or figs from thistles?
Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree does not bear bad fruit, and a bad tree does not bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
Every tree is known by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord!' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?'
Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!' Wisdom and knowledge are in the house of the wise.
So everyone who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on rock.
The rain falls. The water rises. The wind blows and beats against that house. But it does not fall. For it was built on the rock.
But whoever hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.
The rain falls. The water rises. The wind blows and slaps that house. And it collapses with a loud, resounding crash.
Jesus finished all these sayings. The crowds were amazed at his teaching.
He spoke with authority, not like our rabbis.
Jesus Healing a Man with a Skin Disease
Jesus came down from the mountain, and a large crowd followed him.
A man with a severe skin disease came to Jesus, knelt down before him, and said, "Lord, if you choose, you can make me clean."
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man, saying, "I am willing; be cleansed." Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
Then Jesus said to him, "Tell no one, but go and show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." The faith of a Roman centurion.
When Jesus entered Capernaum, a Roman centurion came to him asking for help.
He said, "My Lord, my servant sits at home paralyzed, suffering great hardship."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
The captain answered, "Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof, but just say the word, and my servant will be healed."
I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers who obey my orders; I say to this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.
Jesus marveled at his saying, and said to those who followed him, "Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith!"
I tell you, many will come from east and west and recline at table with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
But those who think they are of the kingdom of God will be cast out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go, and let it be done for you as you have believed." And at that very moment his servant was healed.
When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her instantly. She got up and waited on him.
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to Jesus, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
He did it to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah said: "He carried our sins and our sorrows, and yet we thought of him as plagued, struck by God, and humiliated." (Isaiah 53:4) The cost of following Jesus is high.
Seeing the crowd around him, Jesus gave orders to cross over to the other side of the lake to the region of the Gerasenes.
Then one of the scribes came up and said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
Another servant said to him, "Master, let me first go and bury my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus got into the boat. The disciples followed him.
Suddenly a fierce storm swept over the lake, and the waves began to crash against the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
His disciples woke him up, saying, "Teacher, don't you care if we drown?"
He said to them, "You of little faith, why are you so afraid?" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm.
The disciples were amazed and asked, "Who is this man? Even the winds and the waves obey him!" Jesus healed two men possessed by demons.
Jesus went across the Sea of Galilee to the region of the Gerasenes. When he stepped out of the boat, a man with an unclean spirit came to him. The man lived among the tombs, and no one could restrain him anymore, even with a chain.
O Son of God, what do you want with us? Have you come to torment us before our time?
It wasn't too far away; a large group of pigs was grazing.
The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us to the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go." The demons came out of the men and entered the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.
The pig keepers rushed to the village and told everyone everything that had happened, and how the men who had been possessed by demons were healed.
Then the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to leave their region.
Jesus Healing a Paralyzed Man
Jesus got into a boat and crossed to the other side of the lake to his town.
He said to him, "Do not be discouraged, my child; your sins are forgiven."
Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to themselves, "This man is blaspheming!"
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Why are you thinking evil in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Get up and walk"?
"I tell you, the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he said to the paralyzed man, "Get up, take your mat and go home." Immediately the man got up, picked up his mat and went home.
The man stood up and went home.
When the crowd saw this, they were amazed and praised God, who had given people such authority. They called to Jesus, "Glory to God in the highest, who has given you authority over the kingdom of God to heal the sick!"
Jesus went on from there and saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. He said to him, "Follow me." And he got up and followed him.
Jesus was reclining at the house of Matthew. And many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Him and His disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
Jesus heard this and said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick."
"Go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' (Hosea 6:6) For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." - Jesus' response to the question about fasting.
One day the disciples of John came to him and said, "Teacher, we are fasting, and the Pharisees are fasting too, but your disciples are not fasting. Why?"
Jesus answered them, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them and then they will fast."
People do not sew a new patch on old clothes. The new piece will shrink and pull, making the tear worse.
People do not pour new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the skins will burst, the wine will spill out, and the skins will be ruined. Instead, they pour new wine into new wineskins, so that the wine does not spill out and the skins remain intact.
While he was still speaking, a synagogue leader came and fell at his feet, pleading with him to come and heal his daughter, who was dying.
Jesus rose and Mary followed him, and the disciples followed too.
And immediately a woman who had been suffering from a fever for twelve years came up to him. She had been subjected to a lot of pain by demons, and she was called Anna, who had a blood disorder. She touched the edge of his clothes.
She thought, "If I only touch his cloak, I will be made well."
And Jesus turned and saw her, and said, "Woman, your faith has made you well." And the woman was made whole at once.
When Jesus entered the ruler's house, he saw the professional mourners and the crowd in an uproar.
He said to them, "Stand back, the girl is not dead, she is sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After the crowd had left, he took the girl by the hand, and she immediately stood up.
The news about what Jesus had done spread all over that region. Jesus healed two blind men.
As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, shouting, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus entered the house, the blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They said to him, "Yes, Lord!"
Then he touched their eyes and said, "According to your faith, let it be done to you."
Their eyes were opened, and Jesus sternly warned them, saying, "See that no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They talked about it everywhere in that area.
And while they were going out, they brought to him a man who was mute and possessed by a demon.
And when the demon was cast out, the man spoke. The crowd was amazed, and they said, "We have never seen anything like this in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "By the prince of demons he casts out demons." Few are those who work.
Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness.
When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
Therefore ask the master of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.
Jesus sent the twelve disciples, commanding them
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
These are the names of the twelve apostles. First, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then James the son of Zebedee and his brother John.
The next two are Philip and Bartholomew, followed by Thomas and Matthew the Tax Collector. Two others are James the son of Alphaeus and Judas Thaddeus.
The last two were Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas would later betray Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent the twelve with explicit instructions: "Do not go among the Gentiles, and do not enter any town of the Samaritans.
Go instead to the people of Israel. They are like lost sheep.
They went out and preached, saying, "The kingdom of heaven has drawn near."
Heal the sick. Raise the dead. Cleanse the lepers. Cast out demons. You received freely, give freely.
Do not carry gold, silver, or copper in your belts.
Don't bring a suitcase when you travel. Don't carry extra clothes, sandals, or walking sticks. The worker should be provided with what they need.
When you enter a town or village, look for someone who will receive you as guests. Stay in their house until you leave.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. When you enter a house, greet its people.
If they show you kindness, accept it, but do not follow the evil ways of your enemies. Offer peace to those who are at peace with you.
Not everyone will welcome you or listen to your words. If they do not, shake the dust from your feet and leave that house or city.
What I tell you is true. On the day of judgment, the people of Sodom and Gomorrah will be treated more mercifully than the people of that city.
I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as prudent as serpents and as innocent as doves.
Beware! The men will deliver you to the local courts. They will flog you in their assemblies.
You will be brought before governors and kings because of me. You will be witnesses for me to them and to the Gentiles.
But when they deliver you up, do not worry about how or what you should speak. For it will be given to you in that hour what you should speak.
It will not be you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.
Brothers betray their brothers to death, and fathers their children. Children rise up against their parents and cause their death.
Everyone will hate you because of me. But whoever endures to the end will be saved.
When people attack you in one place, flee to another. Truly I tell you, you will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
A student is not better than his teacher. Nor is a servant better than his master.
It is enough for a disciple to be like his teacher, and enough for a servant to be like his master. If the head of the house is called Beelzebul, how much more the members of his household!
So do not be afraid of your enemies. Everything that is hidden will be made known, and everything that is secret will be revealed.
What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the daylight; and what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the roofs.
"Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell."
Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father.
He counts even the single hair on your head!
So do not fear, for you are more honorable than a large number of sparrows.
What about someone who says in front of others that he knows me? I too will say in front of my Father in heaven that I know him.
But what about the one who says before people, 'I do not know him'? I will say before my Father in heaven, 'I do not know you.'
Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
I have come to set a son against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
A man's foes shall be they of his own household. (Micah 7:6)
Whoever loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
"Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it."
"Whoever welcomes you welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me."
Verily, whoever welcomes a Prophet as a Prophet, will receive the reward of a Prophet. And whoever welcomes a righteous person as a righteous person, will receive the reward of a righteous person.
"Truly I tell you, anyone who gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones who follows me will certainly not lose their reward."
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus finished teaching his twelve disciples and then moved on to teaching and preaching in the cities of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard about the deeds of Christ, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked Jesus, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect another?"
Jesus answered and said to them, "Go and tell John what you hear and see."
The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor.
Blessed are those who do not walk in darkness because of me.
Jesus said to the crowds, when John's disciples were leaving: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
So what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No. Those who wear fine clothes are in the palaces of the ancestors.
"So what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet."
He is the one written about in the books: "I will send my messenger, who will prepare the way before you" (Malachi 3:1).
What I am about to tell you is the truth. No one greater than John the Baptist has ever been born, but the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
Since the days of John the Baptist, the Queen of Heaven has been advancing with power, and the strong have been taking her captive.
They all spoke about the prophets and the law until John.
If you are willing to accept it, John is the Messiah who was to come.
Let those who listen, listen.
How similar people are today to children sitting in the market, calling out to each other:
We left you the stage to sing hymns, but you did not dance. We sang you a lament, but you did not weep.
When John came, he neither ate nor drank as you do, and people say, "He has a demon."
"But when the Son of Man came, eating and drinking, they say, 'Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' Wisdom has been justified by her children." A city that does not repent.
Jesus began to denounce the cities where most of his miracles had been done, because they did not repent of their sins. He said,
Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades! For if the miracles had been done in Sodom that were done in you, it would have remained until today.
But I tell you that on the day of judgment the people of Sodom will be treated less severely than you. Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants."
Yes, Father. This is what I wanted.
My Father has given me all things. And no one knows the Son except the Father, nor does anyone know the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son wishes to reveal him.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Be my servants and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
My service is easy and my burden is light.
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath day.
On the Sabbath, Jesus was walking through the fields. His disciples were also harvesting the wheat and threshing it with their hands.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to Jesus, "Look, your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath."
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and his men?"
So he entered the house of God, he and his men, and they ate the sacred bread, which was not lawful for them to eat, for only the priests were allowed to eat it.
"Haven't you read the book? For it is written in your law that the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are blameless."
I tell you that there is One greater than the temple here.
The writing says: "I desire mercy, not sacrifice" (Hosea 6:6). You do not know what these two words mean. If you did, you would not accuse the innocent.
And Christ says, "God is my Lord and your Lord."
From there Jesus entered the synagogue.
There was a man there whose hand was withered and twisted. The Pharisees asked Jesus, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not pull it out and save it?"
A man is better than sheep! That is why the law allows us to do good on the Sabbath.
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and it was restored, just like the other one.
But the Pharisees went out and plotted to kill Jesus. Abdullah Al-Mukhtar
Jesus knew all that the Pharisees were doing, and he left that place. A large crowd followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But he warned them not to reveal his identity.
That the word spoken by Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled:
He is my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved in whom my soul delights. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations.
He will not argue or shout. No one will hear his voice in the streets.
He will not break a bent branch. He will not extinguish a flickering flame. He will fix everything.
"The nations will put their hope in him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebul
A man possessed by a demon was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and mute. Jesus healed him. So the man spoke and saw.
Everyone was amazed and asked, "Is this the Son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "It is only by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons, that he can cast out demons."
Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand."
If a demon drives out another demon, it is divided against itself. How then can its kingdom stand?
You say that I cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. But by what power do your disciples cast them out? Therefore, let them judge you.
But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Or think of it this way: How can you enter a strong man's house and seize his possessions? You must first tie him up. Then you can plunder his house.
He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.
So this is what I tell you. Every sin and every blasphemy will be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come."
If you make the tree good, its fruit will be good. If you make it bad, its fruit will be bad. You can tell a tree by its fruit.
O brood of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak any good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
A good man says good things. They spring from the good within him. And an evil man says evil things. They spring from the evil within him.
But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken.
"By your words you will be justified, or by your words you will be condemned." The sign of the Greek miracle.
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus and said, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
He answered them, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
Jonah was in the belly of a great fish for three days and three nights. So will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and now one greater than Solomon is here.
What happens when an evil spirit leaves a person? It wanders through dry places seeking a dwelling place, but it finds none.
Then he says, "I will return to my house from which I came." And when he returns, he finds it empty, clean, and in order.
Then the evil spirit returns with seven others more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. So the final condition of that person is worse than the first. That is how it will be with this wicked generation." Jesus' mother and brothers arrived.
At that time, while Jesus was speaking to the crowd, his mother and brothers were standing outside, wanting to speak to him.
Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside. They would like to speak with you."
Jesus answered, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
And Jesus said to his disciples, "Behold, my mother and my brothers!"
"Whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother."
The Farmer's Tale
On the same day, Jesus left the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
A large crowd gathered around him, so he took a boat and sat in it. All the people stood on the shore.
Then he told them a parable, saying: "A farmer went out to sow his seed.
He broadcast the seed on the ground. Some fell on the path, and the birds came and ate it.
Some seeds fell on rocky places, where there was not much soil. The plants grew quickly because the topsoil was thin.
When the sun rose, it burned the plants. They withered because they had no roots.
Other seeds fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and choked the plants.
Others fell on good soil and produced a crop, some a hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty.
Let those who listen, listen.
The disciples came to him and asked, "Why do you speak to the people in parables?"
He answered them, "You have been given the keys of the kingdom of heaven. But these have not been given to the Gentiles."
To those who have that kind of knowledge, more will be given, and they will have abundance. But from those who do not have it, even what they think they have will be taken away.
This is why I use stories when I talk to people. I tell them, "They look but they don't really see. They hear but they don't truly listen or understand."
In them the words of the prophet Isaiah are fulfilled, who said, "You will indeed hear, but you will not understand; and you will indeed see, but you will not perceive."
"Their hearts are calloused; they cannot hear, and their eyes they have closed. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts and turn, and I would heal them." (Isaiah 6:9-10)
Blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. Many prophets and righteous people wished to see what you see now, but they did not. They wished to hear what you hear, but they did not.
Listen! This is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message about the kingdom but do not understand it. Then the evil one comes and steals what was sown in their hearts. Those people are like seed sown on a path.
Others are like the seed that fell on rocky ground. They hear the word and at once receive it with joy.
But they have no roots. They are short-lived. They quickly stray from the religion when hardship or trial comes their way because of the message.
And others fell on good soil and yielded a crop after they had patiently endured. They hear the word and accept it with joy, but they have no root; for a while they believe, but when tested they fall away.
"But others fell on good soil, where they heard the word, understood it, and produced a crop: some a hundred times as much, some sixty, some thirty." Parable of the Sower
Jesus told the crowd another parable, saying, "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a good seed. The man who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man, and the field is the world. The good seed represents the children who belong to the Kingdom of Heaven.
While everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. He sowed weeds among the wheat and then left.
The wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
His servants came to him and said, "Master, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Then where did the weeds come from?"
He said, "An enemy did that." The servants asked him, "Do you want us to go and pull up those weeds?"
"No," said the owner of the field. "While you are weeding out the tares, you may also pull up the wheat with them."
Let both grow together until the harvest. And at the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, "Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn." Parables of the mustard seed and the leaven.
Jesus said to the crowds another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field."
It is the smallest of your seeds, but when it grows, it becomes the largest of garden plants. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest on its branches.
Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour until it was all leavened."
Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables; and without parables he did not speak to them.
So the word of the prophet was fulfilled, who said, “I have opened my mouth and spoken; I have proclaimed what has been hidden since the creation of the world.” (Psalm 78:2) Jesus explains the parable of the weeds.
Then he left the crowd and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
He answered them, "The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man."
The field is the world. The good seeds represent the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the evil one.
The enemy who sows it is the devil. The harvest is the day of judgment. And the workers are the angels.
The good crop is uprooted and burned. Thus it will be with the crop of the wicked on the day of judgment.
The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will remove from his kingdom everything that causes sin and all evildoers.
They will cast them into the blazing fire. There they will weep and wail and gnash their teeth in regret.
Then the sons of God will shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Let those who have ears hear the tales of the hidden treasure and the pearl.
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid. Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.
He found one of great value, so he went and sold all he had and bought it. The parable of the net.
And again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea, and gathered fish of every kind.
When the net was full, the fishermen pulled it to the shore. Then they sat down and took the good fish, putting them in the baskets. As for the bad fish, they threw them away.
This is the case on the Day of Resurrection. The angels will come. They will separate those who did evil from those who did good.
The wicked will be thrown into the blazing fire. There they will weep and gnash their teeth, burning in torment.
"Do you understand all these things?" Jesus asked them. They replied, "Yes."
He said to them, "Every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure both new and old." A prophet without honor.
Jesus finished telling these stories, and then he left.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth, and entered the synagogue, where he taught with authority among them. They were amazed and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom and this power that is seen in his works?"
Is not this the carpenter's son? and is not his mother called Mary? and his brothers, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?
Aren't all his sisters with us? So where did this man get all these things?
They were never pleased with him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, and among his own people."
He performed few miracles there, because they were not believers.
John the Baptist's head is cut off.
At that time Herod the tetrarch heard reports about Jesus.
He said to his disciples, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles."
Herod arrested John and imprisoned him. He bound him and threw him into prison because of Herodias. She had been married to Philip, Herod's brother.
John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have her as your wife."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he feared the people, for they regarded him as a prophet.
And when Herod's birthday was celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced before Herod and his guests, and pleased him so much.
So he promised her by an oath that he would give her whatever she should ask.
Her mother told her what to say, and the girl said to King Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very angry. However, he remembered his promise and his guests for dinner. So he ordered one of his men to give her what she asked for.
Herod ordered John's head to be cut off in prison.
His head was presented on a large platter and she offered it to the girl, who then carried it to her mother.
John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed five thousand people.
When Jesus heard what had happened to John, he withdrew to a solitary place by boat. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them and healed their sick.
As evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, "This is a remote place, and it's already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves."
Jesus answered, "They do not need to go away; you give them something to eat."
They answered him, "We have only five loaves of bread and two fish."
Bring them to me here.
Then Jesus said to the people, "Sit down on the grass." He took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, blessed them, broke the loaves, and gave them to the disciples, who distributed them to the people.
Everyone ate and was satisfied, and the disciples gathered twelve baskets of the broken pieces that were left.
The number of men who ate was about five thousand. Women and children also ate. Jesus walks on water.
When Jesus had finished speaking to them, he sent the disciples ahead in the boat and went off to be alone.
And when he had sent them away, he went up into the mountain by himself to pray. And when evening came, he was there alone.
The ship had gone far from the shore, and the waves were tossing it violently because the wind was blowing hard against it.
Jesus went out to the disciples early in the morning. He walked on the water.
They saw him walking on the sea and were afraid. They said, "A ghost!" and cried out in terror.
So Jesus immediately said to them, "Take heart! It is I. Do not be afraid."
"Lord, are You?" Peter asked. "If it is You, command me to come to You on the water."
Jesus said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat, walked on the water, and went toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, "Lord, save me!"
Jesus touched his eyes with his finger, and immediately the blind man could see. Jesus said to him, "Your faith has made you well."
When they got into the boat, the wind died down.
Then those in the boat worshiped Jesus, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God!"
They crossed the lake and came to land at Gennesaret.
The people who lived there recognized Jesus, and they sent word to him throughout all the surrounding villages. So many people came to him that he had to tell his disciples to have a small boat ready so that they would not be crushed by the crowd.
They pleaded with him to touch the hem of his garment. And all who touched it were healed.
What makes people "dirty"?
Some Pharisees and scribes came from Jerusalem to see Jesus. And they asked him,
Why don't your students obey what the elders teach? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!
Jesus answered them, "Why do you not keep the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?"
God said: "Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) He also said: "Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death." (Exodus 21:1 Farquhar Farquhar Farquhar Farquhar Farquhar Farquhar
But you allow people to say to their parents, "Any help you may have received from us is a sacred gift to the face of God."
"So they would not be compelled to honor their parents with their wealth. You place the word of God at the level of the lowest of the low to follow your own desires."
O you who claim faith, Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you, saying:
These people flatter me with their words, but their hearts are far from me.
"Their worship is worthless to me; they teach man-made doctrines." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand.
What goes into your mouth does not defile you, but what comes out of your mouth, that is what defiles you.
Then the disciples came to him, saying, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?"
Jesus answered, "There are some who are born of God's field, but they are not of this field. I am asking the Father to take them out, so that they will not be enemies of the field."
Leave them alone. The Pharisees are the guides of the blind. If a blind person leads a blind person, both will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
Don't you understand yet?
Don't you see that everything that goes into the mouth ends up in the stomach? And then it exits the body.
But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and it is what defiles a person.
Evil thoughts come from the heart. So do murder, adultery, and all other sexual immorality. Also theft, bearing false witness, and slandering people.
Those are the things that make you 'unclean.' Eating without washing your hands doesn't make anyone unclean.
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Sidon and Tyre.
A Canaanite woman who lived in the region near Tyre and Sidon came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is tormented by a demon."
Jesus remained silent. His disciples came to him and said, "Get rid of her; she is following us and shouting after us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
Then the woman fell on her knees before him. "Oh, my Lord! Help me!" she said.
He said, "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs."
"Yes, sir," the woman said. "But even dogs eat from their masters' table scraps."
Then Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour. Jesus feeds the four thousand.
Jesus went away from there. He crossed the Sea of Galilee, and went up to the mountain, where He sat down.
A large crowd came to him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the mute, the crippled, and many others who were sick. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them.
The people were amazed. Those who could not speak began to speak. The lame were healed. The paralyzed walked. The blind could see. And the God of Israel was glorified.
Then Jesus called his disciples and said, "I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been with me for three days now and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way."
His disciples answered him, "Here we have only two fish and five loaves of bread."
"How many loaves do you have?" asked Jesus. "Seven," they answered, "and a little fish."
Jesus told the crowds to sit on the ground.
And he took the seven loaves and the fish, and when he had given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
Everyone ate and was satisfied, and the disciples picked up seven baskets of broken pieces that were left over.
The number of men who ate was four thousand. The women and children ate as well.
After Jesus had dismissed the crowds, He got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
Jesus is asked to perform a miracle.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus, and asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
He answered, "In the evening, look at the sky. It says, 'The weather will be good. The sky is red.'"
In the morning you say, "Today the weather will be stormy, for the sky is red and overcast." You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you cannot understand the signs of what is happening now.
"An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." Then he left them and went away. The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees
The disciples crossed to the other side of the sea. They forgot to bring bread with them.
"Beware," Jesus said to them, "of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The pupils spoke among themselves, saying: "He must be saying this because we didn't bring any bread with us."
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Why do you discuss among yourselves that you have no bread? Your faith is so small!"
Have you not yet understood? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand? How many baskets full of fragments did you take up?
Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets full of fragments you took up?
How can you not understand? I did not speak to you about bread. But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Then the disciples understood that he was not telling them to beware of the yeast of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. And Peter said to him, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They said, "Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
But what about you?" he asked them. "Who do you say that I am?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
This is what I tell you: You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not overcome it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Then He commanded the messengers not to reveal His matter to anyone.
From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and rise on the third day.
Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him, saying, "Never, Lord! This must never happen to you!"
Then Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Whoever wants to come with me must deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow me."
"For whoever wishes to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for my sake will find it."
"What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul? What can a man give in exchange for his soul?"
The Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will reward each according to his works.
"What I'm about to tell you is the truth. Some of you standing here will not die before you see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."
The appearance of Jesus changed.
And after six days Jesus took Peter and James and John his brother, and brought them up into an high mountain apart.
And his appearance was transformed before them, and beams of light like the sun flashed from his face. His clothes became white and shining like light.
Suddenly Moses and Elijah appeared before them, and they were speaking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three booths: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And while he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. And from the cloud a voice said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him.”
When the disciples heard this, they were utterly astonished and fell face down on the ground.
But Jesus came and touched them and said, "Get up and do not be afraid."
So when they saw Jesus alone, they were astonished.
They came down from the mountain. And as they were coming down, Jesus commanded them, saying, "Tell no one what you have seen, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
The disciples asked him, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus replied, "You are right. Elijah is coming first to restore all things."
But I tell you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also will they do to the Son of Man.
Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them about John the Baptist. The healing of a possessed boy.
As they approached the crowd, a man ran up to Jesus and fell on his knees before him.
Oh Lord, have mercy on my son, for he suffers from violent tremors and endures great hardship. He often falls into the fire or into the water.
I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.
Jesus said, "You faithless and evil generation! How much longer must I be with you? How much longer must I put up with you? Bring the boy to me."
Jesus commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the boy, and it came out of him immediately. And the boy was healed at that very hour.
Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and asked, "Why could we not cast it out?"
He said, "Because your faith is so small. What I am about to tell you is the truth. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to thereunosunosunosunosunosunosunosunosunosunosunosunosunosunosunosunosunosunosun

They met in Galilee. And Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is to be delivered into the hands of men."
"They will kill him, and on the third day he will rise from the dead." The disciples were filled with great sorrow. Jesus pays the tribute to the temple.
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. And there the tax collectors came to Peter and asked him, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
Yes, he does, he replied. And when Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "Who do the kings of the earth take tolls and taxes from, Bra Bra Bra Bra Bra Bra Bra Bra Bra
Peter answered, "Of others." Jesus said to him, "Then the children are free."
