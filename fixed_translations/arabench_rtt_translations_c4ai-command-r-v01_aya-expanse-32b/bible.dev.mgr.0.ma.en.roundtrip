Uzziah was the father of Jotham, and Jotham was the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh. Manasseh was the father of Amon. And Amon was the father of Josiah.
And Josiah was the father of Jechoniah and his brothers. At that time, the Jewish people were exiled to Babylon.
And then the genealogy of the family continues. Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zechariah was the father of Abijah, and Abijah was the father of Azariah. Azariah was the father of Jehoram.
Azor was the father of Zadok. Zadok was the father of Achimaan. Achimaan was the father of Ahalia.
Eliezer father of Eleazar. Eleazar father of Matthew. Matthew father of Jacob.
Jacob was the father of Joseph. Joseph was the husband of Mary. And Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Christ.
So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, and fourteen generations from David to the exile in Babylon, and fourteen generations from the exile in Babylon to the Messiah. The genealogy of Jesus Christ.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph. But before they came together, she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit.
Her husband, Joseph, was a righteous man. He did not want to embarrass her in public. So, he planned to divorce her secretly.
"While he was pondering these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, 'Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.'"
"You will give birth to a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."
All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet.
"Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel." (Isaiah 7:14)
Joseph awoke and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him. He took Mary as his wife.
And he did not come near her until she gave birth to a son, and he called his name Jesus.
Grandfather's garden is a beautiful place.
Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of King Herod. And behold, angels came to shepherds and said, "Behold, I bring you good news of great joy..."
They asked, "Where is the child who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was greatly disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
Then Herod called the chief priests and the scribes and asked them where the Christ was to be born.
In Bethlehem in Judea, they said. This is what the prophet wrote. He said,
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, yet out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times." (Micah 5:2)
Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them the exact time the star had appeared.
He sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me so that I too may go and worship him."
And when the wise men had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.
When they saw the star, they were filled with joy.
The wise men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They knelt down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures. They offered him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod, so they left for their homeland by another road. The flight of Jesus' family into Egypt.
And when the magi had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child to destroy him."
And Joseph arose and took the child and his mother Mary, and fled with them to Egypt in the darkness of the night.
And he stayed there until the death of King Herod. This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, saying, “Out of Egypt I called my son” (Hosea 11:1).
When Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him, he was furious. He gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its surroundings who were two years old or less, in accordance with the time he had learned from the wise men.
Thus were fulfilled the words which the prophet Jeremiah had spoken. He said:
A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and weeping and great mourning. Rachel weeps for her children and refuses to be comforted, because they are no more. (Jeremiah 31:15) The family of Jesus returns to Nazareth.
And after Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
The angel said, "Take the child and his mother and flee to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child's life are dead."
So Joseph got up and took the child and his mother Mary, and went to the land of Israel.
But he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, and he was afraid to go there. So, in a dream, he was warned to go instead to the land of Galilee.
He lived there in a city called Nazareth. Thus was fulfilled the prophecy of the prophets about Jesus, for they said, "He will be called a Nazarene."
He who prepares the way is called John the Baptist.
In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Repent of your sins! for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
Verily, John is he of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke, saying: "A voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight'" (Isaiah 40:3).
John's clothes were made of camel's hair, and he wore a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
The people went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region around the Jordan.
When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to be baptized by him, and he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Bear fruit worthy of repentance from your sins.
Do not think that you can say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.
The suckers are growing at the base of the trees; every tree that does not bear good fruit, we uproot and burn in the fire.
I baptize you with water, calling you to repent of your sins. But after me comes one who is mightier than I. I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
"The farmer's rope is in his hand to thresh his threshing floor. He gathers his wheat into the barn. But the chaff he burns with unquenchable fire." "The pillars of Jesus' baptism."
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan. He wanted John to baptize him.
But John tried to prevent him, saying to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you, and yet you come to me?"
Jesus answered, "So it must be now. It is right that we should do this, to fulfill the holy will of God." And John agreed.
As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."
Jesus is tempted.
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness, and there the devil tempted him.
And after forty days and forty nights, Jesus was hungry.
The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.' (Deuteronomy 8:3)"
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple.
If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written: "He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you." "On their hands they will bear you up, so that you do not dash your foot against a stone." (Psalm 91:11-12)
Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain. He showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
He said, "If you worship me and bow down to me, I will give you all this."
Jesus said to him, "Away with you, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve'" (Deuteronomy 6:13).
Then the devil left Jesus, and angels came and attended to him. And Jesus began to preach.
John was imprisoned. And when Jesus heard of it, he withdrew into Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and made his home in Capernaum by the Sea of Galilee, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
Thus was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah.
Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali! The Galilee, bathed in the nations' midst, their land reaches from Zidon to the sea of Galilee eastward, and to the Jordan westward!
Those who dwell in the land of darkness, a light will shine on them. They dwell in the land of the shadow of death, a light will dawn upon them.
From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." He chose His first disciples.
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew, casting their nets into the lake. They were fishermen.
Come and follow me, said Jesus. "I will make you fishers of men."
So they left the fish and followed him immediately.
He went on from there and saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John, in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. Jesus called them.
After Jesus had said these things, he left the crowd and went with his disciples to the other side of the sea, to a town called Capernaum. A boat followed close behind, carrying some of his disciples, and they were teaching the people. When the people saw Jesus, they were amazed, and ran to him, and greeted him.
Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
The news about him spread all over Syria. And people brought to him all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases. Some brought those who were paralyzed, others who were suffering severe pains, and still others who were possessed by demons, screaming and shaking violently. Some were unable to move. Jesus healed them all.
Large crowds followed him. Some people came from Galilee, from the region called the Ten Cities, others from Jerusalem and Judea, and still others from the region beyond the Jordan.
Isa gives blessings.
Jesus saw the crowds, and went up into the mountain; and when he had sat down, his disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them. He said:
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
"Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy."
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Hello, robot. How are you today? I am fine, thank you. And you?
<h3>Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven. So they persecuted the prophets who were before you. You are the salt of the earth and the light of the world.</h3>
You are the salt of the earth. But if salt loses its taste, with what can it be seasoned? It is no longer good for anything, but is thrown out and trampled underfoot.
You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hid.
Likewise, no one lights a lamp and puts it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house.
In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven. Jesus fulfills the law completely.
Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. Not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will be erased from the law until everything is accomplished.
Do not break the least of these commandments. And do not teach others to break them. For if you do, you will be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. But keep these commandments and teach them to others. Then you will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
This is what I say to you: You must be holier than the Pharisees and the scribes. If you are not, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. Murder
You have heard that it was said to those of ancient times, 'You shall not murder' (Exodus 20:13). Whoever murders will be subject to judgment.
But I tell you, do not be angry with your brother. Whoever is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment. And whoever says to his brother, 'Raca,' will be answerable to the Sanhedrin. But whoever says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of hellfire.
"Suppose you are presenting your offering at the altar and you remember that your brother has something against you..."
Leave your gift there before the altar. First go and be reconciled with your brother, and then come and present your gift.
Suppose someone has a grievance against you and wants to sue you. Be sure to settle the matter quickly. Do it immediately and without delay while you are still on the way with him. Otherwise, he may hand you over to the judge. The judge may then hand you over to the police officer. You may end up in jail.
I'm not going to update you on it, really. You're not leaving here until you pay the last penny! Bastards.
You have heard that it was said, "Do not commit adultery." (Exodus 20:14)
But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman to desire her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
If your right hand should lead you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. This hand of yours is but a part of your body; to lose it is better for you than to have your whole body thrown into Hell.
It is written: "When a man takes a wife and marries her, if then she finds no favor in his eyes because he has found some indecency in her, and he writes her a certificate of divorce and puts it in her hand and sends her out of his house" (Deuteronomy 24:1).
But I tell you, anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. Let a man not separate from his wife except in the case of marital unfaithfulness. Now regarding oaths...
And you have heard another thing taught to your fathers: "You shall not break the covenant, but you shall fulfill the promises you have made to the Lord."
But this is what I will tell you. Never make such promises again. Don't offer them in the name of heaven. That is God's throne.
Do not make it in the name of Earth. That is reserved for the feet of God. Do not make it in the name of Jerusalem. That is the city of the great King.
"And do not swear by your heads, for they swear by the [celestial] bodies that move with precision. And you do not know what you will earn tomorrow, and you do not know by what land you will die. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Aware."
Haggle, haggle, haggle, haggle, haggle, haggle, haggle, haggle, haggle, haggle, haggle, haggle, haggle, haggle
You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." (Exodus 21:24, Leviticus 24:20, Deuteronomy 19:21)
But this is what I tell you: Do not resist the one who is evil. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.
If someone sues you for your shirt, let him have your coat as well.
If you are forced to walk with someone for a mile, go with them for two miles.
Give to him who asks you, and do not turn away from him who wants to borrow from you. Love your enemies.
You have heard that it was said, "Love your neighbor and hate your enemy."
But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.
"So be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect. For He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust."
If you love those who love you, what reward do you expect? Even tax collectors do that.
If you only greet your family and friends, what are you doing more than pagans do? Even unbelievers do that.
Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Giving to the needy
Beware of doing good deeds in front of people to be seen by them. Do not do them so that others may praise you. For if you do, your Father in heaven will not reward you.
And when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be praised by people. I tell you the truth, they have already received their reward.
When you give to the poor, do so in private, so that your left hand does not know what your right hand is doing.
Then you give charity in secret, for indeed your Father sees what you do. And your prayer...
When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, who love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by people. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward.
When you pray, go into your room, close your door, and pray to your Father who is in secret. For your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
Pray, but do not prolong your prayers like the disbelievers, who think that their prayers will be answered merely by talking a lot.
Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.
"Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
"You reign over heaven and earth; your will be done on earth as in heaven."
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
Protect us from falling into sin during times of trial. Save us from the accursed Satan.
Forgive people when they wrong you, for if you forgive them, your Father in heaven will also forgive you.
"And if you do not forgive people their slips, neither will your Father forgive your slips. Your fasting."
When you fast, do not be like the hypocrites, who disfigure their faces and pretend to be pious. They think they will be praised for what they do. But they will be rewarded in this life only.
But when you fast, anoint your head with oil and wash your face.
"Then let your treasure be in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."
<h3>Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.</h3>
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
Your heart will be where your treasure is.
The eye is like a lamp for the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light.
But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. For either he will hate one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Therefore, do not be anxious.
I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you shall eat or what you shall drink, nor about your body, what you shall put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
Look at the birds of the sky, they neither sow nor reap, nor gather into barns, and your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much better than they?
Can you add an hour to your life by worrying?
"Why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they do not toil nor spin."
But listen to what I tell you: not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of these flowers.
If God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O men of little faith?
"So do not worry," says Allah, "O My servants, you are not in need of anything, whether it be food that you eat or clothing that you wear."
The unbelievers strive after all these things. Your heavenly Father knows that you need them.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own troubles. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Be fair when judging others.
Do not judge others, lest you be judged.
You will be judged in the same way you judge others. You will be measured in the way you measure others.
You see the mote in your friend's eye, but you do not notice the beam in your own eye.
How can you tell your friend, "Let me take the splinter out of your eye," while you have a beam in your own eye?
O you hypocrite! Do you not see the speck in your own wooden eye? So when you remove it, then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.
Do not give what is holy to the dogs, and do not throw your pearls before pigs, lest they trample them underfoot and turn to attack you. Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.
Ask and you shall receive; seek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened unto you.
He who asks is given, he who seeks finds, and the door is opened to the humble and eager.
Suppose your son asks for bread. Which one of you would give him a stone?
"Or if he asked for a fish, would you give him a snake?"
"If you, then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!"
Do to others what you would want them to do to you. This is what is written in the Law and the Prophets. In all things, big and small.
Enter the Kingdom of God through the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction and hell, and there are many who enter through it.
But the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and only a few find it. A tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves.
"You can tell what they really are by their fruits. Do people pick grapes from thorn bushes? Do they gather figs from thistles?"
So every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
Every tree is known by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
They will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord! Did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?'
Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!' The wise and the foolish were building together.
So everyone who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on rock.
The rain falls. The water rises. The wind blows and strikes that house. But it does not fall. For it was built on the rock.
But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built his house on the ground without a foundation.
The rain fell. The water rose. The winds blew and screamed at that house. And it fell with a loud crash.
And Jesus ended these sayings, and the multitudes were astonished at his teaching.
He spoke with authority, not like our rabbis.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain. A large crowd followed him.
A man with leprosy came to him and knelt down, begging to be healed. "Lord," he said, "if you are willing, you can make me clean."
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man...
Then Jesus said to him, "Tell no one, but go and show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." The faith of the centurion of Rome.
When Jesus came to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached him and asked for his help.
My lord, he said, my servant is lying at home, paralyzed and in great pain.
Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
The commander said, "My lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word, and my servant will be healed."
I myself am a man under authority, and I have soldiers who obey my orders. I say to this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith."
I tell you, many will come from east and west and recline at table with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
But those who think they belong to the kingdom will be thrown out into the darkness. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go, and let it be done for you as you have believed." And the boy was healed at that very hour.
When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus touched her hand, and immediately she was healed. She rose at once and began to serve him.
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to Jesus, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick.
Its translation is: He did this to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah had said: "He carried our sufferings and our diseases; he bore them himself." (Isaiah 53:4) The cost of following Jesus is high.
Jesus, seeing the crowd around him, instructed his disciples to take the boat and precede him to the other side of the sea.
Then a teacher of the law came to him and said, "Wherever you go, I will follow you."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
Another servant said to him, "Master, let me first go and bury my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow Me. Let the dead bury their own dead." And Jesus calmed the storm.
And Jesus got into the boat and his disciples followed him.
Suddenly a fierce storm swept across the lake. Waves broke over the boat. Jesus was sleeping.
When Jesus got into the boat, his disciples followed him. And behold, there arose a great storm on the sea, so that the boat was being swamped by the waves; but he was asleep. And they went to him and woke him, saying, “Save us, Lord! We are perishing!”
He said, "O you of little faith! Why did you doubt?" Then Jesus got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it became completely calm.
And the disciples were amazed, asking, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the sea obey him!" Jesus heals two demon-possessed men.
Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake, in the region of the Gadarenes. Two men possessed by demons, who had come out of the tombs, met him. They were so violent that no one dared to pass that way.
O Son of God, what do you want with us? Have you come to torment us before our time?
Not far away, large herds of pigs were being pastured.
And the demons begged him, saying, "If you have come to torment us, let us go into the pigs." There was a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain, and they begged him to let them go into the pigs.
Jesus said to them, "Go." The demons came out of the men and entered the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake and was drowned.
And the herdsmen of the swine ran away and told it in the city and in the fields. And they went out to see what had happened, and came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
Then the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk.
Jesus got into the boat, and crossed over, and came to his own city.
Its translation is: Some men came to him, carrying a paralyzed man on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to one another, "This man speaks blasphemy!"
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Rise and walk"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he said to the paralytic, "Get up, take your mat and go to your house."
The man stood up and went to his house.
When the crowds saw this, they were amazed and praised God, who had given such authority to human beings. They called out to Jesus, "Blessed are you, Lord, son of David!" And Jesus went away from there.
As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he told him, and Matthew got up and followed him.
Then Jesus went with them to a dinner at Levi's house, where many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with him and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick."
Go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’ *Hosea 6:6* ‘I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.’ Jesus is asked about fasting.
One day the disciples of John came to him and said, "Teacher, we are fasting, and the Pharisees are fasting too, but your disciples are not fasting. Why is this?"
Jesus answered them, "Can the wedding guests mourn while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them and then they will fast."
People do not tear a patch from a new garment to mend an old one; otherwise they would have nothing left to wear.
People do not pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the new wine will burst the old skins, the wine will be spilled, and the skins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.
While he was still speaking, someone came from the ruler's house and said, "Your daughter is dead. Why bother the teacher any longer?"
And Jesus rose and followed him, and so did the disciples.
And immediately a woman who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment, for she said to herself, "If I only touch his garment, I will be made well." Jesus turned around and saw her and said, "Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well." And at once the woman was made well.
She thought to herself: "All I need to do is touch his clothes, and I will be healed."
And Jesus turned and saw her, and said, "Woman, your faith has made you well." And the woman was made whole at once.
And when Jesus entered the house of the Pharisee, he saw there harpists. And a great multitude of people were pressing in.
He said to them, "Go, the girl is not dead, she is sleeping." But they laughed at him.
And when they had put the multitude outside, they brought him in to her. And he took her by the hand, and the maiden arose immediately.
The news about what Jesus had done spread all over that region. Jesus healed two blind men.
And at that time, two blind men followed him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
And when Jesus entered the house, the blind men came to him, and he said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They said, "Yes, Lord!"
Then he touched their eyes and said, "According to your faith, let it be done to you."
And Jesus sternly warned them, "See that no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They talked about it everywhere in that area.
As they were going out, a man who was demon-possessed was brought to him. The man was blind and could not speak.
And when the demon was cast out, the man spoke. And the people were amazed, and said, "We have never seen anything like this in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "It is by the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons, that he drives out demons." Few are those who are chosen.
Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness.
When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
Therefore ask the master of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.
Jesus sends the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
Here are the names of the twelve apostles. Starting with Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then James the son of Zebedee and his brother John.
The next are Philip and Bartholomew, also Thomas and Matthew the tax collector. Two others are James the son of Alphaeus and Judas the Zealot.
The last two were Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas would later betray Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent out the twelve with these instructions: "Do not go among the Gentiles, and do not enter any town of the Samaritans.
Go to the people of Israel instead, they are like lost sheep.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Say,
Heal the sick. Raise the dead. Cleanse the lepers. Cast out demons. You received freely, give freely.
Do not carry with you in your belts gold or silver or copper.
Don't take a bag for the trip. Don't carry extra clothes, sandals, or walking sticks. The worker is given what he needs.
When you enter a town or village, seek out someone who is willing to host you. Stay in their home until you leave.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. When you enter a house, greet its people.
If that house welcomes you, bless it with peace. If it does not, do not bless it.
Not all people will welcome you or listen to your words. And if they don't, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that house or town.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. It will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that city.
I send you out as sheep among wolves; therefore be as wise as serpents and as innocent as doves.
Beware! They will hand you over to the local courts. They will whip you in their temples.
You will be brought before governors and kings because of me. You will be witnesses for me to them and to the Gentiles.
But when they deliver you up, do not worry about how or what you should speak. For it will be given to you in that hour what you should speak.
It will not be you who speaks, but the spirit of your father speaking through you.
Brothers will hand over their brothers to be killed. Fathers will hand over their sons. Sons will rise against their fathers and kill them.
Everyone will hate you because of me. But whoever endures to the end will be saved.
If people attack you in one place, flee to another. What I am about to tell you is true: you will not finish your tour of the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes.
A student is not better than his teacher. A servant is not better than his master.
It is enough for a disciple to be like his teacher, and enough for a servant to be like his master. If the head of the house is called Beelzebul, what will they say of the rest of his household?
So do not be afraid of your enemies. Everything that is covered up will be revealed, and everything that is hidden will be made known.
What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the roofs.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Are not the sparrows of the garden sold for two farthings? And one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.
He even counts every hair on your head!
"So do not fear, for you have with you more (protection) than the stones of the birds."
What about someone who says in front of people, "I know him"? I will say in front of my Father in heaven, "I know you."
But whoever says to his brother, ‘You fool!’ shall be in danger of hellfire.
Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
I have come to set a son against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and daughters-in-law against their mothers-in-law.
A man's enemies are the members of his own household. (Micah 7:6)
Whoever loves a father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves a son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it.
Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.
"Indeed, he who purifies his heart to obey the Most Merciful and not obey the lowly self, his reward is with the Most Merciful. And thus do We inspire those who wish to purify their hearts from their Lord. And none will grasp this except those with intellect."
"Suppose someone were to give even a single cup of cold water to a little child who follows me. I tell you truly, that person will certainly be rewarded."
Jesus and John, peace be upon them.
After Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard about the deeds of Christ, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked Jesus, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect another?"
Jesus answered and said to them, "Go and tell John what you hear and see."
The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor.
Blessed are those who do not disdain My service and do not lose faith in Me.
Jesus said to the crowds, as he spoke about John and his disciples leaving: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
So what did you go to see? A man in fine clothes? No, for people in fine clothes are in the palaces of kings.
"What did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet."
He is the one written about in the books: "I will send my messenger, who will prepare the way before me" (Malachi 3:1).
What I am about to tell you is the truth. No one greater than John the Baptist has ever been born, but the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
Since the days of John the Baptist, the Queen of Heaven has been advancing with power, and the strong ones are those who hold her.
All the prophets and the law were translated until John came.
If you are willing to accept it, John is the Elijah who was to come.
Let those who listen, listen.
The people today are like wombs that are guided by their children in the cradle, saying, "Come, let someone wipe away a bit of my Khurasani dust or stroke my thighs with the planets."
We left the drums beating for you. But you did not dance. We mourned your death, but you did not grieve.
When John came, he neither ate nor drank as you do. And people said, "He has a demon."
But when the Son of Man came eating and drinking, they said, "Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!" And wisdom is justified by her children. The cities that did not repent of their sin.
Jesus began to denounce the cities where most of his miracles had been done, because they did not repent of their sins. He said:
Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
But I tell you, on the day of judgment it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon than for you.
And you, O earth, will you raise me up to heaven? No, but you will go down to the abyss! If the signs that were done in you had been done in Sodom, they would have remained until this day.
"But I tell you that on the day of judgment the people of Sodom will be treated less severely than you." Comfort for the weary.
At that time Jesus said, "Father, Lord of heaven and earth, you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants."
Yes, Father. This is what I wanted.
My father gave me everything. Only the Father knows the Son, and only the Son knows the Father. And it is he who chooses to reveal the Father to some.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Be my servants and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
My service is easy and my maintenance is light.
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On the Sabbath, Jesus was walking through the fields. His disciples plucked some heads of grain, rubbed them in their hands, and ate them.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to Jesus, "Look, your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath."
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and his men?"
So he entered the house of God, he and his men, and they ate the sacred bread, which was not lawful for them to eat, for only the priests could eat it.
Haven't you read the law? It says how the priests in the temple should do their work on the Sabbath. But they are not guilty.
I tell you that there is One greater than the temple here.
The book says: "I desired mercy, not sacrifice" (Hosea 6:6). You do not know what these words mean. Otherwise, you would not be making accusations against the innocent.
"The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
And from there Jesus went to their temple.
There was a man there whose hand was withered and diseased. The Pharisees were watching Jesus to see if he would heal on the Sabbath, so they asked him, "Is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the Sabbath? To save life or to kill?"
He said to them, "If one of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
A man is of greater value than sheep! That is why the law permits us to do good on the Sabbath.
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out, and it was restored, just as sound as the other one.
But the Pharisees went out and plotted to kill Jesus, the chosen servant of God.
Jesus knew all that the Pharisees were doing, and he left that place. A large crowd followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But he warned them not to reveal his identity.
This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah:
"Behold, My servant, whom I have chosen; My beloved in whom My soul is well-pleased. I will put My Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations."
He will not argue or shout. No one will hear his voice in the streets.
He will not break a bent branch. He will not extinguish a flickering flame. He will fix everything.
"The nations will put their hope in him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebul
A man possessed by a demon was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and mute. Jesus healed him. So the man spoke and saw.
And the whole multitude was amazed, and said, "Is this the Son of David?"
The Pharisees heard this and said, "It is by the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons, that he drives out these demons."
Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand."
If a devil drives out another devil, he is fighting himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
You say that I cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. But by what power do your followers cast them out? Let them judge for themselves.
But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Or think of it this way: How can you enter a strong man's house and seize his possessions? You must tie him up first. Then you can plunder his house.
He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.
So this is what I tell you. Every sin and every blasphemy that is spoken against God can be forgiven. But blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is not forgiven.
"Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come."
A good tree bears good fruit, and a bad tree bears bad fruit. You can tell a tree by its fruit.
O brood of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
A good man says good things. They spring from the good within him. And an evil man says evil things. They spring from the evil within him.
But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken.
"By your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned." - Yunus the Miracle.
Some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus and said, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
He answered them: "The evildoers, the wicked, ask for a sign. No sign shall be given to them except the sign of Jonah the prophet."
Jonah was in the belly of a great fish for three days and three nights. So will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
The men of Nineveh will stand up in judgment with this generation. The Ninevites will stand up against that generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now one greater than Jonah is here.
The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, one greater than Solomon is here.
What happens when an evil spirit comes out of a man? It wanders through the dry places seeking a resting place, but it finds none.
Then he says, "I will return to the house I left." When he arrives, he finds the house empty. The house has been cleaned and tidied with care.
Then the devil goes out of the person, taking with him seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they go in and live there. As a result, that person's final condition is worse than the first. It will be the same for this wicked generation in this age.
Jesus' mother and brothers were standing outside, wanting to speak to him, while he was still talking to the crowd.
Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside. They want to speak to you."
Jesus answered, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
And Jesus said to his disciples, "Behold, my mother and my brothers.
"Whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother."
The Farmer's Tale
On the same day, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea of Galilee.
A large crowd gathered around him, so he took a boat and sat in it. All the people stood on the shore.
Then he told them many things in parables, saying: "A farmer went out to sow his seed.
He sowed the seed on the ground. Some of it fell on the path, and the birds came and ate it.
Some seeds fell on rocky places, where there was not much soil. The plants sprouted quickly because the soil was not deep.
When the sun rose, it burned the plants. They withered because they had no roots.
Other seeds fell among the thorns. The thorns grew up and choked the plants.
And some fell on good soil, and produced a crop: one a hundredfold, another sixtyfold, and another thirtyfold.
"He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
The disciples came to him and asked, "Why do you speak to the people in parables?"
He said, "To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to those outside, it has not been given."
To those who have that kind of knowledge, more will be given. In fact, they will have abundance. But to those who do not have that knowledge, even the little they think they have will be taken away.
This is why I use stories when I talk to people. I tell them, "They look but they don't really see. They hear but they don't really listen or understand."
In them the words of the prophet Isaiah are fulfilled, who said, "You will indeed hear, but you will not understand; and you will indeed see, but you will not perceive."
"Their hearts have become hard, so they do not hear with their ears, and they have made their eyes blind, lest they see with them, and their ears deaf. Do they not reflect within themselves or turn their ears to hear and their eyes to see their Lord? If they did, perhaps they would return."
But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and blessed are your ears, for they hear.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. Many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you see, but they did not see it. They wanted to hear what you hear, but they did not hear it.
Listen! This is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message about the kingdom but do not understand it, and then the evil one comes and steals what was sown in their hearts. Those people are like the seed sown on the path.
And others are those who are like the grain that falls in stony places, who hear the word and immediately receive it with joy.
But they have no roots. Therefore their faith lasts only for a little while. When trouble or persecution arises because of the message, they quickly fall away.
Others fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, because they had no depth of soil. But when the sun rose, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.
Just as some of the seed fell on good soil, they heard the word and understood it, and they bore fruit: some produced thirty, some sixty, and some a hundredfold. The weed version.
He told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
While everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. He sowed weeds among the wheat and then left.
The wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
His servants came to him and said, "Master, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Then where did the weeds come from?"
He said, "An enemy did this." The servants asked him, "Do you want us to go and pull up the weeds?"
"You'll only get rid of the weeds, but with them, you'll get rid of the wheat," the owner replied.
"Let them grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and store it in my barn."
Jesus also said to the crowds another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field."
It is the smallest of your seeds, but when it grows, it becomes the largest of garden plants. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest on its branches.
Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour until it was all leavened."
Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables; indeed, he did not speak to them without a parable.
The prophets opened their mouths and spoke * With ancient words, secreted from of old. 78:2 Jesus explains the parable of the twin.
Then Jesus left the crowd and went into the house. And His disciples came to Him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the tares in the field."
He answered them, "The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man."
The field is the world. Good seeds represent the people who belong to the kingdom. Weeds are people who belong to the enemy of good.
The enemy who sows it is the devil. The harvest is the day of judgment. And the workers are the angels.
Weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire. That is how it will be on the day of judgment.
The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will remove from his kingdom everything that causes people to sin and all evildoers.
They will cast them into the flaming fire. There, people will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then the friends of God will exult in the kingdom of their Father, as the sun exalts in the firmament. They hear and obey. Their example is like that of a hidden treasure and a buried pearl in the sea.
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid. Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.
The kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.
He found one of great value, so he went and sold all that he had and bought that pearl. The parable of the net.
And as we have said before, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea and gathered fish of every kind.
When the net was full, the fishermen pulled it to the shore. Then they sat down and took the good fish, putting them in the baskets. As for the bad fish, they threw them away.
This is what it will be like on the Day of Judgment. The angels will come. They will separate those who did evil from those who did good.
They will cast the wicked into the blazing furnace. There they will weep and gnash their teeth in anguish.
"Do you understand all these things?" Jesus asked them. They replied, "Yes."
He said to them, "Every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure both new and old." A prophet without honor.
Jesus ended these parables, and then departed from there.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth. And there he began to teach the people in their synagogue. They were amazed and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom and the power to do miracles?"
Isn't this the carpenter's son? And isn't his mother called Mary? And his brothers, James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
Aren't all his sisters with us? So where did this man get all these things?
They were not at all happy with him. Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home."
He performed few miracles there, because they were not believers.
John the Baptist's head is cut off.
At that time, Herod the tetrarch of Galilee and Perea heard about Jesus.
He said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles."
Herod arrested John. He bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias. She was the wife of his brother Philip.
John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he feared the people, for they regarded John as a prophet.
At Herod's birthday banquet, the daughter of Herodias danced before Herod and his guests. He was greatly pleased with her.
So he swore to him that he would give him whatever he asked for.
Her mother told her what to say, so the girl said to King Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very angry, but he remembered his promise and his guests for dinner, so he ordered one of his men to give her what she asked for.
Herod ordered John's head to be cut off in prison.
His head was presented on a large platter to the girl, who then carried it to her mother.
John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed five thousand people.
When Jesus heard what had happened to John, he withdrew to a solitary place by boat. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them and healed their sick.
When it was almost evening, his disciples came to him and said, "This is a desolate place, and the time is now late. Send the crowds away so that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves."
Jesus answered, "They need not depart; you give them to eat."
We said, "We have only five loaves and two fish."
He said to them, "They are here."
Then Jesus said to the people, "Sit down on the grass." He took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, blessed them, broke the loaves, and gave them to the disciples, who distributed them to the people.
Everyone ate and was satisfied, and the disciples gathered up the broken pieces that were left over, twelve baskets full.
And those who ate of the loaves were about five thousand men, besides women and children. And they took up the broken pieces that remained.
And he commanded the disciples to get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd.
And after he had sent them away, he went up into the mountain to pray by himself. And when evening was come, he was there alone.
The ship was already far from the shore, and the waves were tossing it violently because the wind was blowing against it.
Early in the morning, Jesus came to the disciples. And he walked on the sea.
They saw him walking on the lake and were terrified. They said, "It's a ghost!" and cried out in fear.
So Jesus immediately said to them, "Take heart! It is I. Do not be afraid."
"Master, are You?" asked Peter. "If it is You, command me to come to You on the water."
Jesus said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat, walked on the water, and went toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, "Lord, save me!"
And immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and caught him, and said to him, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"
When they boarded the boat, the wind died down.
So they submitted (to Islam) and said: "In truth, you are the son of Allah!"
They crossed the lake and came down to Capernaum.
The men who lived in that place recognized him, and they sent messengers throughout the whole region. They brought to him all who were sick.
They begged him to allow only the sick to touch the fringe of his garment. And everyone who touched it was healed.
What makes people "unclean"?
Some Pharisees and scribes came from Jerusalem to see Jesus.
Why don't your students comply with what the elders teach? They don't wash their hands before eating!
Jesus answered, "Why do you not keep the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?"
Allah said: "Fulfill the covenant, indeed the covenant will be asked about" (Surah Al-Isra, Verse 34) And He said: "Lower to them the wing of humility out of mercy, and say, 'My Lord, have mercy on them as they raised me when I was small'" (Surah Al-Isra, Verse 24)
But you allow people to say to parents: "Any help you receive from us is a gift from God."
"So they do not need to honor their parents with their gift. You nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition."
Oh hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you. He said,
These people honor me with their words, but their hearts are far from me.
"Their worship means nothing to me. They only know the rules of men." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus gathered the people around him and said to them, "Hear and understand."
What goes into your mouth does not defile you, but what comes out of your mouth, that is what defiles you.
Then his disciples came to him and said, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus answered, "There are some who are born of flesh and blood, and there are others who are born of the Spirit. You should not be surprised at my saying, 'You must be born again.'"
Leave them alone. The Pharisees are the guides of the blind. If a blind person leads a blind person, both will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Do you not yet understand?" Jesus asked them.
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes to the stomach. Then it comes out of the body.
But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart. These are the things that make you 'unclean'.
Evil thoughts come from the heart. So do murder, adultery, and all other sexual immorality. Also theft, bearing false witness, and slander.
Those are the things that make you 'unclean.' Eating without washing your hands does not make you unclean.
And Jesus left Galilee, and came to the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.
A Canaanite woman from Canaan, who lived near Tyre and Sidon, came to him and cried out, saying, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon."
Jesus remained silent. The disciples came to him and pleaded, "Send her away, for she is crying out after us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
Then the woman knelt down before him. "Oh, my Lord! Help me!" she said.
He replied, "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
"Yes, sir," the woman said. "But even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' tables."
Then Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour. Jesus feeds the four thousand.
Jesus went from there. He walked along the shore of the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up the mountain and sat down there.
A large crowd came to him, bringing with them the blind, the lame, the paralyzed, the mute, and many others. They placed them at his feet, and he healed them.
The people were amazed. Those who could not speak were speaking, the lame were healed, the mute were talking, the blind were seeing. And the people praised the God of Israel.
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been with me for three days now and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."
His disciples answered him, "We have nothing here but five loaves and two fish." They said, "How can we feed all these people with such a small amount of food?"
"How many loaves do you have?" asked Jesus. "Seven," they answered, "and a few small fish."
Jesus told the crowds to sit on the ground.
And he took the seven loaves and the fish, and when he had given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and they to the multitude.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples then picked up seven baskets full of the remaining pieces.
The number of men who ate was four thousand. The women and children ate as well.
After Jesus had dismissed the crowds, he got into the boat and came to the region of Magadan.
Jesus is asked to give a sign as a miracle.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus, and asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
He said, "In the evening, look at the sky. It says, the weather will be good. The sky is red."
In the morning you say, "The weather will be stormy today. The sky is red and cloudy." You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you do not understand the signs of what is happening now.
A wicked people who disbelieved in the signs of their Lord and the meeting of the Hereafter. They seek a sign, but they will not be given a sign except for the sign of Jonah. And the sects among the people of the Book disagreed.
The pupils crossed over to the other side of the lake. But they forgot to take the bread with them.
"Beware," Jesus told them, "of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
And the disciples said to one another, "He says this because we took no bread with us."
Jesus perceived their thoughts, and said to them, "Why do you think among yourselves, because you have no bread? Your faith is so small!"
Do you not yet understand? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand? Or the twelve baskets full of fragments?
Were not seven loaves enough for four thousand? How many baskets of fragments did you take up?
How can you not understand? I did not speak to you about bread. But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
The disciples finally understood that Jesus was not warning them about the yeast used for bread, but about the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter said that Jesus was the Messiah.
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They said, "Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
But what about you?" he asked them. "Who do you say that I am?"
Simon Peter answered and said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
This is what I tell you: You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not overcome it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Then Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. He spoke about his impending death.
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.
Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him, saying, "Far be it from you, Lord! This must never happen to you!"
Then Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me."
If he wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for me, he will find it.
What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?
The Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will reward each according to his works.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. Some of those standing here will not die before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
The appearance of Jesus changed.
And after six days Jesus took Peter and James and John his brother, and brought them up into an high mountain apart.
And his appearance was altered before them, and his face shone as the sun, and his garments became white as light.
Suddenly Moses and Elijah appeared before them, and they were speaking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three booths: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And while he was still speaking to them, behold, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. Listen to him."
When the disciples heard this, they were terrified and fell to the ground with their faces prostrate.
"And if We had destroyed them while they were unjust, We would not have destroyed them completely, but We would have seized them while they were blind and deaf."
And when they looked up, they saw only one man, and he was Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. And as they were coming down, Jesus commanded them, saying, "Tell no one what you have seen, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
The disciples asked him, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus replied, "Yes, it is true. Elijah is coming first to prepare everything."
But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also will the Son of Man suffer at their hands."
The disciples finally understood that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Healing of a boy possessed by a demon.
And when they came near to the multitude, a man fell on his knees before Jesus.
Sir, have mercy on my son, for he suffers from severe tremors, and often falls into fire or water.
I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.
"You hypocrites and evil doers!" Jesus replied. "How long must I stay with you? How long must I bear with you? Bring the boy to me."
Jesus commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it left him instantly. The boy was healed at that very moment.
Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and asked, "Why could we not cast it out?"
He said, "Because your faith is so small. What I am about to tell you is true. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."

They met in Galilee. And Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is to be delivered into the hands of men."
"They will kill him, and on the third day he will rise from the dead." The disciples were filled with great sorrow. Jesus pays the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. And when they were in the house, the tax collectors came to Peter and said to him, "Does your teacher not pay the tax?"
Yes, he does, answered Peter. And when Peter had come into the house, Jesus spoke first to him. "What do you think, Simon?" He asked. "Whom do the kings of the earth take custom or taxes from, their own children or strangers?"
Peter said, "I am last." Jesus said to him, "Therefore, let not the sons judge."
But we don't want to anger them. So go to the lake and cast your line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. There you will find the coin you need exactly. Take it and give it to them as a tax for me and you.
