environmentalist Who is the most important person in the kingdom?
When the disciples came to Jesus, they asked him, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Jesus called a little child to him and stood him among them.
Jesus said, "Verily I say unto you, except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven."
Whoever becomes humble like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
"Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me."
"But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea."
How terrible it is for the world that temptation to sin comes! But woe to those who yield to temptation and commit sin!
"If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away from you. It is better for you to enter eternal life maimed or lame, than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire, where the fire never goes out."
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. How much more valuable is a person than a sheep!
"See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father who is in heaven."
Translation
What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go to look for the one that went astray?
What I am about to tell you is the truth. He is happier with the one that did not go astray than with the ninety-nine that did not.
He is like a father to you in heaven. He does not want any of these little ones to perish. When someone does you wrong
If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over.
But what if they do not listen to you? Take one or two others with you, for a matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses. (Deuteronomy 19:15)
But if he refuses to listen to them also, take him to the church. And if he refuses to listen to the church also, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. What you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and what you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
And I say to you again: If two of you agree on earth about anything they ask for, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
"Wherever two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them." The unforgiving servant
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
And the king had already begun, when a man with millions of dollars in debt was brought before him.
The man was unable to pay, so his master ordered that the man, his wife, children, and all his possessions be sold to settle the debt.
The servant fell to his knees before him. "Give me time," he pleaded. "I'll pay everything."
His master had pity on his condition, so he forgave him his debt and set him free.
So the servant who owed money went out and found his fellow servant who owed him a few coins, and he grabbed him by the throat and said, "Pay me what you owe!"
And the other servant fell on his knees and pleaded, "Give me a chance, my lord, and I will repay you."
But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and threw the man into prison until he could pay back all he owed.
The other servants saw what had happened. They were very disturbed by it. So they went and told their master everything that had happened.
Then his master summoned the first slave and said to him, 'You wicked slave! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me.
"Would you not prefer to have a superiority over your enemies, as you have rescued me from the enemy?"
His master was angry, so he handed him over to the guards. He will be punished until he repays everything he owes.
So will My Heavenly Father do to you all, unless you forgive your brother from your heart.
Jesus taught about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
A large crowd followed him, and he healed many who were sick there.
Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that from the beginning God made them male and female?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
They are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.
They said, "Why then did Moses command a man to divorce his wife with a written document and send her away from his house?"
Jesus answered, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of heart, but it was not this way from the beginning."
This is what I told you. Whoever divorces his wife and marries another is an adulterer. A man can divorce his wife only if she is unfaithful to him.
The disciples said to him, "If such is the case between husband and wife, it is better not to marry."
Jesus answered, "Not everyone accepts this teaching of mine. Only those to whom God has revealed it. They are the ones who have been born of God. They are the ones who call God their Father, and they love me. And I love them. And I will reveal to them the name of my Father."
Some men cannot have children because they were born that way. Some were made that way by others. Others have made themselves that way for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever can accept it, let him do so." Small children are presented to Jesus.
Some people brought little children to Jesus, asking him to place his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples rebuked the people.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for such is the kingdom of heaven."
Jesus laid his hands on them, and then departed from there. Jesus and the Rich Young Man
A man said to him, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to inherit eternal life?"
"Why do you ask Me about what is good?" Jesus replied. "There is only One who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments."
"Which?" asked the man. Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness."
'Honor your father and your mother.' (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) And 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' (Leviticus 19:18)
I have obeyed all those commandments, said the young man. What more shall I do?
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
When the boy heard that, he left sadly. He was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
And I say to you again: It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.
When the disciples heard this, they were astonished and asked, "Then who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter answered and said to him, "We have left everything and followed you. What then will there be for us?"
Jesus said to them, "What I am about to tell you is true: when everything is renewed, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, and all of you who have followed me will sit on glorious thrones as well. You twelve will judge the twelve tribes of Israel."
"Whoever leaves house or parents or children or fields or trade for my sake and for the gospel's, will receive a hundredfold and inherit eternal life."
But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.
The Story of the Workers in the Vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
He agreed to pay them the usual wage for a day's work. Then he sent them to his vineyard.
He went out again around nine o'clock in the morning. He saw others standing in the market doing nothing.
He said to them, "You also go and work in my vineyard. I will pay you the right wage."
So they went. He also went out at noon and at the third hour, and did the same.
He left around five o'clock and found others standing there. He asked them, "Why are you standing here all day doing nothing?"
They said, "Because no one has hired us." He said to them, "You also go and work in my vineyard."
And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, "Call the workers and give them their pay, beginning with the last and then going to the first."
The workers who were hired around five o'clock arrived. Each of them received a full day's pay as usual.
So when the first group of workers came, he hired them at the same wage he had hired the others.
When they received it, they started complaining about its owner.
They said, "These people who were recently appointed only worked for one hour, yet you paid them the same as us. We did most of the work and spent the whole day under the scorching sun."
The shop owner said to one of them, "My friend, I am dealing with you fairly. Didn't you agree to work for your usual daily wage for one day?"
Take your money and go. I want to give the ones I've recently hired the same salary I gave you.
Don't I have the right to do as I please with my own money? Do you feel wronged because I generously gave to others?
So the middle will be first, and the first will be middle.
Jesus went up to Jerusalem. On the way, he took the Twelve aside and began to tell them what was going to happen to him.
"We are going up to Jerusalem," he said, "and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death"
Then they will hand him over to foreigners, not Jews, who will mock him, beat him, and crucify him, and on the third day he will rise from the dead!
The mother of Zebedes' sons came to Jesus with her sons, and kneeling down, asked him for something.
"What do you want?" Jesus asked her. She said, "Grant that one of my sons may sit at your right hand and the other at your left in your kingdom."
Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am to drink?" They said to him, "We are able."
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from the cup that I drink from. But to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared."
The other ten pupils heard about it. They were angry with the brothers.
Jesus called them together and said, "You know that the rulers in the Gentile world lord it over their people, and their high officials exercise power over them."
Do not be like this. But whoever wishes to be first among you must be a servant of all.
"And whoever wants to be first among you must be your servant."
Be like the Son of Man, who did not come to be served, but to serve others. He came to give his life as a ransom for many, so that they might be set free from their slavery.
Jesus and his disciples left Jericho, and a large crowd followed him.
And two blind men sat by the roadside. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, saying, "Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!"
The crowd ordered them to stop. They asked them to be quiet. But the two men shouted at the top of their voices: "Lord! Son of David, have mercy on us!"
Jesus stood and called to them, "What do you want me to do for you?"
Lord, we pray to see.
Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and immediately they received their sight and followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem.
As they approached Jerusalem, they came to Bethphage, on the Mount of Olives. Then Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them,
He said to them, "Go into the village ahead of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt by her. Untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone says anything to you, say that the Lord needs them. And he will send them at once.
This happened to fulfill what was spoken by the prophets: "It is necessary that this should happen."
"Say to the city of Zion, 'Behold, your King is coming to you, humble, and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.'" (Zechariah 9:9)
The disciples went and did what Jesus had commanded them.
They brought the donkey and the colt, laid their clothes on them, and Jesus sat on them.
A large crowd spread out in the middle of the road, spreading their coats. The rest cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
Some of the people went ahead of him, and the rest followed, shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" "Hosanna in the highest!" (Psalm 118:26)
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, "Who is this?"
The crowd answered, "This is Jesus the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus cleansed the temple.
Jesus entered the temple and began to drive out all who sold and bought in it. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of the pigeon sellers.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer' (Isaiah 56:7), but you have made it a 'den of thieves' (Jeremiah 7:11)."
He came to him at the temple, blind and lame, and he healed them.
The chief priests and the scribes saw the wonders that he was doing, and they saw the children in the temple shouting: "Hosanna to the Son of David!" And they were greatly angered when they saw this.
"Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. Jesus said to them, "Yes. Have you never read, 'From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise'?" (Psalm 8:2)
Then Jesus left the crowd and went away. A crowd followed him, and they spent the night in the house of a woman named Mary. And there was another woman who cried out, "The fig tree has withered!"
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem, and he was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the wayside. He came to it, but found nothing on it but leaves. And he said to it, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again!" And the fig tree withered at once.
So the disciples were amazed, saying, "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?"
Jesus answered and said to them, "Assuredly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you do what is done to the fig tree, but also if you say to this mountain, 'Be removed and be cast into the sea,' it will be done."
"If you believe, God will respond to your prayers." - Determining the Authority of Jesus.
Jesus entered the temple courts, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and asked, "By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered, "I will ask you one question; answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things: The baptism of John, was it from heaven or from men?"
Where did John's baptism come from? Was it from heaven, or of men? They argued among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Then why did you not believe him?'"
But what if we say, "of men"? We are afraid of people. Everyone thinks John was a prophet.
They answered him, "We do not know." And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."
What do you think of this? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, "Son, go and work today in the vineyard."
I won't, replied the son. But he changed his mind later and went.
Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing to him. The son answered, "I will, father." But he did not do it.
"Which of the two sons did what his father wanted?" They answered, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John came to show you the way of life, but you did not believe him. The tax collectors and prostitutes believed in him, but you, even after seeing this, have not repented of your sins and believed in him. The parable of the tenants.
Hear another parable: A man had a vineyard, and he fenced it, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower. Then he leased it to vine-growers, and went into another country.
And when the time of harvest came, he sent his servants to the tenants. He commanded the servants to gather his share of the fruit.
But the tenants seized his servants. They beat one of them. And they killed another. And they stoned the third to death.
Then the man sent other slaves to the farmers. This time he sent larger numbers than the first time. And the farmers treated them the same way.
Finally, he sent his son to them, saying, "They will respect my son."
But the tenants saw the son coming. They said to each other, "This is the heir; let's kill him, and everything will be ours."
So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
When the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do to those tenants?
"Those wicked people will perish," they answered. "Then the vineyard will be let out to others, who will give its fruit to its owner when harvest comes."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit.
Anyone who falls on that stone will be crushed. But the stone will crush whoever falls on it.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables. They realized that he was speaking about them.
So they sought a way to arrest him, but they feared the crowd, because they regarded him as a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Story
Jesus also told them other parables.
Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,
He sent his servants to invite the guests to dinner, but the servants ordered them to come, and they refused.
Then he sent out other servants, saying, 'Tell those who are invited, "See, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fattened calves are killed, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet."'
But the people paid no attention. One went to his field, and another went to his business.
The rest they took for servants. They mistreated them and then killed them.
The king was furious. He sent his army to wipe them out. They killed the assassins and burned their city to the ground.
Then the king said to the servants, "The dinner is ready, but those I invited are not worthy to come."
Go out to the street corners. Invite everyone you find to dinner.
So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.
King entered to see the guests. He noticed a man who was not wearing festive clothes.
My friend asked him, "How did you get in here without a wedding outfit?" The man couldn't say anything.
So the king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet, and cast him into the outer darkness. There men will weep and gnash their teeth."
Many are called, but few are chosen. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went out and began to plot how they might entrap Jesus in His words.
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. They said, "Teacher, we know that you are a truthful man and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth, and that you do not care about anyone's opinion, because you are not influenced by people's status."
So tell us what you see? Is it lawful for us to pay the jizya to Caesar, or not?
But Jesus, knowing their hypocrisy, said, "Hypocrites! Why do you try to arrest Me?"
Show me the currency that people use to pay taxes. They brought him a silver coin.
He asked them, "Whose picture is this? And whose words are these?"
They said, "To Caesar." He said to them, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
They were amazed, so they left him and went away. Marriage after the Resurrection.
On the same day, the Sadducees came to Jesus and asked Him a question. For they do not believe that people rise from the dead.
They said, "Teacher, Moses wrote for us, 'If a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, his brother should marry the widow and raise up children for his brother.'"
There were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened to the second and third brothers. This repeated until the seventh brother.
Finally, the woman died.
So who would be his wife among them? She was married to all seven of them.
Jesus answered, "You are wrong, because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God."
When the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage. They will be like the angels in heaven.
As for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what Allah has told you?
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." (Exodus 3:6) God is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
The crowd who heard this were astonished at the teaching. It was the greatest commandment.
When the Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus, they gathered together.
One of the experts in the law tested Jesus with this question:
He asked him, "Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?"
Jesus answered, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind." (Deuteronomy 6:5)
This is the first and greatest commandment.
"You shall love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"All the law and the prophets hang on these two commandments." Who is the Son of Christ?
The Pharisees gathered together. Jesus asked them,
What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he? They answered, "The son of David."
He said to them, "Then why does David call him 'Lord'? For the Holy Spirit spoke through David concerning Christ. David said,
The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at My right hand, till I make Your enemies Your footstool." (Psalm 110:1)
If they call Him Lord, how can He be His son?
No one could answer him with a single word. From that day forward, no one dared to ask him again.
Jesus condemns the Pharisees and the teachers of the law.
Jesus spoke to the crowds and his disciples.
He said, "The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat."
So do not obey them, but do whatever they bid you, and follow not their ways; for they are such as do not practice what they preach.
They tie heavy burdens and place them on people's shoulders. But they themselves are unwilling to lift a finger to move them.
All that they do is to be seen by men. And they put boxes of small size on their foreheads and arms, containing verses from the Holy Book. And they make these boxes very broad. Also, they lengthen the ornamental ribbons on their coats to a great extent.
They love to recline on couches in the dining rooms, and to be recognized in the assemblies.
They love to be greeted in the marketplaces. They are pleased if you address them as "My Lord."
But you should not be called teachers, for you have one teacher, and you are all brothers.
Do not call anyone on earth your father; for you have one Father, who is in heaven.
You should not be called teachers. You have one teacher, and he is Christ.
The most important person among you will be your servant.
He who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces; for you neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter to go in.
Translation
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you traverse sea and land to make a single proselyte, and when he becomes a proselyte, you make him twice as much a child of hell as you are.
Woe to you, blind guides, who say, 'Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold in the temple, he is obligated by his oath.'
You are blind and ignorant! What is more important, the gold or the temple that gives the gold its sanctity?
You also say, "If anyone swears by the altar, it is nothing to him; but if anyone swears by the gift which is on it, he is obliged to fulfill it."
Oh, my brethren! What is more important? Is it the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
So whoever swears by the altar, swears by it and by everything on it.
And whoever swears by the name of the temple swears by it and by Him who dwells in it.
And whoever swears by the sky, swears by the throne of Allah and what is upon it.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faith. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others.
You are the leaders of the misguided! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside they are full of extortion and wickedness.
You blind fool! First clean the inside of the cup and the dish, and then the outside will also be clean.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Just as you are empty from within of everything evil, and appear to the world as kind and righteous from without, you pretend to be what you are not.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the graves of the righteous.
And you say, "If we had been in the community of earlier revelation, we would have been believers." Even if We had sent down the Qur'an upon a mountain, you would
For you bear witness against yourselves that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
"So complete the ritual in the manner We have prescribed for you, perhaps you will find guidance."
O nest of venomous wasps! How will you escape being sentenced to fire?
Therefore I send prophets, wise men, and teachers to them. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some you will scourge in your synagogues, and drive them from city to city.
"You shall pay the price for every drop of righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of my righteous brother Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar."
What I am about to tell you is the truth. All of this will happen to those who are alive now.
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often have I wanted to gather you, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!
Look, your house is empty.
I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.' 118:26
Signs of the End Times
Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to point out the temple buildings.
"Do you see all these things?" asked Jesus. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, with his disciples alone. They asked him, "Tell us, when will this happen? And what will be the sign of your coming and the end of the world?"
Jesus answered, "Beware lest ye be led astray."
Many will come in my name, saying, "I am the Christ!" and they will deceive many.
You will hear of wars. You will also hear people talking about wars in the future. Do not be disturbed. These things must happen. But the end is not yet.
Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
All these are the beginning of labor pains.
Then people will hand you over to be persecuted, and they will kill you. You will be hated by all nations because of my name.
Then many will fall away and betray one another, and many will hate each other.
Many false prophets will arise and mislead many people.
For the abundance of evil will cause the love of many to grow cold.
But he who endures to the end will be saved.
This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached throughout the world as a witness to all the nations. And then the end will come.
The prophet Daniel will speak of the "abomination that desolates." (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11) And one day, you will see it standing in the holy place. Let the reader understand this.
Let those in Judea flee to the mountains.
No one on the roof should go down to their house to get anything.
No one in the field should go back to take his coat.
Woe to the pregnant ones, and to those who give birth, and to those who are suckling their infants.
Ask that you not flee in the cold or on the Sabbath day.
There will be great tribulation in those days, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever will be.
If time were not shortened, no one would remain alive, but it will be shortened because of the elect whom God has chosen.
Then they will say to you, 'Look, the Christ is here' or 'Look, he is there.' Do not believe it.
False Christs and prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect.
See, I told you before.
If it is said to you, "He is in the wilderness," go out; and if it is said, "He is in the houses," do not believe it.
"A thunderbolt comes out of the east, and is seen even to the west; so will be the coming of the Son of Man."
Vultures will gather wherever there is a dead body.
After the terrible suffering of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light. The stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will be shaken. (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
He will send His angels with a loud trumpet call. They will gather His elect from the four corners of the earth. They will bring them from the ends of the heavens to the ends of them.
"Consider the fig tree and all the trees. When they sprout leaves, you can see for yourselves that summer is near."
In the same way, when you see all these things happening, you know that the end is near. It is at the door.
I am not trying to update you on it really, and those who live in that time will not die before all these things happen.
"The heaven and the earth will pass away, but His Face will remain forever." "None knows the time of that Day except Him."
No one knows the day or hour when the Son of Man will come, neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
Remember the days of Noah. So will the coming of the Son of Man be.
In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving their daughters in marriage. They were living their lives as usual until the day Noah entered the ark.
They knew nothing about what was going to happen until the floods came and took them all. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
Two men will be in the field, one will be taken and the other left.
Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and the other left.
"So know that you do not know what the companions of the discord will bring about at the hour that no one will deny."
You must understand something: if the homeowner had known the nighttime hour when the thief would come, he would have surrounded his place with guards and not allowed his home to be broken into.
Therefore you also must be ready, because at an hour you do not expect, the Son of Man will come.
Let your servant whom you have put in charge of the food be honest, loving to his brothers, upright, ready to serve, not a heavy drinker, and eager to do good.
It would be good for the servant to find his master continuing his work upon the master's return.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. The master will put that servant in charge of all he possesses.
But let us suppose that the servant is wicked. Let us suppose that he says to himself, "My master will be a long time away from me."
Suppose he started beating other servants. And suppose he eats and drinks with heavy drinkers.
The master of those servants will return on a day the servants do not expect. And he will come at an hour they do not know.
Then his master will cut him to pieces and send him to the place where the hypocrites go. There people weep and gnash their teeth in anger.
The Parable of the Ten Virgins
At that time the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were fools, and five others were wise.
And the foolish women took their handmills, but they did not take oil with them.
The wise men carried the oil in skins with their lamps.
The groom had not arrived for a long time. All the bridesmaids grew tired and fell asleep.
In the middle of the night someone cried out, "Here's the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!"
Then all the virgins woke up and lit their lamps.
The fools said to the wise men, "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out."
"No," they answered. "There may not be enough for everyone. Go instead to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves."
So they went to buy oil. But while they were gone the bridegroom arrived, and the bridesmaids who were ready went in with him to the wedding, and the door was shut.
The other bridesmaids came later. "Sir! Sir!" they said. "Open the door for us!"
But he replied, "What I am about to tell you is the truth. I do not know you."
"So reflect, O men of insight! You do not know when the Bridegroom will come, or at what hour His hour will be. It is the tale of three servants..."
So is the kingdom of heaven like a man who is the master of a household, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
He gave ten thousand dollars to one. He gave four thousand to another. And he granted two thousand to the third. He gave each servant the amount he knew the servant could handle. Then he set out on his journey.
The servant who received the two thousand dollars invested his money in the business and made another ten thousand dollars.
He who had $4000 made another $4000.
But the man who had received the two thousand dinars went off, dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master's money in it.
After a long time, the master of those servants returned. He wanted to reclaim all the money they had earned.
The man who received ten thousand dollars brought the other ten thousand. He said, "Sir, you trusted me by giving me ten thousand dollars, and here I have made another ten thousand."
His master said, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master."
The man who had four thousand dollars also came and said, "Teacher, you entrusted me with four thousand dollars. Here, I have made four thousand more."
His master said, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master."
Then the one who had received the thousand talents came forward and said, "Lord, I knew that you were a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not scatter seed.
So I was afraid, and I went and hid your money in the ground. Look, here is what is yours.
His master answered, 'You wicked, lazy servant! Did you know that I harvest where I did not sow? Did you know that I gather where I did not scatter seed?
Well, you should have put my money in the bank. Then I could have withdrawn it with interest when I returned.
Then his master summoned the other servants and said, "Take the one hundred dollars from him and give it to the one who has ten thousand dollars."
To him who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.
Cast that unproductive servant into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
"The Son of Man will come in his glory with all the holy angels, and then he will sit on his glorious throne in heaven."
All the nations will be gathered before him. He will separate the people into two groups. It will be like a shepherd who separates the sheep from the goats.
He will put the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right, “Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.”
I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me.
I needed clothes... and you gave them to me. I was sick... and you nursed me. I was in prison... and you visited me.
Then the righteous will answer Him, saying: 'Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You drink?'
When did we see you a stranger and welcome you? And when did we see you in need of clothes and clothe you?
When did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?
The King will say, "Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me."
Then He will say to those on His right, "Go, you blessed ones, into the eternal paradise which they have been promised. Recline therein in peace and security."
I was hungry. But you gave me nothing to eat. I was thirsty. But you gave me nothing to drink.
I was a stranger, and you did not invite me in. I was naked, and you did not give me clothing. I was sick and in prison, but you did not care for me.
They also will answer and say, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty, and did not feed you? Or a stranger, and did not welcome you? Or naked, and did not clothe you? Or sick or in prison, and did not visit you?'
He will say: "Whatever good I intended to tell you, any mercy you did not extend to one of these marginalized people, you have deprived me of it."
Then they will go to be in everlasting punishment. And those who believed and did righteous deeds will be in everlasting bliss.
Plan to kill Jesus
Jesus finished saying all these things to his disciples.
As you know, Easter is in two days. And the Son of Man is handed over to be crucified.
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, Caiaphas.
They plotted to arrest Jesus by stealth. They wanted to kill him.
But not during the feast, they said. "For the people may make trouble." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in the house of Simon the leper in Bethany.
A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, which she broke open and poured on his head as he was reclining at the table.
When the disciples saw this, they were indignant. "Why waste this perfume?" they asked.
The perfume could have been sold at a high price. The money could have been given to the poor.
Jesus, aware of this, said to them, "Why are you troubling this woman? She has done a good deed to me."
The poor you will always have with you, but me you will not always have.
She poured perfume over my body to prepare me for burial.
"What I am about to tell you is truly and absolutely correct. What she did is being spoken of everywhere this good news is being proclaimed throughout the world. It is being told in her memory." And Judas agreed to hand Jesus over.
One of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests.
He said, "What will you give me, and I will deliver Jesus to you?" And they paid him thirty pieces of silver.
From that time on, Judas watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. The Last Supper
It was the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
The man said, "Go to the city and tell a certain man, 'The teacher says, 'My time is near. I will keep the Passover with my disciples at your house.'
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover meal.
When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples.
While they were eating, he said, "I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me and hand me over to my enemies."
The disciples were very sorrowful, and each one began to say to him one after another: "It is not I, Lord, is it?"
Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me."
The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. Woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for him if he had not been born.
It was Judas who would betray him. He asked, "Surely not I, Lord?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is you."
While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is my body."
Then he took the cup, gave thanks, and said, "Drink from it, all of you."
This is my blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.
This is what I'm telling you. From now on, I won't drink wine with you again until the day I drink it with you in my father's kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said that Peter would deny him.
Jesus said to them, "This night, you will all be scattered because of me. For it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)"
But I will go before you into Galilee, after I am risen from the dead.
Peter answered and said, "Everyone will leave you because of you, but I never will."
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
But Peter said, "I would rather die with you! I will never deny you." And all the disciples said the same. Jesus' prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane.
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there to pray."
He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him. And he began to be sorrowful and very distressed.
Then he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and keep watch with me."
He went a little farther. Then, falling on his face, he prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. Yet, not as I will, but as you will."
Then he came back and found his disciples sleeping. And he said to Peter, "Could you not watch with me for one hour?"
"Worship and watch and be patient, for you will not stumble into sin as you are tested, for the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
Jesus went away a second time and prayed, saying, "My Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, unless I drink it, your will be done."
Then he returned to find them sleeping again. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
So he left them and went away again. And a third time he asked the same question.
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are your hearts still hardened? Do you not see that the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is to be delivered into the hands of sinners?"
"Get up! Let's go! Here comes the one who will hand me over to them." So they arrested Jesus.
And while he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came up, accompanied by a great crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Judas, who was to betray him, had arranged a signal with them: "Whomever I kiss, he is the one; seize him."
So Judas, having received the battalion, went immediately to Jesus and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Do what you have come to do." Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' companions pulled out his sword, struck the high priest's servant, and cut off his ear.
Jesus said to him, "Put your sword away; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you think that I cannot ask for help from my Father? He would send down to me at once an army of angels, more than seventy thousand.
But how can the scriptures be fulfilled then? They say that it must happen this way.
At that time Jesus said to the crowd, "Do you think I came to establish peace on earth? No, I tell you, but division. From now on, a household of five will be divided, three against two and two against three. You will be divided, father against
"But this has happened to fulfill what is written in the books of the prophets." Then all the disciples left him and fled. Jesus stood before the Sanhedrin.
But those who had arrested Jesus led him to Annas first, he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas the high priest. And it was there that the chief priests and the elders gathered.
He did not go far from him, but followed Jesus. And he went up to the courtyard of the high priest's house. And he went in and sat with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.
But they found no evidence, despite many false witnesses coming forward. Finally, two other witnesses arrived.
They said, "This man claimed, 'I can destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Do you not answer? What is it that these men testify against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us: Are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
"Yes," Jesus answered, "it is as you say. But I tell you all: In the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? You have now heard the blasphemy!"
"What do you think?" they answered, "He must die!"
Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him on the cheeks.
They said, "Tell us, Christ, who struck you?" Peter said, "I do not know Jesus."
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A servant girl came up and looked at him, and said, "You also were with Jesus the Nazarene."
But before them all, Peter said it wasn't so. He said, "I do not know what you are talking about."
Then he went out to the entrance of the courtyard, and another woman saw him there and said to the crowd, "This one was with Jesus of Nazareth."
And he swore, saying, "I do not know the man!"
And after a while those who stood there came to him and said, "You have the accent of one of them. Your language gives you away."
Then Peter began to curse and swear, "I do not know the man!" And immediately the rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered the words Jesus had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.
Judas hangs himself.
It was early in the morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to kill Jesus.
They seized him, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate, the governor.
Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned to death, and filled with remorse and sorrow for what he had done, returned the silver to the chief priests and elders.
I said, "I made a mistake, I released an innocent man." They said, "And what does that concern us? That's your problem."
Then Judas, who betrayed him, seeing that he was condemned, repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." But they said, "What is that to us? See to it yourself!" So he threw the silver into the temple and departed, and went and hanged himself.
The chief priests said, "It is not lawful to put this money into the treasury, for it is blood money, the price of a man's life." So they took the money.
So they decided to use the money to buy a field to bury foreigners.
That is why it is still called "The Field of Blood" to this day.
Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value."
"They used the money to buy the Potter's Field, as the Lord commanded me" (Zechariah 11:12,13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) The presentation of Jesus to Pilate
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is as you say."
But when the scribes and chief priests came, they accused him of enmity. He answered nothing.
Then Pilate asked Jesus, "Do you not hear what they are testifying against you?"
But Jesus made no answer to any of the charges against him. This amazed the governor greatly.
It was the governor's custom at Easter to release one prisoner. The people chose who they wanted to be released.
There was a well-known prisoner named Barabbas in the jail at that time.
So when Pilate had Jesus brought out to them, he asked, “Whom do you want me to release for you? Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Messiah?”
Pilate knew that the chief priests had envied Jesus, and that this was the reason they had handed him over.
Now at the festival the governor was accustomed to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd. And there was a well-known prisoner named Jesus Barabbas. So when the people gathered, Pilate asked them, “Who do you want me to release to
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus put to death.
Which one do you want me to release? asked the governor. They answered, "Barabbas."
Then Pilate said to them, "What shall I do with Jesus who is called the Christ?" They all said, "Crucify Him!"
"Why? What evil has he done?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "It is your responsibility!"
All the people said, "We and our offspring are guilty of his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas. Jesus he flogged and handed over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Christ.
The governor's soldiers took Jesus into the governor's headquarters, also called the Praetorium. All the soldiers gathered around him.
They stripped him and put a purple robe on him.
Then they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they put a purple robe on him. And they began to salute him, "Hail, King of the Jews!" And they struck him in the face and spat on him and took the reed and struck him on the head.
They spat on him. They hit him on the head with a stick repeatedly.
And after they had mocked him, they took off his robe and put his clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him. Jesus was crucified.
And as they led him out of the city, they found a man of Cyrene named Simon, and they compelled him to carry his cross.
They came to a place called Golgotha, which in Hebrew means the place of the skull.
There they mixed wine with bitter spices and offered it to Jesus to drink. But when he tasted it, he refused to drink it.
When they crucified him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots.
They sat there and watched him.
They posted above his head the charge against him, written in large letters: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
Two thieves were crucified with him, one on his right and the other on his left.
Those who came before them had passed by, forgave him, and stoned him with harsh words, and shook their heads.
He said, "If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross and save yourself! Can you destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days?"
Likewise, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders mocked him.
They said, "He saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
He trusts in God. Let God save him now if He wills. He said, "I am the son of God."
In the same way, the two thieves who were crucified with Jesus were mocking him. Jesus died.
From noon until three in the afternoon, darkness came over the whole land.
Around the ninth hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of those who stood there, when they heard Jesus cry out, said, "He is calling Elijah."
So one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, put it on a reed, and gave it to Him to drink.
The others said, "Let him alone; let us see if Elijah will come to save him."
And Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.
And at once the curtain of the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, and the rocks were split.
The circumference of the graves opened, and the bodies of most of the righteous who had died rose.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus had risen from the dead, they went into the holy city and appeared to many people.
The Roman commander and the guards saw the earthquake and all that had happened, and they were terrified. They cried out, "Surely this was the Son of God!"
He was not far from them, and a large number of women were watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee and were serving him.
Mary Magdalene was there. And Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. And they buried Jesus.
As evening approached, a rich man from the town of Arimathea arrived. His name was Joseph, and he was a follower of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. And Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in clean linen.
He placed her in his new tomb that he had hewn out of the rock. Then he rolled a large stone against the entrance. Afterward, he departed.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The guards were at the tomb.
The next day was the day after the Preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
They said, "O Lord, we remember something that liar said while he was still alive. He claimed, 'In three days I will rise from the dead.' "
So he gave orders for the tomb to be made secure until the third day, to prevent his disciples from coming and stealing the body and then claiming that he had been raised from the dead. That would be a worse lie than the first one."
"Take a guard with you," said Pilate. "Go and make the tomb as secure as you can."
So they turned away, having fulfilled their vow of stoning. They said, "Come to a group that will guard you," and they became guards.
Jesus rises from the dead.
Now the sabbath was ended, and dawn on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
There was a strong earthquake. An angel came down from heaven by the command of the Lord. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled away the stone from the door of the tomb and sat on it.
His body shone like lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so afraid of him that they trembled as if they were dead.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified."
Not here! He has risen just as he said! Come, I will show you where he is buried.
Go quickly and tell his disciples: 'He has risen from the dead! He is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' Behold, I have told you!
So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples.
Then Jesus came up and said to them, "Greetings!" And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me." So the guards went and told the chief priests everything that had happened.
And while the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
When the chief priests met with the elders, they devised a plan. They offered the soldiers a large sum of money.
They told the soldiers, "We want you to say: His disciples came at night and stole his body while we were sleeping."
If the governor hears this report, we'll satisfy him financially. This will keep you out of trouble.
So the soldiers did as they were commanded, and this report has been spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus' final commands to his disciples.
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they bowed down to him. However, some of them were hesitant.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
"Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you, and behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
The prophet Isaiah wrote long ago: "Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me" (Malachi 3:1).
A voice cries out: "In the wilderness prepare the way for the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
And so John came, baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
All the people of Judea and Jerusalem went out to him. They confessed their sins, and John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John wore clothes made of goat hair. He girded his loins with a leather belt. He ate locusts and wild honey.
This is what John the Baptist proclaimed: "After me comes one more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie."
I baptize you with water, but he who comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.
Jesus came up from the water and immediately saw the heavens split open, and he saw the Holy Spirit descending on him like a dove.
And a voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."
So the Spirit immediately drove Jesus out into the wilderness.
Jesus was in the wilderness for forty days, where he was tempted by the devil. Wild beasts did not harm him, and angels attended to his needs. He chose his first disciples.
And after John was imprisoned, Jesus went to Galilee, preaching the gospel of God.
He said, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the good news!"
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
Come and follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.
So they left the fish and followed him immediately.
Then Jesus went a little further with them, and saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were in the boat mending their nets.
Immediately he cried out to them, and said, "What have I to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? Art thou come to destroy me? I adjure thee by God, torment me not." For he said unto him, "Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit!"
And Jesus and those with Him went to Capernaum. And He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath and began to teach.
People were amazed at his teaching, for he taught them with authority, not like the scribes.
And at that moment a man in the synagogue who was possessed by an unclean spirit cried out, saying,
What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are a teacher from God Almighty!
"Be silent!" Jesus said firmly. "Come out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently, and then came out of him with a terrifying scream.
Everyone was amazed. They asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching with such authority! Even the evil spirits obey him!"
The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left the synagogue and immediately entered the house of Simon and Andrew, James and John.
Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed with a fever. They told Jesus about her.
So he went to her and took her by the hand and raised her up. And the fever left her, and she began to serve them.
That evening, after sunset, they brought to Jesus all who were sick and demon-possessed.
All the people in the town gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many who were sick with various diseases. He also cast out many demons, but he would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prayed in a solitary place.
It was still very early and dark. Jesus got up and went out of the house. He went to a place where he could be alone. And there he prayed.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they cried out, "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus answered, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages—so that I can preach there also. That is why I have come."
So he went about among the villages teaching. He called the twelve to him, and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits. And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were sick and healed them.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus, fell on his knees, and pleaded with him, "If you choose, you can make me clean."
Jesus, moved with compassion, reached out his hand and touched him. "I do want to," he said. "Be made clean."
He was instantly cured; the disease departed and he recovered his health.
Jesus rebuked him sharply and sent him away.
"Do not say this to anyone," he said. "Go and show yourself to the priest. Offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded as a testimony to the priest and the people that you are clean."
But the man went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town. He remained outside in secluded places, but people from all quarters were coming to him.
Jesus Healing a Paralyzed Man
After a few days, Jesus entered Capernaum again. The people heard that he had returned to his house.
A large crowd gathered, until there was no longer any room. There was no longer any space, even outside the door. And Jesus was preaching the word of God to them.
Four men came carrying a man who couldn't walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, lowering the man on his mat, they set him before Jesus.
Jesus saw their faith, and he said to the man, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
Some of the scribes were sitting there, thinking.
Why is this man speaking like this? He's saying something very evil! Only God forgives sins.
So Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Why do you think about these things in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say to this man, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take your bed and walk'?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he said to the sick man, "Get up, take your mat, and walk."
He said to them, "I tell you, get up, take your mat and go to your house."
And he arose and took a journey, and they watched him. And they were all amazed and wondered, saying, "What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they
And again Jesus went away to the seashore of Galilee, where a large crowd gathered around him, and he taught them.
As Jesus walked along, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector’s booth. “Follow me,” he told him, and Matthew got up and followed him.
Jesus was reclining at Levi's house with his disciples and a large crowd of tax collectors and sinners, for many were following him.
There were some Pharisees and scribes sitting there. When they saw Jesus eating with tax collectors and sinners, they said to his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
Jesus heard this and said to them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but those who are sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners."
The disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came to Jesus and said to him, "John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but yours eat."
Jesus answered, "How can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast."
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them. On that day they will fast.
People do not sew a new patch on an old garment. If they do, the new patch will pull away from the old, and the tear will be worse.
People do not pour new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will ferment and burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins." Jesus is also Lord of the Sabbath.
On the Sabbath, Jesus was walking through the grain fields with his disciples, and they began to pick the heads of grain and eat them after rubbing them in their hands.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! It is unlawful to do that on the Sabbath. Why do your disciples do what is not lawful?"
He answered them, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him?"
This happened in the days of Abiathar the high priest. David went into the house of God and ate the showbread, which was only lawful for the priests to eat, and also gave some to his men.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
Therefore the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.
Healing on Saturday
Then Jesus went into the synagogue, and there was a man whose hand was withered.
And some of the Pharisees were watching him, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, so that they might find an accusation against him.
Jesus spoke to the man with the diseased and withered hand, "Rise to the middle," and said to him, "Stretch out your hand."
Then Jesus said to them, "What is right to do on the Sabbath? To do good or to do evil? To save a life or to kill?" But they were silent.
Jesus looked around in anger, deeply distressed at their hardness of heart. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He did, and his hand was completely restored.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus.
Jesus went with his disciples to the Sea of Galilee, and a large crowd from Galilee followed him.
When the people heard all that Jesus was doing, many came to him. They came from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and around Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowd, Jesus asked his disciples to prepare a small boat for him. This was to keep the crowd from crushing him.
Jesus healed many people, so the sick were pushing to touch him.
When the people saw Jesus, they fell down before Him; and the demons cried out, saying, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them not to reveal his identity. Jesus' choice of the twelve apostles.
Jesus went up a mountain and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him.
He appointed twelve of them and called them apostles. From then on they accompanied him. He also sent them out to preach.
They will have the authority to cast out demons.
So Jesus chose twelve disciples, and Simon was one of them. Jesus gave him the name Peter.
There were James son of Zebedee and his brother John. Jesus called them Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder.
And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus. Also, Thaddaeus and Simon the Zealot.
Judas Iscariot was also among them. It is he who will later deliver Jesus into the hands of his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebub.
Jesus entered the house, and a crowd gathered around him again, so that he and his disciples could not even eat.
His family heard about it. They came to get him. They said, "He has gone mad."
Some of the Pharisees who had come from Jerusalem said, "He is driven by Beelzebul! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons."
Then Jesus called them and said to them in parables, "How can Satan cast out Satan?
If the kingdom fights itself, it will not stand.
If the family is divided, it will not stand.
