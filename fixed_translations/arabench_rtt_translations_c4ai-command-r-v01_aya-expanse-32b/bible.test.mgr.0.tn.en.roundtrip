And Jesus called a little child, and set him in the midst of them.
Jesus said, "What I tell you is the truth. You must change and become like little children. If you do not, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."

"Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me."
"But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea."
powerful powerful powerful powerful powerful powerful temptation in the world because of the things that lead people into sin! And such things must come, but woe to those by whom they come!
If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter eternal life with one hand or one foot than to be thrown into eternal fire with two hands and two feet. For the fire is unquenchable, and it burns forever.
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. How much more valuable is a person than a sheep!
"Take care that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father who is in heaven."
(No
What do you think? Suppose a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders away. Will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off?
I am not really concerned about updating him. If he comes across that sheep, he will be happier about it than about the 99 that did not go astray.
So your heavenly Father is. If anyone sins against you, do not keep an angry spirit against him either.
If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over.
But if he will not hear you, take with you one or two more, that every word may be established by the mouth of two or three witnesses. 19:15
But what if he refuses to listen to the witnesses? Tell the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.
What I am aiming to detail is a precise truth: what you seal on earth will be sealed in heaven, and what you open on earth will be opened in heaven.
"I tell you the truth, if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven."
"Wherever two or three are gathered in my name, there am I with them." The servant who did not have mercy.
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."
The kingdom of heaven is like a kingdom of a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
And the king began to do so, when a man who owed him millions of dollars was brought before him.
The man was unable to pay. His master ordered the sale, selling the man, his wife, his children, and all he owned to recover his money.
The servant fell to his knees before him. "Give me time," he pleaded. "I will pay you back everything."
His master had compassion on his situation, so he canceled his debt, forgave him, and set him free.
But that servant went out and found one of the other servants who owed him a few dollars. He seized him and began to choke him, saying, "Pay back what you owe me!"
The other servant fell to his knees. "Give me a chance," he begged. "I'll pay you back."
But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and threw the man into prison until he paid back all he owed.
The other servants saw what had happened and were very concerned about it. They went and told their master everything that had occurred.
Then the master called his first servant and said to him, 'Wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me.
"Would you not prefer to have a superiority over your enemies, as you have rescued me from the enemy?"
His master was angry with him, so he handed him over to the jailers. He will be punished until he pays off all his debt.
Thus will my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother.
Jesus teaches about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Large crowds followed him. He healed them there.
Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
They are no longer two but one. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.
They said, "Why then did Moses command a man to divorce his wife with a written document and to have two witnesses?"
Jesus answered, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of heart, but it was not this way from the beginning."
This is what I told you. Whoever divorces his wife and marries another is an adulterer. A man may divorce his wife if she has betrayed him.
The disciples said to him, "If such is the case between a man and his wife, it is better not to marry."
Jesus answered, "Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given by God. For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone accept this who can."
Some men cannot have children because they were born that way. Some were made that way by men. Others made themselves that way for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever can accept it, let him do so." Little children are presented to Jesus.
Some people brought their little children to Jesus. They wanted him to lay his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples rebuked the people.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
Jesus laid his hands on them, and from there he went away. Jesus and the rich young man.
A man said to him, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to have eternal life?"
"Why do you ask me about what is good?" Jesus answered. "There is only one good. But if anyone wishes to enter eternal life, let him keep the commandments."
"Which?" the man asked. Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness."
Honor your father and your mother (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) and "Love your neighbor as yourself" (Leviticus 19:18)
I've translated all those commands, said the young man. What else should I do?
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
Upon hearing this, the young man left sadly. He was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
And again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When the disciples heard this, they were astonished and asked, "Then who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter answered him, "We have left everything and followed you. What then will there be for us?"
Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, in the renewed world, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, and you who have followed me will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
"Whoever leaves house or family or lands for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life."
But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.
The Story of the Workers in the Vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a man who was the owner of a vineyard. He hired laborers and sent them into his vineyard, and he went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
He agreed to pay them the usual wage for a day's work. Then he sent them to his vineyard.
Around nine o'clock in the morning, he went out again. He saw others standing in the market doing nothing.
He said to them, "You also go and work in my vineyard. I will pay you the right wage."
So they went. He also went out about the sixth hour and did likewise.
Around the fifth hour he went out and found others standing there. He asked them, "Why are you standing here all day doing nothing?"
They answered, "Because no one has hired us." He said to them, "You also go and work in my vineyard."
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, "Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first."
The workers who were hired around five o'clock arrived. Each of them received a full day's pay as usual.
Then when the first group of workers came, He hired them for a wage like theirs. And He gave each one of them his day's wage, and He made them happy.
Upon receiving it, they started complaining about the owner.
They said, "These people who were recently appointed only worked for one hour, yet you paid them the same as us. We did most of the work and spent the whole day under the scorching sun."
The employer answered them and said to one of them, "Friend, I am dealing fairly with you, am I not? You agreed to work for your usual daily wage, did you not?
Go and get your money. I want to give the ones I've recently appointed the same pay I gave you.
Am I not the master of my own wealth and free to do with it as I please? Do you feel cheated because I have given generously to others?
So the first will be last, and the last will be first.
Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. Along the way, he took the Twelve aside to speak to them.
He said, "We are going up to Jerusalem, where the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death..."
Then they deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked, and scourged, and crucified; and on the third day he rises again.
The mother of Zebedes sons came to Jesus with her sons, and kneeling down, asked him for something.
"What do you want?" Jesus asked her. She said, "Grant me that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right hand and the other at your left, in your kingdom."
Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am to drink?" They said to him, "We are able."
Jesus said to them, "You will all drink from my cup. But to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The other ten pupils heard about it. They were angry with the brothers.
Jesus called them together and said, "You know that the rulers in the Gentile world lord it over their people, and their high officials exercise power over them."
Do not be like that, but whoever wishes to be first among you must be slave of all.
"And whoever desires primacy, let them be a slave to you."
Be like the Son of Man, who did not come to be served, but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom for many who are set free.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, and a great crowd followed him.
She is a smart, hardworking, and determined woman. She is always striving to improve herself and achieve her goals. She is a role model for many, and her perseverance is inspiring.
The crowd told them to stop. They ordered them to be quiet. But the two men shouted even louder, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"
And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, "What will you that I shall do for you?"
Lord, we pray to see.
Jesus felt a deep sympathy for them. He touched their eyes. They immediately looked at him. And they followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem
And when they came near Jerusalem, and had reached Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them, "Go into the village in front of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to Me.
He said to them, "Go into the village ahead of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied there, with a colt by her. Untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone says anything to you, tell them the Lord needs them. The owner will send them the money right away.
This was done so that what was spoken of the prophet might be fulfilled.
"Say to the city of Zion, 'Behold, your King is coming to you, humble, and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.'" (Zechariah 9:9)
The disciples went and did what Jesus had commanded them.
They brought the donkey and the colt, laid their cloaks on them, and Jesus sat on the cloaks.
A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
Some people translated before him, and others followed him. Everyone shouted: "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred. The people asked, "Who is this?"
The crowd answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus drove out the sellers from the temple.
Jesus entered the temple and began to drive out all who sold and bought in it. He overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' but you have made it a 'den of thieves' (Jeremiah 7:11)."
Blind and lame people came to him at the temple, and he healed them there.
And the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonders that he did, and heard the children in the temple crying out, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" And they were indignant.
Do you hear what these children are saying? they asked him. And Jesus said to them, Yes. Have you never read, ‘Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise for yourself’? (Psalm 8:2)
Then Jesus left the crowd and went into the house. And a great multitude followed Him, and there they came to Him and offered Him expensive ointment, Mary, the daughter of Herod, who was called Mary.
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the wayside. He went up to it, but found nothing on it but leaves. Then he said to it, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again!” And the fig tree withered at once.
So the disciples were amazed, saying, "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?"
Jesus answered and said to them, "Assuredly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you do what was done to the fig tree, but also if you say to this mountain, 'Be removed and be cast into the sea,' it will be done."
"If you believe, God will answer your prayers. The authority of Jesus."
Jesus entered the temple courts. While he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and said, "By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered, "I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
Where did the baptism of John come from? Was it from heaven, or of men? They reasoned among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'"
But what if we say, "of men"? We are afraid of people. Everyone thinks John was a prophet.
They answered him, "We do not know." And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."
What do you think of this? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, "Son, go and work today in the vineyard."
"No, I won't," the son replied. But then he changed his mind and went.
Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing to him. He answered and said, "I will, sir." But he did not go.
"Which of the two sons did the will of his father?" They said, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John came to show you the way of life, and you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and prostitutes did believe him. You saw it with your own eyes, but even then you did not stop sinning and did not believe him. The parable of the tenants.
Hear another parable. A man had a piece of land, so he planted a vineyard in it. He surrounded it with a fence, dug a winepress in it, and built a watchtower. Then he leased the farm to some farmers and went on a journey.
And when the time came to harvest, he sent his slaves to the tenants. He commanded them to gather his share of the fruit.
But the tenants seized his servants. They beat one of them. And they killed another. And they stoned the third to death.
So the man sent his servants to the farmers, a larger group than the first time. But the farmers treated them in the same way.
Finally, he sent his son to them. He said, "They will respect my son."
But the tenants saw the son coming. They said to one another, "This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours."
So they took him and drove him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
When the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do to those vinedressers?
"Those wicked people will be destroyed," they answered. "Then the vineyard will be rented to others who will pay him his share of the fruit at harvest time."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a nation bearing its fruits.
Anyone who falls on that stone will be crushed. But the stone will crush whoever falls on it.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables. They realized that he was speaking about them.
So they sought a way to seize him, but they feared the multitudes, because they regarded Jesus as a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Story
Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,
He sent his servants to the dinner guests. The servants told them to come, but they refused.
Then he sent out other servants, saying, 'Tell those who are invited, "See, I have prepared my banquet, my oxen and fattened calves are killed, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding."' Do you hear?
But the people paid no attention. One went to his field, and another to his business.
The rest of the people kept their servants. They treated them badly, then killed them.
The king was furious. He sent his army to wipe them out. They killed the assassins and burned their city to the ground.
Then the king said to the servants, "The wedding feast is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come."
Go to the street corners. Invite everyone you find to dinner.
So the servants went out into the streets and gathered everyone they found, both good-looking and ugly. And in a matter of moments, the wedding hall was filled with guests.
King entered to see the guests. He noticed a man who was not wearing wedding clothes.
My friend, how did you enter here without your wedding clothes? The man couldn't find anything to say.
So the king said to the servants, "Bind his hands and feet. Cast him into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
"Many are called, but few are chosen." Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went out and began to plot how they might entrap Jesus in His words.
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. They said, "Teacher, we know that you are a truthful man and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You do not care about anyone's opinion, and you do not regard a person's status.
So tell us, what do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
But Jesus perceived their wickedness and said, "Hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the currency that people use to pay taxes." They brought him a silver coin.
He asked them, "Whose picture is this? And whose words are these?"
They said, "To Caesar." He said to them, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
Upon hearing this, they were amazed, and they left and went away. Marriage when the dead rise.
On the same day, the Pharisees came to Jesus with a question, because they did not believe in the resurrection of the dead.
They said, "O Moses, this is from the mercy of God and His favor. And if God willed, He could have hastened your punishment. I say that my brother has a share of the kingdom, and he is my successor. Most of us want to make him a son, but I fear that he might disbelieve in your Lord, and he has no offspring. And that my daughter should be his heir, and he has no descendants to inherit from him. Each of us should inherit from the other justly. He is an orphan, and I have brought you the essence of the message."
We were seven brothers. The eldest married and died, leaving no children, so he willed his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened with the second and third brothers. It continued this way until the seventh.
Finally, the woman died.
So who was his wife then? "She was married to all of them in the past."
Jesus answered, "You are wrong because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God."
When the dead stand, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage. They will be like angels in heaven.
What about the dead who rise from their graves? Have you not read what God has told you?
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." (Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
The crowd who heard this in his teaching were astonished. Which commandment is the most important?
And when the Pharisees heard that the Sadducees were put to silence, they gathered themselves together.
And among them was a lawyer, who asked Jesus a question to test him.
Teacher, he asked him, "What is the most important commandment in the law?"
Jesus answered, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind" (Deuteronomy 6:5).
This is the first and most important commandment.
"You shall love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"All things written in the Law and the Prophets depend on these two commandments." "Who is the Son of Christ?"
The Pharisees gathered together. Jesus asked them,
What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he? They said to him, "The son of David."
He said to them, "Then why does David call him 'Lord'? For the Holy Spirit spoke through David himself, saying,
The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at My right hand, till I make Your enemies Your footstool." (Psalm 110:1)
How can he be the Son of David if he calls him 'Lord'?
No one could answer him in one word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him anything.
Jesus condemns the Pharisees and the scribes
Jesus spoke to the crowds and his disciples.
He said, "The scribes and the Pharisees sit on the chair of Moses."
So you must obey them. Do everything they command you to do. But do not do what they do. They do not practice what they preach.
They tie heavy loads and place them on people's shoulders. But they themselves will not lift a finger to move them, even for a little effort.
All that they do is to be seen by others. On their foreheads and arms they place small boxes containing verses from the Bible. They make these boxes very wide. And they make the embroidered ribbons on their coats very long.
They love to sit in places of honor at feasts and to be in the front seats in the synagogues.
They love to be greeted with "As-salamu alaykum" in the town's markets. They are pleased with those who address them as "Rebbi."
But you are not to be called 'rabbi,' for you have one Teacher, the Messiah. And you are all brothers. Do not call anyone on earth 'father,' for you have one Father, who is in heaven. Nor are you to be called 'teacher,' for you have one Teacher, the Messiah. The greatest among you will be your servant. Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
Do not call anyone on earth your father; for there is but one Father, who is in heaven.
You should not be called teachers. You have one teacher, and he is Christ.
The most important person among you will be your servant.
He who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces; for you neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter to go in.
(No
"How terrible it will be for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and then, when that person becomes a disciple, you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are."
How misguided you are, you teachers of the law! For you say, ‘If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing; but anyone who swears by the gold of the temple is bound by their oath.’
You are blind and foolish! What is more important, gold or the structure that sanctifies the gold?
You also say, 'If anyone swears by the altar, it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift that is on it, he is bound.'
O ye blind ones! What is more important? Is it the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
So if one swears by Allah, let him swear by Allah; and if he swears by the covenant of Allah, he has sworn by Allah and by what is binding upon Him.
And everyone who swears by the temple swears by the temple and by the God who dwells in it.
And whoever swears by the sky, swears by the throne of Allah and what is upon it.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faith. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others.
O you of diseased hearts! Who purify the hair from the food, but swallow the camel in one go.
You snakes! You are like whitewashed tombs—beautiful on the outside but filled with dead men’s bones and garbage.
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and of the dish, so that the outside also may be clean.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead people's bones and all uncleanness.
The same for you. From the outside, you seem like you're doing the right thing. But inside, you're full of wrong. You pretend you're not.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.
And you said, "If we had been in the past generations, we would not have associated [anything] with Allah or killed the prophets."
For you bear witness against yourselves that you are children of those who murdered the prophets.
So you complete what the former among you have started in terms of sins!
O nest of venomous scorpions! How will you flee from the shame, the torment of Hell?
For I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and chase them from city to city.
"You will pay for every drop of righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar."
I'm not really in a position to talk about it, and it will affect those who are alive now.
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!
Indeed, your home is desolate, with its roofs fallen in.
"I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!' (Psalm 118:26)"
Signs of the End Times
Jesus went out from the temple. And as he was going, his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple.
"Do you see all these things?" asked Jesus. "I tell you the truth, not one stone will be left standing on another; everything will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, and when the disciples came to him privately, they said, "Tell us, when will this be, and what will be the sign of your coming, and of the end of the age?"
Jesus answered, "Watch out, lest you be led astray!"
Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ!' and they will deceive many.
You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. You will hear people talking about wars of the future as well. Do not be alarmed. These things must happen. But the end is not yet.
Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
All these are the beginning of labor pains.
Then people will hand you over to be persecuted, and they will kill you. You will be hated by all nations because of my name.
At that time, many will turn away from the faith, they will hate each other, and they will hand each other over to be killed.
Many false prophets will arise. And they will deceive many people.
For the abundance of evil will cause the love of many to grow cold.
But he who endures to the end will be saved.
"This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached throughout all the world as a witness to all nations, and then the end will come."
The prophet Daniel spoke of the "abomination that desolates." (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11) One day you will see it standing in the holy place. Let the reader understand.
Let those in Judea flee to the mountains.
No one is to come down from the roof to their house to get anything.
No one in the field needs to go back to get their cloak.
Woe to the guided ones in those days! Woe to the nursing mothers!
O Lord, do not make us flee in winter or on Saturday.
There will be great tribulation in those days, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever will be again.
If time were not shortened, no one would live, but for the sake of the elect, it will be shortened.
At that time, someone will say, 'Look, the Christ is here or there!' Do not believe it.
False Christs and prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect.
See, I told you before.
"If they tell you, 'He is in the wilderness,' do not go; and if they say, 'He is in the house,' do not believe it."
A thunder from the east will be heard in the west. So it will be when the Son of Man appears.
Vultures will gather wherever there is a dead body.
Immediately after the terrible sufferings of those days, "the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken." (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven. And all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with great power and glory.
He will send His angels with a fiery blast, gathering Pharaoh and his people from every direction.
"Even so, when you see the fig tree and all the trees in leaf, you know that summer is near."
In the same way, when you see all these things happening, you know that the end is near. It's about to happen.
"Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened."
The heaven and the earth will pass away, and only His Face will remain. As for the Day and the Hour, no one knows them except Allah.
No one knows the day or the hour. Not even the angels in heaven know. The Son himself does not know. Only the Father knows.
Remember the days of Noah. So will the coming of the Son of Man be.
In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving their daughters in marriage. They were living their lives as usual until the day Noah entered the ark.
They knew nothing about what was happening until the flood came and took them all. So will it be when the Son of Man comes.
Two men will be in the field, one will be taken and the other left.
Two grindstones are used together, one is taken and the other is left.
"So know that you do not know what the people of insight know."
You must understand something. If the homeowner knew when the thief would come at night, he would make sure to stay awake and not allow his house to be broken into.
Therefore you also must be ready, because at an hour you do not expect, the Son of Man will come.
Suppose a master made one of his slaves responsible for the rest of the slaves in his house. The task of this slave is to feed them on time. The master wants someone trustworthy and wise for this position.
It would be good for the servant if his master found him doing his work upon his return.
"I will not say to you something I do not know. Indeed, your Lord is, on that Day, Generous to the servant. He will reward him fully, without injustice or deprivation."
But let's suppose that the servant is evil. Let's suppose he says to himself, "My master is taking too long to return."
Assume that he will start beating other servants. And assume that he eats and drinks with heavy drinkers.
The master of that servant will return one day when the servant does not expect him. His return will be at a time he does not know.
Then his master will cut him to pieces. He will send him to where the claimants go. There they will weep and gnash their teeth in anger.
A Story of Ten Girls About to Get Married
This is how the kingdom of heaven will be at that time. The ten virgins went out, taking their lamps to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were fools, and five others were wise.
The foolishes ones begged for their lamps, but they did not bring olive oil with them.
The wise men carried the oil in jars with their lamps.
The groom hasn't come for a long time. All the bridesmaids are tired and have fallen asleep.
At midnight the cry rang out: “Here comes the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!”
Then all the virgins woke up and each one prepared her lamp.
The fools said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out."
"No, they said, 'It's not enough for everyone, go to the oil seller and buy some.'"
So they went to buy oil. But the bridegroom arrived while they were on their way. And she entered with him, accompanied by the bride's ready maids of honor, to the wedding dinner. Then the door was closed.
Then the other bridesmaids also came. They said, "Sir! Sir! Open the door for us!"
But he replied, "What I am about to tell you is the truth. I do not know you."
"So reflect, O men of insight! You do not know when the Almighty will take His revenge. The tale of three servants..."
And thus will the King of the heavens gather together the earthly realms. On the day when He will say to the treasurers, "Bring Me what you have of gold."
He gave ten thousand dollars to one. He gave four thousand to another. And he granted two thousand to the third. The man gave each servant the amount he knew the servant could take care of. Then he set out on his journey.
And the servant who had received the ten thousand dollars went at once and invested his money and gained another ten thousand dollars.
He who won $4,000 won another $4,000.
As for the one who received two thousand dollars, he went and dug a hole in the ground and buried his master's money in it.
After a long time, the master of those servants returned. He wanted to reclaim all the money they had earned.
The man who received $10,000 brought the other $10,000. He said, "Sir, you trusted me with $10,000, and here I have made another $10,000 from it."
His master said, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!"
The man who had four thousand dollars also came and said, "Teacher, you entrusted me with four thousand dollars, and I have made eight thousand dollars."
His master said, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!"
Then he who had received the one talent came and said, 'Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not winnow;
So I was afraid and hid your money in the ground. Here is your money.
His master answered, 'You wicked, lazy servant! Did you know that I harvest where I did not sow and gather where I did not scatter seed?
And so you had deposited my money in the savings account. When I returned, I was going to retrieve it along with its profit.
Then his master said to the other servants, "Take the two hundred from him, and give it to the one who has ten thousand."
To those who have, more will be given, and they will have an abundance. But from those who do not have, even what they do have will be taken away.
Cast that useless servant into the outer darkness. There, people will weep and gnash their teeth. Sheep and goats
"The Son of Man will come in his glory with all the holy angels, and then he will sit on his glorious throne in heaven."
All the nations will be gathered before him. He will separate the people one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
He will put the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right, "Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world."
I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me.
I was in need of clothes, and you gave them to me. I was sick, and you healed me. I was in prison, and you visited me.
Then the righteous will answer, "Lord, when we saw you hungry, we fed you, and when you were thirsty, we gave you drink."
When did we see you a stranger and welcome you? Or naked and clothe you?
When did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?
The King will say, "Truly, I say to you, whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine, you did for me."
Then He will say to those on His right, "Enter Paradise, you who are blessed, for you have no fear and you will not grieve." And He will say to those on His left, "Go out to the punishment of the Fire, which was prepared for the Shaytan and his followers."
I was hungry, but you gave me nothing to eat. I was thirsty, but you gave me nothing to drink.
I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I was naked and you did not give me clothes. I was sick and in prison and you did not visit me.
They also will answer and say, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty, and did not feed you? Or a stranger, and did not welcome you? Or naked, and did not clothe you? Or sick or in prison, and did not visit you?'
He will say: "Truly I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these, you did it to me."
Then they will go to everlasting punishment, but those who have done good will go to eternal life.
Plan to kill Jesus
And Jesus ended all these sayings, saying to His disciples:
As you know, Easter is in two days. And the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, Caiaphas.
They plotted to arrest Jesus by stealth. They wanted to kill him.
But not during the feast, they said. "For the people may make trouble." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in the house of Simon the leper in Bethany.
A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, sealed with a stone. She broke the stone seal and poured the perfume on Jesus' head as he was reclining.
So the disciples were indignant when they saw this and said, "Why this waste?"
The perfume could have been sold at a high price. The money could have been given to the poor.
Jesus knew this, and said to them, "Why are you troubling this woman? She has done a good deed to me."
The poor you will always have with you, but me you will not always have.
I poured perfume over my body to prepare it for burial.
"What I am about to tell you is true, and it will be proclaimed everywhere this good news is preached throughout the world, in memory of her." Judas agreed to hand Jesus over.
Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests.
He said, "What will you give me, and I will deliver Jesus to you?" And they paid him thirty pieces of silver.
From that time on, Judas watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. The Last Supper
That first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"
He said, "Go to the town and tell a certain man, 'The Teacher says, "My time is near. I and my companions want to celebrate the Passover of the Jews at your house.'"
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover.
When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve.
While they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."
The disciples were very sorrowful, and each one began to say to him one after another: "It is not I, Lord, I swear to you!"
Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me."
The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. Woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.
And Judas, who betrayed him, said, "Is it I, Rabbi?" Jesus answered, "You have said so."
While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take, eat; this is my body."
Then he took the cup, gave thanks, and said, "Drink from it, all of you."
This is the blood of the new covenant, shed for the forgiveness of many.
This is what I'm telling you. From now on, I won't drink wine with you again until the day I drink it with you in my father's kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said that Peter would deny him.
Jesus said to them, "This night, you will all fall away from me, for it is written: 'The Lord will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)
But I will go before you into Galilee, after I am risen again from the dead.
Peter said, "Everyone else might leave because of you, but I never will."
What I am telling you now is true, Jesus answered. "This will happen tonight. Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
But Peter said, "I would rather die with you. I will never deny you." And all the disciples said the same. Jesus' prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane.
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there to pray."
And he chose Peter and the sons of Zebedee, and took them with him. And he began to be sorrowful and very distressed.
Then he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and keep watch with me."
He went a little farther. Then, falling on his face, he prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter, "Could you not watch with me for one hour?"
And know that your wealth and your children are but a trial, and that it is Allah with whom lies a mighty reward. [And remember] when you say something, there is always an observer, a witness, ready to record. And worship Allah.
Jesus went away a second time and prayed, saying, "My Father, if this cup may be taken away from me, yet not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned and found them sleeping again. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
So he left them and went away again. And a third time he asked the same question.
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners."
Rise! Let us go! Behold, he who betrays me is at hand! Jesus is betrayed.
While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. With him was a large mob armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
And Judas Iscariot, who was to betray him, had arranged a signal with them, saying, "Whomever I kiss, he is the one. Seize him."
So Judas, having received the battalion, went immediately to Jesus and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Do what you have come for." Then the soldiers stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' companions pulled out his sword and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
Jesus said to him, "Put your sword away; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you think I can't ask my father for help? He'll immediately send an army of over seventy thousand kings.
So how are the scriptures fulfilled? They say that it must happen this way.
At that time Jesus said to the crowd, "Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour, when darkness reigns."
But this was done that the word of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him and fled. Jesus, however, stood before the Sanhedrin.
And those who had seized Jesus led him to Caiaphas the high priest. And the scribes and the elders were gathered together to him.
As soon as Peter heard, he followed Jesus closely. He entered the courtyard of the high priest and sat with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.
But they found no proof, even though many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two other witnesses arrived.
They said, "This man said, 'I can destroy the temple of God, and rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Do you not answer? What is it that these men testify against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us: Are you the Messiah, the Son of God?"
Yes. It is as you say. Jesus answered, "But I tell you that in the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? You have now heard the blasphemy."
"What do you think?" they answered, "He must die!"
Then they spat in his face. They raised their hands and punched him. Others slapped him.
They said, "Tell us, Christ, who struck you?" Peter said, "I do not know Jesus."
Peter was sitting in the outer courtyard. A servant girl came up and said to him, "You also were with Jesus the Nazarene."
But Peter said that they didn't all have it. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.
Then he went out to the porch leading to the courtyard, and another woman saw him there and said to the crowd, "This one was with Jesus of Nazareth."
And he swore again, saying, "I do not know him: 'I do not know him!'"
And after a while those who were standing there came up to him and said, "You must be one of them; your accent gives you away."
So Peter began to call down curses on himself and to swear, "I don't know the man!" And immediately the rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered the words Jesus had said to him: "Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.
Judas hangs himself.
It was early in the morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to kill Jesus.
They bound him and led him away. Then they handed him over to Pilate, the governor.
And when Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that he was condemned, he repented and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders.
I said, "I made a mistake, I released an innocent man." They replied, "What's it to us? That's your problem."
So Judas threw the silver into the temple and went away. Then he went and hanged himself.
The priests translated the capital. They said, "It is religiously prohibited to put this money in the temple fund. It is unclean money. It was paid for the death of a man."
So they decided to use the money to buy a field to bury foreigners.
That is why it is still called "Field of Blood" to this day.
Then were fulfilled the words of Jeremiah the prophet, saying: "They gave thirty pieces of silver for him, the price of him that was valued by the children of Israel."
"They paid the money to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me." (Zechariah 11:12,13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) The presentation of Jesus to Pilate
Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "You have said so."
And when he came to them with the proofs of his authority, the chief priests, the rulers, and the elders did not answer him.
Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?"
But Jesus made no answer, not even to a single charge. The governor was greatly amazed.
It was the governor's custom at Easter to release one prisoner. The people chose that prisoner.
And at that time they had a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.
So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Whom do you want me to release for you? Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Messiah?"
Pilate knew that the chief priests had envied Jesus. He knew that this was the reason they had handed him over.
And while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message, saying, "Have nothing to do with that righteous man; for today I have suffered much in a dream because of him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus put to death.
"Which of the two do you want me to release?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered.
"So what shall I do with Jesus called Christ?" asked Pilate. They all answered, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What has he done wrong?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "It is your responsibility!"
All the people said, "We and our children bear the guilt for his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas. Jesus he flogged and handed over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Christ.
And the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered together the whole band.
They stripped him and put a purple robe on him.
Then they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they put a purple robe on him. And they began to salute him, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
They spat on him. They hit him on the head with a stick repeatedly.
And after they had mocked him, they took off his robe and put his clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him. Jesus is crucified on the cross.
And as they led him out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they compelled him to carry his cross.
They came to a place called Golgotha, which means the place of the skull.
It is He who mixed wine with bitterness for them, and they gave Jesus to drink.
And when they had crucified him with nails on the cross, they divided his clothes by casting lots.
They gathered and watched him there, sitting.
A sign was posted above his head, written in three languages: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
صلب مع يسوع لصان، واحد عن يمينو والآخر عن يسارو.
And those who passed by him derided him, shaking their heads.
He said, "If you are the Son of God, save yourself and come down from the cross! If you really say you can destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,"
In the same way, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders mocked him.
They said, "He saved others, but he can't save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
"He trusts in God. May God deliver him now, if he is truly God's son."
In the same way, the two criminals who were crucified with Jesus mocked him. The death of Jesus.
From noon until three in the afternoon, the whole earth was in darkness.
Around the ninth hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" that is, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of those who stood there, when they heard Jesus cry out, said, "He is calling Elijah."
And one of them ran and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave it to Jesus to drink.
The rest said, "Let him be, so we can see if Elijah will come to save him."
And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.
And at once the curtain in the sanctuary was torn from top to bottom. The earth shook, the rocks split apart.
The tombs burst open, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised and came to life.
They came out of the tombs, and after Jesus had risen from the dead, they entered the holy city and appeared to many there.
The Roman commander and the guards saw the earthquake and all that had happened, and they were terrified. They cried out, "Surely he was the Son of God!"
A large crowd of women was also there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee and had been helping him.
Mary Magdalene was there. And Mary the mother of James and Joseph was also there. The mother of Zebed's sons was also there. They buried Jesus.
As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. And Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Joseph wrapped the body in a clean linen cloth.
He placed him in his new tomb that he had hewn out of the rock. Then he rolled a large stone against the entrance. Afterward, he departed.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The guards were at the tomb.
Tomorrow was the day after the Preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
They said, "Lord, we remember that deceiver saying while he was still alive, 'After three days I will rise again.'"
So he gave orders to secure the tomb until the third day, lest his disciples go and steal him away, and tell the people, 'He has risen from the dead,' and the last deception will be worse than the first."
"Take a guard with you," said Pilate. "Go and make the tomb as secure as you can."
So they turned away, having carried out their vow of stoning, and they set up a place of worship there, saying, "Do not approach this (place of worship) until the command of Allah comes."
Jesus rises from the dead.
The Sabbath was over, and dawn was breaking on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to the tomb.
There was a strong earthquake. And an angel of the Lord came down from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled away the stone from the door and sat on it.
His body shone like lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so terrified of him that they trembled like the dead.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid! I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.
"It is not here! He has risen just as he said! Come and see the place where he was lying."
Go quickly and tell his disciples: "He has risen from the dead! He is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him." That is all I have to say to you.
So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples.
Suddenly Jesus met them and said, "Greetings!" They came up, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me." So the guards went and told the chief priests everything that had happened.
And while the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
When the chief priests met with the elders, they devised a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
They told the soldiers, "We want you to say: His disciples came at night and stole his body while we were sleeping."
If the governor hears this report, we'll bribe him. That will keep you out of trouble.
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus' final commands to his disciples.
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
And when they saw him, they prostrated to him, but some of them doubted.
Then Jesus came up to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
"Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you, and behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
ترجمته إلى العربية التونسية هي: من زمان كتب إشعياء النبي: "رَسُولِي أُرْسِلُ قُدَّامَكَ يُهَيِّئُ طَرِيقَكَ" (مَلاخي ٣:١) Translation: Long ago, Isaiah
A voice cries out: "In the wilderness prepare the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God." (Isaiah 40:3)
And so John came, baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
All the people of Judea and Jerusalem went out to him. They confessed their sins, and John baptized them in the Jordan River.
And John wore a garment of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
This is what John the Baptist proclaimed: "After me comes one more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie."
I baptize you with water, but he who comes after me is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to untie the thong of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.
At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
And after Jesus was baptized, he immediately came up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him.
And a voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."
After Jesus was baptized, he went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him. And a voice from heaven said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”
Jesus was in the wilderness for forty days, where he was tempted by the devil. Wild beasts did not harm him, and angels ministered to him. He chose his first disciples.
And after John was imprisoned, Jesus went to Galilee, preaching the gospel of God.
He said, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel."
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting their net into the lake; they were fishermen.
Come and follow me, said Jesus. "I will make you fishers of men."
So they left the fish and followed him immediately.
Then Jesus stopped and looked around, and he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John, who were in their boat mending their nets.
And after he had called the crowd to him, they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men, and went away to follow Jesus. Jesus drove out a demon that was mute.
And Jesus and those with Him went to Capernaum. And He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath and began to teach.
The people were amazed at His teaching, for He taught them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes.
And at that moment a man in the synagogue who was possessed by an unclean spirit shouted out.
What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!
"Be silent!" Jesus said sternly. "Come out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Then it came out of him with a scream.
And they were all amazed, and began to speak with one another, saying, "What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him."
The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus left the synagogue and was followed by a large crowd. They came to the house of Simon and Andrew, and James and John, where Mary, the mother of James and Joses, was waiting.
Simon's mother-in-law lay sick in bed, and they told Jesus about her.
So he went to her, took her by the hand, and lifted her up. The fever left her, and she got up and waited on them.
That evening, after sunset, all who had any sick with various diseases brought them to Jesus, as well as those who were demon-possessed.
All the people in the city gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many who were sick with various diseases. He also cast out many demons, but he would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prayed in a solitary place.
It was very early in the morning, and darkness was still hovering around. Jesus got up, left the house, and went to a place where he could be alone. And there he prayed.
Simon and his companions went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they cried: "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus answered, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages—so that I can preach there also. That is why I have come."
So he went about among the villages teaching. He called the twelve to him, and began to send them out two by two, giving them authorit
A man with a severe skin disease went to Jesus, knelt down, and said, "If you want to, you can make me clean."
Jesus was filled with compassion. He reached out his hand and touched the man, saying, "I want to do this. Be clean!"
And now he was immediately healed of his disease.
Jesus rebuked him sharply and sent him away.
He said, "Do not say this to anyone." Then he said, "Go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded. This will be a proof to the priest and the people that you are 'clean'."
But the man went out and began to proclaim it freely, and to spread the news so widely that Jesus could no longer enter a town openly. He remained outside in secluded places, but people from all quarters were coming to him.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk.
A few days later, Jesus again entered Capernaum, and the people heard that he was in the house.
A large crowd gathered, until there was no longer room, not even outside the door. And Jesus was preaching the word to them.
Four men came carrying a man who couldn't walk.
But they could not get near Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, lowering the mat that the paralyzed man was lying on, they dropped it into the middle of the crowd.
Jesus saw their faith. So he said to the man, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
Some of the scribes were sitting there, thinking.
Why is this man speaking like this? He's saying something very evil! Only God forgives sins.
Jesus knew immediately what they were thinking, and he said to them, "Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say to this man, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take your bed and walk'?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus said to the paralytic,
He said to them, "Get up, take your mat and go home."
And he arose and chose for himself a procession, and went on, and they followed him in awe. And the crowd was amazed. And they spoke, glorifying God, and said, "We have never seen anything like this!" And Jesus called to him the one who was called the tax collector.
And again Jesus went away to the seashore of Galilee, where a large crowd gathered around him, and he taught them.
And as he walked, he met Louhi the son of Halphai. Louhi was sitting at the tax collector's post. Jesus said to him, "Follow me." And he rose and followed him.
Afterward, Jesus was reclining in the house of Levi. And there were many tax collectors and sinners sitting at the table with Him and His disciples, for there were many who followed Him.
Some of the scribes and Pharisees saw him eating with sinners and tax collectors, and they said to his disciples, "How can he eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said to them, *"Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick; I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."*
The disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came to Jesus and said to him, "John's disciples fast, and the Pharisees' disciples fast, but yours do not fast."
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom grieve while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast."
But death will come to them unexpectedly, and they will be unable to avert it. On that day, they will not be able to consume any food.
People do not patch a new piece of cloth on old clothes, because the new piece will tear away from the old and make the tear worse.
People do not pour new wine into old wineskins. For the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine will be spilled, and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins." Jesus, Lord of the Sabbath.
On the Sabbath, Jesus was walking through the fields with his disciples. As they went along, the disciples began to pick and eat the heads of wheat.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Behold, you are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath!"
He answered them, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him?"
That was in the days of Abiathar the high priest. David went into the house of God, and ate the shewbread, which was lawful to eat only for the priests, and gave also to his men.
So Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
Therefore the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.
Healing on Saturday
Again Jesus entered the synagogue, and there was a man there with a withered hand.
Some Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They watched him closely. They wanted to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus spoke to the man with the weak and crooked hand, saying to him, "Rise up and stand before everyone."
Then Jesus said to them, "What is it that you are doing to the man on the Sabbath? Is it right to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?" But they were silent.
Jesus looked around in anger, deeply disturbed at their stubborn hearts. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He did, and his hand was completely restored.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians against Jesus, how they might kill Him. And the multitudes followed Him.
Jesus and his disciples went to the Sea of Galilee, and a large crowd from Galilee followed him.
When the people heard all that Jesus was doing, many came to him. They came from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and around Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowd, Jesus asked his disciples to prepare a small boat for him. This was to keep the crowd away from him.
Jesus healed many people, so the sick were pushing to touch him.
And when the people who were possessed with evil spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, saying, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone about him, saying, "The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected.
Jesus went up a mountain and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him.
He appointed twelve of them and called them apostles, and from that day they accompanied him and he sent them out to preach.
They have authority to cast out demons.
So Jesus chose twelve disciples. Simon was one of them, and he gave him the name Peter.
There were James son of Zebedee and his brother John. Jesus called them "Boanerges," which means "Sons of Thunder."
And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus. Also, Peter, and Matthias, and Simon the Zealot.
Judas Iscariot was also among them. He was the one who would later betray Jesus to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebub.
Jesus entered a house. And again the crowd gathered, so that Jesus and his disciples could not even eat.
His family heard about it. They came to get him. They said, "He's crazy."
Some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul, and by the ruler of the demons he casts out demons."
Then Jesus called his disciples and said to them, "Truly I tell you, it is not possible for one demon to drive out another demon."
If the kingdom fights itself from within, it will not stand.
If the family is divided, it will not stand.
