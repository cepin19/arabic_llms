So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, and fourteen generations from David to the exile in Babylon, and fourteen generations from the exile in Babylon to the Messiah. The genealogy of Jesus Christ.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
And her husband, Joseph, was a righteous man, and did not want to expose her to disgrace among the people. So he decided to divorce her secretly.
While he was pondering these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.”
"You will give birth to a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."
All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet.
A virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel; which is translated, God with us. (Isaiah 7:14)
Joseph woke up. He did as the angel of the Lord commanded him. He took Mary to his house as his wife.
But Joseph did not know her till she had brought forth a son: and he called his name Jesus.
The Visit of the Wise Men to Jesus
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the reign of King Herod. After Jesus' birth, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
They asked, "Where is the child who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was greatly disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
Then Herod called the chief priests and the scribes and asked them where the Christ was to be born.
"In Bethlehem in Judea," they answered him. "This is what the prophet wrote." He said,
And you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times.
So Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them the exact time the star had appeared.
He sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me so that I too may go and worship him."
And when the wise men had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.
When they saw the star, joy overwhelmed them.
And the wise men went to the house. And they saw the child with his mother Mary. And they bowed down to him and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and offered him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
And God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod, so they returned to their own country by another road. The journey of Jesus' family to Egypt.
And when the wise men had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child to destroy him."
Joseph got up, and during the night he left for Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.
They remained there until the death of King Herod. Thus was fulfilled what the Lord had spoken through the prophet: “Out of Egypt I called my son.” (Hosea 11:1)
When Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him, he was furious. He gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its surroundings who were two years old or less, in accordance with the time he had learned from the wise men.
Thus was fulfilled what the prophet Jeremiah had spoken:
A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and weeping and great mourning. Rachel weeps for her children and refuses to be comforted, because they are no more. (Jeremiah 31:15) The family of Jesus returns to Nazareth.
And after Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream in Egypt.
The angel said, "Take the child and his mother and flee to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child's life are dead."
So Joseph got up, took the child and his mother Mary, and returned to the land of Israel.
But he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in the place of his father Herod, and he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he went away to the district of Galilee.
And there he lived in a city called Nazareth. Thus was fulfilled the prophecy of the prophets about Jesus, for they said, "He shall be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Repent from your sins, for the kingdom of heaven has drawn near."
Indeed, John is the one about whom the prophet Isaiah spoke, saying, "A voice cries out in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight'" (Isaiah 40:3).
John's clothing was made of camel's hair, and he had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
The people went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region around the Jordan.
When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to be baptized by him, and he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
Bear good fruit that shows your repentance from sins.
Do not think that you will be sons of Abraham just by saying, "We are descendants of Abraham." For I tell you, God can raise up children for Abraham from these stones.
The sapling stands on its roots, every tree that does not bear good fruit, we cut it down and burn it in the fire.
I baptize you with water, calling you to repent of your sins. But after me comes one who is mightier than I. I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
And his pitchfork in his hand to thresh his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he burns up with unquenchable fire." The baptism of Jesus
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan. He wanted John to baptize him.
But John tried to prevent him, saying to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you, and yet you come to me?"
Jesus replied, "So it must be now. We must do what is right. Let us fulfill God's will." John agreed.
As soon as Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son, whom I have chosen."
Jesus is tempted.
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness, and there the devil tempted him.
And after forty days and forty nights, Jesus was hungry.
The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.' (Deuteronomy 8:3)"
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple.
"If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down below, for it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you, on their hands they will bear you up, so that you may not dash your foot against a stone.' (Psalm 91:11-12)"
Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain. And he showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
He said, "If you worship me and bow down to me, I will give you all this."
Jesus said to him, "Go away, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
Then the devil left Jesus, and angels came and attended to him. And Jesus began to preach.
John was imprisoned. And when Jesus heard of it, he withdrew into Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and went to Capernaum, which is by the lake in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
Thus was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah.
Zebulun and Naphtali, Galilee of the nations, The people who dwell in darkness Have seen a great light; Those who dwell in the land of the shadow of death, Upon them a light has shined.
Those who dwell in darkness will see a great light. They who dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them will the light shine. As for you, the light will rise over you like the day, and the shadows of death will be like the brightness of the morning.
From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." He chose the first disciples.
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
Come and follow me, said Jesus. "I will make you fishers of men."
So they left the fish and followed him immediately.
And afterward he saw two others walking in the boat, James the son of Zebedee and his brother John, who were mending their nets. Jesus called them.
And they immediately left the boat and their father, and followed him. Jesus heals the sick.
Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
The news about him spread all over Syria. People brought all those who were sick, those suffering from various diseases. Some were in great pain, some were possessed by demons, some were convulsing violently, and others were completely paralyzed. Jesus healed them all.
Large crowds followed him. Some came from Galilee, from the region known as the Decapolis, others from Jerusalem and Judea, and still others from beyond the Jordan.
Isa gives blessings.
Jesus saw the crowds, and went up into the mountain; and when he had sat down, his disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them, saying:
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
"Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy."
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
"Blessed are you when people hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil because of the Son of Man."
<h3>Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great. This is how they persecuted the prophets who came before you. You are the salt of the earth and the light of the world.</h3>
"You are the salt of the earth. But if salt loses its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything, but is thrown out and trampled underfoot."
You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hid.
And likewise, He made it clear to the people that they should not light a lamp and place it under a bushel basket, but on a lampstand, so that it may give light to everyone in the house.
In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven. Jesus fulfills the law completely.
I have not come to abolish the law or the prophets. I have not come to take away from them, but to fulfill them.
"I am telling you the truth. Heaven and earth will pass away before even the smallest letter of the law passes away. And not even the smallest detail of the law will pass away before all is fulfilled."
Do not break the least of the commandments, nor teach others to break them. Otherwise, people will call you the lowest of the kingdom. Either you practice and teach these commandments, and people will call you the inhabitants of the highest kingdom of the heavens.
This is what I say to you: You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. If you are not, you will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Murder.
You have heard what was said to those of old, 'You shall not kill.' (Exodus 20:13) But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment.
But I tell you, do not be angry with your brother. Whoever is angry with his brother without a cause will be liable to judgment. And whoever says to his brother, 'Raca,' will be answerable to the Sanhedrin. But whoever says, 'You fool,' will be in danger of hellfire.
"Suppose you are presenting your offering at the altar and you remember that your brother has something against you"
Leave your gift there before the altar. Go and be reconciled with your brother. Then come and offer your gift.
Suppose someone has a claim against you and wants to sue you. Try to settle the matter quickly. Do it while you're still on the way with him. Otherwise, he may hand you over to the judge. The judge may then order you to be handed over to the police officer. You might end up in jail.
I'm not going to update you on it. You're not leaving here until you pay the last penny! Adultery.
You have heard that it was said, "Do not commit adultery." (Exodus 20:14)
But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman to desire her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
If your right hand entices you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. (Divorce)
It is written: "When a man divorces his wife, he must give her a written notice of divorce." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
But I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. It is permitted for a man to divorce his wife if she does not provide him with food in his bed. And the swearers of oaths
And you have heard another time what was said to your ancient fathers: "Do not break the covenants which you have made with the Lord your God. Do not swear by His name falsely."
But this is what I will tell you. Never make such promises again. Don't offer them in the name of heaven. That is God's throne.
Do not make it in the name of Earth. That is reserved for the feet of God. Do not make it in the name of Jerusalem. That is the city of the great King.
"And do not use your oaths as a means to justify disobedience, lest you should sit [in disobedience] against Allah, [and] the one who created you. Evil is the return."
"Say, 'Yes, if you mean yes, and say, 'No,' if you mean no.' Anything beyond that is from Satan. Be righteous."
You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." (Exodus 21:24, Leviticus 24:20, Deuteronomy 19:21)
But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.
If someone sues you for your shirt, give them your coat as well.
If anyone compels you to go one mile, go with him two miles.
Give to him who asks you, and do not turn away from him who wants to borrow from you. Love your enemies.
You have heard that it was said, "Love your neighbor and hate your enemy."
But I tell you, love your enemies. Bless those who curse you.
"So be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect. For He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust."
If you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Even tax collectors do the same.
If you only greet your family and acquaintances, what are you doing more than the unbelievers? Even the unbelievers themselves do that.
Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Kindness to needy people
Beware of doing good deeds in front of people to be seen by them. Do not do them so that others may praise you. For if you do, your Father in heaven will not reward you.
"And when you spend, do not spend ostentatiously, seeking to be seen by people, nor to boast of what you give to others. But spend to seek the reward from your Lord, and seek forgiveness from Allah. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful."
When you give to the poor, do so in private, so that your left hand does not know what your right hand is doing.
Then give alms secretly, for your father sees in secret and will reward you for it. Prayer.
When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, who love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by people. Truly I tell you, they have already received their reward.
When you pray, go into your room, close the door, and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
"Do not be like those who utter prayer carelessly, like the disbelievers, who think that they are being heard because of their much speech."
Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.
Thus they prayed: "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name."
"Your kingdom come, Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven."
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we also forgive those who sin against us.
"Make us love piety and protect us from trials. Turn away from us the devil and protect us from him."
Forgive people when they wrong you, so your heavenly Father will also forgive you when you wrong him.
"And if you do not forgive people their slips, neither will your Father forgive your slips."
When you fast, do not be like the hypocrites, with somber faces, as if they were suppressing a veil. They have already received their reward in full.
But when you fast, anoint your head with oil and wash your face.
"So do not show off your charity to people, but give it away in secret, and Allah, Who is All-Mighty, All-Wise, will give you a great reward. And when you pray, do not be like those who show off their piety."
<h3>Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</h3>
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
Your heart will be where your treasure is.
The eye is like a lamp for the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light.
But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. For either he will hate one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not worry.
Say, "Do not feed me your food, for I do not eat of it, nor will you eat of it. And do not make me a companion of the devils. Verily, they do not guide towards righteousness, and they cannot attain it
Look at the birds of the sky, they neither sow nor reap, nor gather into barns, and your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much better than they?
Can you add an hour to your life by worrying?
And why do you care about clothes? Look how wildflowers grow. They don't get tired or dress up.
But I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these flowers.
If God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O men of little faith? You who sow in hope of a rich harvest, do not start with doubt and end in fear.
Therefore do not worry, saying, "What will we eat?" or "What will we drink?" or "What will we wear?"
The unbelievers strive after all these things. Your heavenly Father knows that you need them.
But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
So do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Be fair when judging others.
Do not judge others, lest you be judged.
You will be judged in the same way you judge others. The measure you use for others will be used for you.
You see the mote in your friend's eye, but do not notice the beam in your own eye.
How can you tell your friend, "Let me remove the splinter from your eye," when you have a splinter in your eye as well?
You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.
Do not give what is holy to the dogs, and do not throw your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces. Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.
Ask and you shall be given. Seek and you shall find. Knock and the door will be opened to you.
He who asks will find, and he who searches will have the door opened for him.
Suppose your son asks for bread. Which one of you would give him a stone?
"Or if he asked for a fish, would you give him a live one?"
"If you, then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!"
Do to others what you would want them to do to you. This is what is written in the Law and the Prophets. In all things, whether great or small.
Enter the Kingdom of God through the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction and hell. And many are those who enter through it.
But the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and only a few find it. The tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.
They know what they are doing. Do people gather grapes from thorns? Do they pluck figs from thistles?
So every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit. And a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
Every tree is known by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
They will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord! Did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?'
Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!' The wise and the foolish were building together.
So everyone who hears these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on rock.
The rain falls. The waters rise. The winds blow and beat against that house. But it does not fall. For it is built on the rock.
But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.
The rain falls. The water rises. The wind blows and strikes that house violently. And it crashes with a loud noise.
Jesus ended his discourse with this parable, and the crowds were amazed at his teaching.
He taught as one having authority, and not as their scribes.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain. A large crowd followed him.
A man with leprosy came to him and knelt down before him, saying, "Lord, if you choose, you can make me clean."
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man, saying, "I want to, be clean." Immediately, the man was cleansed of his leprosy.
Then Jesus said to him, "Tell no one, but go and show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." The faith of the Roman centurion.
When Jesus came to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached him and asked for his help.
My lord, he said, my servant is lying at home, paralyzed and in great pain.
Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
The leader said, "Sir, I am not worthy to have you enter my house, but say the word, and my servant will be healed."
I myself am a man under authority, and I have soldiers who obey my orders. I say to this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith."
I tell you, many will come from east and west and recline at table with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
But those who think they are part of the kingdom will be thrown outside into the darkness, where they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go your way; just as you have believed, so it shall be done to you." And immediately the servant was healed.
When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up at once and waited on him.
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to Jesus, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick.
Its translation is: He did this to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah had said: "He took our infirmities and bore our diseases, and we considered him stricken, struck by God, and humbled." (Isaiah 53:4) The cost of following Jesus is high.
Jesus, seeing the crowd around him, instructed his disciples to take the boat and precede him to the other side of the sea.
Then one of the scribes said to him, "I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
Another servant said to him, "Master, let me first go and bury my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus got into the boat. The disciples followed him.
Suddenly a fierce storm swept across the lake. The waves broke over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
And the disciples came to him and woke him, saying, "Master, save us! We are perishing!"
He said, "O you of little faith! Why did you doubt?" Then Jesus got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it became completely calm.
And great fear took hold of the disciples, and they asked, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the sea obey him!" Jesus heals two demon-possessed men.
Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake, in the region of the Gadarenes. Two men possessed by demons came out to meet Him, coming from the tombs. They were so violent that no one dared to pass that way.
O Son of God, what do you want with us? Have you come to torment us before our time?
Ten large pigs were grazing not far away.
The demons begged Jesus, saying, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go." And the demons came out of the men and entered the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the waters.
And those who were tending the swine fled and reported it in the city and in the countryside, and they told what had happened to the possessed men.
Then the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk.
Jesus got into the boat and crossed the sea to his town.
Jesus found their faith so strong that he said to the man, "My child, your sins are forgiven."
Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to one another, "This man speaks blasphemy!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking, and he said to them, "Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Go and walk"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he said to the paralytic, "Get up, take your mat and go to your house."
The man stood up and went to his house.
When the crowd saw this, they were amazed and praised God, who had given such authority to human beings. They called out to Jesus, "Blessed are you, Lord! Son of David!" And Jesus went away from there. Mark 2:12, Bible
As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he told him, and Matthew got up and followed him.
Afterward Jesus went to dine at the house of Matthew, and many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
Jesus heard this and said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick."
"Go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
One day the disciples of John came to him and said, "Teacher, we are fasting, and the Pharisees are fasting too, but your disciples are not fasting. Why?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast."
People do not patch an old garment with new cloth, for the new patch would pull away from the old cloth, making the tear worse.
People do not pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst, the wine will spill, and the skins will be ruined. Instead, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.
While he was still speaking, a synagogue leader came and fell at his feet, pleading with him to come and heal his daughter, who was dying.
Jesus rose and the disciples followed him.
And immediately a woman who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment, for she said to herself, "If I only touch his garment, I will be made well." Jesus turned around and saw her and said, "Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well." And at once the woman was made well.
She thought to herself: "All I have to do is touch his clothes, and I will be healed."
And Jesus turned and saw her, and said, "Woman, your faith has made you well." And the woman was made whole at once.
And when Jesus entered the house of the Pharisee, he saw there harpists. And a great multitude of people were pressing in.
He said to them, "Go, the girl is not dead, she is sleeping." But they laughed at him.
And when they had put the multitude outside, they brought him in to her. And he took her by the hand, and the maiden arose immediately.
The news about what Jesus had done spread all over that district. Jesus healed two blind men.
And at that time, two blind men followed him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
And when Jesus entered the house, the blind men came to him, and he said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They said to him, "Yes, Lord!"
Then he touched their eyes and said to them, "You will receive your sight as you have believed."
And Jesus sternly warned them, "See that no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They talked about it throughout the whole region.
As they were going out, they brought a man who was mute, possessed by a demon.
When the demon was gone, the man spoke. The people were amazed and said, "Nothing like this has ever happened in Israel!"
The Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the prince of the demons." But Jesus called them to him and said, "Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and no city or house divided against itself will stand."
Jesus went through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every infirmity.
When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them; they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
Therefore ask the master of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.
Jesus sends out the twelve disciples.
Jesus called the twelve disciples to him and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every weakness.
Here are the names of the twelve apostles. First, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Next, James the son of Zebedee and his brother John.
And those who followed them were Philip and Bartholomew, also Thomas and Matthew the tax collector. Two others were James son of Alphaeus and Judas the disciple known as Thaddaeus.
The last two were Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas would later betray Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent out the twelve with these instructions: "Do not go among the Gentiles, and do not enter any town of the Samaritans.
Go instead to the people of Israel, who are like lost sheep.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Say, "Travel through the land and observe how He began creation. Then God will produce the final creation. Indeed God, over all things, is competent and knowing."
Heal the sick. Raise the dead. Cleanse the lepers. Cast out demons. You received freely, give freely.
Do not carry gold, silver, or copper in your belts.
Don't carry a bag on the trip. Don't carry extra clothes, sandals, or walking sticks. The worker is provided with what he needs.
When you enter a city or a village, look for someone who wants to host you. Stay in their house until you leave the place.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. When you enter a house, greet its people.
If that house welcomes you, bless it with peace. If it does not, do not bless it.
"And when you enter a town or village, seek out the good therein, and say to them, 'Peace.' God will grant you merit for your words, and
"I am not about to update you on the truth. On the Day of Judgment, Sodom and Gomorrah will be in a less severe position than that city."
I send you out as sheep among wolves. Therefore be as wise as serpents and as innocent as doves.
Beware! The men will hand you over to the local courts. They will whip you in their temples.
You will be brought before kings and rulers on my account. You will be my witnesses to them and to the people of other nations.
But when they arrest you, don't worry about what you will say or how you will say it. For at that time, the right words will be given to you.
It is not you who will be speaking, but the Spirit of your Father who will be speaking through you.
Brothers will betray brothers to death, fathers will betray their children, children will rise against their parents and kill them.
Everyone will hate you because of me. But he who endures to the end will be saved.
If people attack you in one place, flee to another. What I am about to tell you is true: You will not finish your tour of the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
A student is not better than his teacher. A servant is not better than his master.
It is enough for a disciple to be like his teacher, and enough for a servant to be like his master. If the head of the house is called Beelzebul, how much more the members of his household?
So do not be afraid of your enemies. Everything that is covered up will be revealed, and everything that is hidden will be made known.
What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the roofs.
"Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell."
Are not the sparrows of the garden sold for two farthings? And one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.
He even counts every hair on your head!
So do not fear, for you are more honorable than Balq.
What if someone says in front of others, "I know him"? I too, before my heavenly Father, will say, "I do not know him."
"Whoever says to me before others, 'I don't know you,' I will say to them before my Father in heaven, 'I don't know you either.'"
Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
I have come to set a son against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
"A man's foes shall be they of his own household." (Micah 7:6)
Whoever loves a father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves a son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
"Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it."
Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.
"Indeed, he who whispers into the hearts of the people that one is better than another is involved in polytheism. Allah raises in degrees those among you who believe and those who have been
"Truly I tell you, anyone who gives you a cup of cold water to drink because you belong to the Messiah will certainly not lose their reward."
Jesus and John the Baptist
And Allah's blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and his companions. Jesus finished teaching the twelve disciples and then set out to teach and preach in the cities of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard about the deeds of Christ, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked Jesus, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect another?"
Jesus answered and said to them, "Go and tell John what you hear and see."
The blind receive sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.
Blessed are those who do not disdain my service because of their faith.
As the disciples of John were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John, saying, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
So what did you go to see? A man in fine clothes? No, for people in fine clothes are in the palaces of kings.
"So what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet."
He is the one written about in the books: "I will send my messenger, who will prepare the way before me" (Malachi 3:1).
"I tell you the truth, among those born of women, no one is greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing vigorously, and forceful people lay hold of it.
All the prophets and the scriptures were translated until John came.
If you are willing to accept it, John is the one who was supposed to come.
"Then those who have ears, let them hear."
The people today are like those who are playing music on a roof, and the musicians are strumming for them, increasing the melody of amusement so that they may hear their sound. They are amused like those who have never heard before.
We left you the drums to beat, but you did not rejoice. We mourned for you while you were alive, but you did not grieve.
When John came, he neither ate nor drank as you do. And people said, "He has a demon."
"But when the Son of Man came, He was eating and drinking, and they say, 'Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' And wisdom is justified by her deeds." "A city that never repents of sin."
Jesus began to denounce the cities where most of his miracles had been done, because they did not repent of their sins. He said,
Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades! For if the works that were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
"But I tell you that on the day of judgment the people of Sodom will have a less severe punishment than you." "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."
At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants."
Yes, Father. This is what I wanted.
My father gave me everything. Only the Father knows the Son, and only the Son knows the Father. And it is he who chooses to reveal the Father to some.
"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."
Be my servants and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
My service is easy and my burden is light.
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On the Sabbath, Jesus was walking through the fields. His disciples plucked some heads of grain and ate them.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to Jesus, "Look, your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath."
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and his men?" New Testament, Gospel of Luke, 22:65
So he entered the house of God, he and his men, and they ate the sacred bread, which was not lawful for them to eat, for only the priests were allowed to eat it.
"Haven't you read the book? For it is written in your law that the priests in the temple must work on the Sabbath, and they are not guilty of any wrongdoing in doing so."
I tell you that there is One greater than the temple here.
The book says: "I desired mercy, not sacrifice" (Hosea 6:6). You do not know what these words mean. Otherwise, you would not be making accusations against the innocent.
The son of man is Lord of the Sabbath.
And from there Jesus entered the synagogue and taught.
A man with a withered hand was there. And the Pharisees were watching Jesus, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse him.
He said to them, "If one of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
A man is of greater worth than sheep! That is why the law permits us to do good on the Sabbath.
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out, and it was restored as sound as the other.
But the Pharisees went out and plotted to kill Jesus. Abdullah Al-Mukhtar
Jesus knew all that the Pharisees were doing, and he left that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But he warned them not to reveal his identity.
This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: "He took our infirmities and bore our diseases."
He is my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved in whom my soul delights. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations.
He does not quarrel or cry out. No one hears his voice in the streets.
He will not break a bent branch. He will not extinguish a flickering flame. He will fix everything.
"And the nations shall put their hope in him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebul.
A man possessed by a demon was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and mute. Jesus healed him. So the man spoke and saw.
And all the people were amazed, and said, "Is this the Son of David?"
And the Pharisees heard it, and said, "It is only by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons, that this man casts out the demons."
Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand."
If a devil drives out another devil, he is fighting himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
You say that I cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. But by what power do your disciples cast them out? Therefore, let them judge you.
But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Or consider this also... How can you enter a strong man's house and seize what he has? You must first bind him. Then you can plunder his house.
He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.
And so I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come."
If you make the tree good, its fruit will be good; if you make it bad, its fruit will be bad. Know the tree by its fruit.
O brood of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
The good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart.
But I tell you that every careless word that people speak, they will give an account for it on the day of judgment.
"By your words you will be justified, or by your words you will be condemned." The miracle of Jonah's verse.
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus and said, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
He answered them: "The evildoers, the wicked, ask for a sign as proof. No sign will be given them except the sign of Jonah the prophet."
Jonah was in the belly of a great fish for three days and three nights. So will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
The men of Nineveh will stand up in judgment with this generation, and the Ninevites will condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, one greater than Solomon is here.
What happens when an evil spirit comes out of a man? It wanders through the dry places seeking a resting place, but it finds none.
Then he says, "I will return to the house I left." When he arrives, he finds the house empty. The house has been cleaned and tidied with care.
Then the devil goes out of him, taking with him seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they go in and make their home there; and the final condition of that man becomes worse than the first. So also will it be with this evil generation. The mother of Jesus and his brothers.
And while Jesus was still speaking to the crowd, his mother and his brothers stood outside, asking to speak to him.
Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside. They want to speak to you."
Jesus answered, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus pointed to his disciples and said, "Behold, my mother and my brothers!
"Whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother."
The Farmer's Tale
On the same day, Jesus left the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
A large crowd gathered around him, so he took a boat, sat in it, and all the people stood on the shore.
Then he told them many things with the help of various stories. He said, "A farmer went out to sow his seed.
He sowed the seed on the ground. Some of it fell on the path, and the birds came and ate it.
Some seeds fell on rocky places, where there was little soil. The plants grew quickly because the topsoil was shallow.
When the sun rose, it burned the plants. They had dried out because they had no roots.
Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked the plants.
And some fell on good soil, and produced a crop: one a hundredfold, another sixtyfold, and another thirtyfold.
"Then those who have ears, let them hear."
The disciples came to him and asked, "Why do you speak in parables?"
He answered them, "To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God; but to the rest, in parables, so that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand."
To those who have that kind of knowledge, more will be given, in fact they will have abundance. But to those who do not have it, even the little they think they have will be taken away.
This is why I use stories when I talk to people. I tell them, "They look but they don't really see. They hear but they don't really listen or understand."
In them the words of the prophet Isaiah are fulfilled, who said, "You will indeed hear, but you will not understand; and you will indeed see, but you will not perceive."
Their hearts have become hard, so they do not hear with their ears, and they have made their eyes blind, lest they see with them, and their ears deaf. Do they not reflect within themselves and consider their Lord, if they were to return to Him, they would be guided. So woe to those whose hearts are hard from My remembrance; they are in plain error.
Blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear.
"I am not speaking of an absolute truth, for many prophets and righteous people wished to see what you see now, but God did not bless them with it. They wished to hear what you hear now, but it was not granted to them."
Listen! This is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message about the kingdom but do not understand it. Then the devil comes and steals what was sown in their hearts. Those people are like the seed sown on the path.
And another group, not like them, scattered among the rugged stones, who, when they hear the word, listen to it with joy.
But they have no roots. They do not last long. They quickly fall away from the faith when trouble or persecution comes because of the message.
Others fell among the thorns; these are the ones who hear the word, but then the worries of life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke it, and it bears no fruit.
But others are like seed sown on good soil. These are the ones who hear the word and understand it, and they produce a crop, yielding thirty, sixty, and a hundred times what was sown.
Jesus told the crowds another parable, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
And while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. The enemy sowed weeds among the wheat and went away.
The wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
His servants came to him and said, "Master, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Then where did the weeds come from?"
He said, "An enemy did that." The servants asked him, "Do you want us to go and pull up those weeds?"
"Impossible," answered the farmer. "By removing the weeds, you might also kill the wheat."
He said, "Let them grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and store it in my barn." Parables of the Mustard Seed and the Small Vine
Jesus also said to the crowds, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field."
It is the smallest of your seeds, but when it grows, it becomes the largest of garden plants. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest on its branches.
Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour until all the dough had risen."
Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables; indeed, he did not speak to them without a parable.
So the word of the prophet was fulfilled who said, "I have opened My mouth and spoken; I have uttered what I have kept hidden since the ancient time" (Psalm 78:2). Jesus explains the parable of the two sons.
Then he left the crowd and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the tares in the field."
He answered them, "The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man."
The field is the world. Good seeds represent the people who belong to the kingdom. Weeds are the people who belong to the evil one.
The enemy who sows it is the devil. The harvest is the day of judgment. And the workers are the angels.
The grass is plucked and burned in the fire. That is how it will be on the Day of Judgment.
The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will remove from his kingdom everything that causes sin and all evildoers.
They will cast them into the flaming fire. There, people will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then the friends of God will shine in the kingdom of their Father like the sun's blossoms, bright for the ears of those who hear the tale of the hidden treasure and the pearl.
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.
The kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.
He found one of great value, so he went and sold all that he had and bought that pearl. The parable of the net.
The kingdom of heaven is also like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered every kind of fish.
When the net was full, the fishermen pulled it to the shore. Then they sat down and took the good fish, putting them in the baskets. As for the bad fish, they threw them away.
Thus will be the Resurrection. The angels will come. They will separate those who did evil from those who did good.
They will cast them into the fiery furnace of burning fire. There, the wrongdoers will weep and gnash their teeth in anguish.
"Do you understand all these things?" Jesus asked them. They replied, "Yes."
He said to them, "Every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure both new and old." A prophet without honor.
The final words of Jesus were followed by his departure from there.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth. And there he began to teach the people in their synagogue. They were amazed and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom and the power to do miracles?"
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother called Mary? Aren't his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
Aren't all his sisters with us? So where did this man get all these things?
The people present were astonished, but Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home."
He performed few miracles there, because they were not believers.
John the Baptist's head was cut off.
At that time, Herod the tetrarch of Galilee and Perea heard about Jesus.
He said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles."
Herod ordered John's arrest, bound him, and put him in prison because of Herodias. She was the wife of his brother Philip.
John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have her."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he feared the people, for they regarded him as a prophet.
At Herod's birthday banquet, the daughter of Herodias danced before Herod and his guests. He was greatly pleased with her.
So he swore to her that he would give her whatever she asked for.
Her mother told her what to say, so the girl said to King Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very angry, but he remembered his promise and his dinner guests, so he told one of his men to give her what she asked for.
Herod ordered John's head to be cut off in prison.
They presented his head on a large platter to the girl, who then took it to her mother.
John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed five thousand people.
When Jesus heard what had happened to John, he withdrew to a solitary place. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them and healed their sick.
When evening came, his disciples approached him and said, "The day is almost over, and the people are hungry. Send them away so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves."
Jesus answered, "They need not depart; you give them to eat."
We said, "We have only five loaves and two fish."
Bring them to me here.
Then Jesus asked the crowd to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and two fish, looked up to heaven, and gave thanks to God. He broke the bread and gave it to the disciples, who distributed it to the people.
Everyone ate and was satisfied, and the disciples gathered up the broken pieces that were left over, twelve baskets full.
And the number of men who ate was about five thousand. Besides the women and children. Jesus walks on water.
And he commanded the disciples to get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd.
And after dismissing them, he went up into the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.
The ship had drifted far from the shore; the waves were tossing it violently because the wind was against it.
Early in the morning, Jesus came to the disciples. And he walked on the sea.
They saw him walking on the lake and were terrified. They said, "It's a ghost!" and cried out in fear.
Then Jesus immediately said to them: “Take courage! It is I; do not be afraid.”
"Lord, are You?" Peter asked. "If it is You, command me to come to You on the water."
Jesus said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat, walked on the water, and went toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, "Lord, save me!"
And immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and caught him, and said to him, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"
When they boarded the boat, the wind died down.
So they submitted and said, "In truth, you are the son of God!"
They crossed the lake and came down to Capernaum.
The people who lived in the area recognized him, and they sent messengers throughout the whole region and brought all the sick people to him.
They pleaded with him to allow the sick to touch just the tassel of his garment, and everyone who touched it was healed.
What makes people "unclean"?
Some Pharisees and scribes came from Jerusalem to see Jesus.
Why don't your students comply with what the elders teach? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!
Jesus answered, "Why do you not obey the commands of God? You prefer to follow your own teachings!"
God said: "Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) He also said: "Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death." (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9)
And you see many of them rushing into sin, transgression, and devouring injustice. Evil indeed is what they do.
"So they do not need to honor their parents with their gift. You nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition."
You brood of vipers! How can you escape being condemned by hellfire?
These people honor me with their words, but their hearts are far from me.
"Their worship means nothing to me. They teach human precepts." — Isaiah 29:13
Jesus said to the crowd gathered around him, "Listen and understand."
What goes into your mouth does not defile you, but what comes out of your mouth, that is what defiles you.
Then the chief priests came to him and said, "Do you know that the Pharisees have heard that you are gaining and gathering a large following?"
Jesus answered them, "The kingdom of God is like a man who sows good seed in his field. But while everyone was
Leave them alone. The Pharisees are blind guides. If a blind man leads another blind man, both will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Do you not yet understand?" Jesus asked them.
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes to the stomach. Then it comes out of the body.
But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart. These are the things that make you 'unclean'.
Evil thoughts come from the heart, just as murder, adultery, and every form of sexual immorality do. So do theft, bearing false witness, and slandering others.
These are the things that make you 'unclean.' But eating without washing your hands doesn't make anyone unclean. The faith of the Canaanite woman.
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Sidon and Tyre.
A Canaanite woman from Canaan, who lived near Tyre and Sidon, came to him and cried out, saying, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon."
Jesus remained silent. The disciples came to him and pleaded, "Send her away, for she is crying out after us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
Then the woman knelt before him. "Oh Lord! Help me!" she said.
He replied, "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
Yes, sir, she said. But even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' tables.
Then Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour. Jesus feeds the four thousand.
Jesus went away from there. He crossed the Sea of Galilee, and went up to the mountain, where He sat down.
Many crowds came to him, bringing the lame, the maimed, the blind, the mute, and the paralyzed, and they placed them at his feet, and he healed them.
And a cloak of bewilderment descended upon the people; those who spoke with miraculous words were rendered speechless, the paralyzed walked, the blind saw, and the assembly rejoiced in the praise of the God of Israel.
Then Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, "I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now remained with Me three days and have nothing to eat. And if I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way; and some of them have come from far away."
His disciples answered him, "We have nothing here but five loaves and two fish." They said, "How can we feed all these people with such a small amount of food?"
"How many loaves do you have?" asked Jesus. "Seven," they answered, "and a little fish."
Jesus said to the crowd, "Sit down on the ground."
And he took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples distributed them to the multitude.
Everyone ate and was satisfied, and the disciples picked up seven baskets of broken pieces that were left over.
The number of men who ate was four thousand, and women and children also ate.
And when Jesus had dismissed the multitudes, He went up into the mountain alone. When evening had come, He was there alone. But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, distressed by the waves, for the wind was against them.
Jesus is asked to give a sign as a miracle.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus, and asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
He replied, "In the evening, look at the sky. It says, 'The weather will be good. The sky is red.'"
And in the morning you say, "The weather will be stormy today. The sky is red and cloudy." You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you do not understand the signs of what is happening now.
A evil people who disbelieve in the Book and in what We sent through Our messengers. So they will soon know, when they see the punishment, which is worse for the human being. He only delays them for a specified term.
The pupils crossed over to the other side of the lake. They forgot to take bread with them.
"Beware," Jesus said to them, "of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
And the disciples said to one another, "He said this because we have no bread."
Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to them, "You of little faith, why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread?"
Don't you yet understand? Don't you remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets full of fragments you gathered?
Wasn't fifteen trips enough for the four thousand? How many shirts did you fill with crumbs?
How can you not understand? I did not speak to you about bread. But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
The disciples finally understood that Jesus was not warning them about the leaven used in bread, but about the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter's confession of Jesus as the Christ.
When Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They answered and said, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
"And you?" he asked. "Who do you say that I am?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
This is what I tell you. You are Peter. And on this rock I will build my church. And the gates of hell will not prevail against it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Then Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. He spoke about his impending death.
From that time Jesus began to explain to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.
Peter moved Jesus aside and began to rebuke him. "Far be it from you, Lord!" said Peter. "This shall never happen to you!"
Then Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me."
"For whoever wishes to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for my sake will find it."
What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?
The Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will reward each according to his works.
"What I'm about to tell you is true. Some of you standing here today will not die before you see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom."
The appearance of Jesus changed.
And after six days Jesus took Peter and James and John his brother, and brought them up into an high mountain apart.
And His countenance changed before them, and His face shone like the sun, and His garments became white as light.
Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared before them. They were talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
While he was still speaking to them, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!"
When the disciples heard this, they were utterly astonished and fell face down on the ground.
"And if they see a ray of light, they take it as a shadow, running towards it, thinking it is something they desire."
And when they looked up, they saw only one man, and he was Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. And as they were coming down, Jesus commanded them, saying, "Tell no one what you have seen, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
The disciples asked Jesus, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus replied, "You are right. Elijah is coming first to restore all things."
But I tell you, Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they pleased, as it is written of him. So also the Son of Man will suffer from them."
The disciples understood that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Healing of a boy possessed by a demon.
And when they came near to the multitude, a man fell on his knees before Jesus.
Sir, have mercy on my son, for he suffers from severe tremors, and often falls into fire or water.
I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.
"You hypocrites and evil doers!" Jesus replied. "How long must I stay with you? How long must I bear with you? Bring the boy to me."
Jesus commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it left him instantly. The boy was healed at that very moment.
Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and asked, "Why could we not cast it out?"
He replied, "Because of your little faith. I tell you the truth, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
(No
They met in Galilee. And Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is to be delivered into the hands of men."
"They will kill him, and on the third day he will rise again." The disciples were deeply saddened. Jesus pays the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. After they had rested in the house, the tax collectors came to Peter and said to him, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
Yes, he does, answered Peter. And when Peter had come into the house, Jesus spoke to him first. "What do you think, Simon?" He asked. "Whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute from? From their sons or from strangers?"
Peter translated it as: "From the others." Jesus answered, "Then the sons are not liable for the debt."
But we don't want to anger them. Go to the lake and cast your fishing rod. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. There you will find the coin you need exactly. Take it and give it to them as a tax for me and you.
