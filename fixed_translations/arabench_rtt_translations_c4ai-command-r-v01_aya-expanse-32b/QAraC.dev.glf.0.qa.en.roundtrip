He refuses to develop himself and improve those around him.

And you are very hungry.
Will you eat or not?
No, I will eat.
Did he accept it?
Your husband is too old to accept that.
I've had enough of him.
It's our chance, our cars are old for embarrassment.
Try to talk to him, please.
These things are common and normal.
Stupid! Lacks self-confidence.
He, is he afraid?
What really bothers me
Is he the one responsible for the budget?
What is this project that he is managing?
It's a massive government project.
It's hidden at the bottom.
I have the right to take the money.
Do you work in another ministry?
Mama, how could you forget!
And today in the garage.
It means I will do it.
Consider me in!
It's equivalent to me not benefiting from anything.
Won't I get anything?
This means I'm involved too.
We're all supposed to take.
This is a government project.
But your foolish son will not understand.
I will talk to him.
The good that you are rejecting
This is a government project.
This is your chance.
As others do precisely.
The precious feast is before you.
Take your share.
He has only one riyal in his pocket.
I heard it myself.
It is known that government projects
The last third is plunder.
Salih's son
He went to Souq Waqif.
A single lantern cost him eighteen riyals.
They valued it in the budget at the price of
At a cost of one hundred and eighty riyals each.
They said we didn't do anything wrong.
You will get tired of it.
"And hold fast to Allah, He is..."
Yes, but I think he changes his mind.
God willing, my God.
He is the president and everything is in his hands.
Most importantly, don't forget us.
We are your friends.
We have to be together.
A government project like this is considered an opportunity.
Sure, Ali!
We can't do that without you.
Don't worry, Ali!
And with God's will, all those included in the project.
Of course
Yesterday, I was talking with our friends.
From your side
We are not worried because you are members of the project committee.
Concerned about Saleh, the project manager.
They say that
Don't worry, Ali.
And tell your friends not to worry.
Truly, O Abu Fahd?
This is good news.
But, Saud, don't forget.
No, no
Inshallah, everything will be alright.
Let Saleh agree to that first.
I'll take care of it.
I wondered if I would get some advantage.
Is this possible?
Then you are a partner in the project because you work with us in the same department.
But the most important thing is to keep it a secret between us.
And you found a plate of rice and meat in front of you.
I will do it.
Bahanmak
What's wrong with you!
If you remain so oblivious,
It's not going to work.
That thing isn't going to work.
Questions or inquiries?
Happy to help.
How will we get our share?
Or is it logical?
What do we call it!
We are not the only ones who will take them.
Every participant will demand their share.
Why not!
Don't be afraid, Saleh.
We're the ones who will set the budget.
And what is the news about the land he bought today?
Did he just find it, too?
No one can afford to buy it.
Where did you get this information?
Call me today.
Because my brother's phone was turned off.
I said: "What happened?"
Tell your brother.
that the other earth
The one next to the land he bought yesterday.
The sale has been approved.
Please call him to see if he wants it, I'll book it for him.
He doesn't want to share the money with us.
And what about our money?
We are considered participants with him.
Even if we weren't participating!
You eat a big bite by yourself.
Honor your brother and your mother with at least something.
I'm not here to beg you.
We are also participants in the project, we have the right to ask for our share.
Tell her, tell her.
It's true that when Sultan came and asked for his share, he refused.
But I didn't agree with him.
You have to give him a share of the project.
Phase one.
I am no less than anyone.
Project Committee Members
I heard him addressing them.
They admit their brothers and friends.
I know that government projects are open to anyone.
We want a limited amount of money and it's done.
Equity capital
Let his brother, the Sultan, attend the committee meetings if he wishes.
Because it appears that the committee members
Project budget
But we want
Thank you.
Yes, Abu Saleh.
Your husband!
You will love him.
It will benefit the project.
We remind ourselves.
We divided the tasks, did we fix it?
You, O Saleh
I'll be responsible for the cement, bricks, and concrete.
And I'll handle everything related to water and electricity.
Oh people!
Take your share.
I, swear to God,
Sometimes I decide to take some money.
And I sometimes say
Give me a percentage.
No problem, Saleh, no problem.
Take what you want however you like.
The most important thing,
We too
Thus during this week.
Everyone specifies the amount of money they want to get.
For example,
After a few days, they changed their minds.
And he asked for another hundred thousand.
Knowledge, it's power!
What do you think?
I agree.
Even the participants,
Focus on your looting work, and ignore him.
And there is also the wealth of orphans.
Add to the budget.
Many people want to eat.
Who does he think he is?
What is this! Is it your father's project!
Yes, he is a sultan.
Ah! Oh brother! Ah! Oh ruler!
He is a participant.
Is it a nickname?
Your friend Saud lists a lot of names.
He continues adding names, saying: "Let's do good to them."
So in which group do I add it, the percentage or the amount of money?
No, put it with the beggars.
How much would you like to allocate to him! Put twenty thousand for him.
Yes, that's enough.
They even add a note here saying
He is our neighbor.
But Saud's list is longer than Abdulaziz's list.
Everyone will be seen as part of the first stage's destiny.
As one whole, no one will notice it.
Yes, there's also the list that my mom sent.
Every two hours, you call and add people without asking.
Haha, may she live long.
Apple of my eye, my son.
Have mercy on her, she is sick and poor.
But the woman has no money.
"May God cover you, I told you this is the last one."
Tell him it's a liver transplant.
What! Yes, wait, wait... How much do you need?
How much is enough to buy a liver and stay in the hospital!
Around one hundred and eight thousand riyals.
How many livers will you transplant!
One, but expensive my sister.
Yes, please, write her name on the list.
Hussaina, yes yes Hussaina daughter of Hilal
Are you giving her your own money!
Reassure him and tell him that I'm not accepting anything from phase two.
Yes, one hundred and eighty thousand riyals.
Oh man! They're going to replace her liver with a new one.
Tell him, tell him to add two thousand, I want to buy gifts for my daughters.
2000
"A thousand for you"
Yes, Hassnaa is the daughter of Hilal.
Can I embarrass you in front of your friends!
No, Mother.
I have a lot of work.
Then, I'll call you later.
Those who eat from the feast have increased.
The infrastructure is capable of bearing the load.
Do not forget me.
Write the number you want.
I don't know.
You decide.
I am the chairman of the board.
And I say that you deserve a million.
They decide that the project will start tomorrow.
And they will pay us continuously.
How much! We want to know!
They will give it all to us at once or in parts.
Why does she get more than us?
Either an electric shock or looting, it doesn't matter, the important thing is to keep quiet, we are waiting for them and they are coming.
He commanded you to stop talking, so be silent now.
Don't be embarrassed.
If you hear someone speaking
I will sew his mouth shut.
Stay long, very long.
Learn that this is about money, not an easy matter.
What was the price before?
Fifty million
It seems you're taking quite a big bite.
You are the president after all.
We don't want any headaches.
We approve the budget.
Mr. Saleh, we listened to your presentation about the project and noted that it is a blessed and very important project.
And not just for this generation
Yes yes
Tomorrow, the first phase of the project will be inaugurated.
We would like to thank you for your presence and congratulate you once again.
And I welcome you.
On this occasion
United Nations
Where to? To the project.
Where are we then!
I don't know where we are.
I'm bored.
Don't you see that the officials have spoken and the people have applauded them?
We are at the official opening, what's your order?
Alright, they've spoken now, which means we're in the project.
Yes, we are in the project.
People are yawning.
And as for these divisions, I do not know what they have placed within them.
Leave the box alone.
These sections are the infrastructure.
The official opening of %pw International Beaches
What has happened to you, third millennium?
Frankly, I don't know.
Yes, praise be to God, old age is a disease.
I wish I knew why they isolated me.
He's just parking his car.
I found this visit strange.
But when she told me
No one told me anything.
I saw it with my own eyes, there's a big farm over there.
Praise be to God, you are comfortable.
You get fat while relaxing at home.
Why tire yourself, my love? Don't think about anyone, you're radiant.
Thank God, Munira, that you found brothers like Rashid ibn Saad and Saqir.
Mind your own business and invest in it.
Look at my friend Hessa.
Her brothers don't give her a single riyal from her father's inheritance.
We do not act in this manner.
This is your legal right.
This is a matter of trust... Don't you trust us!
I don't know.
I'm not satisfied with what my brother, Rashid, said.
He always reminds me of the check they get for me every three months.
Just my right.
He always tells me.
Don't you trust us?
Wealth and inheritances must be clear.
If you are not satisfied, dear.
You know what it does to people.
And the mother of Salman is a role model for you, O poor lady.
Who would believe she inherited millions?
Because of her brothers.
Money destroys people.
But it is their right, due to the prices they set for their goods.
So, what's next?
We run the company.
Investment in land, real estate, and money
No problems, no headache.
She said she was passing by the land, in the desert.
This is more than enough for her.
I'm afraid that her husband, Nasser, is the one who did that.
What's the problem?
Your sister has started searching.
That is the problem.
You're planning to get us into trouble.
It is our good nature to give her the money.
Calm down, Falcon.
We must find a solution to this matter! O Rashid
In my head
What is this?
My share of my father's inheritance
The charity they give me every three months.
Everything is clear.
Forty thousand is no longer there.
As if they don't invest money.
I see, I see, I see, I see
Clear
Clear.
They said, "Add more to it, perhaps she will be happy and stop asking."
Correct, everything you said is correct.
They give me a little each time.
If you only saw their women.
Abounds with diverse collections of diamond jewelry.
And I do not have half of what they have.
They don't think I deserve my father's inheritance.
If you seek it.
Your right
Legal and legitimate right
I feel like they're stealing from me and lying to me.
I don't feel comfortable with the way they behave.
Life is surprising, oh dear.
They tire me out, they make me sick, oh! My beloved
Do they not know that there is a judgment and punishment there?
And Allah will reward them according to what they used to invent.
And beware of mentioning anything about the court to them, dear!
They will be happy.
Is it because of our high population?
Therefore, I say to you, my beloved.
Calm down.
Everyone has an apartment that looks like a skyscraper.
I only want my right.
I want to build a mosque before I die.
Give charity to the poor.
Um Salama
Lower your voice, dear!
And don't mention anything about the court to them.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
You know why!
Now
Her rights are stolen.
You were asking the accountant questions.
Who are you!! to ask him.
Answer them!
Yes, I am... No, no, I'm here for your sister.
The door through which I entered.
Do not frown.
Do you know which door I entered through?
No, no
No falcon
What makes you happy, is a loss!
Manar, don't get yourself into trouble.
If you want your share of the company and properties, that doesn't bother us.
Six hundred thousand
She was content throughout her life.
I'm sure he's her evil husband.
How kind she is!
As if I'm begging them.
It is a well-known and established legal principle.
He tells me it's either six hundred thousand or nothing.
Not fair
Wait for everything, Munia!
My father's company.
Eight buildings.
Livestock is a fundamental pillar.
He said it was only six hundred thousand.
By signing the waiver document
No, Munira!
Don't be fooled and sign this paper, be careful, I advise you.
It's your right to know everything about the lands, the money, and everything else; it's not in their hands.
But the company,
You are a partner
You've just been fired from the company.
No one can stop me.
I know what?
Is it your company?
Don't you see him gnashing his teeth?
Let me in, I'll tell you.
Leave it, there's no need for it.
He has a paper that I don't know what it is.
He's screaming in our faces, make him shut up.
His age is
My brother Saad went to the office and explained the matter to them, as they didn't know.
Enter
Would Mr. Nasser like to drink something?
Please come in.
Without a doubt %pw
It will get us into trouble.
He will discover the extent of her being.
We will be found to owe her four hundred thousand, not forty thousand.
Let's do the calculations.
In 96 months
Here lies the problem, multiplied by three hundred and sixty times.
11,520,000
No problem, then?
Let him do what he can.
Frankly, I'll tell him.
Our money
Inherited by those who inherit the earth and people whenever anyone dies.
Hello, welcome to your company, ignore what happened.
Welcome
This is the accountant, Samir.
Mr. Nasser wants to know everything.
The whole company is under your control.
If you want to come in, please do, don't ask for permission for anything.
Thank you.
Count on me.
Go and get him, take him with you.
To access all files
Supposed to take more than ten million.
They didn't mention that until...
She used to say she was poor.
That her father left.
Four buildings.
I thought they had three lands.
Every land is greater than the other.
"Glorified and Exalted is He, and He is the Helper, O my son."
What they're doing isn't fair.
Don't leave them alone.
What can I do, O Mother of Salman?
I must sue them, there are no other options.
He will quickly glance through some papers.
The case was postponed.
Beware, my son! O Nasser
Don't mention anything about the court.
Oh! Madam, you're here, the doctor is looking for you.
Rise up, O Mother of Salman.
Go to your room.
And all Muslim patients
He didn't tell me.
Excuse me, who is speaking?
Ah, now I remember you, yes yes I remember you.
Yes yes yes yes
About what, brother!
It doesn't matter, thank you.
Now that he knows we have money, he's gone crazy.
Do you think that this Abdullah whom I sent to them can...
Is he a close friend of Rashid?
He has known him well for years.
Can you believe it, Munira?
Even Abdullah, he gave me some advice.
Follow them.
Don't leave them alone.
Try to take as many as you can.
Do you know what Abdullah is telling me?
Not for people who live seventy or eighty years.
Directed at those who will live two hundred years or more.
Mother of Salma, may God have mercy on her.
God have mercy on her soul, she used to say
Our population has not reached four hundred thousand.
And the case will take ten years, and even more.
Do we have to be *mummified* before we consult the court?
That's it.
Yes, dear, are you sitting with them?
Good luck
An old friend from school
Life is short.
And I ask for benefit for you.
And you come from a large and well-known family.
And their spirits intertwine with ours deeply.
Please, Rashid, we are friends.
Please go while I'm still calm.
Or you will be beaten.
Stay away from me and forget about friendship.
Are you going out or what?
He paid one hundred and twenty-nine thousand dollars for a diamond jewelry set at the jewelry exhibit.
Where did she get all this money from?
They spend their money on their women.
He deprives his sister of her money.
Do you have hope, Nasser?!
They fought with you.
When I spoke with him yesterday in the mosque.
Just let me do what I told you.
Well-known people with deep roots
Perhaps, let it be.
But, I also advise
O Allah, bless this conversation among these bright faces.
O Allah, enlighten our hearts with that which is good for our life and our hereafter.
You, listen.
If you have anything to say besides the matter of my sister's share.
True
You must leave quickly or you will receive a painful beating.
What matters to me is what you say.
I wished for you for months, but you refused.
What matters to me.
I will go tomorrow morning.
Give it to me.
Hello, hello
Don't listen to her.
You will not go to court.
The day after tomorrow
We'll give you a chance to see what you'll do.
Goodbye
Kindness will not benefit them.
And they realized that their future lay in escaping his command.
We'll see what they decide.
Saud, are you busy tomorrow?
I've decided to take legal action against them.
Tomorrow we visit her.
What is this?
You are right.
You asked why.
She wants to go to court and sue us.
To receive your inheritance
Yes, I did that.
Your life will be sweet.
Your life would be perfect.
Why did I tell you that we want to travel after tomorrow?
Upon arrival, first park your car in the parking lot.
You will see the security guards.
Go up to the eighth floor.
The judges are here on this floor.
All business cards of lawyers in the country
You'll definitely need them.
Come here to mock us.
We want her to initiate legal proceedings against us.
Go to the court.
Listen to Manar.
And fill a waiver ```
What is good?
Know the way
We have shown you the way.
Let's go, brother.
I forgot to give Mona something important.
Al Raya Newspaper Today
There is a very good article on this subject.
It was written by a woman, I think she's a doctor.
I want you to take a look at it, as a gift *from me*.
It was necessary to change his residence.
How foolish!
He has four sons, but his home is unhappy.
There is no doubt that it will be so, for he risked all his wealth.
He ventured in this project.
It was never Bo and Waleed that I expected to start a business.
Eat, eat, you children of the new merchant, Bou and Walid.
My love, do you want me to prepare something for you to eat?
No, I'm fine.
Get up and move, get yourself some fruit.
Mom, I want Hamood's toy.
Between my houses
My son Waleed put some candy out for your uncle.
Congratulations, Waleed, on the project! You deserve it.
My friends found me an excellent accountant.
Thank you, thank you, my son.
Oh father, when we become big merchants, I want to have my own room.
Look what he asked for, he has no ambition, my dear son.
Okay, I'll get you a large BlackBerry.
Forget their wishes now.
As with all people.
Instead of our miserable little house
First, let's pay off all our debts, then we'll see.
You look very happy, Bou Walid.
He eats more than before.
He is a merchant, fortune favors him.
With all my hair, my father is the merchant.
Blessings to the project.
Leave some for my friends.
God willing, God will protect you.
I met a Japanese young man, he was among them.
When we were sitting, I swapped places with him, and he gave me a catalog.
After that, one of my friends saw her.
He said, "It's an opportunity."
Multi-purpose halls?
Always like this
They are computer labs.
Click on the cinema.
If you want a playground ..
This is magic.
They all said yes, they were amazed.
I borrowed from the bank, some money from my relatives, and sold a piece of land of mine, praise be to God.
Now, with the committee's approval,
Why didn't you request it since the ministry approved it?
Then an email is sent to the factory.
He will contact you upon his arrival.
There is rosemary tea.
Nothing, I'm still waiting in Ali's office.
The secretary did not pray with my brother.
And I'm absent for ten days.
It's a matter of luck.
My papers are ready.
The committee approved it.
Why don't you sign it?
Aren't you a fully empowered director?
Why don't you go to him to get him to sign for you?
I told you he can't.
Not just him, all the staff there do the same thing.
Appearance can be deceiving at times.
You should thank God.
I was there trying to get the signature, and I was anxious.
Have you finished?
How can I finish that when Bou Fahd never shows up?
What can I do?
After that, I'll lose my money.
I want him to sign as soon as possible so that it's over, I don't know what to do.
I'm afraid the manager might ask you about me.
Tell him I am sick, what?
I myself am waiting.
You say that and you're his secretary, so what about us?
And give me your mobile phone number.
"She's not the secretary, please have a seat, it's not hers, what's the matter?"
Don't call, you're scaring people, they thought it was the secretary.
No, we're still waiting for Abu Fahd.
The bathroom renovation cost me a lot, more than %pw.
He is funny.
Hey! People, wait, wait!
Quiet, quiet,
He told you to be quiet, enough, shut up.
Bu Fahad has to go to the airport.
How did he leave?
A glance at him beside the car before he left.
What's his problem?
May God help you.
Abu Fahd waited.
Do not blame your father, my joy.
He behaves in a strange way.
And if he does not receive the goods
He won't be able to get his money back.
And now she needs him.
Where is he now?
What are you looking for?
He is here in front of you.
You call me in the middle of the night.
Brother, I have told you.
I have told you.
The matter is out of my hands, my daughter.
I know, father, but it is not fair.
Studies will start at the university next week.
If I don't enroll, I'll have to wait until the next semester.
Three months would be a waste of time.
Oh my darling, I'm trying.
Don't you see that I go to the ministry every day?
Wait until Abu Fahd arrives, Abu Fahd.
And I'll stay at home.
Do you not understand?
Don't call me during lunchtime.
This is the fourth time you've called me.
Are you stupid?
I know you need the money.
It is hoped, however, that Bu Fahd will sign the papers this week.
And they will pay him the first installment.
I tell you, sister, I don't know.
He woke up in terror.
He walks and talks to himself all night long while asleep.
If Bu Fahd doesn't sign,
May God help him.
Therefore,
Bu Fahad is required to sign this paper this week.
What is he waiting for?
He attends work once.
And he traveled in the year.
And he abandoned interest in the welfare of the people.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. How did this happen?
Do you feel better now?
Shattering me into pieces
This strange fever is dragging me and pulling me along.
What does he want?
I heard that I'm going to the ministry.
To process my papers.
He told the staff that he would teach me a lesson.
The time period is about to end.
Give me the phone, give me the phone.
He is Bu Fahd's secretary.
I want to tell you about
Tomorrow, Bu Fahd will come, for sure.
As soon as I call you
Come without any need to enter any procedures.
In the name of
You were never that kind of person.
I'm talking to you.
And your eyes on your mobile phone screen.
I said it was a tragedy.
To feel responsible
And if you pledge yourself
I'll take you back to your department.
Fifteen boxes of printing paper
Fifteen boxes of printing paper
The situation mourns him.
The manager punishes him.
By bringing him along with us
Have you heard about the factory?
He will lose his money if they don't sign his papers today.
If he goes and the manager finds out.
Yes, of course, tell me.
What if the manager asks about him?
We'll take care of that, just let him go.
Bu Waleed
I'll go, but I'm expecting a phone call.
Tell me
May God help him.
Wait, people, wait, people, wait!
How can I know where he's going?
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Do not move.
Don't sit.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't go to work.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Let's go look for him in Uzbekistan.
Room by room
Alley after alley

Call the hospital, quickly.
Don't call the hospital.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
I spent my whole life as a runner, from many years ago until today.
Oh, Abu Saeed, we haven't seen you in a long time.
What were you thinking?
He may be around fourteen years old.
Sent
A very annoying headache.
And sweating without air conditioning in past years.
Do you think riding a bike was ever easy?
With a yellow mark
Those were very hard days, Abu Saeed!
Woe, my son!
"And upon us is only [the duty of] clear transmission [of the message], [O] son of Adam."
Bu Saad
Alright, excuse me gentlemen, the manager has arrived as he said, let's go and get to work.
The manager has arrived. What a beauty! Let's go.
Congratulations, Bou Said.
They said your son Khalid has been appointed.
What I told you
I told you, God willing.

I told you, when my last son graduates, I'll resign.
Graduated and got a job.
Praise be to God, I will finish my work.
Served suitably
Thank God.
Change your mind, oh! Ya Bu Saeed
You deserve it.
Many thanks, Abu Abdulaziz.
Many thanks, Abu Abdulaziz.
Hey, you
We did our duty.
Let them continue the journey.
Your right
After all this age and work
And all of them are racing towards the swiftly moving chariot.
Rest, O Abu Saeed.
After I leave here, my wife calls me.
Celebrating my retirement
A coffee pot and dates, how beautiful.
When will we finish, my son?
You are in a hurry because of the khanafresh, O Abu Saeed!
Don't worry.
Ready-to-eat donuts
Coming, certainly, goodbye.
I told you the khanfroush is ready, waiting for me.
I'll finish all your paperwork now.
Your chance to introduce him is today.
He told me that their manager would travel.
I'm not in the mood.
I don't want to move ever again.
Send it with someone else.
Now you are officially free.
Thank you.
Now, you can rest freely.
Thank you very much, Abu Abdulaziz! Goodbye.
Congratulations to me.
No more work.
That means you're free, dad.
Okay, please, Dad.
Yes, Human Resources
Thank you, goodbye.
Zahr is throwing a party to celebrate her son's success in the exams.
She is making a cake.
I can't.
I sent my father myself to handle some paperwork.
The flower will get angry.
Okay, I'm going.
My father left work.
May God help him now.
He has done enough, let him rest.
Let him rest.
He asked me to cook some khonafrush.
I prepared it.
And I waited for him,
Fear God and have mercy on your father.
Your turn now.
He will eat it tomorrow.
He wants rest.
You've tired this old man out.
As soon as he came back
He was tired.
Don't trouble me about them (it suffices).
Don't trouble me about them (it suffices).
I wanted to drop off these documents at the bank on my way to work.
He said that he would punish anyone who was late.
Sure, my love.
Go to your work.
From this nose, and those little Chinese eyes, goodbye.
Bu Said
Sends you every day to a place.
As you wish, Mother Saeed.
A smell wafts.
There's something in my nose.
Snake oil salesman
Why did you go to the central bank?
No, father, take it to the market branch.
And go there.
Are you sure? I don't want to go there and they tell me he's not here.
And thus peace.
The sunlight struck me.
Hot sun
I entered my neighbor's house.
The housekeeper recognized me.
What's wrong with you?
What compelled you to do that?
No, Mother Saeed, I can't eat the khonafrosh now.
Mom, where's Dad?
Back and forth
She didn't tell him which bank to go to.
They told him that some of the papers were missing.
She asked him to take a taxi.
Mama, we met with the director.
How is my father now, does he feel better?
I napped a bit, and the headache is gone now.
Tell him about it.
Leave your father alone to rest.
The mother of Sa'id mourns for them.
They must adhere to their duties, they will be evaluated, what can they do?
As you like it
Bu Shahin
You could say I retired, but I didn't retire.
How did this happen?
Before, previously
Misery written upon me.
Your children are mature.
I have to help them.
They said to me
You are wrong.
Do you think all young people who lost their fathers don't finish their personal tasks?
It depends on the job.
Some jobs allow you to go out to run your personal errands.
May God reward you with good.
I'm close to you, at the coffee shop behind you.
Where are you heading, Abu Shuhayn?
I'll finish some paperwork, for my son, Saeed.
In this ministry, which is located next to this cafe.
I will direct him to the land departments.
Goodbye
What's bothering you, Mom? Okay, I'll see you later, goodbye.
This won't help you.
I warn you.
I heard you say that to Saeed.
Your father is sick.
I don't care about you.
If your father doesn't complain
He falls silent.
And he doesn't talk about her.
You have wearied him, fear God.
Your loud scream woke me up from my sleep.
Father, you worked in the government agency and know well what storage means.
And they wrote this first %pw %pw
And now they are doing it like this.
Tomorrow is the last day for loans at the Development Bank.
No, no, who said that?
Present, my son.
I believed his lie.
He says he has an inventory committee meeting tomorrow.
What are you complaining about!
As you like it.
Go now to accomplish his work.
Nothing, nothing
He has been silent since he returned home.
He doesn't answer me.
You have no shame whatsoever.
I don't blame your father for being angry with you.
If you agree to this
"Help often and may God reward you generously."
He was supposed to call you.
Why is he calling his servant?
You are the most honorable in our eyes, O father.
And we are grateful to you.
Forgive him, please.
Let me discipline him.
From now on, my father.
And relax.
"Khunfuroosh, Khunfuroosh" (Singing)
Thank you...
Your satisfaction, O Father!
May God reward you with good.
We decided that from now on,
We will prepare our files ourselves.
Many thanks to everyone, may God reward you, praise be to God.
But Dad, please!
These printed documents are considered the highest.
But I can't.
Call me now.
Father, I will not go to the meeting; I detest meeting the minister.
The minister will be angry with you.
No, no, no, this can't happen. You can't upset the minister. You must leave, even before him.
I won't go any further, what can I say, I don't want to bother you.
Don't say that.
Your papers are with me, consider them done.
He will be on your way when you finish Saeed's papers.
Balism, my father.
Consider it the last leaf you finish for me.
I was happy to serve you, father.
But your son is supposed to sign this paper.
Do you mean I should come back tomorrow to give it to you?
I advise you to return it today.
And if they don't see the documents?
You will have to wait for two months.
I won't give it to him to sign, and I'll bring it back to you.
No, no, no, no need.
Call him and ask him to come for just a minute or two.
I will do it.
Don't you know Saeed?
No, he's on vacation.
And return after sunset.
All our friends are there.
Every time I ask a friend, "Where are you?"
He is said to be with Saeed.
I'm waiting for the work day to end.
Okay, man.
Why did you come to complete your papers yourself?
Why didn't you send your sons?
Don't you have any sons?
Are you alright, sir?
Be so kind, sir, as to take them.
Many thanks
It's of no use.
I will leave you.
And go to the nursing home.
I don't want to tell them where I'm going.
What will you tell them, Abu Saeed?
I will write something else.
Yes, praise be to God.
He got out of prison yesterday.
She's not really my sister.
Why be stubborn?
I told him: "Never appear on television or radio."
These talks about "fighting corruption" are putting us in a bind.
God guides him to the straight path.
Okay sister, goodbye, may God bless you.
Did he go to prison?
I was absent.
What can I tell you?
He said the program is called "Mileas", I think.
Spoke to the man.
Khalid Jassem
And he commanded him to stop the corruption.
His colleagues heard him.
He started talking about the government.
And even oil and money
I don't know what happened to him.
None of his friends
Those who encouraged him to do that,
He left it.
May God guide him to the straight path.
Excuse me now because I have to go cook.
Welcome anytime.
Come, my son.
Sit here.
Stop corruption, my son.
I'm tired and bored.
I've been in the hospital for two days.
You don't deserve this, Mom.
I'm sorry to know that this has happened.
I didn't tell you this.
What is it, Mother?
And he screamed.
This link
May God guide you this time.
I warn you.
Don't worry, Mom.
There's no need to talk about him.
Halting Unlawful Gain
Why did the manager fire the employee?
This is very sad, after all these years, you are deporting me!
Don't listen.
Halting Unlawful Gain
Another one, please.
Yes, correct.
You are a reasonable man.
Those who follow and criticize public affairs.
Well-informed
We will soon be able to do without two or three employees.
And you are one of them.
There's nothing personal.
Agreed, goodbye.
A good brother
I hope your uncle, Manira's father, doesn't find out.
Angry with you before.
Who will know him?
If he asks you
Tell him that I'm working.
I told you they were going to fire him, didn't I?
I asked his mother and she said he was still working.
Of course
His mother said that day.
What can we do with him now?
We cannot let our daughter suffer with him.
What you see as right.
I'll give him two weeks.
But, if he doesn't find a job, I'll sue him for divorcing my daughter.
Drink your coffee.
Don't wander around me unless you have something in mind.
Frankly,
I want to go out.
You are banned from flying.
I know you desire death.
Go to the coffee shop.
To talk nonsense.
Go to your room and sleep.
And look for a job tomorrow morning.
God willing, I will wake up early.
Mother, I told you, I've gotten rid of this habit.
Swear
I'm a little bit bored, Mama.
Don't talk nonsense.
Browse like a deaf person
He changed it.
What happened, man? Where's your voice? Why aren't you speaking as you used to?
We want to hear some of your speeches against corruption.
Halting unlawful gain
Halting Unlawful Gain
Salih is here!
He must be sleeping.
Did my son do something wrong?
We just saw him at the café.
What did he say?
Doing the right thing
Because there are many people around us.
He is indeed a handsome man.
Don't waste your time.
If I see you here, I'll cut off your leg.
You are not to blame for that.
His behavior is the reason he didn't stop you.
I know you well.
You're like someone who just quit smoking.
Is it better to speak or remain silent, to stop talking about fighting corruption or not?
I warn you.
If I hear you speaking on a radio program.
For the righteous who fight against corruption.
You are a good citizen, Mr. Saleh. You are very patriotic.
We won't hire you.
What can I do?
Sorry
Hello Saleh, how are you?
I wish you hadn't gone to the trouble of coming, and we appreciate it.
Mere lies
I miss hearing her every day. Stop the corruption.
You are a very brave man, afraid of nothing.
Tell me, just once.
<h1>God bless you</h1>
Is it a cigarette? Just say "enough corruption," please.
He begs you, rent him to just one person.
This is wonderful
Now, my dear
Regarding the job
You are a loyal citizen, and you are very dear to us.
We wanted to contact you to inform you.
Perhaps he was making you feel uncomfortable in front of others.
Are you serious?
They all said: "No vacancies."
They did want to hire me, but there are no openings.
And now... how will you secure money for yourself and your mother?
And don't forget that.
She has four sons.
May God help you.
Do not despair.
Don't lose hope.
Never stop.
You must look for a job every day.
So that my father wouldn't get angry.
I'll take any kind of job, just for you.
I will never say "Stop corruption" again.
Stop corruption.
You don't know what he's doing these days.
I told you.
And you, you never listen to me.
May God guide you.
I cannot go to the minister and tell him what this man is doing.
The minister will think.
Surely he will think about it this way.
You are right.
Enough, this is a serious matter.
We have to do something.
They say he will replace you, you know such a rumor is very effective.
I'm trying to find a way to stop him.
I don't want anyone to feel that I'm involved in that.
I agree with you.
What are you thinking about now?
The only way to keep him from influencing our interests.
Have you heard about Saleh stopping corruption?
He lives in my neighborhood.
I'll take care of it.
We lost your voice.
Not suitable
I'm a big fan of yours.
Salih is a very good man.
And, O Lord, soon.
He will return, and we will gladly listen to his voice.
I'll ask about you from Bou Fahd himself.
Tell me, Saleh.
Why did you leave the job?
I faced some problems, some health-related and some psychological.
Frankly,
You are very ambitious.
It's been a long time since I heard from him.
How beautiful she is, please reconcile.
Just once, do it for me.
I want to hear you talk about it.
Salih says he agrees.
No, folks, it's really tough.
What's wrong with you?
The man is begging you.
Abdulrahman, I had already resigned.
Didn't you tell us you were looking for a job?
Okay, this is your chance.
Please him and let him hear your voice, then go and ask him for a job the next day.
He will hasten to you.
I want what's best for you.
Do you know what?
Forget it and go home.
No, no, no, we don't want your help anymore.
Okay, bro, wait, let's discuss this.
No, we don't want to.
Ok Ok Ali Ali
Well, if I'm speaking for the last time now, I've resigned but I'll do it one last time,
What does Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed like to hear?
What problem concerns him the most? I know there are many problems here as well, more than we can count.
What does he prefer to hear? Or does he prefer riots? I don't know, tell me.
A binding contract
Use his authority.
The bear is 87 centimeters.
He destroyed it.
Don't interrupt me.
Why did the officer do that?
Where is number seven? Seven.
Don't interrupt me.
Number seven, the minister.
Why did the employee leave?
When the ministry moved to its new headquarters.
brings his brother's cars
People, stop corruption.
Now that you're back, we want you to stay in touch with the program.
This is the last time for this dear nation.
For I have truly ceased.
Mother, didn't you say that he resigned and that you prevented him?
Yes, my daughter.
Yes, my daughter.
The man nicknamed "Stop Corruption" was talked about on the radio.
I didn't listen to him, but some people told me that
I'm sure someone from the ministry has exposed it.
Get rid of it.
He is free.
Alright, Your Excellency the Minister
Don't worry.
My entire day is dedicated to serving the ministry, and may God bless you.
Did you hear him?
I said it only for you.
Ignore me.
He didn't speak to me.
Abdulrahman told me he would hire me.
He didn't speak to me.
You are very poor, Saleh.
I grieve for you.
I am Bu Fahd's secretary.
And I know the problem.
They used you to achieve their goals.
"And woe to them for what they have attained."
Do you know who planned all this?
Your neighbor, Abdurrahman
He was behind all of that.
Bu Fahad won't appoint you.
You will do the same to him.
Madmom tinraf. (Note: This phrase seems
Who would hire you?
I want to take you to court tomorrow to get a divorce.
An answer was found.
We are the best community in the world.
Free of any problems
No, we are not.
We don't have any problems at all.
We are pleased.
What is nepotism?
Everyone lines up in a single file.
Because that's the system followed here.
He gets more rights than a foreigner.
We are not on a stranger's sheet.
We don't own that.
Your effort and work make you the best, we have no problems.
Or an important officer
Your termination from work has been ignited.
We don't have those things here.
With my regards
Saleh Rashid Saad Rashid Al-Bohairi
Combating corruption
I didn't want to eat dinner.
I was running and waving my arms when he grabbed my shirt and tore it.
Jealous because you're wearing a new shirt.
Walid saw him wearing the shirt we bought him for the opening of the village.
He pulled it with jealousy and tore it.
He is kind-hearted and cannot blame.
I believe in *
Either you or Adoul saw my handsome child and envied him.
It's none of his business.
Why did you take off the baby's shirt?
You saw him wearing a new shirt and your heart envied, so ask your father to buy you a new one too.
What do you think you are?
Why did you tear Waleed's shirt?
I tell you
Don't make me hit you.
Sultan, my brother
Why don't you also punch him in the face and disfigure him?
He's a little child, not your age, be ashamed.
Is this a child?
Yes, a child.
People need someone to raise and correct them.
Not just to the left
Speak carefully, Sultan!
Do you think I'm a child to fix me?
You are arrogant.
Train up a child in the way he should go.
And if you are unable to do that
I respect him.
I don't want to blame him in front of his wife.
And brothers
If Adel hits Waleed again,
I will punish him.
I am the one who wastes his time arguing with you.
Imagine yourself.
Go and show her.
Argue with a fool and you'll lose your mind.
Where are the good old days?
And the intentions are clear.
Forgive us
Do you have a larger one than this?
No, no, this one is the biggest.
Depart from everything and come now.
Come and see the predicament we're in.
Yes, but my dear, tell me what happened.
Brother Ahmed, I'm sorry, I have to go home. There's an emergency I need to take care of.
Adoul's pants disappeared.
He is a resentful and hate-filled person.
It is the sultan.
How would a child cut all these clothes?
God is sufficient, I did not seek help from them, God is sufficient.
Show it to him.
Sit down and listen to me.
If you go and talk to him, he won't admit it. He'll say it was the child.
So, what's the solution?
Walid, do you know how to ride a bicycle?
Yes, I know.
Walid, my love
Yes, I'm telling the truth.
Say to me
Where did my beloved put the scissors?
Under his bed.
They destroyed it; may God deprive their souls of rest.
But I'll show him.
I will not be silent.
He is crazy, mentally ill.
Now
And do not change it.
But the computer is another matter, I'll show it to him.
I will not be silent.
Do you think it's our son Adoul whose computer broke down?
Ask him to come, let's see who's behind all this.
No *
Go and mock someone else, perhaps it's your friends, not me.
I told you it's an idol.
And laugh at someone else! Not me, Fahd.
Live, come let's expand.
The hearts were good.
And the intentions were clear.
Is there a child?
I'm not going to find friends.
You laugh at me, no, Sultan!
They falsely accused me.
Hold those scissors.
Imagine yourself with courtesy.
Hello, Abdel Rahman, come quickly, my son!
Come and see your brothers, Fahd and Sultan.
They quarrel every day, my son.
I don't know.
In a meeting like this,
We have to be
Look carefully at our actions.
And the works of those who preceded us
WC
It will be a lesson for us.
We have to learn from them.
Do not act like children in this way.
A camel's hump
Do you have children?
With zero knowledge
You are his role model, not them.
This model is his father.
You, Sultan!
And you, Fahd
And I am your older brother.
To me
I'll make him pay for the computer.
Shook his hand.
Some of them did not forgive each other.
No, I just shook his hand to escape.
From Abdulrahman's loquaciousness
Where are you going?
I swear I won't leave him.
Did you prepare that tea?
Go out and don't hide.
Open the door if you're a man.
Didn't you say that Abdul Rahman had satisfied you?
But, I swear to God, if he doesn't calm down, I'll destroy his room.
Your brother
Madness
Your brother is crazy.
Show him, carry the tea.
On his head.
"Go away, go away, stop! Oh, my sons, they have no shame, they are hitting each other."
You're acting like little children, stop it, son!
I swear to you that I will show you.
He hit him, hit him, alas! A very strong blow.
Blood, mother
You scared me with your shouting.
Oh God
Leave us alone.
Shame
I have cleansed your hearts of rancor, so that you may treat one another as brothers.
I won't leave you.
When he came to them at night to reconcile them.
He didn't have time, my daughter.
It is forbidden for him.
God willing
Speaks fluently
But, girls!
May God guide you.
You should calm them down.
Do not incite them to fight among themselves, girls!
What happened, I hope it's good.
You've disappointed me, Abdurrahman!
I wanted your help, not for you to do the same thing.
You are a wise brother, my son. May God guide you.
Two consecutive strikes.
Stick out your arm.
You are embarrassing us, Lord guide you.
Our neighbor Saeed is laughing at you.
Oh! Oh, Spring, we've said it time and time again.
Don't believe him, officer.
They were throwing stones, all three of them.
Sorry
No *
Believe me, sir, I saw them *from my window*.
Did you hear him?
Means too far.
My brother was right when he said it was amazing.
I'm sorry, but you've signed that your children won't do it again.
Thank you, thank you.
Welcome, my brother, welcome.
Officer, how are you going to release them? I'm sure, believe me.
Listen to me.
I didn't want to say that in their presence.
Abdulrahman, the eldest brother
Is the assistant the ministry's agent?
The middle one is the head of a public authority.
Take two tablets of Panadol and rest.
Panadol! Officer, please.
Do you have two boxes of Panadol medicine here?
"There is no power or might except by Allah."
"There is no power or might except by Allah."
"There is no power or might except by Allah."
What is this * What %pw
A child will throw it that far!
This is an adult man's hand, it looks like his father's hand.
Do you believe that?
He seems to be from a respectable family, kind and polite.
That's because I come from a poor family.
So what's the matter?
Follows you
He still sees you with his eyes.
And it is annoying to you.
And I said you weren't given the chance.
When you passed by, I looked at you, what does that mean?
Coincidence, you think!
You moved your head and she moved her head at the same time.
No, but surely there's something.
I notice when you enter.
She feels happy at heart.
Go and ask her about the pen.
Give her your notebook.
I don't know her name, can you believe it?
Romantic, more than it should be.
Dude, we're in the 21st century.
He despaired greatly.
Frankly
It's been a long time since we sat and talked like this.
No, this is the good news.
From now on, I'll have more time to sit with you.
But you should go and rest now.
Especially after yesterday's outdoor photoshoot in the desert.
We were exhausted, put the horses away, and I told the secretary that I didn't want any interviews with the press or television, or to sign any contracts.
I want to spend some time with my family.
May God help you.
Even if you're busy.
The first thing that came to my mind
I'll contact the owner today, I have his phone number.
What's the delay for?
The villa has been sold and the buyers moved in a few days ago.
You were busy with serials and photography.
Umm Abdul Aziz says they are poor and *
This is what God has decided for them, and we do not interfere in that.
Good morning, Uncle.
What's not going well?
This car, my son, breaks down every now and then.
It seems to be the battery.
No problem, don't worry, I have a charger and I'll charge it for you.
May God reward you with good.
At any time, uncle.
Peace be upon you
Walid is right.
Tomorrow, I'll start looking for a nearby villa so I can visit you every day.
What do you want now?
Okay, enough already, man.
Take it.
What is your full name?
Rashed Abdullah
The same name?
I said that to your father.
Your mother is right.
I was very happy to learn that Rashid Abdullah, my favorite actor, lives near us.
Everyone likes him.
They say he is kind and humble.
Neighborhood before housing.
I want to take a picture with him.
My colleagues at work will believe me.
He couldn't believe our house was right next to the house of the artist Rashid Abdullah.
Persuade him to agree with you.
What a life!
What we used to see on TV.
And we hope to see him.
He became our neighbor, praise be to God, thank you, God!
If they need a ship to sail, I have what fulfills the request.
I was happy to help, but people, have mercy on me, I'm still not quite used to it.
You heard about him.
It was very kind of him, may God reward him well.
Peace be upon you
It has been confirmed that some employees will be relocated to the ministry's new branch in Dukhan.
Did they tell you who's leaving?
I haven't heard of the names.
That's all I've heard and I'm sure of it.
Is Bu Ali among them?
My name!
But, we don't know exactly who we'll transfer to.
I can't go, please. It's too smoky for me, I can't.
Can you, or can't you? Business is business, man.
The committee is currently studying the matter.
And if they choose you
Thank you for visiting me, welcome Waleed, please come in.
Thank you, thank you, Abu Ali!
Sorry, the furniture is old.
We are neighbors today.
We are like one family.
That's very kind of you, oh! Boy, Walid.
May Allah reward you with good, O Abu Waleed.
I've heard a lot about your kindness.
God preserves this love forever.
But, my daughter!
I'm ready to tour the market for you until you find beautiful, suitable furniture at a good price.
When? To be honest, our furniture is very old.
We need to change them.
God willing
I've told you before.
If you need anything
Look at me as if I were your sister.
I will never cry for you.
Where did you go, my love?
I forgot to scold her when she called me yesterday.
Not because it exhausts you.
No more than that.
I'll call you later, goodbye.
And indeed, I used to speak to her.
But those people are different from us.
They are rich, and we are nothing in comparison.
Don't worry, Mom.
Wait just a moment.
Wait just a moment.
And I'll give you the green light to ask me to marry you.
I told you.
No, it doesn't matter to you, Mother.
And you will come and ask me to propose to you.
I set the dinner in the living room.
If you want to eat
The driver will take her to the university now, God willing.
Didn't we agree that we're family?
Whose car is this then?
And soon, God willing.
I called to thank her.
Good people love charity.
Yes, you're right, Dad!
Even our closest relatives wouldn't have done that to us.
Is my name included?
Are you sure?
What a hassle, why do problems keep chasing us?
I don't know... I'm confused now after hearing this news. What should I do? I don't know...
Go, go, go now, under the blessing, under the blessing, thank you, may God reward you with good, may God reward you with good.
What happened, Abu Ali!
The committee met today.
And the list of names of the people who will be transferred to Dukhan.
My name is listed.
Speak to the manager to have your name removed.
I don't think it will be useful, Um Ali! I don't think it will be useful.
I spoke to him, and he said, "Not from my end."
Famous actor
Your name was never on the list.
"May God bless you, thank you very much. Oh! Bu Salem"
If this doesn't bother you
I want to take a picture with you to show my children.
My children will be happy.
God bless you.
Can I take a picture with you, actor?
"Balakam, may God protect
Come, come
Of course, I'm happy to help.
And you and those you love
Notify me a day or two in advance.
Mother, get ready.
Ready? Ready for what?
Are you crazy? What's wrong with you?
She said, "I don't care."
Let his mother come.
Go to them.
But, alas! My son.
I don't want them to feel that we are poor.
You have to be neat.
I don't have any chic dresses.
You put me in a bind.
Why are you taking out all these jewels? This is the first time I've seen you do that.
It's not mine.
Mother of Ali
Ali's aunt will nominate her son.
She wants some elegant clothes and jewelry.
You want to show them that they are rich and wealthy people.
God willing
Happy is she.
God willing, this is my wife? She is taller and *bluer*.
God willing, I will listen.
Inshallah, you are a queen, a queen.
You have to be ready too.
They will ask you to meet her father.
After checking, I won't go in these clothes.
When I enter in my new costume
Mother, be careful with her belongings.
It is very kind of Umm Waleed to give you her things, so use them carefully.
Yes yes
So we must be like them.
Why didn't his mother go to ask for his hand in marriage?
That was for the women.
I must go and meet the men.
As you can see, God blesses you.
"Blessings of God upon you, I still want to drink tea."
Oh people of kindness, help me.
They were cooperative, and only the bisht remained.
I want to borrow it from you to complete the outfit.
Everyone stood up for you.
Yes, but Rashid, should I let it go like this, or hold on to it?
No, look, first.
You have to close this button.
I hold my breath
The dress is loose, but
May God bless you.
The left hand should be in...
The string is tuned like this.
Hold onto the bottom of the abayas.
Wow, wow
How beautiful it is!
Your mistakes need to calm down a bit.
Ah! Yes.
Now you look like a millionaire.
What they gave you, perfect, seconds.
Put your left hand, like this, to the left, in this way.
Do you know my friend Aisha?
What's wrong with her?
You know what she was telling me earlier today.
She told me that because you're my friend and I don't ever want us to be apart.
I will ask my brother to propose to you.
Tell your friend not to ask her brother and put him in an awkward position, and embarrass herself.
I see many suitors are interested in you these days, a few days ago you told me that Sa'ad wants you for her uncle, and today this girl wants you for her brother.
They want to take my beloved.
I just sit and watch.
Don't they know about our relationship?
No, they only know that we are colleagues.
"تم" tra
Tomorrow they must know.
Why did he reject the child?
I scream.
My son Walid is rejected.
Actors are more sincere than you, two-face.
But you...
Your role embodied your entire theatrical life.
What reflects you?
To serve people
He lied to the people.
Wear different costumes in life, in front of everyone.
I wore the thobes while acting on television.
Me or you!
You wore accessories and jewelry made of gold and silver.
Playing
You got married.
Scene
A man walks in front of his wife.
A vine hung down over his cheeks.
Do not turn your deceased to the right or left.
He reminds me of your friend, the one you were talking about, who works in the same office as you.
Is he with a girl and a boy?
Why is he walking like that?
As they said,
May God help him.
Walk straight, don't stop.
He has no personality whatsoever.
He laughs, he's happy!
Show us the view of the city center.
No, no, no, no, it doesn't look nice with you sitting like that.
You look better awake when you're standing up, get up, get up, get up.
I beseech you, O Thursday.
Hello, are you going to the city center?
Come, I want to talk to you.
Where are you going? Stay with us for a while.
His wife annoys him.
Are you satisfied with this!
Thursday
I run it, and if the presenter is a woman
I change the channel because I'm afraid it will get me into trouble.
I swear I'm at work.
I'm sitting with Salem, my coworker.
Talk to her.
The phone went dead in my face, take it, take it.
She hung up the phone, and now she'll start bothering me.
Now you say I let you talk to her because there's a woman with us.
Now you might throw me out of the house.
Get you out of here!
You're not the first to leave.
No, no, no, I can't, brother!
I don't want to torment my mother in her grave.
He entrusted me with
She said, "Don't get divorced."
No, no, no, I can't, it's impossible.
Are you looking for something?
No, no, no, %pw stay, stay
You're completely crazy.
Don't drive me crazy.
Tell me, I want to know what's wrong.
No, no, no, Mother, don't say that about him.
Salem, in particular, is one of the best men in our village.
He is asking you for a divorce.
Even if he asked me for a divorce ... Am I stupid to divorce? It's unreasonable.
Thursday, you've officially gone crazy.
Leave me, leave me, from me.
I was talking to him, alone.
May God guide you.
A poor man, heart-breaking.
I want to give him an important message from the minister's office.
Who do you want to give it to, O God's will guide you?
No, no, there's nothing, nothing.
Give it to him, I'll take it to him.
The meeting with the women's delegation will be tomorrow.
Women's delegation
What's wrong with you! Aren't you sleeping today?
Hello Salim
I am your brother, Khamis.
No, I'm talking to you with full awareness now.
Hello, brother!
Please remove my name so I don't attend.
How can we remove your name?
The only one who can remove your name is His Excellency the Minister.
A meeting at the ministry.
Official meeting
Who are you addressing?
Healthy, healthy, healthy
Tell me the truth.
Who is the lady you were talking to?
Safe and sound, peace, by God, it was peace.
If you're talking to Salem
Will you speak?
This lie is useless.
Don't lie, Khamas.
Will you not speak the truth?
You're wearing casual clothes.
She thought I was talking to a woman.
How terrible my life is!
May God bless you, please contact Salem.
I hope you believe me.
You were asked to call him.
You have no right to it.
Don't meddle in others' affairs, or you'll see what you don't like.
And I complain about you.
Hello?! You there!
How do you bear living with a woman who has such a sharp tongue?
We're starting the meeting now.
Hassan went to call Thursday.
Alright, let's discuss the real estate budget first.
We start
We hope he will be found.
He was terrified when he saw the women.
I searched the whole ministry and you were hiding here.
Come on, come on, people are waiting in the conference room.
I can't sit with the women.
Oh! Thursday, how will you tell your wife?
I'm afraid she'll call me.
Oh my God, do you want her to doubt me? Don't you understand?
If I don't answer her call, how will I get home?
Will your wife call at this time!
Of course, your company is very large.
This project, which your company will undertake for our ministry
One of the largest projects in the history of our ministry.
Hey! People, why is the table shaking?
No, Your Highness, it's not the river, it's me.
You can answer your call.
Who is this?
Excuse me, who do you want to talk to?
This is my phone, %pw
I'll explain to you, wait, wait.
He fainted from fear of going to the house.
Her brother came.
He told him that his wife said, "Don't come back home unless you change your job and stop working with ladies."
Therefore, he sent a letter to the center requesting to be transferred from our department.
Exactly, the minister himself told me that he approved it, what more does he want!
What about his wife?
This is madness.
I ask him: Who are you talking to?
I told you he's crazy.
What will you do! Your family will return tomorrow.
I don't know what to do.
It's done, you did what you wanted to do, why are you afraid to go back home and see your children?
You want official proof.
Okay, give her the documents.
Okay, that's what I did, I sent the papers with her brother.
To see the minister's signature and make sure of it.
And perhaps I will agree with her, and if I do, I will return home tonight, God willing.
Sister, this is the minister's signature.
What else do you want?
He will start working in the new department tomorrow.
Office and job different from the one he used to work in.
Where is the location of this department, may God bless you?
Yes, God bless you, this is the minister's statement.
Nothing, nothing, it's that one, on your right.
Yes, %pw, blessed are you.
Please come in, your office is ready.
Saad and Abdul Qadir, God willing, the office is big, yes.
Goodbye
How do you request a ride?
The whole section is women.
My wife
No one can execute another's decision except the minister himself.
You have to work until the minister returns.
Oh brother! Make a deal with your colleagues.
Hello, gentlemen. I hope you are all well. I would like to inquire about...
And I had added two more to the new workforce.
The new employee, is actually a male employee.
A few days ago, the minister's office assigned a man to work with us.
Are you serious!
This poor man, working among five women, seems funny.
They say his wife is very jealous of other women around him.
Blind jealousy
A poor man, he is in need.
But he asked us to remain silent when his wife called, and we obeyed his orders and did not speak.
Yes, Abdulqader who is with you in the office.
Does it fit you in size?
My son called and said my wife is on her way to the office.
What are you doing?
Continue walking straight, it's the first floor on your left.
This is at the social welfare office.
With five.
Those are six employees.
And I'm sure he came to work.
These lies don't fool me.
My wife is jealous of other women around me.
I am beautiful.
O Sultan, God has made your path easy.
But we want to know what stage we've reached.
Uncle, Sacer and I were at the bank yesterday.
that the project
Peace be upon you
Brother, I have an important meeting at work today.
Go to the kitchen quickly.
I'm dressed up and ready to go out.
In fact, your place is the kitchen.
Women must obey men.
And the sting of scorpions is painful.
This is important for rain, look look
Look, Uncle!
Aisha, please contact the secretary and ask him to inform the staff.
The meeting time has been changed to tomorrow.
I hope it's not serious.
They keep issuing orders.
And we must execute.
They must know that you are an important supervisor.
She has many responsibilities and obligations.
They consider women as servants.
I haven't seen people who despise women like them.
In what age do they think they live?
They told me not to go to work today and to go to the kitchen to make tea instead.
Where are the maids?
And the other one fled a week ago.
Even the servants cannot endure the stench of their obscenity.
I understand them.
May God help you.
There are few banknotes.
Tea
Uncle, they mean it.
In fact, the villa complex is worth nothing without a garden.
Alright then, the park...
Sister, before you leave, I want to talk to you about something.
My beloved Fatoum, I must go, I'm late.
Okay, tell me, what do you have?
If you don't speak, I will leave.
Play it in the school.
A committee from the Women's League came today.
The school nominated me to join the league.
Are you crazy?
And you want to go to the governorate.
Do you know that if you tell your uncle and brother about this, you'll never see anything good from them again?
You bear the blame.
We have warned you.
Why don't you come and visit me? It's been a long time since I last saw you.
A year has passed, a year since I saw you.
Is he married or still single?
Oh, Lord, guide them.
Who would agree to marry an uneducated mother?
No, no, no, it's not important if he's illiterate, he's a man.
And Thursday is the son of the scorpions.
The sting of a scorpion is very painful.
And he must marry one of similar social standing.
A scorpion like him.
May God help you.
What can I do, Aisha!
Since the minister has traveled, all papers are referred to me.
I informed Mustafa, the head of the HR department, that I would like to have an interview tomorrow.
The ministry's guests arrived today.
Your schedule
And now I am free to talk to you, Ayesha.
Yes, Mary.
Present, coming, present, coming now.
What can I say, O Aisha!
My brothers are the source of all this trouble.
I don't know what happened.
"Don't worry, my love, the ice packs are necessary to prevent your face from swelling."
Didn't we advise her not to go and talk to them about it?
I went to them, so they beat her.
Do you know if you told them it's a football?
They broke your bones a long time ago.
What a pity you don't play soccer!
Next time, we'll break your neck.
Know who you're talking to.
The Big Scorpion
That little one
Yes, but Uncle, I didn't hit her, it was Sultan who hit her.
Did you hear that?
I chose economics and politics.
I chose graphics because it's in demand these days.
Architecture
It's not your turn.
Your opportunity was there.
Do not be wicked.
Okay, scorpion.
Hit her and break her teeth in her mouth.
I will hit her.
She is with me here.
Go to the Sponsored Scholarships section.
I will translate the following text into English.
Take your time.
Let's make sure.
I spoke to the sultan and the falcon.
They don't care if you marry Mounira.
What else do you want?
Yes, our son Khamis deserves the best.
I'll arrange a meeting with them and let you know.
Accompanying the delegation.
I understand your personal circumstances.
Give yourself a chance to think about it until tomorrow.
To tell you the truth,
They care about you a lot.
And your nomination by the minister.
It's true.
I know my brothers well.
They will never agree.
I am confused.
Their car payment comes out of my salary.
And I maintain the house.
She wants me to travel with her too.
Aren't we going to marry her this week?
What are you saying?
Stupid Thursday, he doesn't even have a school certificate.
Marry and travel with him.
Done, let's go.
Fault
They will kill her if she refuses.
My son, I have told you time and again.
Why don't you go?
Tomorrow I will go.
"Never mind, welcome is the son of scorpions."
Appearance doesn't matter.
I don't want to marry Khamis.
Go to the kitchen.
Put it in the living room.
Madrid vs Barcelona match tonight
I hope Valencia doesn't defeat us.
My sources are reliable.
She is loyal and hardworking.
What do you think about that?
What do you want me to do?
We have to go.
Please proceed to your offices.
Thank you, may God grant you a long life.
A long life.
Coffee is served there.
Madame Happiness
May God prolong her life.
Hello, may God grant you a long life.
Your radiant back, my Lord.
Yes, may God grant you a long life.
Did you wash the coffee cups?
Go and pour coffee for Captain Emad.
And also
We will play in China after tomorrow.
Yes, Captain, I forgot to introduce you to my sister Mary.
I'm going to the formal party.
Are you stupid?
You don't know anything in this life, and you want to marry a minister.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Yes, ma'am.
Empty it and make a new one.
Actors are called.
Learn, Maha also called me a few minutes ago.
What can I say to her?
What happens if we skip her turn isn't suitable for Mashael.
Noof is a sixteen-year-old girl.
And Mashael appears to be in her twenties.
I wonder why she doesn't play the role of Mary.
Suits her better.
Nouf is thirty years old.
We must remove the obstinate person from the committee.
It's complicated, and I'm sure he won't let things go smoothly.
It is detailed.
He will talk about art, family values, moral art, content, and so on.
Who chose him for that committee?
The minister is the one who formed the committee.
You, me, and Hamad can influence him.
No, no, no, this is impossible.
Nothing indicates that it belongs to us.
And if he had gone and inquired at the Ministry of Economy.
He will not find our names.
The company is registered in the name of Hamed's wife, may God protect you.
Do not worry about this matter.
Don't worry, really, who is the head of the committee?
The last word is mine.
No, no, man, everything is fine, please come in.
I just got in touch with them and we agreed on everything.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, welcome Rashid, please come in.
As you know, this meeting is specifically to decide whether or not to approve the series "Extortion of Conscience."
Produced by Modern Arts Foundation, Massat
A nice, unpredictable, and stubborn sequence of actions.
I agree with Hamad.
The storyline of the series is absolutely amazing.
I agree with you.
I liked it when you took the gun and killed your neighbor.
She wanted to hide the gun, so she put it in the car.
And she didn't know he was her son, it's interesting, and when the police came.
And her son comes from school.
He kicked a box.
He kicked it, and it flew and scratched the glass of his mother's window.
Here comes the surprise.
This is the part of the box that goes into the mother's room.
And it's wonderful that a local company is producing works at such an advanced level.
We should encourage and support them.
Mr. Rashid, you didn't tell us your opinion.
You left me nothing to say.
With all due respect to your opinion and consideration of the series, this is "conscience extortion."
Blackmailing human values
Repulsive surprises
Every episode features one and a half people.
The other half is expected in the next episode.
This series is written without social awareness.
It does not carry a moral message that helps society progress.
Tears fall, why do they make the audience cry?
Sorry, Rashid.
You've given us your opinion, Ali has given us his opinion, let Mr. Rashid express his opinion.
It is clear from the meeting.
There is an agreement between you both.
Organized it.
Some people understand because it's their field of expertise, while others have nothing to do with the area.
I denied that chain.
I feared he would get us into trouble.
Neglect it.
What can he do? He can't do anything.
I'll do what I want.
He gave me the bag and said it was from Ms. Samira.
I don't know what to do.
I don't believe her. Oh, Nasser!
A new series we will produce soon.
The person who led the driver to rape the girl.
For the blessed things we have obtained through him.
The first blessing is the beautiful ring on your hand.
I'll tell you how.
So they presented it in the name of Hamad's wife, who sent you the ring.
And your husband's role was to cover their backs.
Owns five percent of the production.
Beautiful role
I just played a similar role. Didn't you watch "Lost Dreams"?
By the way
It's called "extorting something," I can't remember it.
Yes, extorting dreams.
Why did all the names resemble each other?
Last year's series were all about girls.
You notice that each chain has more than eight or even ten girls.
Your turn is secure.
People love you very much.
Your happiness
Yes, Omar.
Yes, okay, okay.
My love, I'm leaving to go to work. I don't understand what happened with them.
Eat and go.
He said he wanted to see me about a very urgent and important matter.
I had to go.
I heard that Rashid met the minister.
Spent half an hour with him.
And you said to him that you would make his life miserable.
I told you that he complained to the minister about us.
What happened was that the minister's office called and requested a meeting with me.
I also fear that the minister will believe his words.
I will meet with the minister.
The man came to explain his point of view about the series.
This is all.
This is true, may you live longer.
But first, you who are concerned can tell me that it is unacceptable to talk about a colleague behind his back.
Everyone knows that Rashid
He is jealous of everyone around him.
He only thinks about material gains.
But it's his specialty.
But, bless you, not every scholar can handle these matters of art.
Special Television Productions
The loss of the literary deterrent, the series we are working on.
Mass production
We will have a media initiative at the Gulf level.
Strong distribution
Of course, it's your specialty. You know more about it than I do.
I promise you a great series.
He will defend our name.
Read what Abdel Hamid the journalist wrote, listen listen.
And one of the actors also said
The series promotes unethical ideas.
Limited only to the fall of modesty.
This is indeed a bold and powerful critique.
They will be in big trouble if journalist Abdulhamid continues writing about them.
And if the people to whom I was sent knew about it.
But they are smart, they know how to handle her.
They are great.
We need to create our own website.
All activities of our company
What's the name of the company again?
From now on, you are the media advisor.
The conscience extortion series supervised by the Mercury Media Production Company is considered
A Quantum Leap in Arabic Drama
Because it carries ideas and moral values.
It's a series aimed at developing society.
The same journalist who criticized them a few days ago.
Is it possible for him to change his mind to the opposite?
How can he accept that?
The journalist Abdelhamid and all those like him
Don't worry, Mr. Hamed.
He asked what I thought of the series, and I told him it's the best in the Arab world.
I hope so.
I feel our series will be great.
I don't know where he is.
And the other is packing his bags and ready to travel.
A lackluster beginning.
Your stories are always unrealistic, and the events never actually happen in reality.
It's clear at first glance.
Your writers are fools.
It may happen.
Your series is funny, very funny.
What do you think?
Very tragic
Other bad series are no excuse.
This production can be understood at first sight.
These are hidden lines and dimensions, one needs to focus to discover them.
By the way, it's a political drama.
It is a shame to be looked at like this.
What happened?
I wasn't nervous like that yesterday.
I was in the standing market yesterday with Ali.
We were in a coffee shop.
You ignored me.
Nasser, what do you think about what happened? The minister is angry, this is a big problem.
Within a week, we'll all be separated.
What a failed series, everyone who watched it said it was a failure.
I heard that Rashid is planning to visit.
And tell him that the series is a failure and does not contain any action scenes.
This is a catastrophe.
Leave it to me.
Let's see what Nasser does.
Listen, Eli!
From now on, I don't want any work criticism on your page.
Eli, please.
A few days ago, I saw an article that not only criticized the production but also cursed it.
Don't make me angry.
Rejoice
On that day, I was relaxed.
I will never allow them to write that.
Frankly, I haven't received any congratulatory messages.
Once again, outstanding success.
Goodbye
Brother Rashid,
Should I believe you or the newspapers?
Conscience-wracking soap operas are the best television production.
You lived long, they have an agreement.
Listen to what the other newspaper wrote.
Do they also have an agreement with the viewers' page?
I nearly died of a heart attack.
A little later, they told me.
Good luck, the minister is satisfied.
Frankly, Nasser,
Get ready to witness Conscienceless Extortion 2
No, no, no, no, enough, my brother.
Serial said he wouldn't write again.
He prefers to stay in his miserable job.
After all these troubles, comes a second part.
A third and a fourth as well.
What's wrong with you? You don't want to take advantage.
One of his friends told me.
Here I am
What the magician can do.
I wish you more success.
Tell us your opinion about that success.
I thank God for that success.
And enemies of our successful lives.
I find it strange.
That this series wins awards while being a failed series.
But they are the experts.
They have been given a place of honour for it, seeing what we do not see.
Preparing the second part of the series.
God willing, you have a long life.
A real wizard.
You will see, "blackmail of conscience" is a...
I saw you talking to the minister at the beginning of the event.
Do TV festivals lie too!
I heard him say, "Get ready for part two."
They are the same thing.
They are taken to the bank to be washed and cleaned.
All the weak, silly, and immoral series you see.
They nominate it in Arab and Gulf festivals.
To clean it and award it, so people see it as high-class.
Yes, that's correct.
As long as the judges are the producers themselves.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, praise be to God for your arrival.
True, we signed a contract with them, but they want to lower the prices.
Come to my office.
We are not a small bakery or a bread shop.
We are one of the largest bakery companies in the world.
We will not raise the white flag.
Or terminate the contract.
We submitted a signed contract yesterday.
British Company
A cup beyond description.
As you like it
He did a great job.
It will be the first in the world to produce this product.
He is not just the best bread baker in the world.
I'll tell you
How can bread be with a zipper?
You can either open it with your hand or go to the kitchen to look for a knife to cut it, and you might cut your hand.
So he made bread with a zipper.
Put the cheese back and close it again.
This is not bread, it's a pair of pants.
So what do you think, actually, it's a bag of bread.
How can we remove that zipper?
So, one can say to his friend: "I ate two sandwiches."
Why weren't the Noor Mountains Hospital sweets delivered yesterday?
I know that, but why didn't you hand it in yesterday?
Bakers who prepare it.
And again, the bakers used...
What happened, sir.
Why are you shouting in his face?
You're wasting your time with football and delaying my work.
Learn that your son loves football.
So what's the problem if some employees from the company take some time to have fun?
You have four hundred employees in the company.
11 starting players
4 substitutes, and 2 administrative assistants, that's all, just 17.
The seal of the team's spokesperson
Why are you angry with him?
But that's okay at the same time. Although the fans are the most important players on the field, they are the twelfth player.
I'll let you enjoy playing with them.
We have already signed a contract with these people.
When he first told you he wanted to play football
Listen to you.
He didn't do anything.
Not that you're angry at him just because he took some employees to play football in front of him for entertainment.
I didn't say he couldn't take some employees.
Even if some of your friends need some staff, you can lend them some.
Important bakeries
Yes, my son, why do you take the important bakers, this cannot be.
Next time, tell me before you hire any staff.
No, no, let Hamid do this paperwork.
He is in the hospital.
Why didn't they teach you?
I finished work, and as I was driving home...
Nasser called me.
I went to him.
He said they couldn't find the goalkeeper and they have an important match today.
He told us to bring a goalkeeper, and then we reached the playground.
Wear the goalkeeper's outfit.
I have never touched a soccer ball.
That situation
This is contrary to reason.
And we'll find you a job instead of wasting your time playing football.
I want to explain.
Father, do you want me to disband the team and let them go, is that it?
Yes, that's correct.
Okay, Dad, please, I beg you.
It's impossible to dismiss the team, tomorrow is the final match.
No, no, no, he is right.
Do you agree?
Congratulations on your victory.
Congratulations to Mr. Nasser for winning the cup.
We wanted to know how you planned to win.
Look, I've prepared the team psychologically, physically, and mentally, and the coach has worked hard.
In a hotel
Congratulations to you all, and we will hold a celebration as promised.
Your father seems happy.
I'm afraid he's merely nice and polite.
Uncle Abu Nasser, firstly we would like to congratulate you on the great victory of your team, the International Bakers Team.
For this outstanding success
May the cold be far from you. Go away. Go away.
No picture without a pee, wait, wait, stop.
No, no
He wears the bisht.
Your care, attention, and creative insights played a significant role in this success, undoubtedly.
The coach's plan
Instead, they played 5-5-3-2 in the final matches.
And as an athlete, you know that changing the game plan confuses players, but Bakr's team wasn't confused and did a great job.
The coach's plan
Bou Nasser, as the first athlete on the International Bakers Team, what advice do you have for the players?
To infinity
Hello hello
Long life
They are welcome, is Hamad Sultan with them?
They are welcome to come, but they must have dinner with us first.
Dinner, okay!
Thank you, Abu Abdulaziz.
And it is a contribution to the private sector.
The team is still young.
Don't envy me.
No, who?
Bu Abdelaziz
The motors' deputy that we use in the factory. (Note: The original sentence is not grammatically correct in Arabic, so the translation maintains that structure.)
"You se
I've wanted to meet him for a long time.
Football introduced me to him, and I told him so.
I said to him: "O Abu Abdulaziz!"
You've never been interested in football your whole life.
It has nothing to do with you.
The ball was always close to me, it was only fifty centimeters away from us.
Hasn't Bu Nasser arrived yet?
No, he didn't come today either.
There will be a seminar on football injuries, as the platinum sponsor, he should be present.
You will see more.
Did you see the building behind the bakery that he wanted to convert into worker housing?
He is obsessed with football.
As usual, we arrange to meet and interview a sports personality.
This man inspires the bakery team with his great ideas.
And what about the International Bakery Team? We heard that you are undergoing a comprehensive development.
Compared to offices, all efforts
It's a paltry sum of money, just a million dollars for all this effort.
Don't be stingy, man.
No worries, brother Shahin.
My mistake.
So what was my mistake?
You told me you need players for the Gulf countries.
Gulf prices in US dollars are the highest.
Which means if the player is worth two thousand
The waterfront section cost three or four million dollars.
I don't understand, explain it to me.
Receive my fax from here
And read it before him when you are with him.
My father bought four new players for the team, in addition to a new shipment of four players.
Learn, it's amazing, he can easily defeat Billy and Ronaldinho.
But it says eight hundred thousand on it.
Yes, that's correct, God bless you, but a Turkish club set this price.
Sold for a price of 1.2 million in the UAE.
Don't look at me.
Can we examine the goods?
He is here.
The leg of the locust.
Good, perfect.
No, no, no, I guarantee you that.
Insha'Allah, he is fat, it's good that he is fat.
This one is slim, suitable for the center.
The attached muscle
It is the most important muscle by far, a player is useless without it.
Thank you.
Let your driver take them to the Elysian Club, to the Elysian, what did I say? To the Elysian.
How did this happen?
Hamdi, let's go.
Congratulations, congratulations
These, God bless you, are young players.
Yes, we bring them from African forests.
We feed them and raise them, then release them into the playgrounds.
Hurry, take it, do you have a place for it or should I transport it in my pickup truck?
When he saw them putting pressure on us
The offending player was asked to play.
They were singing and dancing, no.
Ask the team's defenders to play.
Kagumakakani Lololo was supposed to play.
He is a beginner coach.
And even if it were in the vastness of Mars
Spain! Even if he were coaching on Mars.
I didn't like his style of managing the game.
This should be on the way to Damascus.
The rules of the game are present.
Even if it's just two days.
What's happening? Why are you screaming?
Your stupid son
He is not convinced that the coach is not an expert in football.
Listen to her ... she speaks like rain.
And he knows that the attacking player Selulu Tekawawa is an excellent midfielder, as Ahmed Tayeb said.
What's in your hand won't give you a headache.
Stay away.
I know how to deal with him.
Why did the team lose the game?
The team is required to change the plan.
The players are not staying in their positions.
And the player spoke, "He was completely out of position, he should be moved back to his usual spot."
Our coach is changing...
The decision to expel Hboui Malalu was made.
Okay, okay, okay
No, no, no, no, what's happening in the stadium?
It's not supposed to happen.
The coach shouldn't do that.
<h2>Please postpone these issues until the game is over.</h2>
People are watching this, it's happening in front of the camera.
Fourth goal for Al-Najah team, the ball entered the goal area.
He scored the fourth goal, he's the star of the match today.
This trainer is stubborn.
Tell him, your uncle Abu Nasser doesn't want to be the coach of his team from now on.
And you, be quiet.
I'm watching the game on TV and you're on the bench, do everything I ask you to.
Don't do that, it's not good.
We have a match tomorrow. How are we going to play without a coach?
What does your father do?
Enough, Rashid.
What's wrong with you? You scared me, tell me what's wrong?
He divorced me, he divorced me.
I divorced you! How is that?
I don't know, Mother, I don't know.
Why did he divorce you? You were married for less than a month.
I swear to God, Mama, I don't know, I don't know.
He divorced you without any reason!
Yes, Mama, yes.
I swear, Mom, I don't know. He suddenly came to me and said, "Go to your parents' house."
I asked him, "Why?" He replied, "You are divorced."
I swear, I don't know what's going on?
They were married for no more than a month. So what will people say about us?
I agree with you.
I don't know what to say.
All I know is that he's divorced from you now.
Sit down. I'll be back in a minute.
Due to her high moral standards.
She insulted Barcelona.
Light of my eye, Abdullah.
He came to me crying.
He said she had disrespected Barcelona, a team he loves and admires greatly.
She mocked him, I honored him, and his feelings were hurt.
My mom insulted Barcelona, so I told him to divorce her and I'll marry him another one.
Tell him your daughter is divorced because she insulted Barcelona FC.
That's the only reason he divorced her! Are you serious?
I don't care.
Is it easy to hurt someone's feelings?
A stab in the chest from a wife who betrayed her husband.
I can't believe what I'm hearing!
We don't need a girl who doesn't appreciate world teams.
This time, he started mocking Messi.
Problems arise between the couple and us.
One of them is worth a thousand girls.
The girls multiplied and wished to marry him.
Listen to me.
I don't want to hear anything.
And this is my son, and I know him well.
I told you it's none of your business.
I will be angry with you.
Don't trouble yourself, my son, and don't think about it.
One of them is worth a thousand girls.
Why are you angry!
And when I mention her saying
Real Madrid is better than Barcelona.
Alright, my love.
What's wrong with her!
Her name is Mona.
Was she married for one month?
If I tell you her story and why she got divorced, you'll never stop laughing.
To involve you with him, we need your attention.
What's the benefit of dealing with this man? He divorced his wife for a football team!
The hairdresser knows her and told me the whole story. Mom, don't involve me in this, I don't want to have problems with someone like her.
That's all, you're listening to the hairdresser's gossip.
Say to them, "I have not accepted."
Let her talk and say whatever she wants to say.
A fortune comes to you.
I said to her: "Alas, girl, do not cut off your portion!"
If that's all her wealth, I don't care at all.
She will stop her luck and our luck with her.
This building
He won't say no to me.
Glorified and Exalted is He, the Sufficient One, from this evil adorner.
They hear a rumor and spread it.
Don't listen to her.
Tell her and make her understand not to close the door of opportunity that will open for us.
He knows how to convince her.
<h1>Man, don't joke. Do you believe he divorced his wife for Barca?</h1>
Forget all this nonsense and don't be crazy.
Don't miss the opportunity.
And perhaps it is she who is the cause, or something in her, that led him to divorce.
Listen, girl, don't let Abu Burjiyah slip through your fingers.
What is that, Abu Burj?
But when they get closer, they discover that it's actually two towers.
Therefore, they called his father Shahin Abu Boghin.
Welcome
Oh, no, no, no. That's so sweet. Thank you, thank you.
Yes, thank you. Please.
May God grant you many years.
Your Excellency, I was inattentive and you seemed very busy, that was a month ago.
The first wedding was just a month ago, it's a new marriage, and he has already divorced his wife.
He was married and divorced as well.
Yes, this is his third marriage.
And this is his story, my brother, hold on to him tightly.
Ah! Man, this is the tough generation.
Opinion and the other opinion
Congratulations, congratulations my daughter!
Oh, dear, don't forget your fruit; I placed it on top of the bag.
You can carry it with you when you board the plane.
Upon your arrival in London
Yes, my son, don't you want to go to London?
Hello, Mom.
So, that's good.
So you can come with us and shop as well.
Malaysia, Malaysia.
Your translation is: Malaysia Take the fur with you
Goodbye, Mama
What's wrong with her?
I don't know.
I'm asking her and I don't know what's going on.
Tell me, my daughter, what's happening?
You did the best by ignoring her.
It's nothing.
On your honeymoon, you should be taken care of in every possible way.
Is it logical to sit while pouring water!
The cup is beside you, she doesn't hold it and let you drink.
You didn't have a good upbringing.
You should have told her that since I was born, I only drink water from my mother's hand.
What's wrong with her?
You look very sad.
And who is this lady accompanying you?
Her name is Michelle.
She is miserable, divorced during the honey moon.
Would you believe her if I told you her story?
May God bless you, Auntie. Thank you.
Your aunt requested, and your aunts also requested.
Yes, but I don't know where the mother booked us.
Hello, Mom
Where did you book us?
Because she wants to go there with us.
"There is no power or might except by Allah."
Why did he do that at the airport and why did he take the children?
What happened between them?
She asked me, and I have no idea what's between them!
It's indeed nonsense.
So where is Munira then?
She's in her room talking to this idiot.
Now she says she has been calling him for two days and his phone is switched off.
I just found it.
We're waiting to see what he has.
How do you know he's angry? The boy comes from outside tired and wants to relax.
Mom, every day I tell her to peel the apple, but she doesn't. Every day she makes me angry.
And you know that I don't like the apple with its skin.
She doesn't peel the apple.
Hello, let me tell you.
You are divorced.
And another one when necessary.
Go, Boo! Light of my eye.
Go, Boo! Light of my eye.
Monira, what did he say?
Why are you angry too!
Call him three times and tell him you're divorced.
May God guide you, be quiet.
I don't know, Mama, who saw me at the disco in Ceuta and told him.
He has nothing to say.
True, he has nothing to say.
You will dance twice or three times.
"And whoever divorces my daughter and then dies, then my obligation to him is ended."
How did he divorce you?
Where are you going?
Where am I going? I'm going to unleash my anger on this rude man.
Its tail is like that of a jungle fowl.
Inlaid with gold, rubies, coral, and diamonds
And the other girls are a toy for you and your son.
They have no families and mothers who taste the bitterness in their mouths.
Who are you mocking?
And divorce them in a good way, as you have taken them.
She didn't help you drink water, and she insults Barcelona, divorce her and forget her.
Who went to a nightclub?
Without shame or decency
The minister's agent, an Arab and a Muslim.
He cares about his reputation and that of his children.
Sit still and don't move.
Some humanity
It belonged to my father.
Who sells such real estate?
Abu Sakr took it from his father by force.
Why is he selling it?
O Allah, guide him. If Abu Saqr wants something, can anyone say no to him?
Trust in God, man.
Please, go ahead.
Let's go, let's go.
What happened to your project, Abu Saad?
As you know
حسناً، في الأسبوع الماضي قلتِ إنكِ ذاهبةٌ إلى مكتبِه؟
I told you, if you want to carry out your project, you have to start by paying for it.
Abu Sakr, this great millionaire
Doesn't he eat? Doesn't anyone eat in this world?
It's not a problem, brother. We'll let him eat and get full, and we'll fill his belly, but the problem is how to reach him.
And you must know Abu Sakkar's key, so that all doors will open for you.
I met him during Umrah and greeted him more than once.
It doesn't matter if you know him as long as you pay him and run your business, all you need is to know the right time.
When the secretary told me that Abu Saqr was waiting for you for dinner.
I just came.
Abu Sakr, may God protect him, holds a feast every day.
Hey! Man, anyone.
He enjoys this meeting and gathering with friends.
It's very fun to spend the night at this farm.
Yes, sir, this is Abu Nasser, the owner of the car agency behind the shopping complex.
He wants to know who you are, madam.
He obtained the license.
I can almost see my son who got the license.
Thank you, and may God bless you.
Congratulations on your license, Saqr.
Divine providence watches over you.
Abu Sakr
I asked you not to let me down, say yes.
Say yes, my lord judge.
A gift for him.
And do not say "No."
"My deeds speak for themselves."
It means you met him and talked to him easily.
Don't be foolish.
Yes, Abu Nasser ordered me.
Tell me what technique you used? What did you do?
My suitcase serves me.
When we were sitting with him.
His son just got his license.
I have a gift of a falcon.
If it's about the car,
That's easy.
Come, come take me to him.
Yes, it has happened.
I just got out of the hospital.
He had his tonsils removed.
He will certainly give a feast.
You deserve your son's health, madam.
We wish him well, we wish him well. If it is God's will, he will not see any harm. If it is God's will.
And we met at the jewelry store.
I think so.
Ah! Man, we're starting to forget as we get old.
They told me your son Shahin was in the next room and has already left.
So I thought I should visit you.
And I congratulate you on the health of the falcon.
%pw Listen, sir, you ought not to go without dining with us.
I don't feel like it.
Say yes or no.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Our beloved son, Shahin, was quickly discharged from the hospital.
In Corniche Tower
Say "Yes"
Oh my son, don't be stubborn.
Mom, don't try, I don't like business and I'm not inclined towards it.
Who can start a project without capital these days?
At the vehicle and crane agency, he just said, "Let him point to what he wants."
Love is from God, and people love you because of their love for your father.
Even the university
All the doctors love and respect your father.
Most of them are in his council every night.
God willing, your father is loved by everyone, and you only look up to him.
My son, people borrow from banks to start a company or business.
Am I sitting in the supermarket?
You opened a pickle shop?
This is also a new thing.
This is a falcon, the apple of my eye, he brought them to me yesterday and said, "These are samples, try them."
He only took their agency yesterday.
"You se
He also told me that all businessmen like me, God loves all people just like you.
Yes, sir.
On my way to the office,
I saw a new supermarket.
They were preparing it.
I'll be fond of him.
I don't know whose it is.
Congratulations, Uncle Sakr, congratulations.
Divine providence watches over you.
In the name of God, In the name of God
Who is he to come as a partner and take it just because he is like that?
You can say "no" now.
So, what's going on?
What should I say?
Be his partner.
You don't know who his father is?
Who doesn't know his father!
I said, "I am a friend of Qasim Abbas. He asked me if you have experience in trade."
I said, "I have a bakery; praise be to God who provides for me from it."
No, no, I don't like the name.
I didn't notice that.
No, brother, the name is not nice.
So it's a fitting name for Iranian bread.
I understand, you piece of bread.
Qasim, we'll call it the Big Bread Bakery.
Wait for me a little.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too, my lord, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Excellent, excellent. Do you need anything or any assistance?
No, thank God, everything is fine.
Ayad, she is a new employee here!
My lady sent her car for repairs and came to take mine because she works as an advertising agent in a marketing company and cannot do without a car in her work.
You might need your car as well.
No, I don't need the car today.
Present, no problem.
This is the age of science, knowledge, and study.
I agree with Dr. Rashid's opinion that everyone should have sufficient knowledge in their field, whatever that field may be.
Excellent, Dr. Sami!
Yes, sir.
And study, and study.
Repeat what is written in the books.
He didn't study either business or economics.
He never read a book in his entire life, and I never saw a single newspaper in his hands, not even the %pw.
Everyone knows who Falcon is today.
I didn't want him to enter this business.
His uncle, Abu Nasser, is alive and present among you now.
He who loves him
But there are people who are born for trade and naturally love business.
You're right, Doctor!
God willing, Ya Saqr, you will be like your brother.
God willing, Karim will do it.
It's still early.
This depends on education.
No one can be like you, Doctor.
Be honest.
How did Falcon, who hates trade, easily reach that great economic sense?
If the world's population is counted today as seven billion, they will count it with them.
Do you know, Abu Sakr?
Saquar chose "The Financial Market Medal".
Peace be upon you
How are you, Nasser!
Mohammed called me and told me that Abu Nasser is in the hospital.
Do you remember when you once told me that you heard Falcon, son of Hawk, wants to take over the car dealership from his father?
You no longer own the agency.
And people are never satisfied.
My father helped him enter the market.
He opened his eyes to commerce.
Be informed that the doctor said his condition is critical.
It won't work.
Everything is possible.
She shocked or disturbed him, that's not my business, I tell you, you will divorce her, divorce her and you will divorce her.
These people were found in the 21st century.
We meet you, dear viewers, with one of the good and generous men in this country.
A man who knows the way to the poor and the deprived.
So we have the founder and owner of the Falcon Charity Society.
Then, when we speak, sir, of this organization,
We all know your noble goals that you seek to convey to the world, and of course to everyone.
Without hypocrisy or a desire for fame, seek refuge in Allah.
Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds, we were recently able to provide thirty sacrifices for our brothers in Africa.
Praise be to God, we are now ready for delivery.
Seven boxes of candy for our children in Gaza.
"Mā shā' Allāhu!" Oh, how magnificent! May Allah grant us many more like you!
We just left the house, my wife and I.
But my wife will be passing by for half an hour to open her new project.
And I will wait for her.
"Problem"
I enjoyed their company and loved spending time with them. I truly did.
And it's also the source of income for my children.
He is my whole life.
I think you want to waste my time.
Stay away from trouble.
Arabs are brave, Arabs are noble.
Come on, people!
These people were found in the 21st century.
These people were found in the 21st century.
If someone wants to dive, diving requires effort.
He needs brave men.
Souq Waqif lived
I deserve it, I deserve it, congratulations, congratulations.
May God watch over you all.
Masha'Allah, everyone loves you, Sheikh! Love is from God.
I want to say something, but just say yes.
On the occasion of the license, my son Shahin has to go to the exhibition and choose the best and most expensive car as a gift from me to him.
A breeze blew upon us from the valley's cleft.
O breeze, in the name of love, take me back home.
Hello, Fadi.
How are you, Anood?
No, no, no, no, no.
You told me the dress would be ready in a week, and yesterday you sent me a message saying it would take ten days! How stupid.
And you want your dress embellished with crystals, which takes longer.
And if God wills, you'll start talking to Alanoud and ignore me?
How many lights do we have?
No, no, no, no, no, let the whole world rage, but Anond will not rage.
What more do you need, Fadi? They're starting to get jealous.
Oh my God, I love the way they speak, I'm jealous of them, not like our people.
Don't let me forget about it.
Is my dress ready?
Here you go, Fadi.
Thank you, brother Fadi.
Brother Fadi, I'll pick up the dress from you next week, bye.
How can I assist you?
Send the dress to my house only.
No, I didn't like it.
God willing, today I went to Fadi in the neighborhood, he is doing wonderful work and the girls are coming and going.
Praise be to God, we have succeeded brilliantly in this project.
What's up?
Abu Nasser, my cousin.
What's wrong with him?
Look at the envy!
We never heard of him starting a business, so where would this bankrupt get the money from?
They opened their mouths, they devoured and pillaged!
And when he begins trading in his own time,
Are you sure?
I heard some rumors.
And if God wills, you will not do anything?
It's seven o'clock in the morning now.
Do you want them to bring you breakfast?
No, thank you, I've already had breakfast.
But I have something I'd like to talk to him about.
I heard that you...
You want to start a business.
I don't know anything about these matters, may God guide you, my son.
Design, women's fashion design, etc.
Who lied to you?
I am a businessman!
No, no, no, no, no, no, but I ...
You need advice, you need %pw I'm ready if you need any help.
Thank you, thank you, my relative! Thank you.
So forgive me, I must go.
Enter, my lord!
Let me know for the first time if you need a raise.
Indeed! Fadi cleaned the store. You're busy, as I see?
The shop is no longer sufficient.
You said you would rent the shop next door, so go ahead and take it.
I hope so.
Did they rent the store next to us?
Is there anyone named Khalaf Sultan Al-Seifi who is not your relative, Abu Nasser?
No, there isn't?
I come from the Ministry of Economy. I saw his name on a transaction with my friend, and his name is Essam, and he is responsible for his papers.
Women's fashion design
Are you sure?
I saw the lease and his name was written on it.
What don't you like about it? What don't you like about it? What don't you like about it?
What don't you like about him? What don't you like about him? What don't you like about him? There's a flaw in him.
Your sick heart didn't stop you.
When you saw my project succeed,
You said I should destroy it.
This is an open market for everyone.
Abu Nasser
What does the shepherd say?
And I was testing you, I told you, "Do you intend to start a project?"
I didn't lie to you, man.
Secrecy is the best policy.
I don't care about you or your demands.
But that won't get you there.
The man, those are the reasons for living, and each one takes his livelihood.
You hit me.
Come on, cousins.
No, no, no, Abu Saleh has crossed the line.
You hit me in my own home!
Open to everyone!
You are brothers.
My friend Ibrahim advised me.
Bring in a Lebanese designer.
I am a woman, ask me.
I know our women, they love Lebanese men.
Ah! Madam, this dress looks wonderful on you. No, no, no, this dress is quite different, there's nothing like it in all of Doha.
Those suit you, madam, and from these beautiful words, that piece which is worth a thousand is sold for thirty and forty thousand.
Yes, just do as he does.
As you know, the wardrobe I built last year when I brought in the Lebanese carpenter.
Ah! Madam, I will design for you a wardrobe unprecedented in all of Doha.
Look, if you want to succeed
What specifically is he suffering from?
Why don't you know?
This means he stole the customers.
What do you think about moving to another place, sir?
Don't mention it, don't mention it. Oh! Fadi.
By this time they will be playing by themselves.
This means that we were defeated, no!
We will confront them!
And we're winning our clients back, whether they like it or not.
Do you have money to pay?
I'll pay.
I'm ready to do anything.
But most importantly, don't defeat me.
The cost of the dress you chose is sixty thousand riyals.
Of course, without the necktie in the middle.
This is a gift from the designer, from me.
I've set it with a crystal stone for you. There are only fifty pieces of this crystal in the whole world, and this piece is very unique.
Of course there is no discount, our prices are world-famous.
No, of course not, who would do that?
Madam, wait, wait, what's the matter? What happened?
They have harmed us, O Saad, they have harmed us.
Is this something they do?
They killed us; we have no ride with the officials now.
This is called war, Abu Nasser.
We won't stand idly by!
We must fight them as they fight us, and also respond to them.
Tomorrow, I will take out a loan from the bank.
And I will start the war against them again, and you will see what I will do.
Abu Nasser won't stop him.
Look at the advertisement!
Look at the ad he's putting up!
We announce a special offer on wedding dresses, where the bride gets two evening gowns free with every wedding dress.
He made four evening dresses with each wedding dress.
We advertise in a quarter-page.
Look, he's publishing an ad that's half a page long.
I don't know what he intended to do!
Do you believe me, Umm Nasser?
For six days, not a single customer entered their store.
And they have not yet opened today, and this evening is also closed.
And you will hear that he has put his shop up for sale.
I will kill him, I will kill him.
Even they cannot sit there, he sat outside.
Alright, drink your tea and go to him.
What tea might God give you? I can't drink it, that's a problem.
Is there anyone who bears a grudge against you?
There is someone, God bless him, who intentionally sprayed this perfume scent all over the store.
And these are chemicals.
Are you sure someone sprayed perfume in the store?
You are cousins, you are adults, you are not children to behave like children.
He came at night and sprayed a foul smell in the store, is that fair?
I didn't spray anything, that's your perfume.
Do not cross the line.
I signed an undertaking at the police station.
Don't worry.
This time,
I prepared a hellish plane for him.
Without anyone noticing any mistake from me.
No, everything is fine.
This is what confuses me.
I swear I don't know what's going on, this is the fourth day in a row that not a single customer has entered our shop.
Oh God, this is not the place, we have to go to the other one, I have uncovered my face, we ask God to guide you.
And what did the doctor say to you?
The shop is empty, and no customers are entering the store.
I don't know what magic he did to him.
Women and girls do not approach the store.
As if magic had turned Sa'ad into a monster.
Possible, anything is possible these days.
He is an evil innovator.
Is he asleep or awake?
"Go and take a look, my brother. Go, I'm afraid the roof might collapse on us."
I lost, Sultan, I lost!
I don't know, turn him into a dog!
It turned him into a monster!
Calm down, brother! Don't get angry.
I don't know what he did.
My love, tell me what you did to him; they say his friends have started collecting money and paying off his debts.
Its designer
Not Lebanese
I told him, didn't I?
Don't you know where he is?
Stars are our destiny, and we seek them desperately.
Call the man again, he might have an emergency.
What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you, Uncle Ahmed?
What's wrong with you, Ahmed?! You're just sitting here while the director is shouting at me... What should I do? Where are the extras you said you'd bring today?
It's better for you to leave me alone, I've been thinking about it and it's giving me a headache, so I asked Abdullah's opinion.
First, don't shout. We're actors and we want to relax a bit, and we need to focus on our roles. Second, the man called more than once in front of me, just calm down.
What are you saying, Mr. Abdullah? What are you saying?
Oh! Mr. Abdullah, what should I do now? The director will end the scene and scream at me.
Okay, guys. Okay, guys.
We want to finish, but there are still some additional actors who were supposed to perform in the scene that are absent.
You don't want anyone to shout at you, is that understood?
Do your work quietly and without shouting.
Our neighbor has been shouting all morning. We need to focus.
I've found a solution for you.
What do you think about directing the scene yourself, and if God wills, I will bring you an actor who can perfectly embody the role?
It's true that he'll only appear in one scene.
But that scene is the most important scene in the series.
But your eyes are kind, sir, please take a shot right now.
But if you're not ready today, I'll back out.
Guys, let's go upstairs.
I'll tell you something, there's a Filipino, is that okay?
Abu Walid doesn't know, he will resign immediately. He needs someone who looks elite, and must be elite and Qatari.
Dude, he'll wear a gutra and igal, and no one will notice!
Are you serious, Alaa? You just want the easy way out. This is disrespectful to people's feelings and intelligence.
Alaa gave you all the responsibilities, distributed the tasks, and you'll be at ease.
Calm down so we can think. Rey, think with me, maybe you'll remember one of your friends.
Who is he?
Ahmad, do you remember anyone in the Sultanate district named Saud al-Shouk?
The same as the Saudi sidr bush.
Say: Saud is a can-do!
The manager said he needs a wealthy and respected man, and you say cans.
Dear, at the end of the day, it's just a bit part; you'll see a rich and distinguished man playing a bit part.
But with a simple decoration for Reem, dressing her in a bisht and clean, luxurious clothes, and a luxurious car.
Insha'Allah it is suitable.
How can we reach him?
I know their house.
Peace be upon you
Happy cans
So who is it then?
Yes, yes, yes, he is.
Yes, it's him, thank you very much.
And now, how are you going to do it, Mother? There's no other shawl besides this three-leaf one that Uncle brought from abroad.
My son, the cloak you wear is yours.
Oh son, it's here under my clothes in the closet.
What should I iron? People are waiting outside.
May God help you, my son.
Today I'm going to watch you on TV.
Yes, Mom, they said I'd be on TV as one of the elite.
Sit down, you miserable wretch!
Hey man, what are you doing? Spit on you!
Vaporizer, vaporizer.
Here it is, Mom.
Quickly, do you feel better, Mama?
God willing, my son.
God forbid, hopefully they will give you some money.
May God help you.
Call for me.
I'm bringing you Saudi cans and a Saudi laptop.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Is this Obeid, the son of Fatima, Obeid?
Hello, hello.
Is Saud happy?
Will he perform the scene?
Yes, yes, God willing, he will perform the task perfectly. Calm down and be quiet until they give you a complex role.
How is your mother doing?
She is not the same person who used to gather wild thorns.
Shame on you, shame on you, be quiet.
You're wearing glasses now.
You are an old man now.
You don't change, or I'll regret nominating you.
The man they brought to Abu Abdulaziz's house.
He is here, we will bring him to you, you are welcome, you are welcome, you are welcome.
Do your best, this is our manager, Mr. Ghafel Fadil.
The most important thing is not to be afraid of the camera.
Brother, I only fear God.
Don't worry, stay calm and listen to his instructions, and say yes to anything the manager tells you.
Brother! Brother! Please, you'll play the role of one of the elite, one of the rich, understand that or not?
Come here, boy, come here, boy!
I'm talking to you.
He is to a degree of foolishness, the role needs someone who is serious.
Everything is acceptable from certain people.
Ask me why I speak like this.
My brother, we bought this role for the shoot, listen to me, I'll take you to the makeup room now and rehearse you for the role.
Shame on you, shame on you, shame on you.
Come here, welcome.
Met her.
Stop, stop, stop here here!
Praise be to God that you are here, come in, come in.
The car you need for the scene is ready, boss.
Saoud will clean and organize everything.
We'll repeat it again, and the assistant manager is here to see you and assure the manager.
Imagine yourself as a well-known merchant.
You're saying this?
Yes, yes, I'll tell you, wait, wait don't rush, I didn't expect that from you Abu Abdulaziz! Say you're Abu Abdulaziz.
For our rights.
Beautiful, and you should know!
Brush my teeth, brother!
He will clean, and Abu Abdulaziz Falah Al-Marzooq, Jamil.
Beautiful, trust in God, think about it.
"And be guided by this book of mine, for it is the way for my daughter."
Don't bother trying to figure out why she got divorced.
Your daughter is divorced... Pretty? Pretty?
She is very beautiful, go ahead and consider yourself engaged, we don't marry.
Why don't I spit on him?
Great, you're amazing and he remembers everything, amazing.
Let %pw clean my teeth.
How? Why?
Ah! Man, the homeowners surprised us and they want it tomorrow, and the director decided we'll shoot the hall scenes first and then move outside later.
How is that? They don't want %PW!
Yes, they want to, they want to, but it's been postponed to a later time. They will shoot another scene, and we'll catch up with them, God willing.
Shall I ask them to bring you some tea?
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
Good morning, sir.
Hello, which tribe do you belong to, boy?
My name, sir, is Salem Abu Shwaik Al-Shwaiki
Known for being famous.
He deserved it.
My wide nostrils and my lips can also settle here.
Tell me, my brother, about the people with delicate noses nowadays,
I carry myself.
If it were someone else, he wouldn't stop laughing.
Keep this for a minute.
Hello, Mom.
My mother is very sick, I must go quickly, brother!
You'll go in that outfit.
I don't have time, I told you my mother is sick, she is very sick and !
Listen to me, you can go like this, but when I ask you to come, you must come at once.
He and I, we can't leave the place.
Present, present, I'll try to find a taxi, brother.
What's a taxi? If you searched for a taxi for an entire year, you wouldn't find one.
Learn that we rented the car for the scene.
As long as it's available, take it.
Brother, please give me the key! My mother is sick, give me the key, please.
In the car.
I need a two-seater sofa.
Wait, wait, I'll get a wheelchair now. Oh, dear!
Can I tell you something? Can I tell you something?
Very tired in the car, and I need a reclining seat, please help.
Where is the patient? Inside the car?
Oh! My child, what happened?
And in your silence, find comfort, do not speak, just look in silence.
Peace be upon you
Nothing's wrong, but my mother, your mistress, is suffering from asthma, quickly.
I'll tell them to make the bed.
Alright, alright.
Do not burden yourself.
"Glorified and Exalted is He! Is He not sufficient for you? What have you done?"
Good! Wise.
Take care of our son, Rashid.
As you wish, come with me, Mr. Rashid.
Come with me, Mr. Rashid.
And I'll take Mr. Rashid and do what's necessary for him.
This is what we expect from you.
I'll tell the nurse to come and ask you what you'd like to drink, Your Highness.
Come with me, Oh! Mr. Rashid
Sorry.
What should I do, there are so many people, just wait!
The problem is that no one cares about us.
Sir, what would you like to drink? Tea, coffee, or cappuccino?
You're not the first, Nasser. Nasser married a Filipina nurse in the hospital.
Who told you I was rejected?
A woman gives me neither her attention nor herself.
They philosophize and ask for a lot.
He doesn't have a certificate, I don't want your mother, what?! I don't want your mother! Go and find your friends.
Oh! Brother, there's a girl in the hospital, I like her.
If she ignores you, look for another one.
I can't, my brother, my heart is hanging.
Do you think your brother has fallen for her? When I see him, I believe it.
Give this to Dr. Mohammed.
What's wrong with you!
Go now.
May God curse you.
Your Excellency, my aunt is now in good health.
You are a professional actor, Saud, come on!
Bravo, do you see how they applauded and praised you?
Now, go and change your clothes and remove your makeup.
Ah! Man, forget it, come and sigh for me here first.
Yes, from now on, my name is Falah Al-Marzouz.
Forget this and write Saud.
Saud died.
From now on, my name is Fahad Al-Marzouq, Abu Abdulaziz.
May God bless you, my dear.
One buffet!
I translated two.
I even heard one of the bride's relatives say, "Wow, they are so stylish, I don't think anyone can do something similar to what they did at the wedding."
In the name
Look at this, Mama.
I have to bring them something on the occasion of my wedding contract signing.
What's wrong, Mother?
Look at your brother who will bring us disgrace!
Oh, the shame, by the way, it's cheap.
Rather, this depends on our balance, and it aligns with it.
Leave this matter for the servants to eat.
He wants to joke with us.
I was happy to see him.
This type is the free class, dedicated to the upper crust of society.
Around above average.
No, we want something unusual, something not everyone can do.
Sorry, ma'am, you can't blame those who don't know your capabilities.
Be quiet... Be quiet, you don't know anything.
I'm afraid the money I have isn't enough.
Don't embarrass us, pay with the credit card.
What about this luxury, it's very sophisticated.
Yesterday, Saleh signed his marriage contract.
Salih Nasser
I am at your service, I am at your disposal.
He's coming to you.
They reserved the small dance hall and the food was disgusting.
Very cheaply
What she said about the Saeed's wedding,
Certainly, everyone is saying the same thing.
This is what scares me!
My dear sister,
He cares only about money.
And he doesn't care what people say.
He wants to joke with us.
But we're supposed to provide something that fits within our budget and circumstances.
Do you know that some people borrow money and sell their homes and cars just to have an extravagant wedding and prevent people from talking about them?
Leave it to us... cheap chocolate is enough to embarrass us with.
You said the manager liked the Chinese food, so he took it home.
Alright, if the bride's family says that we'll choose the ballroom, the theater, and we'll prepare everything ourselves.
And you think we will choose what!
No, nothing, but the store we went to before has a very good price.
On the other hand, this store designed Abu Dhahb's wedding.
Has anyone used it before?
Be honest once.
At the wedding of a protected, blessed daughter.
No, no, no, we don't want anything used.
I need a theater that we'll be the first in the world to use.
That means you want to excel.
Show me what you've got.
This stage is used for the first time in Qatar.
Inspired by the information revolution, like Facebook and Twitter.
Very modern and new.
How much does this theater cost including the rest of the arrangements?
I'll calculate it for you now, but it's not less than one hundred and twenty-five thousand.
Mom, mom, we can't afford it, everything has to be fancy, good, and of the best quality, and all of that costs a lot of money.
Everyone did that.
Please be quiet.
What is the decision?
Did you like this?
This is Noah's Ark.
Both are new, but Noah's ship is twenty thousand more expensive.
No, God bless your parents, I think the mouse stage is much better.
Be quiet, no, I need Noah's Ark.
These are the costs of marriage. We are from the middle class.
Do I have to pay one hundred and five thousand riyals for the theater hall and another one hundred and five thousand riyals for the ballet dance hall, the royal hall that you also call?
I didn't say a box, but why all this show-off and everyone wants to boast to others and everyone wants to outdo what others have done.
It's a battle of pride, and the only beneficiaries are wedding hall owners.
Who knows that everyone wants to be special, exploiting us and lying to us.
I swear I know one of my friends who says his brother has a wedding supplies store.
He said that the theater wouldn't cost more than two thousand riyals.
I'm just waiting for this moment when his father says *yes*.
Alright then, do something.
Like other married men who take care of themselves.
Hello Sheikh, we are honored by your presence.
How are you?
I know you love excellence.
That's why I'm reaching out to you now.
First time in Qatar, designed by international artist Peter Salomon.
A collection inspired by the nine planets.
I am from the Solar System.
You'll look absolutely stunning with a Noah's Ark platform.
There is no harmony like it; you will be the first in Qatar to use the nine planets.
Alright then.
It was one hundred and fifty thousand ... and now?
Alright then.
May God have mercy on you.
As you wish
Expenses are high, my brother.
By the way, I couldn't get the full eighty thousand.
All I could gather was sixty thousand, and I took twenty thousand from my brother.
Thank you, thank you very much, my brother! O Fahd.
How can I sort things out, Fahd! As long as we boast at weddings, we'll remain in trouble.
Without boasting.
Of course, you will receive the invitations you want.
Yes, this week, God willing, we will start sending out the invitations.
Our wedding will be more beautiful than theirs.
Looking at the invitations your son chose for the wedding, Mama.
Where does your brother live?
People now travel to countries just to design their invitations.
Contrary to the Amina family, who traveled to Italy to design their invitations, they printed them on their way back. The same goes for the Manar family.
They traveled to France; even non-rich people go to Lebanon to get their invitations.
The system works like this in the country, do you want us to be different?
So, which country would you like to travel to?
We saw some wonderful invitations.
Wonderful, it's expensive, but...
Only her, in particular, and no one has done it before.
Glitter, I love it.
Gold will be much better, it sparkles.
Oh brother, if he can't afford the wedding expenses,
Why did he put himself in that situation?
And leave all this extravagance and boasting in celebrations, and all these expenses that have no benefit.
In it, the hotels and wedding planners are the only ones benefiting from our madness.
That's him, he's leaving now, his tenderness.
I'll go get him, maybe no one will be there to take him.
Come, let me ride you.
Thank you, Abu Nasser!
Brother, the bride's family has to be with you.
I tried once, just once.
I said there that a dance hall is not needed in a very distinguished hotel.
Why did you find our daughter on the street when the others are no better than her?
That's the problem, everyone is looking at each other.
Who told you I got married?
They are all sisters, they are all brothers.
It's all about a simple party and some minor expenses.
And the phrase "Afa alaikum al-salam" translates to "And upon you be peace..." Today, Facebook has become the children's workshop for translating texts from and to Arabic, English, and French.
Cheaper and at a lower price
This means you won't marry from your country.
Forget her, do you want me to go crazy?
You will see.
If I don't attend Abdullah Roaished or Nawal at my son's wedding.
God damn her, she'll never be better than me.
I want to ask you something, dear.
If your son has a Rashid number, give it to us so we can contact him.
So, dear, thank you very much, goodbye.
Mom, we agreed on the DJ's music, why did you change your mind?
And will Um Nasir be better than me?
Did you forget who she is and our identity?
Those who were below us have become better than us.
It's not as you say, Mother. Look at my brother Saleh, he's breaking my heart, and we're not putting too much pressure on him.
By God, he broke my heart.
Oh, really!
In the hospital! Which hospital and when.
I don't know, suddenly she fell without saying anything.
She heard this and threw herself to the ground.
She has no right, and no one can blame her after she prepared everything and informed people. He simply told her that he doesn't want to get married.
He wants to embarrass us.
What did the doctor say?
He embarrasses us, he wants to cancel the wedding.
Insha'Allah, everything will be alright.
Don't break her heart.
My son, you are a man, and your livelihood is to earn a living!
Go, go and put it out for her.
I swear, if I told Abu Yusuf, his heart would stop beating.
You know why the minister is still holding on to Abu Yusuf.
On the one hand, he should have retired three or four years ago.
There's nothing wrong, he's going to help me.
I swear you're crazy.
Do you understand what I want from him now?
And he will let him hide the papers and documents until he returns the money to me.
They call it amount cooling postponement.
I won't speak, and I don't know why you're alarmed.
No need to worry, I'll pay you back by the end.
Do you know what they call me? Do you know what they call me?
The disciplined, the disciplinarians.
Uncle, uncle, I tried, but there's no other way besides this one.
If I give you then the auditors later,
They are tough on audits, they'll get me, quickly, quickly.
Quickly, the board, the board, the board.
You ate, you ate the date.
No, no, God willing, from 7:30 we will be in the dance hall to receive guests.
Yes, yes, we will definitely be there.
I will throw a wedding for my son that will be talked about all over Doha.
Link!
So, dear Fatima, I'll talk to you later.
I'm worried about you from those who oppose you, woe to them tomorrow when you enter upon them with the force.
So, Mom, is the length of the dress okay?
The police arrived!
God willing, there's nothing wrong.
Stay put, officer, I'll be back soon.
"May God be enough for you, Salwa."
Forget everything about your wedding.
From the marriage cage to the prison cage.
They found the document I hid for your loan. I was suddenly discovered.
Why are you angry!
You'll hear about many more disasters than this.
So, what's being said!
A respectful and dedicated employee
Whoever loves their job, the ministry contracted a company to perform maintenance.
He asks about the materials from his concern for his work, so the employee goes and wonders.
He learned that its price was four hundred thousand.
He will save the ministry one million six hundred thousand.
The minister punished the man! No, no, no, I don't believe it.
Why don't you believe him!
Here is Saad.
Of course, he has all the news.
He dismissed him from work.
What has happened to the world? Where are the values?
They say he called his office manager.
He told him: "Let her work in place of Uthman."
And who is she?
She is the daughter of the manager of the same company that submitted the maintenance offer.
Any Uthman has been monitored.
No, no, no, no, this is unbelievable.
You're always surprising, Saleh!
Who does this company belong to?
For whom?
We became like this!
What do you say!
What does this have to do with the poor employee Uthman? What did he do wrong?
His fault is that he is honest and truthful!
Do you think the manager is in his office?
Yes, he left just now.
What is corrupting the world!
We started seeing some strange people.
I agree with you, Uthman doesn't deserve it... but there's nothing we can do.
It's not fair, sir. He has seven children and doesn't have a passport.
He lives off this job! What will he do now and where will he go?
Do you know what happened?
The new employee appointed by the minister.
I entered Uthman's office and started working, and poor Uthman came to take his belongings, so I prevented him and told him to go and I would send his belongings with the tea boy.
Where is he now?
Things have changed! Oh Uthman?
This is the reward!
This is God's will.
Praise be to Allah, the Able, the Most High.
Oh God, the Generous, the Merciful! Oh Uthman, God will not abandon you, goodbye.
What's wrong with you? Can't you hear properly!
I know, I know you're a very sensitive person.
What is this work! I can't work, I'm leaving now.
And a chance for my mom to come and bring you things.
I don't want you to stay upset like this.
Why are you shouting in my face? I'm your mother.
I'm not shouting at you, I'm asking you.
How is this allowed? By what right do you go with him? Is he your husband, your father, or your brother?
The world has changed, where do you live?
I don't know, Mama!
You're crazy.
People liberated themselves, and the world became a small village. Where do you live?
But what can I say!
Be modern, live in the present, and don't be backward.
Hurry up and get the things from the car! Go and don't look at me, lock it.
Nothing's wrong! Saleh, what's happened to you?
No, you're not well today.
You shouted at the poor maid, and it wasn't her fault.
You know I didn't mean it.
No, no, no, I'm not hungry.
To forget the disasters I've seen.
My love, don't cry.
The president is a little angry.
Your visit makes us happy, Your Excellency.
Thank you, thank you very much.
Perseverance and diligence
Correct, wow.
The most important thing,
The most important thing for me in this ministry
Correct! Sir.
Tell me, what's the use of an official who doesn't accept bribes?
It is false.
Therefore I want you all.
No place for loyal, principled people with outdated values.
If I ever discover
He will blame himself alone.
Justice is a principle, regardless of the reaction!
Therefore, I want you to work with me cooperatively.
If you find doubt
Just tell me.
We are thieves and sons of thieves, and no one can match our sisters.
If Nora doesn't take a bribe in one day, she'll steal government tea before leaving work.
Excellent, excellent, bravo. This is what I expect from all of you, I don't want her to be the only one like this, I want all of you to be like her.
Divine providence watches over you.
Therefore, I want you to leave the finance department and become my office manager.
Be honest, you know how to choose, you've chosen the right thief for the right place.
Enough, O mother of Saud, enough, do not torment me any more.
I don't want to live in a prison.
"Enough, God protects me from him. The devil tempted me and made lying seem attractive to me."
And he told me to be honest.
You are a father.
Why did you tire yourself with honesty and loyalty?
You were a thief and a wastrel all your life.
Praise be to God that I didn't become a scholar.
I want to talk to your father.
Never do it.
One on the straight path, who dodges, steals, and slips through like a hypocrite to live in comfort.
My father is in prison because all his money is illegal.
Cease, cease
Is this something we wear!
We are a respectable family.
Shame on you.
Where is your stomach?
Why isn't it exposed?
You are not shy, you are shameless.
I'm too shy to wear it, brother.
Are there any shy girls these days?
Why are you shouting?
Look at what your daughter is wearing!
Is there any respectable lady who wears such a thing?
Will you walk in the street without showing any part of your body?
What annoyed me about her was that she didn't listen to what I said.
I've never hesitated to offer support here.
I bought her some transparent clothes that she doesn't need.
I warn you, if I ever see you wearing anything above the knee.
Since you are aware of the situation, never blame me for the consequences.
We are here, God bless you.
Insha'Allah, he is every girl's dream boy and a bad boy.
He is like his father.
As you can see in front of you.
He is a very good man, how can we find someone like him?
Don't worry, Uncle, I'm fine.
A man is not defined by his legs. Originally, I love my daughter Sarah very much and care about her future.
We didn't hear about it until later.
Praise be to God, her reputation is very bad.
I came home at 3:30 a.m.
I arrived home at 5 a.m.
Hello, hello, what! Hello.
Come and get me from the bar.
Start your car's engine and come pick me up from the bar.
This is the first time I've seen a father who doesn't obey his son.
Stop, father. I'll work the car, I'm waiting for you.
Mary, I love you.
I love you too, I disappeared, I disappeared, I disappeared.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Simple, simple, his father, my father is here.
Where is he?
He is brave, unlike my father who doesn't joke with anyone.
Meet my friend, Majid.
No, Father, Abdulaziz was my former friend.
Welcome, please come in, it's time for tea.
The Arabic and Israeli satellite channels
Many Palestinians discovered they hadn't cut their nails.
According to what the State of Palestine maintains within the framework of the comprehensive peace agreement,
In any case, the United Nations meets today to discuss Israel's request to send special inspection committees to inspect Palestinian fingers.
To know if their nails are long or not.
A condition that there is nothing that cuts, causes injury, or draws blood.
State of Palestine
I call on the entire international community to visit Palestine.
Comprehensive Peace Agreement
It was made of cinnamon.
And the olive tree, O man.
We press olives like this, like this we press olives.
We and our Arab brothers call upon the international community
To form a committee to inspect Palestinian nails.
And now, let's begin the voting.
No, no, no, no, it doesn't come to this, no.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Salih, Salih, what's wrong?
What did you dream about?
I dreamed of the upside-down world.
Ah! Rashid, you must be a strong character.
Now oh! Brother, what number is this school you're going to work at tomorrow?
I am a teacher like you.
Why haven't I changed my school since I started teaching?
What about personality, brother?
But the problem is his weak personality.
By the way, the teachers who were with him were the ones who complained about him.
To that extent, brother!
That's why you see him calm.
Then he started teaching.
It wasn't ketchup, it was mayonnaise with %Pw.
Oh! Brother, we're not talking to you to make you angry.
We're telling you because this is your last chance.
And he told me, "I accepted Rashid despite his weak personality."
Hesitant, and yet very good.
He is still a citizen.
Why are you so quiet, brother?
Because everything you say is true.
Everything you say is true.
From tomorrow,
The new Mr. Rashid
Mr. Rashid,
You are absolutely right.
The matter was forgotten.
And from the next day,
Yes, this is good. What's next?
He will tell you.
I am a teacher who does not like mistakes.
We said, for example, if a boy jumped up and said to you what the other boy said at your previous school, and the inspector was there.
And take your bag.
Slowly, slowly, you break the door.
Well, one learns from one's mistakes.
From the first minute,
He will tell you.
I'm nervous.
It belongs to me!
Silence!
It seems he just said, "Shut up!"
Did you hear him?
Tell him that Mr. Rashid let me out.
It seems he said, "It doesn't matter to me," but he will find out. I don't want to see your face here in class.
Teacher, don't you know who he is?
Who is his father?
Here comes Mr. Rashid.
Did you see him?
Teacher, the problem is that if he tells his father.
Okay, where do you usually see him sitting?
You might find him sitting in the chair area.
Above the chairs.
Chairs, chairs.
By the end of the day, a human.
But you shouted in my face!
Friends joke, and you're joking with me.
My father is out of the country and will be back next week. I'll tell him when he returns.
No, no, no, no, Abdel Rahman, God protect you.
We are friends. Besides, the garden strawberry is very delicious, you might not like it. It has a slight sourness, but it's wonderful.
Alright, go and get it quickly.
The only thing I fear is that he will tell his father.
I said he was outside.
Yes, he's outside. His father won't be back? That means they took his father's things and kicked him out!
I hope there won't be dire consequences.
I carried his bag and took it to him, gave him my phone number, and said, "If you need anything, call me. I'm your friend."
Yes, but.
Yes, but what?
You are the ones who told me.
Scream and pretend to be strong.
The bathroom, the bathroom, the bathroom.
Ah! Rashid!
Nami, you can sleep, nami, don't tire yourself, sleep.
Mr. Abu Nasser, Mr. Rashid is in the bathroom.
One juice.
Come, come, come, come, give me.
Go, quickly.
Put them on the table.
That all people are equal.
Therefore, I've gathered you to hear your opinions about the party.
How can anyone tame a boy?
"That will lead us to problems," he calls out.
It's three o'clock.
This, hello. I hung up, I really feel like he was joking.
Faster, faster.
Peace be upon you
Stand up for the inspector, sit down.
Yes, I am at your service.
Ah! Teacher, come here, come here!
Are you done screaming?
I'm not mocking, man! I'm just asking if you're done.
Whether I am finished or not, where is the teacher's authority? By your actions, you are humiliating yourself and the teaching profession.
Present, present, okay, okay.
And you raise your voice?
Yes, I raise my voice, you first need to know who this boy is?
Faster, faster.
Just two cars.
Two cars, no, no, I want four or five cars. Supply, supply, we have plenty of space. Go, go, go.
He thinks he owns the neighborhood!
Abu Nasser used to do it and sometimes he wouldn't.
May God help him.
I'm the boss here.
Knows that Abu Nasser
We used to give all the teachers extra classes.
Except me.
Who is the principal of the school here?
You are the manager, we ask God for your success, what's wrong with you?
Put your leg down.
I didn't put it on your head, on the chair, my friend.
What do you mean?
No need, I swear I want to ease your burden.
What do they call it?
So, what are we going to do with you now?
Improve your behavior for your own sake, or you will attend extra classes whether you like it or not.
What's wrong with you, go, go, go, get out!
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. I'm going out.
As you like, we've told you, man!
We must put a stop to it.
Wait, people of the Earth, wait.
Do not blame us, O Abu Sulaym.
Ah! Abu Naif, you're the neighborhood chief and it's your responsibility to stop him from overstepping his bounds.
I am not my father's son.
You'll see what I'll do with it.
Faster, faster.
Goodbye, Judge.
Wow, when did he buy this new car?
I told you, but you didn't believe me.
He shaved his mustache and his face turned red.
Do you believe that when he came, I didn't recognize him, but when he spoke, I recognized him by his voice.
Did you know he got a promotion at work last week?
He is responsible for eight schools for boys and girls.
What is this magical secret? Ask him to tell you, what is the secret that got him out of the bottom!
I've been telling you this since day one.
When I teach, I don't want to hear a sound.
No breath.
Follow the rules.
And you too answer me, you too argue with me. Get out of my sight, get out, get out, GET OUT!
When you are appointed a minister, look for a good staff to work with you.
So don't tell me to come and take this job.
Either the other job, no brother give me options, different jobs and I will choose the job most suitable for me.
My brother is a minister!
I swear I'm not at peace after the call I received.
Everyone congratulates me.
What they say, Mama, may God guide you.
This is very common. Each minister automatically employs their friends and acquaintances.
From this side, there is no need to worry, I am pleased to meet you.
They know that I will become a minister.
So they bribe me, this is a disguised bribe.
Wealth will come to us, a treasure, a treasure that will open up to us.
The vast earth.
Come on, let's all go congratulate the new minister.
Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!
Congratulations, Your Excellency the Minister.
By your blessings, congratulations.
Congratulations, sir. You deserve it.
He deserved it, oh! Your Excellency the Minister.
Oh brothers, the responsibility is great. May God help us bear it.
As they say, you are very qualified for this job.
You left after the phone call with Abu Saleh.
He was far from him.
Forget it.
I was shocked to see the extent of his love for him now!
And Abu Sultan is not naive.
Yes, I opened the car door for him.
Bravo, you've done a lot!
We are waiting for our brother to become a minister.
I told you, Mother, but you don't believe me.
You were saying they were café stories, café stories.
After her husband's death, she said that I envied her husband.
God forbid, God forbid.
Yes, you have nothing to say, you have nothing.
Mom, let's walk, I'm bored.
What do you mean by "none of your business"?
All you have to do is relax.
I cut off their conversation because they were bothering me.
Yes, they are right.
But I didn't want to say that in front of my mom, you know my mom, she'll tell everyone.
She said, "I heard everything, they call me the filter, we don't want a scandal."
What guarantees do you have, if excluded from power, that they will appoint you to the position?
Because I asked.
If he's out of the office, you'll be the first candidate.
What guarantees do you have that they will expel him?
No, I'm quite sure about that.
Don't remember, I saw him outside the office just as I see you now in front of me.
You will amaze him with what you do.
But the plan in my head is foolproof and effective.
Burn and kick plan
I'll make him attend every event that happens in the country.
Now they will burn him, and when he is burned, he will be out of work. And when he is out of work, he will be expelled.
I swear to you, brother, I don't know how or what to tell you!
Your visit is called participation that reflects how much you love your country.
Do you believe that?
Today you are a statesman, and you must always be present.
You must participate in everything, I'm sorry, sir, sorry, sorry.
Before I forget, thank you for the lamb you sent me yesterday.
Come with your dignity. This is a simple sheep, it's not your level. With your dignity, what do you see? Are you with me today?
The man is waiting for you outside!
Be honest.
I don't want to go.
I am sick, I am tired of awe, I am tired of it.
You are the minister today, he is right. As he said, you are a distinguished figure, so do something that will earn you admiration!
God sends you this kind man.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Don't take my picture.
Take, take
Today I accompanied him to a poetry night and a wedding reception, and at least a hundred photos were taken of him.
I'll also tell him about a great place we can go to.
Listen, I've also arranged a great educational activity for you.
Yes, like this. Let it shine, I want it to shine, shine, shine until it glitters. I am looking for this brilliance.
Seller, thank you and a blessed Eid, a blessed Eid, from the blessings of the bicycle. %PW Picture, picture, your happiness. Take a picture, take it. Don't take my picture, I'm far away, take it.
This is the bicycle.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. A blessed beginning and a thousand blessings. His Highness congratulates you.
Picture... Picture... That's right... Your flesh is my flesh, my lord.
"Nothing, God bless you."
Go to the second page.
No, he doesn't know him.
It's a national participation.
Say, "Everyone acts according to their own inclination."
This is the fourth friend who has called me today.
Everyone praises your activities, O Mother of Khalid, they call you the active social activist.
Yesterday, I heard a word that hurts me.
The party that Abu Sultan took me to last night.
A celebration of the children's swimming victory.
Someone was talking to his friend.
They thought I hadn't heard them.
This minister said
I want to buy a birthday present for my nephew.
Hello, hello.
I see you, sir, in the newspaper every day.
Correct, correct,
You have illuminated this place with your presence, I will give you a discount on everything you want.
Whether you want to pay or not, that's fine.
This means you won't be wandering around and going out with your minister.
I, I am Abu Saleh, the minister.
Abu Sultan didn't come to pick me up, I'm waiting.
And he sat me in the front row, then went to the car to rest.
We don't want anything from him, may God guide you.
"Maryam, hope that God keeps your family safe. Ask Him. You want to make sure they're okay, don't you? I'll come back later once I'm certain."
And you are calling yourself.
People offer us discounts.
I told you.
This job is great.
But let this man come and take me!
The minister's excellence annoyed me, may God damn him.
Hello, hello Minister.
No, but I'm a bit tired today.
If you're very enthusiastic, we're at your disposal.
We are at your service, but my brother Saad will take you and show you around, and I hope he can find a party or something for you.
Then a party?
No, no, we have no activity today.
No, we don't.
Okay, where can we find?
Yes. Thank you, thank you.
Is there anyone we can ask?
Go, may God assist you.
Sleep and rest.
A moment of happiness.
Is there anything, even henna?
Yes, this is good.
There might be extra time.
Take it! Put it in the cabin and look for a photographer to take some pictures of his face.
Agreed. Agreed, with safety.
What did you find for him?
As far as I know, it's a reserve league match. Let him go to the stadium alone!
What does this mean! This minister is a breath of fresh air for us!
Beautiful, this means he has reached the summit.
His end drew near when he became the talk of the town.
Your Excellency, he has become much more popular than you.
Your Excellency, if you go anywhere and take Abu Saleh with you.
Oh, my lord!
His star shines brightly.
We'll turn it off and return it to its normal size.
The minister came, came, came. The minister came.
Don't take pictures! Don't take pictures! I swear to God, if any of you take my picture, I'll hit you. I'm not leaving.
Brock breaks their cameras, I don't want pictures.
She sends you her greetings.
As they say, I missed the train.
This is my brother Khalid.
"There is no power or might except by Allah."
Why?
This is the first time I've seen him.
First glimpse!
I haven't seen him in years.
Oh God
Is this my cat?
I haven't seen him for a long time, come to me, dear.
What can I do? He's so attached to her.
"There is no power or strength except with Allah; you return to the same question."
Get out, get out, and don't give me a headache. I came back from the wedding at 3 a.m.
Just let me rest and don't make a big deal out of it.
Your brother is a girl.
I swear I'll tell my father. Look at yourself, you look like a girl.
It means he was playing, playing.
Yes, he was playing, I assure you he was playing with the makeup set.
And I will deal with this, Saud, as it suits him.
Poor Khalid, I wish all children were like him.
About these campaigns and nonsense he fabricates about his brother.
Come here, dear brothers, come and say hello.
How are you, dear?
No, dear, we won't be traveling to Spain this summer.
Who are you addressing?
Fahd is from Kuwait.
Hello, Hamada!
Listen to what I say.
"There is no power or might except by Allah."
I'll leave it to dear Amal to choose for herself.
But in reality, what do you see?
I say that the one overlooking the sea is the best.
So that in the near future, when we buy a yacht, we can sail it directly from our home to the sea.
We and our children.
Please, you must decide on the wedding date.
It's okay, it's just a year and a few months.
What faults your brother has is that he uses too much perfume.
Amal, frankly, I've noticed that your brother Khalid, I don't know.
But he is quite different from your brother Saad.
Different or not, my dear, everyone is free to act as they please.
And your fiancé is backward, he doesn't know that there is a unisex perfume.
Let your fiancé keep his opinion to himself!
I don't care.
I don't believe her, Khalid!
It's not the perfume that you use like women.
You even use their colors.
Why are you doing this, Khalid?
Sure, you have nothing to say.
Mom, why don't you want to believe anything about him? Don't you see his actions and behavior?
Unisex perfumes are now common.
This is me warning you.
Have you seen the Bluetooth?
I heard about it from my friends in the council; they say it's very common in Doha.
I've heard about it, show us.
You have to watch it and I'll tell you later.
Look how this girl dances!
Look at the movements!
Those are girls! Look at the one who says she dances well and does some moves, do you know who she is? She's Khalid's cousin's daughter.
The gift is for my dear cousin Khalid.
Okay, you'll see my work in it.
Wait for his brother Saad now.
Why? Let him come and you'll see... Let Saad come! I'll send him the Bluetooth so his family can watch it.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, hello, hello.
Of course you were defeated.
Why is my cousin sitting so far away?
Is your Bluetooth on?
No, but I'll send you something.
No, thank you, Amira.
He ran away from his family.
Are you crazy, Saad?
And I will travel tomorrow.
You won't see my face in this country.
Where are you going alone? (Proverb) Where are you going alone? (Proverb)
What will people say?
They will say that their son left them and traveled, and you don't want to cause us a scandal!
Oh, really?
And what your son Khalid has done is a honor and a source of pride!
Isn't the man who turned himself into a woman a scandal?
I can't face people if they say this is my gay brother.
Tell him that he travels for medicine, or study, or work, or even suicide.
The most important thing is that I don't live in a place where scandals chase me every day.
So, where are you headed?
I don't care where I go.
This is the end.
The other one, we don't know where he is, and this one here is packing his bag to travel.
Not even we know where he's going?
What did you expect it to be?
What's wrong with you? I came to check on you, and you respond with harsh words that break my heart!
I was telling you to take care of him.
Don't leave him in the care of the servants.
You don't know anything about him and you were busy.
And your father is busy with his work and has left the responsibility to you.
You are right, Mother.
Have you made things easy for your sister?
In this, you are correct.
What Khalid did is a disgrace to us among people.
I don't see anyone.
Did you say anything to him?
That is my father's greatest sin.
We are dealing with the strange and bad question of immortality.
I didn't tell him.
Burn it to a CD and give it to him.
Only when I go to the airport.
I'm very worried about him.
Our house doesn't reach that level of hopes!
Do not be amazed.
Khaled and his companions don't care about their families' reputations.
And the reputation of their brothers and sisters.
Whatever religious values call them
And they go away dancing and singing.
In the evil swamp
Go away! My son, I am in doubt.
Goodbye, my father.
Take care of yourself, my son.
Yes, Father, I have a small gift for you.
A gift for me!
Now he put the CD in the laptop, I'm afraid of what will happen, come with me!
Beware, my mother.
I can't believe Dad is still watching the documentary, it's only three minutes long.
He may go out.
Where is he going? He doesn't have enough time to go anywhere.
Answer me... What's wrong with you, Abu Saad?
Daddy!
Aww, Amal.
And if I search, I won't find.
To find someone with your moral compass.
But forgive me.
May God help you.
I see you looking out the window!
Yes, my love.
We live in the age of freedom.
The age of human rights, and no one owes us anything.
If anyone has one riyaal, he can take a thousand, oh beloved of the soul.
I can certainly handle her. God bless America.
Do you know that salaries are high now?
It is twelve hundred.
Glory to Him, the Most High, He is sufficient for you against them. Every time you speak to a driver and ask him: "What is your salary?"
My salary is very low.
When he sees me, he starts complaining, my salary is low and not worth it. We agreed with him that his salary was seven hundred and we increased it by a hundred when he got the license, what more does he want?
I told him, "When you've worked for a year, we'll increase your salary."
He seems greedy, and we'll have a hard time dealing with him.
Shut up, shut up, just keep your mouth closed, just be quiet, just be quiet, send him back and get rid of him.
This word is easy for you, easy.
You'll let him ruin it for us, I hate going out with him in the car.
Alright, leave it to me.
You have now told me the story, I am the man of the house. Be quiet, enough, you too be quiet, I will handle the matter.
Get up, I want you outside, get up!
Come and pitch.
What did I tell you?
I told your friends not to come to your room. Didn't I?
President, this is not my friend, this is my uncle.
He will come for five minutes and will leave, God willing.
Five minutes!
And keep it in your memory!
Don't tell Miss that I want a raise! I want a raise.
Everything in the world is expensive now.
And when did I give you eight hundred?
Boss, I have a lot of problems at home.
Drivers in Doha earn one thousand one hundred and one thousand two hundred.
It can be three thousand one hundred.
Wait, I'll think.
Listen, I'll raise one hundred percent and shut up, I won't raise against you.
You say I've raised you a hundred times over. Go find yourself a job!
What did he say?
I'll tell you.
It has no benefit out of a hundred.
It has no benefit from one hundred and ten.
I feared a screen.
Why are you afraid?
All drivers fled.
Because they work outdoors for three thousand or four thousand hours.
What's the problem? When you work in a house, you won't benefit anything, but you earn more money when you work outside.
I'm very scared.
Look at these, they are all drivers.
How much is the price?
2500
But I am afraid of the police who will arrest me and imprison me in jail.
No, don't be afraid.
I will support you.
I was wearing my cloak and about to go out.
I was calling, but no one answered me.
He opened his room and found the closet empty.
Monira's maid ran away for a year.
Allah will suffice him.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Very well, I will come to you.
I went to the police.
If you report, you will have no further responsibility.
We will do our best.
And also search around the neighborhood, you might see him and let us know.
Yes, he will make money and when he is satisfied, he will surrender himself.
We bring them here, spend money on them, clothe them, feed them, and teach them how to drive.
It's none of his business.
The game starts now, come in, you'd better be inside the field.
Yes, we were worried.
These are foxes, and a fox is not easily caught.
Do you know that if more than three don't sign up, it means we haven't won, we need ten or fifteen.
This is a clear mockery, a clear mockery. Let's be clear, it's a clear mockery.
That's his level. If he doesn't score more than three, it's not the Foxes team.
Take it from me.
In Vienna, in the players and in the performance.
They don't have anything. They should thank God if they get less than three. They should thank God.
Any goal, these are just appetizers. Our team is still hungry, this is the Foxes team, leave us alone, man.
You scored a goal now, you are relaxed and happy now.
Do you think there are also some goals or is it the end of the road?
This fox is very good, it's very smart. It goes here and there and no one can catch it, you'll feel dizzy. This fox eats chickens.
No, I don't have a car.
You are my friend.
Did you hear what he said?
This fox said it's a big problem.
You can't grasp it.
Yes, sir!
Don't you know him or what?
He is a Foxes fan.
He sometimes appears on the "Activate Yourself" show.
They will win today and you will lose.
I will definitely hit you. The fox team never loses, it's always the winner.
"Thalob, what do you think about the result today?"
Why are you asking me about the result?
It's over, Fwaisat is the winner.
The birds came to take their food and then flew and flew.
Let's get back to reality a bit, and don't say the foxes won and flew away.
Those are foxes, my friend.
The fox takes the chicken and eats it.
You didn't see what he did on the field, sir.
The audience never stops laughing at him.
Clear on the field and thank you for listening.
The true fan who has genuine loyalty to the club.
Spending time with Qatari elites who go to shopping malls and similar places.
He treated me to a cappuccino.
How strange the world is, man!
The boy gave me five hundred riyals and paid the bill.
Tell us the poem that your poetry crafted about our match with Al-Khadr.
Thank you to all the listeners here.
You are a frog.
You're not ashamed that my team defeated you by four?
Talk trash, talk trash about the field and the team and see what happens!
Don't say that!
When one of the foxes was expelled
The reason behind that is a judge.
Remove a player from the Foxes team.
I changed his name from Hakim to Ahmaq.
Thank you, thank you, thank you to all the listeners here.
Every month we meet to choose the best fan.
Great, who did you choose to honor this month?
The club board members will decide.
They are children and you are all older than camels.
I manage this big club. A fox.
Come, come and see the driver who escaped from us, he's on TV, come.
Is it him?
One speaks well, the other is mute.
What do you think, is this a pen or a watch?
Now, I know how to communicate with him.
The crowd departed.
Follow in his footsteps.
Turn here.
He was driving fast.
We've lost him now.
Beautiful!
Be quiet. You're not the one who decides. I am the head of this family, and I am the one who decides.
We must make sure.
Majid Abdulrahman Al-Subaie
Yes, yes, yes, God bless you.
I am from the Dhabian tribe.
Buy it and register it in my name, no, no, no, no, I don't want to live in it, I have a house.
I just want to invest.
And may Allah bless your earnings.
How can I help you, people? What do you want?
May God bless you.
Come in, folks! Want some coffee?
You have nothing to say, may God bless you. You don't need anything, may God exalt you.
You say I'm sure, is that good? We'll embarrass ourselves in front of the elite!
I am very worried.
Mama, mama, I'm mama.
Now, what our father will do to us, that I don't know.
I didn't mean it, Mom!
Hello Mama, don't tell Dad.
Your father will turn the house upside down.
Of course he'll kill you now.
Mom, I swear I didn't break it on purpose.
Great idea, Mom. Why don't we buy some glue and stick them together?
What will we commit to, my son?
How can we find another like it? I don't know where your uncle bought it, it was a gift.
I'm worried about you because of him.
Mom, I'm afraid he'll hit me.
Close the door until I find a solution to this matter.
Quickly go to your room.
Blind, blind, blind! You have blinded me!
Are you blind to break the vase? Blind?
Mama, why didn't Walid come to you?
No, my God! Your son didn't come. What happened to you?
He ran away from home because he was afraid of his father.
This is not true. Show some empathy for the boy!
This is not upbringing, my daughter! May God guide you!
What do we do now, mother?
I don't know what to do!
I don't know, I just scared him of the cars in the street.
God will protect him, I think he went to the supermarket or to the neighbors to play with the boys.
Yes, he is kind, good, and beloved.
No, no my child, seek refuge in God's words from the devil, and don't worry, God willing, everything will be alright.
So, goodbye my daughter.
Where is Waleed?
My father is going to hit me.
My grandmother, my father will kill me with torture.
Do not despair, pearl of my heart!
Do not be afraid, my beloved.
I won't let him hit you.
I didn't mean to break it.
Come, my son, come and drink some water and rest in my room.
Your face turned yellow.
God guides him, God guides him. Come with me, my son, yes! Some of them.
O Allah, the Generous
I was afraid my father would come here.
Come, my son, do not worry.
No one interferes in the upbringing of my son.
This is my son, and I raise him the way I want.
Indeed, the poor person buys in a state of panic and trembles in fear and terror of something he did not intend to do.
Why doesn't he have eyes?
Let's see!
He accidentally knocked over the vase with his bag, believe me, he didn't mean to do it.
You! You have to support him!
Don't tell him anything about me, please. Forgive him this time, his state of fear breaks my heart.
But where is he now? Why is he here at this time?
It is not here.
He's here! Where?
Enter, go!
No, no, I'll give it to my brother today.
Why don't you bring something other than the old one!
Come on, Nasser, my brother... Let's go play!
And your mother says you're studying!
My father just wants this game and we'll start studying!
Aren't you taking the exam tomorrow?
Yes, Father.
Come on, dad, go and don't ruin the game.
Oh father, come on, don't take it so seriously. Come on, father, let's start studying.
What are you saying! Listen to me.
If you don't go now, I'll call your uncle Abu Waleed right away.
No, no, no, no. Don't tell my uncle, don't tell my uncle, no!
I don't care.
I'll tell him you don't obey me.
Get started. Each of you take your book and start reading.
Alright, Dad, put your phone in your pocket. We're going to start studying, Dad, but don't tell Uncle.
Mom, I'm really confused! I don't know what to do.
I feared he would cause us a problem if he found out about it.
Of course, he will ask me: Why are you taking him to the hospital?
So what's the problem, if you tell him?
If he finds out that Walid is wetting the bed, he will kill him.
Oh, Mother! He is the culprit... He is responsible.
Ah! My daughter has a psychological impact.
The boy is not a child, he is now twelve years old.
That's good, my girl!
She will come to have lunch with us and I will give him some signals.
And I will see his opinion.
Her mother went to Bahrain to buy abayas.
It's just an argument, my daughter.
Fun and shopping
She says he wets the bed every night.
My son wets the bed every night and you don't tell me the story.
He said I should take him to the hospital so they could treat him.
Her husband is stupid.
He doesn't understand anything.
He spoke the truth.
They must take him to the hospital, son! So they can find out what's wrong with him.
He is looking for a good dry hose.
He beat him until the last person in the neighborhood heard his screams.
Sit down!
Go! My child, eat.
I didn't say anything.
Take it and go quickly and have a bath, I'll get you some clothes. Go!
Please, urgently.
I have to punish them.
Don't interfere!
Do you call this a pass?
And Khalid translated forty-nine out of fifty.
Is that a vacation?
However, their rates are good.
He told them they would be punished if they didn't get fifty out of fifty.
Don't take them to your brother!
They must be punished.
My children are
Alright, I swear to God, uncle, uncle, this will be the last time.
Why not divide five by five, but divide five?
Give him another one.
I tell him, "Don't go with us to public places."
Yesterday we went to the hospital and they told him not to enter. It's prohibited.
You're different, don't come with us.
Go! Let me punish his brothers.
Stop, uncle, I'm going to die, stop, stop, stop, stop, I'm going to die, stop, uncle.
It is up to me to punish you.
This is not a punishment, but you'll see at the end of the year if any of you don't get fifty.
I will drain the pool.
I will fill it with oil.
Where is your certificate? Where is your certificate?
It will be ready tomorrow.
Khaled Abdul Rahman
Finish, let it be, perfect work!
Faisal Abdullah Rashid
Excellent, Faisal!
Divine providence watches over you.
You are an excellent student and you were second in your class.
The teacher is crying because he got forty-nine out of fifty in math.
The teacher is afraid of his father because his father wants him to get a score of 50 out of 50.
O son, I am addressing you!
Call, call your classmate.
He said he saw him by the school entrance.
Call, call your mother, she might be at your grandfather's.
No, he didn't go there.
So where is he? Where is he?
"There is no power or might except by Allah."
What's wrong with you, brother!
Ah, of course he failed and is afraid of his family.
He did not fail, but he was an excellent student and was second in his class.
He was only afraid of going home.
Because he only lost two marks in math.
God have mercy on him.
Walid, Walid.
Walid, Walid.
"And indeed, He
Forty eight, forty nine, you've lost a mark or two, never mind. I won't say anything, I won't scold or beat you. Walid,
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
and nuclear energy
which accounts for sixty percent of the world's oil reserves
Saudi Arabia leads the scene with 24% of the world's reserves.
Then Libya, the United States, Nigeria.
Three percent each, and then the rest of the world combined at fifteen percent.
And for that reason
In production
And perhaps it is a secret among the secrets and a reason among the reasons that prompts major industrial nations to rush to occupy this region and its countries.
And the highest consuming country of oil is the United States of America.
But oil prices continue to rise steadily.
In tandem with the decline of the US dollar
The unit used for pricing oil.
Where did the price of a barrel reach yesterday?
That led to an increase in income in producing countries and at the same time
To the height of her inflation rates
Where inflation in some of those countries reached fifteen percent.
The most important source of energy in the world.
Prices of living commodities and cost of living
In a live interview with the Deputy Prime Minister
Qatar's Minister of Energy and Industry
Abdullah bin Hamad Al Attiyah
For viewers who wish to participate, they can reach us at the program's phone numbers.
Sir, welcome and greetings.
I'd like to start with you on the unprecedented prices oil has reached.
Where might prices be heading?
Of course, where prices might go is a perplexing question.
Or what we call market power.
What is OPEC?
And are not the producing countries?
Neither the producing countries nor OPEC have anything to do with setting oil prices.
Is the price the only relationship between supply and demand?
So far, supply and demand have little to do with the matter.
So what are the factors?
There are other factors besides supply and demand.
What made investors
I feel an enormous pressure and turn into oil and gold, or what is known as "commodity marketing."
Investors lost confidence in stock markets.
And gold as well.
We've seen gold rise from $355 in recent years to $970 now.
And today, as I mentioned before, one hundred and nine dollars.
But they are all on the rise, and if they fall, it is only a slight decline.
I remind you that in the first quarter of this year.
The second quarter is expected to see a drop in prices due to lower demand for oil.
But we saw the market in a strange and exciting state.
In the second quarter and at the beginning of spring, it rises above one hundred dollars.
But this means that the previous factors that determined the rise in winter prices and consumption have now changed, and other factors are at play.
and economic growth
At the same time, we see oil prices rising to this level.
I mentioned political factors and said that political tensions play a role in this matter.
Do you think Fallon's resignation in light of the current political complexities was wise?
Most American newspapers and global press outlets accompanied her today, and it could affect oil prices.
Yes, one hundred percent, and today anything.
Today, we live in the age of globalization, and influences are accelerating at a rapid pace.
Unrealistic factors may influence.
The latest type of disruption in the market
And he also spread some political rumors.
He said there was no plan, but he did not rule out the existence of other options that could be applied to Iran.
The market always reacts to uncertainty.
It's not in my nature to be sure, there's nothing certain about America being at war with Iran.
And I am one of the people who don't see this scenario.
And perhaps there is what we have not seen will happen in the future.
And we are those who work in the field of energy.
We see these political tensions.
Regarding global oil supplies
On the contrary, there are very profitable supplies.
This shows that there is oil going into storage.
And there is no shortage of oil supplies at all.
They may be preparing for the next war.
In light of this reassuring picture you're presenting regarding the supply, and that there are no obstacles to the supply.
In case President Bush and the United States decide to change their plan.
This is something else.
Prices will rise to record-high levels.
Oil prices may reach
Global oil reserves
You are here, today the Gulf holds great importance.
In addition to Iraq, Iran, and other Gulf countries
Today they represent more than 60% of oil reserves, that's for what is confirmed.
You today
If a very minor accident occurs.
Therefore, it indicates.
That any war with Iran will mean that there is no guarantee of the extent to which oil prices will rise.
God knows that today we have reached what you have not reached.
Wars up to one hundred and seven (107) and dollars one hundred and ten (110), and it may jump to one hundred and ten, only God knows.
Today, olives live under political and psychological pressures, as I mentioned to you.
And the speculators rode the wave, taking advantage of these tensions.
Invest only in oil.
Or what is so-called "uninvested" of course does not include real investment, nor purchasing, nor future marketing.
It is called olive paper.
And it's all speculation on oil paper.
Its entire production is around three hundred thousand barrels or less.
These people may be prompted to buy more and then upgrade more.
I hope April is the month of jokers.
I hope there isn't one.
It is said that Cheney will visit the region and that this issue tops his agenda.
The owner of this project is Shiny, as stated by several politicians and media personalities.
I didn't know what was inside Cheney's bag.
And I can't guess what might be in it, you know.
Will he start a war?
America is in transition.
Why doesn't the son do something else?
Let's see what will happen. If we're talking about April, it's just a few weeks away and we'll be in it.
And let the world pay the price.
And America is a huge consumer.
In the Gulf countries
The Gulf will be the tough number.
You can't throw this number away.
Their production cost is very low.
Compared to West African countries, most of which rely on
The Gulf, no other country in the world can do that.
We have been hearing this talk from the West and the United States for many years.
Use
etc., don't you remember the story of the Caspian War?
Whatever these dreams may be
When you sit with Westerners in a small circle
You hear them speak in a different way.
What are they saying?
On supplies, the importance of the region, and the value of reserves.
When I asked a European official, I said, "It's strange that you speak among us in closed rooms."
It's not the same as the way you talk to them.
He told the media: "Primarily for political reasons."
And of course, there is what is called double standards or double speak.
The language you know that the Gulf countries speak is Arabic.
Today, it carries great importance, like Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
The largest producer and exporter of oil in the world
And entering into it.
In spite of all that
The Chief of the Central Region
Declaration of war on Iran
Even in the event of an aerial war or air raid, as they say.
In the supplies
You're not late, you're actually very excessive.
I don't agree with you on what you're saying.
We don't even deal with the Berbers.
We deal with America.
Where there are good prices
Whether in the market of this town or another.
Non-renewable energy
For the generosity (between the parentheses)
Arab hospitality
Go ahead and give it to me.
Observers say the real price of oil is
The reason for the rise in oil prices is
Oh citizens of the Gulf, and OPEC and its countries
You are very generous with Americans, insisting on keeping their currency.
I said the price of oil should be seventy dollars.
I said the actual price for the drop in the US dollar is sixty to seventy.
The price is now one hundred.
One hundred and nine because the dollar dropped thirty percent.
And now the price has exceeded one hundred dollars.
If we take the percentage and the ratio
No one denies it.
One of the main reasons
Compared to the decline of the US dollar
If we take
This comparison
Oil prices
Because the United States of America
Of course, it's in our interest at the moment for the dollar to decrease.
Weakness or stagnation in the American economy, Americans can't "do anything."
So what happened to these regions to cause their economic weakness and stagnation?
You too, become.
The United States is reducing benefits on the dollar.
Why the insistence on linking oil to the dollar?
We're discussing why oil prices are linked to the dollar.
The first who, more than 100 years
The United States of America was the first to export the first barrel of oil.
And it was exported in US dollars.
From the twentieth century to the present day.
Pricing oil in dollars
Historically, it became
And for a hundred years the world has been reacting and evaluating prices.
And Norway is now the third-largest oil-producing country.
And an exporter of oil.
Russia is the second-largest exporter of oil.
North Sea field production in Europe
Pricing in US Dollars, not Qatari Riyal.
Everything is changing in the world; there are other sources and information indicating something different from this.
You are the Gulf countries.
There are secret agreements between you and the Americans.
And oil became the real cover.
This is true and does not exist.
And these are the agreements.
If oil continues to underpin the dollar in trade, the United States will continue to support these regimes.
This is not actually true and there are no secret agreements.
Today, let's take OPEC.
He has sixty-six percent, Sir Honorable Deputy.
Among thirteen countries
40% of the fifty-eight barrels are for OPEC.
There are many countries that are large producers of oil.
Outside OPEC
What are the obstacles to pricing in another currency?
Search for prices in another currency.
Isn't that how adults decide?
You, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries, are arrogant and proud.
Today's OPEC class is like everyone else's.
There are sixty percent.
Even if we assume that OPEC wanted that.
There is an agreement among all oil-producing countries.
There is a trend and an intention to change.
What kind of attempt?
But now these two countries cannot change the pricing currency.
Unless there is an agreement between them.
What is the impact?
Let me speak now, why European?
They do not export their petroleum.
From the North Sea or Russia or Norway in euros or roubles
Because it's in their interest to have their currencies strong and expensive.
No, on the contrary.
Here is where the loss is.
They export a barrel and a half for one euro.
No, you are the loser because your currency has decreased due to its linkage to the dollar.
He is also a big loser, a heavy loss.
The currency's link here in the Gulf is historically tied.
Do you remember when the dollar was the strongest currency in the world?
And I connect now when you talk about disengagement.
It's as if we're married when we get married.
It's not easy to let go.
Not here
Or have you entered into a Catholic marriage with the dollar?
Cost estimation should be carried out systematically.
Inspected professionally and examined.
Similarly, Kuwait unloaded twenty-five percent of its currency in dollars.
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar
You may adjust your currency's rate.
Today about the subject but this does not mean that you do not intend to study the subject or think about it.
His Excellency the Prime Minister stated that the exam is of course different.
It was mentioned that the Qatari currency is undervalued by 30%.
In this study
In which direction are you the only ones pursuing this matter?
Kuwait also went its own way, so why don't you follow its steps?
Economists say that it is more profitable for countries and their people than losing.
But we
And nothing else.
that these four Gulf states declare
Everyone insists on that.
And I mean those who support him personally.
He will be supported.
It must be included in the study.
In itself
Made from what is made from one or two countries.
Until the time of the currency
You won't save the situation now.
A balm from you is enough for us, and...
And they will be the ones who
It's not a matter of experts, this requires a political decision.
Let's wait and not rush now. Look what happens today.
People started
Of course, in the subject of collusion.
Honorable Deputy, the inflation rate in Qatar reached fourteen percent in 2007 and will reach fifteen percent this year.
Ate people's salaries, swallowed their wages, the wages of the workers here.
Resident salaries in Qatar eroded by between thirty-five and forty percent.
We'll be back after the break to find out the extent of the pay increases.
The number of employees in Qatar will increase for the foreseeable future, so stay with us.
Welcome back to "Without Borders" in this episode where we host the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy of Qatar.
And Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah on the sharp rise in prices.
with oil, which returned with millions of dollars to the Gulf countries and producing states.
I am writing about oil, and my question concerns the anticipated increase in employees' salaries. However, before this increase, I would like to provide you with some important information.
The United Arab Emirates has seventy-nine and eight-tenths percent of reserves and produces two and six-tenths percent.
Just tone, and the Kuwait Times report is an economic report, and Gulf revenues are among the greatest.
Saudi Arabia expected revenues of $109 billion in 2008.
And it was
One hundred and seventy last year, sixty-six this year, and it is expected to reach seventy-five.
Kuwait is sixty-six and was fifty-five.
One quarter of oil plus fifty-five billion.
It's gas, as other reports have said, and God knows no envy, I swear we don't envy the deputy's happiness.
Iraq forty-seven billion.
One and a half billion
Based on the expenses, its budget reached one and a half trillion dollars.
Gulf countries exported $1 trillion, which means one thousand billion.
The dollar was a diverse array of imports.
U.S. investment was three hundred billion.
Nine out of ten billion
In Bahrain, the rate was three percent.
In 2007, the ratio was six and a half percent in Oman, but it will increase to seven percent. In Qatar, the ratio was 13.75 percent but it will increase to fifteen percent.
This means that those living in Qatar expect a high cost of living, with expensive goods and prices.
Life is getting more expensive, with prices rising to very high levels in Qatar.
We express our sympathy to everyone.
So the solution must be
And the solution means that it aims to control inflation.
That means you'll increase their salaries by 50%.
They will not say that you are against raising salaries.
This is not the truth.
And in the cabinet, he opposed the raise in salaries.
There is a problem and the solution must be the optimal solution.
Not stopgap solutions
There is a balance between the two.
And this will be everything.
The most important thing is to solve the inflation problem.
And here in Qatar, there is a committee.
His Highness issued a decision to form
And he places.
He lays solid foundations.
To solve the problem and control inflation
What matters now is controlling inflation.
Inflation
If you don't control it
But Your Excellency, now
The market research specialist published last February, just days before
Among them because of material ranks.
Now you are about to solve inflation and let inflation devour these people's income.
Many of them now
Payments to other countries
They raise our salaries, then solve the inflation problem, and lower them again.
I echo what they say about finding balance in the matter.
But now
It's not a temporary solution.
Increase it by a larger amount.
Therefore, here.
To curb inflation
Boredom will always remain.
Because the increase was enormous over the past year, wasn't it?
The second point is
Those who work in the private sector are not like those who work in the public sector.
The private sector is severely neglected.
So now the question of increase must also be considered fairly.
I don't know where I got these notes from.
We live in Qatar, Your Highness, not in Germany.
I'll tell you the opposite, today the private sector has started paying.
Most of them
Many Qataris who were working in government offices have moved to the private sector.
Due to the high ranks.
Confronting a problem
Moving to the private sector because it is more vibrant and dynamic.
It provides good salaries.
Attached by the force of the market so called.
Or market power
They are not highly qualified.
They don't come to Qatar because the salaries are low here or because the prices are low.
Or their own expenses
With our consent and clear understanding
I'm not jumping to conclusions, and I'm not saying that there will be a raise in salaries.
No hope either.
To control inflation
Let's give her some time.
Inflation monitoring
And God willing, this is what was mentioned in the report, that Qatar in 2008
God willing, we say that.
We observe that these numbers will change.
Spray some of it on the people.
It is a professional formal process.
Certainly, with professionalism and mastery.
From inflation
Spending money
Often in various projects
My question is: Can I receive some questions from the audience, hoping everyone will ask a straightforward question. Abdulaziz Mohammed from Morocco, what is your question, brother Abdulaziz?
About the ruling families in the Gulf.
Therefore, I don't think his justification is about the OPEC disagreement.
The total oil revenue goes directly to the governor.
Then the remaining money is allocated to the owning family and the rest is spent on development.
In the absence of accountability, things will remain the same.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Welcome, brother Ahmed.
I won't belabor the point. The brother mentioned the topic of ruling systems and the issue of the Qatari riyal, its peg to the dollar, or other Gulf currencies to the dollar, but...
America wants to globalize the world and make it swear allegiance to her.
The American deficit in trade between China and the United States reached $82 billion.
Next to it, the European Union with sixty-eight billion dollars.
This means that all trends in global politics are against the dollar.
And we are paying the price now as Arab and Gulf oil-producing countries.
It will end in a confrontation between America.
And among the developed countries of the world, such as China and Russia and others, the issue may become
Purely military
China explodes bombs, Russia explodes bombs, Japan explodes bombs, America also explodes bombs.
Many thanks for this clarification and information.
Your question, Muhammad.
Hello, your question.
Can you turn down the TV and ask your question?
Your question is relevant.
But what I saw was His Highness's insistence on not responding.
The topic is about not being tied to the dollar because the dollar is in decline.
With God's permission, he will reach the bottom.
He is a kind man.
He should not follow the style of the Arab brothers.
Thank you, Brother Mohammed, thank you. Now, we request the final intervention from Ahmed Hassan from Qatar. Your question, Ahmed.
Evening light upon you as well.
Thank you, and thank you for the wonderful interview.
What's required? A salary increase, and God willing, things will improve.
It's true that we all face some problems, not in salaries.
Salaries, God willing.
Faster, tell me your question quickly.
Your service will be cut off. Do you have any questions?
All this is because of the high prices, the increase has affected all goods, they are all imported.
European countries
We have factories and workshops in the Arab world.
Thank you, Ahmed. Thank you for taking the time.
Now the case of rising prices is an important one.
The issue of supporting the poor, the man told you, Your Highness, to stand by the poor.
Anyone who doesn't have a billion here is considered poor.
Here for some brothers we are.
Who doesn't know Qatar?
For the State of Qatar, this is not true.
Today, anyone coming to Qatar can see the indicators.
Growth indicators in Qatar are as they are.
Highest growth indicators in the world
What happens to this money? Where does it go? What is it used for?
What's in the frame of response?
When the Moroccan spoke, he uttered words that have no existence or reality.
Who does not see with his own eyes.
If he comes and sees Qatar and how many massive projects are underway there.
As a significant growth, you are right, you are asking.
And every human has a right.
And since your population is small, where will you find the people?
Does that really mean you'll bring the surplus from China, for example?
No, we will not export, God willing.
The state is based on planning.
Ideal independence from the money coming from oil and gas, and everyone knows that oil and gas will run out one day.
To become the State of Qatar
One of the best achievements in the Arab world.
Today also
The focus is on
What will have a great impact.
Beyond Oil and Gas
So you're not copying Dubai.
Every country has its own peculiarities.
In the State of Qatar, we focused on education.
About the ingredients
There will be a medical city where people come for treatment.
A media city will be established and developed.
Of course we must build the world today.
Building a vision
Beyond Oil and Gas
There were fatal errors.
Unfortunately, we were not prepared for this leap as it took us by surprise.
We were not prepared for it, neither in terms of human resources, nor technologically, nor even educationally.
Everything has changed now after thirty years.
Even better
Today there is a vision.
Vision
Vision
Thank you, His Highness the Vice President, and I thank the distinguished audience.
To contact us, hoping that we have provided you with what pleases you.
Qatar's foreign policy appears enigmatic to many observers.
Qatar enjoys special relations.
At the same time that Qatar was in contact with Israel and still is
Islamic Resistance Movement "Hamas"
Qatar provided
Started
The largest Arab country
That angered the ruling regime in Egypt.
To the extent of accusing Qatar of conspiring against Egypt.
As Qatar was not far from important files.
Like Darfur, the Houthis in Yemen, and even the Israeli captive.
Gilaad Shalit, who was reached by Qatari foreign policy in a way that disturbed the largest Arab states.
And what kind of authority puts him in such a position?
These achievements
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani
Or write to us on our website www.aljazeera.net
Hello Your Highness
On September 22, 2007, to Saudi Arabia.
The visit differed regarding the relationship between the two countries at least in the past two years.
Redrawing the borders
Wash what was in stock.
This is what was mentioned.
in a Hijaz newspaper or magazine
that was held with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, during which contact was restored and the Saudi ambassador returned.
To Doha
First, your introduction was too long and needed a lot of answers without your last question.
I think you gave it to me.
Especially regarding the Saudi topic.
It is not precisely defined.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's mission to Qatar is very important.
Between the two countries
I spoke about the silence of the island.
You spoke about a revolutionary movement.
I think these matters have been clarified from both sides.
And we accepted the explanation.
In the State of Qatar
Dispute with Saudi Arabia
It was always limited in scope.
From the sights of the eyes
Praise be to God, that was due to the wisdom of the two leaders.
King Abdullah and His Royal Highness the Prince
In the Gulf notably
For over a hundred years
The relationships were bright, honorable, and trustworthy.
I want to limit myself to the misunderstanding between two parties.
This issue has been addressed, and there were no conditions.
In resolving any issue.
There was a shared vision and sincere intention among the parties.
To resolve this pending issue
And its relationship is not seasonal but strategic.
We hope it doesn't continue, but evolves.
Polite diplomatic speech
Saudi Arabia recalls its ambassador from Qatar.
I'm not used to speaking diplomatically, or I'd have prevented a lot of problems.
I always say what I believe.
Therefore, it is not diplomacy, but our faith.
The topic of the island falls under media.
Between the parties and erupted in the middle of many countries.
Think that he might gain points at the expense of other countries.
Or at the expense of Qatar.
At the expense of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
Success in the Gulf House
I mean the opposite of what was the case before.
It's part of a political agreement.
No, no, there was no agreement except for the agreement of love and interest.
Except for that, you can ask the island management.
Have you established strategic relations between yourself and Saudi Arabia to prevent the repetition of what happened before?
Foundation-based strategy
Can we say it in one, two, three, and four?
Let there be cooperation between us.
And some disputes were settled on this basis.
Between some Arab countries and attempts to mend the rift and resolve other differences
Because now, if we look at the differences in the Arab world, they are all differences based on different points of view.
We have a vision about a certain policy in a specific issue, and another country has a different opinion.
It is viewed from two angles.
Some observers see that you enjoy criticizing Saudi Arabia.
He criticized her.
Were you tired and decided to walk in another direction, and from there you headed to a bigger country, which was Egypt?
And it is the same principle.
No, no, we're not enjoying this or that, and we're not involved in anything.
Dealing with any party in this manner
I mean the reasons for the conflict with Saudi Arabia are over.
Between them, and I know that there is a very great understanding.
And you know that we created.
And there will be a kind of the protected.
But Saudi Arabia
I will put this under two lines.
You started skirmishes with the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram in the eighteenth issue published last April.
An official Egyptian newspaper.
In a comprehensive investigation, it was stated that extensive investigations
Hezbollah's network uncovered a sabotage plot.
Three countries target Egypt: Iran, Syria, and Qatar.
Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood
And a well-known media figure for his conspiratorial role.
Qatar is the smallest Arab country.
Planning against Egypt
We appreciate
And her struggle over the years.
I'm not saying this to manipulate anyone emotionally.
Let me finish, I'm not done yet.
We appreciate that.
President of the Arab Republic of Egypt
And he who abstains from ignorance.
On Arab relations.
First point
Gaza
As they say and as we acknowledge
Qatar is
A small country.
You can be part of such schemes.
Because we have suffered from the interventions of other countries at one time, and I never want to go back to that.
Following the intervention of some countries in domestic affairs.
That was the policy of His Highness's government.
Now that they've discovered what they call a conspiracy
What I want to say is that for the house, the Lord can protect it. Syria and Iran can defend themselves; it's not me who should defend them.
If the situation stabilizes in Egypt.
And why would Qatar want to change or interfere in such a matter?
"And the sacred things are not brought into being from nothing."
It is said that the small mini-state of Qatar is seeking to undermine Egypt's role and its ties with Turkey and the European Union.
And I sought to hold a conference to rival the Arab summit to steal the spotlight.
And you are using a central horn, which is Al Jazeera's channel.
Yes, please go ahead.
By the party of God.
And we are not comfortable with that.
But I can say that we are sure.
To have
Principle of non-intervention in such circumstances
Our brothers in Egypt were forced into this, and that's why we blame the Egyptian authorities.
The ongoing conflict with some members of the Egyptian government
Some officials have problems with
With what?
I'm coming for that.
Days of the fragrance of peace and the message of peace are our days.
I previously lived in Egypt.
And then with us
Because Israel
We have a disagreement with her.
You have no dispute with Israel.
And now, because of the conference, from that day on.
Any Islamic conference, they are sensitive to Arab conferences.
This sensitivity
Why don't we sit with them?
Let me finish.
And we always hope for the best.
We discovered that this sensitivity
Or three
The Gaza conference that was held
That Egypt does not want to hold it in Qatar.
Not in Arabic
I am in Qatar and there is a summit in Kuwait. We informed them.
The Palestinian people are being attacked.
For more than two weeks
But we held it before any planned conference, the Kuwait conference which we were the first to attend.
People are being killed and
Procrastination
The conflict began.
Or a small state.
I know there are some brothers in the government, and this is also an insult to Egypt, not to others.
When they said that afterwards.
Are you on the island?
The Israelis said the day before that a gathering would be held to cease hostilities before any speech or anything else.
What is that?
My brother allowed medicine and food to enter during the beating that our brothers had to endure.
They say the gate was firmly closed.
We can't get the trucks in.
As soon as they tell us there's a deal on the other side and they have to come.
Now is not the time to bring up Fatah or Hamas.
I don't care about Fatah or Hamas. I care about the 1.6 million people who are being attacked.
And those who do not possess a remedy.
When we started talking about this situation and discussing the Gaza conference
Qatar's interventions in the matter affect the Egyptian regime.
It's not interference.
We did not say how Egypt would resolve the situation as that falls under its jurisdiction.
A official said, "We have uncovered a large-scale conspiracy such as this."
He hasn't told us the events of the story yet.
We officially mean this matter.
He tells us that Egypt is a very important matter.
We fully understand that Egypt is a large Arab country, and we always say that Egypt is a great nation.
Therefore, we always ask a lot of things from a big country.
Because Egypt is ours.
And you were invited to a conference they attended, which was provocative to them.
We weren't invited to the conference.
Reconstruction of Gaza
We coordinated and had a unified position.
People in Gaza are suffering.
Forbidden, I know Turkey introduced things through Israel.
I would be happy to see him enter through our brothers in Egypt.
They are part of us.
And if Egypt wins or does good political work
We believe that it is in the interest of Qatar and the Arab world as a whole.
Egypt's stability is very important to us.
If he does a good job, he is important to us.
You completed your question and the introduction of your talk took fifteen minutes.
Now you've lost me.
I'll tell you my anger now.
You are among the officials of the Egyptian regime.
We are behind the failure of the Qatar summit.
The second is that they are the ones who failed the Qatar conference.
King Abdullah had a wisdom he desired.
And he wanted to make reconciliations.
That's why he intervened and prevented some countries from attending.
And I said this to our brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia because we
There is no disagreement with Saudi Arabia even on this point.
Because, as it appears, there are internal problems.
Or an official
Among high-ranking officials
A large country where a government official finds that a small country does things like this.
And there you had
Play any role.
<h2>Darfur is part of the national security of Egypt and Sudan</h2>
The five major countries decided.
Any country other than Qatar would be suitable.
But these sensitivities exacerbate the situation. Why do you try to stick your nose into everything around you?
We want to solve this allergy, take an antihistamine, they should tell us what this allergy is.
Why sensitivities?
Some brothers from the government
They want, they have a local strike.
They want to draw attention to a plot in Gaza Revolution.
As if they are saying: "Blame the Italians."
**When something happened**
Not only for instructions but also for analyses.
We learned about what happened because
The issue should be resolved locally.
And it was not resolved.
It's not my looks that concern me, but my country.
My priority is to first find out the reasons that concern my country.
Then I'll see if I have enough time left.
And looking into the reasons that concern my Arab nation.
Qatar tried to reconcile.
And thinking about any Arab issue in which you can contribute as much as you can.
Why do you consider it provocative? Why don't you take it in good faith?
I can't fix you.
I can explain my point of view.
Don't throw it at me.
From our perspective
That which emanated from his heart.
Let me finish.
When he announced an initiative for reconciliation and all the presidents gathered in Kuwait, we pinned our hopes on a good outcome, and I welcome that.
There are reports.
Of course, the Egyptian official who explained his heroic competitions.
I will not respond to him in a report or a TV interview or anything else.
Because I have an answer for every point.
But to maintain the minimum of relations that bind us and connect Arab interests.
It is also a response to the call issued by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.
But I can give him and anyone else this advice:
They are trying to rectify their mistakes, both internally and externally.
In politics, economics, or otherwise, we too have our mistakes. No one is infallible.
Due to their accusation of Qatar with all these charges.
Are you denying the existence of a relationship between Qatar and Hezbollah?
This is a funny topic.
Distorting Egypt's relations, weakening its role, and undermining its contacts with Turkey and the European Union.
And first, we are few in number.
If we can pull this off.
This is incorrect.
There are some accusations directed at you personally.
Paying money to the families of those held by Shalit so that Qatar can take over the Shalit file and surpass the Egyptian role in this file.
They always accuse us of offering money, but we didn't pay any money and we didn't discuss offering any money with anyone.
But in this case
We support Egypt in its resolution of the Palestinian issue, as we always support Egypt in resolving the problem between the Palestinians.
It was he who allowed the President of the Palestinian Authority to stay until the issue was resolved.
We were there and the first to support the State of Qatar.
"In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Until a just decision is made regarding it, and let there be arbitrators among you who are trusted, who are fair in their judgments, and do not deprive people of their rights."
And we said that.
"We asked him to join the Arab League, but he said no, and we did it because we believe that some people do not want that."
But We have achieved it with skill.
Is he addressing his boss?
His Prime Minister
I truly don't know about the existence of a problem.
I don't know any of them.
They decided now in the twelve-issue exclusively with Al-Shuruq newspaper in the April issue last month.
The political leadership in Egypt decided to launch a satellite news channel to counter Al Jazeera's media dominance, challenge it, and put an end to it.
In a few days, everything will be over.
Are you afraid the island will become a thing of the past?
You mean that we are now in a political adolescence?
I also visited Saudi Arabia, and the Emir of Qatar met with the Saudi king.
We didn't concede to them, and they didn't concede to us.
We treated them as brothers.
A small state yields to the large state Egypt.
There is no important point to clarify about Saudi Arabia.
Qatar's relationship with Saudi Arabia is different.
Then we talk.
Relations between Qatar and Egypt
We rely on him heavily.
Believe me.
Is it a dispute about the main policy?
I hope it's not a personal issue because we have no personal issues. I've told you that we respect the Egyptian people.
If I asked you, you would say there are two problems: Gaza and what comes after?
This issue has deeply affected us all.
We want a psychological solution to this, a way out of this predicament.
Published in some newspapers
Minister of Foreign Affairs
In the presence of Prince Saud al-Faisal
We talked about everything.
Of course, things got worse and were not resolved.
No, no, there was listening.
I cannot tell you about our relationship with Egypt.
They direct the blame at us, and they are entitled to as our brothers.
And we blame them for that rightly, as the brothers blame each other.
We don't want to compare ourselves to a major power.
I mean, Egypt is big for satisfaction.
It's not a matter of life or death, but will the solution come from heaven?
For us, if there is anyone waiting for satisfaction.
Or waiting for a way
In Qatar
You will deal with neither nobles nor brethren.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Our country is large, yes, we are proud of Egypt as a large country.
Even if there are those who deceive others.
I know that Israel is doing this to us.
The previous American policy under the previous administration was either with me or against me.
Therefore, I don't think they want to imitate Israel or America in this matter.
Similarly, if we consider their policies, other parties are also pressuring them.
In many cases, let me finish.
We understand and know that there are some kingdoms even for a large state.
What guides your policies?
What moves us is one thing that we cannot move.
Our internal Qatari affairs are our internal affairs.
And whenever we can help the Arab world, we will.
Sources of energy: Island and holiday newspaper
Can you say that this is not strength?
Our faith in God and trust in Him.
His Highness' vision
We don't want to disturb anyone.
Let me finish, we don't want to cause trouble for anyone.
"And we do not intend to race anyone."
They can say whatever they like about great Qatar or otherwise.
But we have a point of view.
First and foremost, we shut down the Israeli office and ended its operations.
First they said close the office, so we did, then they got angry and went to complain to the Americans. Can you believe these people?
Join the team called "Devil's Team"
What they tell you
Americans and Europeans, these are my friends, and we know how to deal with them.
Their cunning
That was made.
This is a flaw, we have reached a certain stage, and then what?
Tell me now.
How will the problem with Egypt be resolved according to your points?
And given that Egypt plays a significant role in the Arab world.
We think it is important to look at it.
And I am sure that President Hosni Mubarak is dealing with the matter cautiously.
Some of the staff
I must leave.
Occupying the Egyptian public opinion, government leaders, or other such nonsense
And focus on Arab and Egyptian interests.
Are there any steps?
We are behind them, not in front of them, because they are a great nation.
In the near future.
Frankly, I can't imagine how this will happen.
And I know there's a time for logic
And there will be a time either from us
If it's from me.
Or them
Large Arab interests united them.
One day we will find this out.
You mean that life is continually progressing forward.
We won't respond in the Egyptian style you responded in.
If someone gives us a hand, we'll give them an arm.
Now, Your Highness
We were never used to running.
Unless we are well-prepared and ready to fight for Egypt.
Let's hang out with Egypt.
Many rumors spread about Egyptian workers in Qatar and their impact on this matter.
There are also contracts for Egyptian citizens working in universities or high-ranking positions.
Learn that canceling and calling off jobs is not our custom in this regard.
Because these people have nothing to do with this matter.
This is a market where requirements change, they cancel one order and place another.
It's supply and demand. There are other nationalities that have seen increased demand while the demand for some has decreased.
Quick answer
The office was there.
We've closed the office, so it's best to leave now.
We were going to activate it on the days when the campaign was hot. All our losses in negotiations with Israel were because of this office.
So we closed it... and let them fix it with Netanyahu.
He was a guest.
And it was our custom to hold a party to which we would invite all the ambassadors accredited to any foreign country.
It was not an official invitation to honor Gabriela Shalev.
No, we didn't honor her before when the relations, as they say, were good. We won't honor her now, for this is a bit difficult.
There's no reason now for you to reopen the office during this period.
The office will reopen when there are no longer any reasons preventing it.
You made it big.
Who made him great like Egypt?
Egypt imposed this.
Let me make it clear to you, our relationship with America is a strategic one.
In some things, and this is it.
What is the most important thing?
There are things in our area regarding resolving some cases where we disagreed with the previous administration.
Now we have high hopes for the administration, especially with the steps taken by President Obama.
We see a great hope that this administration will improve.
Serious about advancing the peace process and serious about resolving the Palestinian issue.
They are our friends, and we don't deny it.
What is happening in Iran and what impact might it have on the Arabian Gulf and on you?
Iranians must decide how to solve their issues.
Among them.
In their usual ways, and I'm sure they'll overcome this crisis.
Iran is stable as mentioned by the Emir of Qatar.
It is important for our region, the Gulf region, as we share a border with Iran.
Of course, we have special relations with all our neighbors, including Iran.
Because our country seeks peace and stability in this region.
And we intervene whenever a party wants to change the Doha Agreement.
Saad Hariri also said
Now everything is over, and what remains is the strategic talk between the president
Lebanese communities
How can I see?
As for Yemen, you have no role or they have just taken a position.
Listen, it's known that we supported unity at a time when most Arab countries were against Yemeni unity.
We are the only Arab country and Gulf nation that stood with the unity of Yemen.
And in the south, we spoke with Yemen, and His Highness the Emir sent me twice to meet the Yemeni president.
And I explained to him that our goal is the stability of Yemen because Yemen is an important country in the Arabian Peninsula.
This agreement was not respected, and I don't want to say what each party did.
And what truly affected me
Is this Qatar that took this stance and was accused of paying money to the Houthis and to major corrupt figures in Yemen?
Because we don't interfere in such matters.
And whoever stands with unity, is not against it.
Another goal in favor of Yemen, whether on the political, economic, or other levels.
What matters to us is that, but I told you the truth, I was deeply shocked!
He sent me to Yemen among the Yemenites because I had gone more than ten times during the dispute.
It is not good luck that this accusation is strange.
Time is up but briefly tell me about these problems you faced due to your attempt to solve the problems, will these problems change your policies regarding intervention in other Arab problems?
If His Highness hears me, I think there is no need.
And there was a great burden upon her.
Over five billion dollars at that time, if we had invested it, it would now be worth fifty billion dollars, better than the headache we are suffering from now.
But I say this with confidence because the time in the Arab world has now come.
That is not allowed under these circumstances.
Many thanks to your happiness.
Perhaps even unprecedented in the era of Sheikh Hamad.
What happened to the Doha agreement?
How did the Doha Miracle happen?
Mandate and support the committee with everything necessary.
Let's discuss Lebanon after the Israeli invasion.
The Arabic consensus
We went to New York, and we were able to make a somewhat balanced decision.
And we were keen on that in Doha, where the desire was mutual from both parties.
We tried hard not to hear it, otherwise we wouldn't be.
Because we knew the committee.
On the ground, and we know what the problem is after we sat with the Lebanese for long hours.
I think it's a shared success.
However, there was a determination.
I think Lebanon's problem lies in its direct exposure to the prevailing atmosphere of the region around it.
Peaceful or non-peaceful
This was supposed to be Lebanon's website.
Under these conditions
And he did not receive the abundant luck.
External repercussions
I can say that the problem between Lebanese, even if it exists, won't be the number one problem.
Okay, Sheikh, I know that perhaps the time is not now, maybe it's too early to talk about the scenes, but
What happened? Did you come here?
The talk about fieldwork has somewhat stopped now.
You didn't delay even for a second.
I know what happened precisely, even the Lebanese leaders kept me informed about what occurred.
From the beginning
When I spoke with His Highness
I told him if we went to Lebanon.
I will present the idea, which His Highness has approved and supported.
Where all Lebanese leaders are present.
For here in Beirut you will have to go to each one's district.
While they are in the same hotel and the same place.
They met on the same plane and talked.
So we created this atmosphere, but our idea from the start was
And that was the most important decision they both made.
Of course
And I felt this from the Arab League.
So we must be faithful and trustworthy trustees.
Praise be to God, I believe everyone is now convinced that Qatar has made an effort in this regard.
On both sides.
To reach a honorable solution that satisfies both parties.
And there will be a solution, and no one will lose.
Before any move
The consultation took place at the Arab League and we found support.
From what we have done.
And I told him while we were there.
If we succeed in Lebanon, we'll take them to Doha.
And he recommended him to me.
He locked them up and took away their mobile phones.
We were able to bring them there as the brothers in Syria supported the position.
And I told you from the beginning that the committee can do anything without Arab support.
Why did they want a solution?
I think the situation in Lebanon and the escalation that occurred there
And this is the past tense verb.
Tension in Somalia... Tension in Sudan
A lot of things happen in the world.
And whenever we extinguish a fire
It is in the higher interest of the Arabs to avoid foreign intervention.
And we strive hard.
The forces are sent.
Even if he were a soldier.
For example, I think this is a topic.
There's a point for discussion.
He always said that the solution to the Lebanese file was...
Saudi-Syrian Agreement
To stop the Arabs, I mean Qatar and the Arab League.
Could what happened in Lebanon lead to serious reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Syria?
Need for Self-Review in the Arab World
After the Arabs set the difference among themselves.
And any agreement between two Arab countries.
And we tried this.
October Liberation War
When Arabs agree on a solution to a problem.
I think it's useful.
Saudi Arabia and Syria play a significant role in Lebanon.
Both parties should
Wisdom prevailed.
Arab relations are on the right track.
Because we here in the Arab world face many great challenges.
Everyone plays in our schoolyard.
And we have no say in the matter.
And how can we stop playing in the square of Arab countries?
At the very least, the Arabs agree to this agreement.
We happily complain.
And we watch.
Our disagreement as Arabs and the lack of trust among us; trust is missing between Arab countries.
The Arab states
It's not so much betrayal as it is a kind of...
Envy, what is the word?
This is a case that requires support from everyone, that's what I mean, I guess.
Will you make this dream a reality and truly call for an Arab summit?
We get angry when he gets angry and we rejoice when he rejoices.
He came in the middle of the conversation.
Is it possible to play a role in repairing the situation between Damascus and Riyadh even if?
Eager to find solutions, I am confident in their ability to act wisely.
They might reach an understanding.
Among them in many cases
There was harmony in politics, and I am sure that, God willing, it will continue.
That relations have improved.
It takes a step from both sides.
But I can't be sure that's what's happening now.
I am sure that if Arabs focus on resolving disputes between Arab countries and the problems faced by some Arab countries that I mentioned earlier,
Optimism and pride for the citizen that there is a general Arab awakening.
But I can't say what happened in Lebanon.
It can be interpreted as an Israeli-Palestinian escalation on the ground.
There might be an American-Iranian escalation, and perhaps other cases as well.
Will you still fear her in the coming months?
We, as Arabs
We can't just deliver food and medicine.
And electricity for the people.
We in Qatar are ready and always up for it.
More than one and a half million Palestinians are under siege.
And we do not want them to possess weapons or support.
They do all this.
And no electricity.
And we give it to the Red Cross to deliver it to the Palestinians.
And with the Palestinians, we only deliver them food and medicine.
And our disagreement with them can continue.
And I ask the Palestinians on both sides to put the national interest first.
Leave behind the illusions.
The Palestinian division is now a deep wound.
To find a solution
But they didn't commit
This is a serious matter, they must adhere to the Mecca Agreement.
And they must ask to be allowed to go back to Mecca and Saudi Arabia.
And this disagreement was resolved.
They won't benefit.
And any promises from any party
I wish there were a solution, but
Our position is known and has been conveyed to all concerned parties that we
We will not be a part of it and we do not accept being a part of any military conflict with Iran.
We have good relations with them.
But we are a sovereign state and they are a sovereign state.
Everyone seeks their best interest, but these interests do not harm them or us.
We believe that the destiny of the Gulf should be in clear agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council.
And Iran's cooperation and peaceful coexistence with neighbors.
But when Your Excellency says that Qatar is not a party to that.
Any details or clarifications
Just a sign
Absolutely not.
I want to go back to the Lebanese file, please.
In all honesty, Your Excellency the Minister, we were facing a big dilemma, but we managed to find a solution in the last few hours.
He who ties the new to what was previously announced, arrives.
The information might be disparate and unrelated, but what happened was...
What led you to this conclusion?
What happened in Istanbul, I know about it if it had a previously determined date.
You knew that there were negotiations.
Starting with the formulation of a plan
Undoubtedly, supporting the kingdom is of utmost importance.
Change the negotiation strategy.
These negotiations have been taken over.
To a positive outcome; we've gathered some parties from various sources.
And we began to speak to one another.
There is an Arab and Qatari approach in this paper.
Tell me what errors this paper relies on.
And we started talking about the subjects one by one.
At the last moment, overcome the obstacle and persevere to the end.
But the prince met with the parties.
And we got rid of this contract.
And there was a solution.
We heard a word from the Emir of Qatar at the opening session in Doha.
Don't look at your turn now.
Listen, the most important thing is to stay away from the lights.
I have no regional ambitions.
Or even control another state or anything like that because our state
Our size... We are proud of ourselves and believe that we can contribute to solving problems with our peers.
But in the Arab world, it is a matter of utmost importance.
To have nations
I want them to do something, and it's important.
Allowing and supporting certain small countries to take on this role.
Some things are excellent, others are good, and some are below par.
Last question, sir.
What is the central priority?
Is it a political priority?
Embrace or reconcile with the enemy.
or confront Israel
We stop the show at the Arab court.
We fix our problems in the Arab countries.
To choose an active member in Iraq
To calm things down.
At both the national and regional levels
But if we insist.
Or will there be any hope for us?
Thank you, His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani, for this meeting.
Global efforts to stop the ongoing war on Gaza.
We start by requesting a meeting with the Arab League Council at the ministerial level.
As if you had changed your mind about
Request for an emergency Arab summit
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Peace be upon you and the mercy and blessings of Allah. I am very happy to participate with my brother Hasan in this program.
Despite the human circumstances
What our brothers in Gaza faced
Conditions that require us to do many things.
Qatar did not ignore the Arab summit.
The truth is, when we proposed the idea of the Arab summit,
Neither the Security Council resolution nor
Two medusae, not to be underestimated.
I'll phrase it in another sentence.
And we submit to discipline.
That the street cannot bear more than that, and if we, the officials of the Arab street, bear more than we have borne, it will be an impossible matter.
You won't bear him.
When we were in Egypt
The written approvals were ten to eleven.
Some spoke at the meeting, and we may hold another session.
As long as there is an Arab consensus on it.
And I do not blame them if they have an opinion about the meeting.
And how can the problem be solved?
Because it will be solved.
This is the important issue.
Because our goal is not advertising, but finding.
So why was the summit neglected?
Even we ask ourselves
We'll go put pressure on the other poor side.
Previous and subsequent, and on the Security Council resolution, but let's just stick to the topic of the Arab Summit and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Speak clearly that the situation may require an Arab summit with those who attend it.
We found a majority of our brothers supporting the holding of the summit.
Who attended?
And I don't know what they mean by moderation.
We are the only nation.
If we go to a nation in Asia or Latin America, it is only the Arab nation.
Unsolved
That were classified as moderate states
And what is moderation in our eyes?
Will you abandon the Palestinian cause?
We don't just love them.
Are we interfering in the affairs of the Palestinians in some way?
No state allows the intervention of either evildoers or do-gooders.
Like Hezbollah, and who knows, maybe another movement will emerge tomorrow.
Is he asking?
Can we accept them as part of the Arab body?
As if we were meant to engage in an internal Arab conflict.
Agreed if we go to the Security Council.
There is no decision in the Security Council.
I hope Israel will finish its mission afterward.
The second Arab ministerial meeting I was invited to attend.
which was dominated by discussions, disagreements, and sharp disputes
There is an important point.
This is not the task.
When we called for the meeting
Terminal stations
No peace from now on.
Are the ministers ready for that?
Because there is a party telling us we should wait.
But we are in an Arab initiative.
Freezing peace talks with Israel.
We say that we are in a party that says we will lose in these elections.
There is no greater loss than the one we have suffered now, but we have always been respectful, polite, and committed to decisions since the days of the truce.
She says that squabbles are not important.
There was someone who wished that Hamas could be destroyed and such.
This incident reflects a political stance more than it does a dispute between two ministers.
Indeed, something distressing has happened.
Not the Book
I'm not eager to speak for others.
It is important to be men to ourselves and men to our state.
We are implementing the policies of our countries.
Who does these things on his behalf?
I think
I don't think they'll respect us in the end.
Is there anyone doing things on behalf of the West?
No, and I hope I don't accuse anyone, I don't want to blame anyone in this matter.
After the Security Council's decision
What will his agenda be?
The situation began with the resolution of Arab efforts.
And they disagreed here on whether Israel would immediately implement the decision.
We can say that there is a decision.
But Israel did not implement the resolution.
Are we ready now to go and ask for Chapter Seven? I am quite sure there will be difficulties.
Is the international community asked? And if asked,
You will be ashamed.
The state
Look, they did something for the Jew and the Israeli.
Let them take their rights.
This is the current Arab situation.
If the Arabs do not rely on the Security Council
They agree to hold a summit and make firm decisions.
And the Western countries will seek us out.
Because we are in an Arab depth, and while there are many people, you can see the reaction of the Arab street towards that.
But this decision is important.
The problem of appealing to our leaders one after another.
In the end, they said it was nothing, which was a lie.
Agree if we are now like Germany, or will we demand otherwise?
They don't have to pay any compensation because they were the ones who carried out the attack, just say you have incorrect information.
And the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives.
That's because you're a weak Arab party.
We went as Arabs, some of us.
I worked hard on how to do it.
To display it.
As if it were destiny and God's will.
If the Arab nation says: "If you send forces to Darfur, we will send forces to Darfur."
Arabs consider, or some consider, the decision of 1860 to be...
And our colleagues worked hard to issue the decision.
Issued by the Security Council
I'm not saying it was a victory or not.
And what will lead to it.
Let's assume it's victory.
What we will do
We are supposed to disagree with the rest of the decision.
But I assure you that we will comply with the decision.
Unfortunately, you will comply with the decision even though you shouldn't.
Even after the Israeli rejection, Israel came and agreed.
Means that we
Do you have an alternative, or are you the ones calling for a ministerial meeting?
I think that the Arab nation
In the meantime, I'm open to alternatives.
And I do not think the Arab nation is ready.
In implementing the Gaza siege
For various political reasons
Let Palestine prevail, one faction over another, rather than reconciling with each other.
We start by trying to make plans.
They met once, I don't know, some kind of Euro-Arab intelligence thing, without mentioning names.
And after they did that, meaning that we share.
In implementation
What is asked of us from the West?
But if we go
I want a classification in this.
Of course, I'm not talking about the decision, I'm talking about...
Follow-ups because the Gaza file has been ongoing for two years, not just now.
I'll speak about the topic that's exactly two years old, but precisely regarding the decision.
Do you have any warnings about its terms?
Neither issued nor implemented
We weren't invited.
Perhaps they think we have a different viewpoint.
The requirement was for everyone to have the same view of the universe.
It is not necessary for all people to have the same perspective, but I think those who left have made an effort.
And we thank them for that.
Regarding what happened in Gaza two years ago, and you call it parties.
and raise other factions that participated in the siege of Gaza.
Do you really agree with the statements, insinuations, or accusations made here and there?
A real Arab conspiracy is taking place in Gaza now.
We have partially reached it.
On this matter, let me tell you that we are not entirely informed.
But I know.
The Palestinian conflict
It ignited on the Arab and international levels.
And if not fueled, there would be little difference between them.
And after the elections
Hamas came and took control of the government.
By a majority vote
We should have given them a chance and seen.
They want reform, or they are still revolutionaries who only know weapons and fighting.
but on the day they came
At the Arab level, some of our brothers believed that these radical movements should not reach power.
Some say there was an assault just now.
Hamas, which breached the truce, or those Palestinians from Gaza who breached the truce.
Ceasefire
You remain while the Palestinian people in Gaza starve for two years.
He died.
For Israeli security reasons
It's clear we don't want them in power, but that doesn't matter to me in Qatar.
And what is the sin of the remaining people?
Then who decides?
Not all countries enjoy sovereignty in their choices.
Our government
Is the main problem...
And I'm sure it could have been solved.
Only if we had worked hard, we would have worked hard to ignite the conflict.
But it is clear that we were asked to allow one group to dominate another because this group...
We consider them terrorists.
Everything that happened led to
They promised the party that they would provide them with suitable pasture.
They didn't do anything for them.
We return to the international and Arab efforts exerted to end what is happening, as you mentioned.
There is a Security Council resolution that Israel has rejected so far.
And there is also the Egyptian Initiative.
And Egypt is in Cairo.
Those Egyptian efforts
Not at all and not a ruse.
Required for an important role
Egypt's borders also neighbor Israel and Palestine.
That we
And that we must stop the chaos now.
In Gaza, and we are trying to bring people to stop the chaos in Gaza because
This is not the path to peace.
It must be.
And that's why we always ask them to play a big role.
What was announced.
Does that mean you can't assess the initiative now?
Either enables success or study.
I think his chances of success are great.
If the brothers in Egypt can
Making Palestinian perspectives more similar.
And it is the injured party in Gaza who is compelled to initiate the discussion about the initiative.
Because he is the one who can say yes or no.
And this is an important point.
When Resolution 1860 was issued
This is an Arab-Palestinian problem that we have.
We don't want to hear any party.
But I really wanted it, when the Palestinian delegation left.
And when they went to the committee, they asked for someone from Gaza.
So the Israelites will know that these are our brothers, and we are with them.
This is an important point.
We will not hand over the responsibility to the government.
Our goal, not our policy, should be built.
To stay in power
The sheikh now.
I don't know if it's possible to discuss the Egyptian initiative since you haven't reviewed its materials.
Do you believe, in principle, that this could be an appropriate mechanism to implement UN Resolution 1806 as some people have claimed?
Balanced role
Now, not tomorrow or the day after, because
Every day passes.
There will be a bloodbath for our brothers there.
Therefore, we do not want to postpone or have the Israelis postpone on this matter, and when they finish their mission, we will put forward this initiative.
And I am sure that the brothers in Egypt know this and are investigating the matter.
I want to clarify everything you said.
Now we have to solve the problem.
And it is not as Israel desires.
The Turkish role has been attractive since the beginning of the crisis.
Does it express?
Empty Arabic
And without a doubt, a wonderful site.
And it has an Arab depth.
An Introduction to Disability in the Arab World
We know there is an Arab disability.
Some of it was due to conflicts.
Some, due to their perspective, each think that their perspective is correct.
And another thinks that his vision is the best.
And no conscience, how can you let people estimate and know that there is an Arab decision?
Or they will bring us one by one.
Another will say: No, we just give them two or three extra days so we can reach out to them and bring in peers to level the playing field and solve the problem.
We must rise above this and not accept it.
Hamas may make mistakes, but we will deal with them.
At the Arab level
But now
We said to them, "No"
Within the required Qatari stance, roles such as, we will return to this point later, but
At the same time, it was also heard in the field.
Yesterday, Khaled Mashal, the head of the Political Bureau of the Hamas movement.
First: What Brother Khalid Mish'al said was unnecessary, with all due respect and appreciation for him.
Why don't we sit with Khalid Mash'al and talk to him as Arabs?
We will go to him at the Arab University and inform him.
That's an important conversation.
From Hamas
Imposing conditions Israel imposes conditions.
Let them impose the conditions. Don't they have the right to impose conditions, and Israel is able to impose them?
What do you think of this Arabic gift?
They are cattle, and we should not listen to these commoners who say De Gaulle did not listen to them.
It is quite different; first and foremost, de Gaulle liberated his country.
His country from scorching occupation, aided by his allies or alone.
Now what are we talking about?
Is this the Arab gift we're supposed to give?
Leaders must represent the opinion of their people.
Arabs in all those demonstrations we've seen.
That can be met from these required courses.
Many of those who criticize Qatar at this stage also demand
Regarding what's happening with the actor, the office is still open.
They don't speak the same language.
Severing relations, we will go with all Arab states.
Sever the relationship, all ties, even if someone claims to have a treaty with them.
They want Qatar to make the sacrifice alone.
That we
And this is more important than the relationship.
Not only in this decision but in harder decisions.
This decision
We must have a unified Arab stance.
For others
No one sells another's place for moral, material, or any other interest.
Yes, before we close this file on this subject, there are also countries that have taken individual steps.
The good Chavez is a different matter, he has disagreements with the United States.
Our people don't need us to remember.
Five permanent member ambassadors, convinced that these are cinematic films.
We're done with that now, and the street knows it well.
With a high ceiling, O His Highness Sheikh.
Or demanding that Lebanese forces confront the Israeli aggression and so on.
Do you think that if it were framed within a single Arab framework, it might work?
But we call for an Arab stance that makes people respect us.
I think the Arab countries are not ready for war.
Not that we would encourage them to do that.
How will you unite Syria, Lebanon, and other countries? There are Arab states that do not communicate with each other.
It should be.
A shift in Arab relations.
This policy represents what is currently practiced among Arab states.
It's still standing, but I think it's expired.
In goals
The important issue
And we know how the Lebanese structure is.
There is no doubt that Lebanon
Their example is like that of one who
Things will be different in Gaza, for they are still...
Surrounded on all sides
This siege
Her nature changed.
Yes, I mean here Israel's goals, that is, the goals of the operation for Israel.
A day when you hit someone with it, and a day when you punish someone with it, and a day when you please someone with it.
An example of this is what happened in Lebanon; it is not a good example for them.
The solution sample that became in Lebanon.
I consider him good.
To Gaza
Listen, the problem of Gaza or Palestine is easier to solve than Lebanon's.
Those who disagree with each other today or tomorrow ... Will we retrieve our land?
Their disputes over power
Distribution of power
That differs because they are closer intellectually to each other.
I prefer the Lebanese intellectual.
Therefore, the solution is much easier.
And this is the problem.
His Highness Sheikh
We only have a few minutes left if we want to finish quickly.
Diplomatic deed
How can this process end?
Palestinian Gaza
I'll tell you.
Or reject
And help.
He did not agree with us on that.
It will be an Arab failure.
Based on the strategy
But on the Palestinian side
There were some efforts, but we didn't see a full initiative.
Not before now, nor now, why?
It's not so much a question of initiative as we feel.
Whoever solves our problem, we will help without mentioning Qatar, because some object to mentioning its name.
And there is no need for a summit, as there will be a summit held in March.
If we take the initiative, we will be better than our brothers. I don't think so.
And do not bear the burden for them.
Because history will not forgive us if we are unjust.
We are going through this initiative, we saw all parties where there was a meeting on the fourth day and it was postponed due to the Security Council.
God willing, we hope to make progress and we ask our Arab brothers to provide all the help they can in this matter.
And we hope to eliminate her from the competition.
Arab Competition
In heating up due to their dispute with the Sudanese government at one point.
And these are our problems; it's enough for us that we fight each other and don't agree.
I don't want to go through this.
In Kuwait, in the coming nineteenth month, I believe, of course, the Arab situation.
As you know, as mentioned and explained by His Excellency
Is the Arab climate entirely dry, or is it the first economic summit?
They named him.
Of course, we attend any summit held in a brotherly country.
And we do not object to attending any summit.
but he is not afraid that it will become a political summit.
Of course, taking into account the time that imposes itself.
It's too late even if it's in ten days.
Are you talking about the Palestinians after they were beaten for twenty-five days?
It will be
"Or will they not say, 'The Arabs have not united'?"
We said that.
We said that.
With all due respect, this conference has been arranged in advance and we are committed to it.
I mean, I think that we
The Arab Street is against us.
Our way of traveling
And for that reason
"And enter in peace."
Done, and guaranteed.
For this meeting
Thank you, esteemed audience, for watching.
Our coverage of the endless war on Gaza continues. Farewell.
An international day to celebrate people with disabilities was just a few days ago.
Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani
In Doha and contributed to the preparation of a draft law specific to
She was also a member of numerous local and Arab councils in the field of childhood.
He also delivered over seventy-five lectures, workshop papers, presentations, and articles published in Arab and international journals.
Initially, let's agree on the term currently in use.
It is preferable to use the term "people with disabilities" or "those with special needs" depending on the context.
Good evening.
Drawn from a culture of human rights or a culture of human rights because people with disabilities
Because it treats people with disabilities as people first.
Human
Then his attempt to adapt to society revealed his disability.
The medical concept was prevalent at that time.
Move towards a concept.
The field of special education emerged.
This category becomes
That's why we started calling them people with disabilities.
The normative rules from which it was derived.
The role of the Special Rapporteur in monitoring the implementation of this document.
The pace accelerated until the emergence of a legally binding international agreement, which distinguished itself from the rules in this regard.
Set a fundamental condition or core rule for this term.
These people are treated as humans, as individuals.
Is there a shift in this community group's perspective as the terminology changes as you mentioned?
Yes, and it is measured in a way.
That varies from region to region.
But the special thing about this
The Arab world is distinctive or different.
But legal trends include human rights and exist, for example, in Africa.
In Latin America, but the reasons might possibly be due to a lack of financial resources, right?
Of course, that's what I meant to say, that culture exists but its path is obstructed by a lack of resources, and sometimes by a lack of political will.
Sometimes laws, but
But unfortunately, awareness is also a bit low, and there is no culture of human rights.
People with disabilities make up 10% of the world's population.
80 to 90% of working-age people with disabilities in the population of developed countries
He suffers from unemployment.
I mean during my visit to Darfur.
In the presence of mines and weapons
Males are one degree better.
They will be in remote areas, far from civilization, and among them are people with disabilities.
Therefore, there are many directions of organizations working in this field and trying to raise.
Awareness and Realizing the Right to Education
Instead of creating numerous religious centers that can be talked about
They went on to establish rehabilitation centers, hospitals, and schools.
Praise be to God for that through our work in the office.
I tried with the current organization in Qatar.
Set an agenda
Or incorporate these centers into the agendas of humanitarian organizations.
In light of the deteriorating situation of persons with disabilities in the world
I can't name it, and I agree with you that there's a decline.
If there is a setback in the Arab region due to disability.
Placed in a social, political, and economic context, we cannot expect the conditions of disabled people to be
While they are among the marginalized groups.
In a country like I told you, Gaza and Darfur
On the contrary, I cannot assert that there has been no improvement in the situation.
And it has already been applied in reality, and if I can give an example, I would say:
Qatar Red Crescent
We agreed that the projects would include...
People with disabilities who have health issues are within the scope of this strategy, and there are also other programs.
We tried to include her as well.
Within the framework of the work of organizations on the ground
Kamal Kiro is with us now from Syria, welcome him.
Good evening, I am Selimane Kirou.
Islaman kiro, afu ani, talk Islaman.
My best regards to you and Mrs. Hafsa.
Firstly, is there a disability in the laws of the United Nations?
Intellectual blockage means that a healthy person has become a pressure factor leading to intellectual blockage.
My son was disabled as a result of torture and imprisonment, and his psychological condition became poor. He is still undergoing treatment to this day, six years later.
I know that there are around four hundred people, including children and the disabled, in the prison.
Is there a law in the United Nations?
In fact
Because they know them as they know their own children.
The general meaning without losing any part of the significance
And there are values in the West.
Agreed upon by people
Some of them are apostates or do not follow the wisdom of Islam, and they are not to be taken from.
Many thanks, Naif Saeed from Kuwait.
We go back to our guest for comment.
On the communications, Solomon wondered if there was any decline in cognitive abilities.
Yes, it's within the global ranking.
Regarding disabilities, of course, intellectual and mental disabilities, as they are called.
Are there sensory impairments among these disabilities, such as visual or hearing impairments?
Of course, as mentioned, disability
The action and the reaction occurring in a social context.
In the Arab world or any other region.
By the head, there is no doubt that the focus on disability has occupied a long period.
And even at the level of the United Nations
Like me, for example, during my experience and work as a Special Rapporteur, among the issues I tried to address and work on.
In another sense, it is everyone's right.
Until they present it to them.
And the different qualifying aspects to ensure their enrollment in schools as well as organizing work.
Working on vocational rehabilitation, including people with disabilities.
He had some improvements.
Especially after the reform
In general, this international committee exists.
Me too, I mean as a special rapporteur.
The fact that my work was positive for me was not directly related.
"Which supported this stance"
I've seen that in many meetings, for example, the international convention.
Rights of persons with disabilities
Hindered by these obstacles or these deficiencies.
For example, with regard to legal capacity.
This is one of the main points in the world of disability.
The United Nations, unfortunately, delayed them slightly during the preparation and drafting.
Regarding organizations and agencies
For example, and I'll end with it.
Governments of the world and non-governmental organizations based in the United States of America
We directed another questionnaire.
In United Nations organizations and agencies in various regions
To know the extent to which their agendas have succeeded in providing programs for people with disabilities
If budgets are allocated, participation is accessible to people with disabilities.
Human rights
And not only issues of evolution
We take more calls, with us now is Moucharaf Naji from Algeria, welcome Naji.
"Upon you as well" or "To you as well"
I wanted to ask my sister: Who exactly should be blamed?
I wanted to ask because I'm already physically disabled.
We will direct this question to her. I am Naji Machri from Algeria. Many thanks, Ahmed.
Welcome, Halabi, from Greece.
Good evening, ma'am. Good evening to your guest.
Healthcare, housing, seasonal clothing, and even taking them on seasonal tours - this is what happens in Europe.
Will a psychiatric patient be considered disabled?
Especially those who may harm themselves or harm others.
Everything we talk about falls into the category of unproductive discussion, thank you.
Sister Hassa pointed out the insufficiency of the funds.
In poor countries, especially in Africa, Latin America, and Asia, I demand...
Establishing an international fund to support disability and allocating one percent of the net profits of every institution in the world.
And this must be mandatory without any exception for any institution or company.
The inability of many disabled people, war victims, and the like will be compensated.
Many thanks to Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
Naji Mashri was wondering and revealed his problem as a person with a disability.
At the local or national level, across the Algerian Republic.
Needs must be met within the local community.
The same rights should be granted to anyone else.
In other words, the right to live first, then the right to housing, the right to health, and the right to education.
Therefore, I really appeal from this platform to governments, especially Arab ones,
For the benefit of the citizen and the individual.
To ensure
Those needs and rights within the framework of existing plans.
No, there is no need to invent any new devices.
To meet the needs of the disabled person or not to, if the state...
They must have committed to doing that and have made a firm resolution to carry it out.
I advise him first to return and review with the competent authorities at the government level if possible.
Because it is at the national level and must be within this scope.
You mentioned the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, but many countries have signed it without complying with it.
And here we have a question from a caller: Why are there no laws?
We are, without a doubt, in a human society, which means that mistakes are abundant and truths are scattered.
<h2>Undoubtedly, many agreements and undoubtedly many treaties do not contain a verbal commitment to them.</h2>
Or an ideal commitment for many countries that have joined conventions such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and others.
But there are violations and infringements, and we know it.
But the question is whether to adopt an agreement and organize it.
First, we will ensure there is at least awareness.
This awareness starts at the top of this pyramid with the decision-makers.
Officials, then gradually increasing until it encompasses society as a whole.
As well as our commitment to prepare and submit reports to the United Nations.
The issue of knowledge, understanding, and awareness to a high degree.
To the reports you worked on as a rapporteur at the United Nations
Yes, from what I've seen and come to know, there is interest.
There is thus a relative advantage to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
Therefore, I advise, encourage, and invite.
Similarly, it can be important for the disabled.
And we will hear what Ali Obeid Al-Sanani, President of the Qatar Association for the Deaf and Mute, has to say.
Mr. Naji Sakr will speak about this topic. Welcome to Mr. Naji and Mr. Ali as well.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
With me is Mr. Ali Obeid Al-Sanari, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Cultural and Social Center for the Deaf in the State of Qatar.
And chaired by H.H. Sheikhaha Hessa
Former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
I heard it from Qatar.
In fact, Sheikhah Hessa has a long history in this field.
The international agreement you are referring to now is indeed
Great benefit for all people with disabilities around the world.
And especially the Arab world.
And I ask as a deaf person.
These countries should implement this international convention.
This center will serve people with special needs, therefore it is essential that
Ready to find an advocate for this agreement in all states.
Obaid Al-Sananiri, President of the Qatar Association for the Deaf and Mute
We stop
And we continue our discussion after a short break, stay with us.
Send and share your opinions on important issues in economics, politics, sports, and other diverse matters.
The SMS service is via the live broadcast of Al Jazeera channel.
Dear female viewers, welcome to you and our guest today, Sheikhah Hessa Al Khalifa Al Thani.
International Fund for Disability Support
Disability and the obligation of all countries to provide funding. What is your opinion on this proposal?
The United Nations has a fund called the Disability Fund.
Unfortunately, those contributions are very weak.
Monitoring the implementation of normative rules
When I worked for six years, I received little to no support.
Only from China and Austria
And I always thank this country for its support.
The main supporter of the country is my own, Qatar.
Praise be to Allah who created the office, through which we were able to implement many activities and projects.
Yes, this lack of support foreshadows what's to come.
I mean, like we discussed initially, this point always comes up.
Conditions of ordinary people
The care of persons with disabilities or disabled care is called "Disability Care."
This means that if there is a realistic, genuine, and serious commitment.
In all cases, in all categories
Refugee and displaced children and women with determination.
All these matters may indeed reach a point called
Equal opportunities, participation, and equality
And there are these voices that are always demanding and never get tired or weary.
In the Islamic and Arab region, why is no part allocated, unfortunately?
For the benefit of these programs and projects.
As he has presented to him from this platform, I would like to express my profound gratitude to him.
Islamic Development Bank
Within the budget allocated for that.
Non-compliance with what you told me regarding the payment of financial dues.
Does funding to assist people with disabilities cover only developing countries and Arab states, or...?
Even developed countries do not provide.
I mean, the person who was before me and who is Swedish yes
Some countries in the European Union as well.
Certainly, there are many countries, especially in the Arab region, that may not have taken the same steps.
He is aware of this special course.
In my case, I mean what happened.
In Sweden and China
And the Arab region, unfortunately, has seen many promises, but only one country has kept its word.
We will talk about the Arab region, but
We have with us Hamad Al-Marri, a Qatari. Hello Hamad, welcome.
Peace be upon you
And upon you too.
Hello, Dr. Sheikhah Hessa.
It approaches ten.
We noticed that this girl suffers from a psychological disability.
What is your role towards the girl who suffers as she does?
With her colleagues
I mean, sometimes even when we try to maintain...
Your role regarding the daughters of Qatari women.
Many thanks to Hamad Al-Marri from Qatar and Kawan Behjat from Kuwait. Welcome!
As they say, Sheikhah Hessa.
Why don't we leave our petroleum in the ground?
Those with special needs can be counted among them.
And we can help them.
We have massive financial components.
We can break down the psychological barrier between us and them.
Boosting individual morale
And spend it in this noble cause.
If we are truly believers
Gratitude and appreciation to Sheikhah Hessa for all her efforts and everything she has done during her tenure as "Special Rapporteur."
With profound gratitude to her, and thanks to the State of Qatar for all it provides to people with special needs.
Many thanks, Aisha Mohammed from Qatar.
Peace be upon you, Professor Wasila.
Peace be upon you
Your noble guest
Her Highness Sheikhah Hessa
My question is about prevention.
As they say, prevention is better than cure.
There is another level of disability, apart from wars and traffic accidents.
In the jinn realm, it may result from families where relatives intermarry.
I think it's a large percentage.
Leading to disability
Many thanks to the noble standard-bearer from Tunisia, and now I return to our guest.
The first caller was Hamad Al-Marri, and he was wondering.
Where can a mentally disabled girl go?
And to whom should he go?
In every country
Confident that there are services providing for all types of disabilities in the State of Qatar.
Around these disabilities, whether they are mental disabilities like those mentioned or any psychological disabilities.
Schools
Previously, there was
Or do I not mean private education in the Ministry of Education, which is now the Higher Council?
The noble standard-bearer from Tunisia pointed to something of utmost importance.
Scientific research and the like
Only programs of organizations working in the field of disability, and even within campaigns.
Programs for women
All this has attracted many reproductive health campaigns and programs.
I talked about this aspect.
Adopts healthy strategies
Based on awareness.
To demonstrate the danger of marrying relatives
and genetic factors
I think it has been implemented in the State of Qatar.
Habits and traditions, but it definitely takes some time.
Especially in tribal societies
But over time there will be a response to it, but it is necessary that there be some form of legal commitment.
Yes, Bejt's caravan wondered and suggested allocating one percent of the budget of Arab states.
To help those who suffer from disabilities, let me first...
Yes, there is a statistical estimate applied by the World Health Organization to the entire world.
There are forty or approximately forty million people with disabilities.
Half of them are women.
But these numbers double.
Like a study conducted in South Africa where they saw and proved
War statistics in Iraq and Gaza certainly confirm that.
For every death, three are disabled.
And as the Arab region has become an indisputable conflict zone
Suggestion of Joyful Caravan
One percent will not be enough.
Assisting people with disabilities in the Arab region
The issue of percentages for people with disabilities or other marginalized groups.
In all honesty, I don't think it aligns with
that require addressing their issues and needs
Make sure that people with disabilities are the most neglected.
Government surveys do not count disabled people in general.
These habits are correct and sometimes related to the culture and societal constraints of the community.
When the census is conducted by
Relevant agencies
There is a disabled person in the house.
Is there a person with a disability or not?
The part related to this subject and by the concerned people there.
We cooperated in preparing the form.
We recommended adding more details.
First, it clarifies the gender of the disabled person, whether male or female.
Did he get help or not?
In fact, even if the numbers were correct, we wouldn't reach an accurate conclusion.
Progress in attention and care should also be present, with us from Qatar, hello Fatima Al-Dosari.
Peace be upon you too.
I am a Qatari citizen and I have a child with special needs.
And I thank His Highness the Amir of our country, Sheikh Hamad.
And Sheikh Moza banned him for supporting this category.
I am very proud to receive all this care and attention.
For her important role
Latifa Al-Musallem Hello
Because they represent major disorders in society without education, without treatment.
Thank you very much, Latifa Al-Messafer from Qatar, for joining us. Nasim.
Abdulkareem from Jordan welcomes Nesim.
Listen, Karim, we hear you clearly!
Peace be upon you
God bless you, I have a frank intervention.
First, I am a sound engineer and I worked in the State of Qatar for almost four years.
We had a month for raising awareness about speech and hearing disorders.
We held conferences, lectures, and seminars to raise awareness about hearing impairment.
Now I want to talk about Jordan, I've lived there for almost three years now.
Frankly, he provides new and good services.
Frankly, he provides new services, whether material, moral, or ethical.
Jordan's Ministry of Education
Ministry of Education in public schools
And our private institutions as well.
They enjoy good support.
Okay, Kareem, do you have a direct question? It's just due to time constraints, excuse me.
Do you have a direct question?
In Qatar, the UAE, and Jordan, the services are wonderful, and I believe they are excellent.
Can you comment on viewers' questions?
Who works in this field?
Regarding the subject
I will also return to the question of agreement.
Which are binding once they are ratified and acceded to.
As an obligation on the state or on these organizations
Because it's a matter of the rights of these people, regardless of
And frankly, what?
Working during that period for people with disabilities and the reason for that.
And you wish it would happen now.
Of course I hope it's equal.
I hope that this research or survey will be built upon and that higher-quality research will be conducted in this area.
And it seemed to me from this test as well.
Six years of experience
And coordination among Arab countries as well.
They also have a role, it's not just about rights, they also receive rights.
Sheikhessa Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani, former UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, thank you.
Now with us live on air from my channel League and Cup, Lana. Good morning, Lana.
I am also delighted to welcome the distinguished guest, Captain Umm Salal, Captain Ali Qasim.
Hello, Ali!
Hello %pw
Good morning.
I want to open the door to congratulations, for each of you to congratulate us freely, for our dear one, go ahead.
The studio is open for five hours and a two-hour studio the day before.
I congratulated Qatar, the country, the government, and the people, on that well-deserved international achievement.
I may have the opportunity to congratulate Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.
And his heir apparent, Sheikh Tamim
Yes, of course, Lana. You are from the field of sports and an expert in this area, with extensive knowledge of these lines and this field.
Because our file is also
It is competitive, which means that we deserve to win by a margin of six votes between us and the United States, fourteen votes for Qatar and eight votes for the United States.
That's because our file is rich and comprehensive and enjoys the support of many ambassadors, very good support, for example, the fields.
Perhaps some people were afraid, perhaps there was a percentage like in the United States.
And some countries are ready for that, and they do not have to provide playgrounds, but rather prepare some projects specifically for this low number.
Because they are already ready.
But they are concerned about this point.
Captain Ali, as athletes, I believe this is a very significant achievement for sports people.
It will have an impact on the economic, political, and health sectors, I think.
But you, mathematicians,
What does that achievement mean to you?
Barcelona wins the treble in 2009, and of course this is a huge achievement especially for us, even you saw the joy of non-sportsmen with this victory.
God willing, Ali. Tell me about the moment the winner was announced.
I left training and we were listening to the radio.
A friend and I were waiting for the announcement.
I'm driving and listening to the radio.
The moment they announced that Qatar and...
We both screamed, naturally we had opened the roof window.
So my friend threw his body out of the car's roof.
We were screaming, and everyone was looking at us. We signaled them with our flashlights and started our celebration alone.
We started celebrating from the beginning.
Alhamdulillah, it was a very special day. I think all the channels focused on this event a great deal.
Lana, of course you were involved in this.
Translate the following text into English, only print out the translation, do not add any explanations.
How did they celebrate this event and what was their reaction?
Many media and channels from all over the world were there.
It became a main teacher, appearing very clearly on the map, and the name of Qatar shone brightly.
Absolutely, Ali, the presence of the player in the team is extremely important.
And I consider it a responsibility that should be taken seriously.
What is your opinion on that particular point?
Peace be upon you, O Sublime one. Do they mention the required qualities for joining the lodge?
Now there are more upcoming sports events.
And we must prepare a strong generation.
He who has solid foundations and well-studied tactical plans in football.
So what are the rules and principles that a player should have?
And I think professionalism includes everything from
Rigorous, continuous training and discipline
All these things are essential to help him focus all his efforts on games or training.
I think each stage has a unique feature.
It has unique feelings and taste.
Talk shows and sports programs, which do you prefer, and where do you find yourself?
Wonderful
Engaging in exercise keeps you in good health and makes you feel how to maintain your body's fitness, and that's the truly important aspect.
Everyone watches football matches, and you'll automatically love them when you step into the stadium.
Is the work of people in the media limited to one aspect?
Doesn't that limit you in some way?
An open field, not just football.
They're all sports, but sports are great.
Ali, there are also some other important issues we would like to discuss.
Didn't you wish you could go back ten years in time to reach the year 2022?
Did you not wish for that?
Barcelona, of course, dreams of this, especially as it is the World Cup, and any football fan wishes for that.
Anyone who watches World Cup matches will be happy, so imagine how much happier they would be if they were playing in the World Cup!
I hope they live up to expectations, and this is their chance.
What do you want to say as a professional player, Captain Ali? What do you want to tell them from the bottom of your heart?
We love having you with us.
As I just said, I'm currently on vacation, but...
For his return to the international scene after an absence of twelve years from the Gulf Cup.
A beautiful comment from Qatar TV and wonderful memories.
With God's permission, Qatar TV will transform into a university that graduates large batches of male and female media professionals.
Our team is brave, and God willing, it will win many different awards.
We're discussing an important point about Umm Salal Club.
How are you there? How are you doing? I hope you're well.
Yes, praise be to God, sincerely.
Of course, yesterday we talked in the studio about many players.
So I think some of the young men who were watching us believe that you
What is needed
Player transfers between clubs in the Qatari league are frequent.
I think I had a good opportunity in Umm Salal, *as an offer*.
Alhamdulillah, I was able to secure a spot in the Asian Cup with the team.
My situation with the team is excellent.
How can we make sports a social affair?
In addition to Qatar, how can we attract women, children, and youth to engage in sports?
Connects everything, everything is sports supplements.
Women play a role in all fields of sports.
Every individual, whether young or adult, in this society realizes the importance and necessity of sports.
About eleven or twelve years until we reach this incident is enough.
We have newer generations.
The generation grows and matures, but we must raise a generation aware of sports from an early age.
We get Aspire, Aspire is an active building.
And they are essential for the new generations of athletes.
We just need to be firm and move forward.
And football in particular.
How can we engage the audience to interact in all matches of the various club competitions?
Frankly, the lack of audience is a problem we face in the Qatari league.
But the problem is attendance, as the Qatar Football Association has not yet found a way to attract the audience.
What method should we use to attract them to attend those football matches?
It depends on the person themselves; some people don't like coming to the stadium.
Media plays a crucial role in the public's refusal to attend.
And now they use a ticket or collect points here.
No, no, the Football Federation has a plan and many steps to attract the audience.
Some clubs have ways to attract the audience like Al-Rayyan, Al-Rayyan is a popular club and does not need to attract the audience.
Some clubs organize some activities and events.
For attendance, and to motivate them, I think those are the only ways.
The players, I mean the new generation.
They love what they do and believe in their capabilities, and as you mentioned, they not only need financial support but also greater moral support.
Many thanks for this wonderful meeting, God willing.
So, we'd like to hear your final word on Qatar's win to host the World Cup in 2022, please.
I would like to reiterate that Qatar is always supportive.
Insha'Allah, Captain Ali, your final word you'd like to say in this conversation.
Congratulations and we wish you continued success.
Thank you, Captain and Knowledgeable Player. I wish you success in your sports career and life. May God bless you.
I love sports even more.
The episode will be about young talents.
Some young people argue that these songs are popular these days; however, they have a rich and beautiful history.
A Ragabiean band is a group of young people singing Arabic or English words.
Today, we will talk to you about this with a group of volunteer rap lovers.
We'll get to know them better through the interview that will bring us together directly.
Welcome to our program, dear viewers, wherever you are.
For many years, a new genre of music has dominated the Arab and Gulf scenes.
It came from the west, especially from America, and it's rap.
Before we start talking about rap music,
There is courage in using any word without bias.
Anyone can rap.
For writing the words.
Most rappers write their own lyrics.
So we will know all these many and important details through two who have deeply entered this field.
They played together professionally.
Yousef Al-Nuaimi and Salman Abdullah, good morning Yousef.
Welcome, good morning Salman.
Good morning, welcome.
We are very pleased to have you join us in this program.
And of course, through the topic of rap singing.
Yusuf, how did you get into this?
We discovered that rap does not exist in Qatar.
In a better way
Spokesman for the Citizen
Including fun, sadness, and political topics.
Yes, I can say that.
And you see this song ... I see it as if an artist is painting a picture and the poet is writing a poem.
The singer can sing and the musician can play all instruments.
Do you think there is acceptance in Qatari society and Gulf society for this type of speech?
Two thousand ten.
Do you feel that people like buying rap CDs?
Diverse ages
Families and many people today are listening with more attentive ears than before.
There was something like a website.
How many of you are on this wave so far?
This means you can all say words, write poetry, and perform rap.
The rapper singer says
He is the one who sometimes plays and writes words.
Ah, okay!
I ask to hear and tell him that I recorded this song.
Alright, all these songs that you produced, Salman and Youssef, and anyone else in the same band.
Have you considered releasing it on a CD and distributing it in the markets?
And you know that if someone is alone, it means I'll be doing the album production and releasing it to the market, so the commercial recording and procedures are difficult.
Come on, why didn't you think? You're twenty-five years old, and a single page can't clap.
"You will be two, if God wills, with twenty-five hands, and God will protect you all, young men and brothers."
You can produce a CD and you can market it through more than one website on the Internet.
You have Facebook and YouTube, as well as local newspapers.
I think it contains thirteen songs.
The recording doesn't sound the same now.
It's a bit old, but it was clear.
It is of poor quality, not like now, but it is clear.
Produced about fifty CDs
There is rap, I can't say it didn't exist because there might be some young people who have known this art for ten years.
It's not as strong as the recording and I think the distribution during that time, now it's different.
Especially with the diversity of music now and the spread of various types of technical music.
Those men and those artists who produce a collection of wonderful songs.
As we would also like to talk about the parties you attended,
Look, the party we attended in Doha is one and the same.
Organized by Al Sadd Club, their cooperation was excellent.
We looked to witness the public.
We were surprised, we didn't expect such a huge number.
And we were also amazed to see more than one family present.
More than the youth
The organizations were wonderful.
We were a bit nervous because it was happening for the first time in Doha.
We didn't expect all this attendance.
The audience interaction was fantastic.
It took a long time, so there were many songs.
Okay, let's hear something from your lyrics and melodies that the audience loves, especially the youth.
We will play some verses to show the audience.
Can we listen to it directly?
Take your time.
Go ahead, Salem.
The problem is that it's random.
We will listen
I don't know.
Here is the Doha Morning Program
We were happy to have you at the program this morning.
Salman is an expert in this field, this is his fifth year in the rap scene.
And if people don't like it.
They know nothing about it.
The words are random.
Okay, for the songs you've performed, give me a few lines from your previous songs.
Look, not all songs are random, or what is called in English "free style".
They are in perfect harmony.
But when we sing, some words are chosen with great care.
Thank you, let's see.
We can say, good morning my country, good morning Doha program.
We are live on television, to the viewers.
What will one two one give?
Together from dawn's early light
A beautiful song you just heard
I insisted that the men distribute it everywhere and on the internet.
I really appreciate that, when will you release it?
Teamwork
Everyone writes for themselves.
He's never going to find it easy to do that.
Let each of them write.
Yes, I assume that every artist, whether a painter or a poet, is always
He can also write it out of love for sports.
Or love for the homeland
And I'm sure you participated in the National Day.
Through beautiful songs, you represent the youth of Qatar.
People are waiting for a dazzling celebration to welcome the Asian Cup, and there will be a festival on the corniche.
To celebrate that occasion
We are broadcasting this segment live now.
"Welcome to the Asian Cup, Doha"
From Doha Airport until now.
Let's watch this live footage together.
Reception, attendance, our children, the students
The Asian Cup arrived at Doha Airport this morning to continue its journey.
Preparations to host the major continental event
We return to our guests Youssef and Salman, whose presence delights us.
They are from an Arab Gulf rap group, aren't they?
Can we call it that way?
Currently, frankly, we
They are preparing a feast, but they are not sure about it.
But you are working on a concert that, God willing, Youssef will announce.
If God wills, but this is not certain, we are still beginners.
You are still at the beginning of your career, I wish you good luck, and know that our program will support you wholeheartedly.
Like Salman, where do you and all these people, twenty-five individuals, meet?
Where do you meet, and how do you bring all the ideas together?
I assure you that there are some shared songs.
It is not necessary for anyone to sing a whole song like Salman or Yusuf or any of you.
There must be cooperation among all of you.
Frankly, it's difficult to get the twenty-five together in one place.
I'll start by contacting Youssef and others and ask them to meet in one place.
Listen to the song lyrics and think about them.
And there is another way.
I claim my share.
And it is continuous.
So he wrote it down and sent it to me.
And look at other experiments.
Collect some CDs by famous artists.
Do you benefit from their experiences and techniques?
Yes, always.
Artists who have been doing this for years and have experience in the field.
We listen to them, learn techniques, and try to innovate with unique lines.
Because if we do the same thing, with the same tone, the same phrases
What we are about is not the creation of something new, but rather we want to do something.
We benefit from them a little.
Yes, there is also a large group of young people from the Arabian Gulf in the GCC countries.
In a primitive way, let's watch the report together for benefit and enjoyment, let's watch it together.
Those skills that some people possess are strange.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Praise be to God.
Abu Ibrahim Abdullah al-Dail
That's one hundred and fifteen kilometers.
I am from the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
He has good experience and skills.
Identifying shallow groundwater sites
For depths exceeding one hundred meters
Learn that drilling wells is very expensive.
Determining the appropriate location to dig the well, but an expert can do that.
Discover | Locate
Groundwater sites
Since ancient times
Our fathers and grandfathers
They consulted experts to find wells.
Digging
Abu Ibrahim's methods for finding groundwater
These are not modern techniques.
Or analyzing soil samples in laboratories.
He relies on God's mercy in his work.
And its underground rivers
Pomegranate seeds
Pomegranate or fig branches
Now, the scientific process is applied to the discovery of watercourses.
To end the broadcast, this is the end of the broadcast.
Come back again.
Return
From here, we start marking.
And here the table ends.
He needs a lot of experience and patience.
To know the sensitivity of the "to" movement
I visited many places.
Which means success 95% of the time.
Of course, and by using copper bars.
And there is no precise scientific explanation for
This method
What really surprises is the success rate of those who plant this primary profession.
Exceeds ninety-nine percent
In search of shallow groundwater resources
<h1>Glory is for Allah, Who taught knowledge by the pen.</h1> <p>This news is from the two noble sanctuaries.</p>
Who has their own band and has released more than one CD?
Whether on the internet or by phone
Sometimes competitions are held between Gulf countries, such as Qatar vs. Bahrain and Qatar vs. Kuwait.
They perform a stronger song for a stronger theme.
Addressing an issue, etc., there are many problems.
I see her as a role model.
"What Allah wills" or "As Allah wills"
At the same time, we want
Broadcast a large and varied selection of songs.
We hunt life among
Sometimes, we'll stay in touch with you.
Let's find out the latest news about the band.

We are proud of them and the beautiful arts they present.
Deals with various social and psychological issues of youth
But only two of them are with us in the studio now.
I'm sure they'll represent the rest.
Yusuf and Salman, welcome back.
Subscriptions sometimes end.
We tried to contact the company, but no one answered.
As a band, you need to keep developing yourselves, as people love bands that keep getting better.
Facebook and YouTube
and other similar sites
Band Name
You'll find us among the first search results.
Coordination and collaboration on this wonderful production.
The images are coordinated and matched with the songs, are these personal photos?
Or you can download it from YouTube and other video sites that you can follow.
Some of us did it before.
There are many songs.
The obstacles you face, such as the lack of a company that embraces you, and the lack of a website.
A place where you all meet as a band, that's really essential.
What are your wishes that you want to fulfill and achieve?
One of our shepherds
And prepare an album for us.
I hope it becomes official.
Because we spent five years.
"Like a drunk, no more."
Yes, we've participated in some things, in some series.
We hope the situation improves.
We have those who support us and stand with us.
Yes, Salman, we also want to know your demands.
My only wish is to produce a music video.
We wish you good luck.
We hope that all your songs become famous in the Middle East.
This is a very beautiful and popular art.
He bears a message, as you just said.
Good luck, I wish you all the success.
<h1>Welcome everyone, and we wish you success.</h1>
We conclude the program with the song they prepared especially for it.
This is a KD and DJ AMR El-Eldoh's program.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This Lady Bobo with Mr. KJ wants to get a hot body tattoo.
We can say, good morning my country, good morning Doha program.
We are live on television, to the viewers.
Don't forget, the show airs at 9:30 sharp. Everyone must watch.

Together from dawn's early light
Produced by Hassan Neama, presented by Shaima Al-Hamadani
The director is Nasser Al-Maliki, and the guests are Qatari rappers, of course.
It can be repeated again and used at home.
Like a shopping cart or a shelf cart.
I am shopping in the big store.
When you put any item, or anything you want to buy in
A large screen will display the components of this product.
It was a brilliant and practical idea.
Just a barcode, a scanner in the cart detects the item.
Facilitated shopping for the buyer.
He can get all the details on the screen.
I suppose it raises health awareness.
When the device is with you or in the cart.

Any warnings or side effects?

Or ambition, for example there are a number of projects, about four or five.
Concerned with the issue of traffic congestion problems.
He addressed the topic of traffic congestion and other issues such as parking problems, and was very creative and beautiful.
Insha'Allah, the Children's Cultural Center
Mr. Abdullah, let's discuss the various activities that will take place in the coming days.
Yes, there are also surprises, but we'll discuss them briefly.
Thoughts, I don't know if you want me to mention some of the projects presented or not.
As for underground transportation, the brilliant idea is
And after the man leaves his house, he finds an elevator.
And gather them at one place.
I assume that all viewers are enjoying the images they are watching now.
Children's Creations
Exactly, this example is like an ATM.
For women, perhaps I am carrying a card.
Enter it and say I want a shirt.
This is an example of some shops, or if you lose items at home, like the key.
Lost, for example, office key
A fundamental goal set by Her Highness Sheikh Moza.
Her Highness Sheikhha
From an early age, this has been a matter of great importance in project design.
For 300 selected children
We were also called narrators and orators.
Yes, it was she who hosted the closing ceremony.
To showcase their programs, we must truly open the doors to interested children.
Then they can start.
We need them to be there and support us, that's our priority.
These programs and activities serve that central idea.
Various diverse skills for children
Self-evolution
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Yes, we have numerous collaborations with youth clubs in Qatar.
There are also science clubs in Qatar.
Of course, all our programs are based on the exchange of ideas.
It's all a professional partnership.
by other community service institutions specialized in nurturing such talents
Participation from all concerned institutions
Photography Society
The Innovation Center for Girls, and the Secretariat of the Council of Ministers also played a crucial role.
Yes, Qatar's vision played a crucial role in clarification.
And training children on them.
Attracting and engaging children, as each program relies on institutional partnerships.
According to the importance of projects and institutions.
And Allah does not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves.
Here in Katara, they give us a strong boost and great support.
And faster.
We are currently, in collaboration with Katara, preparing for some projects that will be ready for launch within the next two months.
But it's a partnership in many programs.
Reading is a wonderful hobby and an important part.
Chairman of the Supreme Council for Family Affairs
And we are working on it, especially as we are in the preparation stage.
To build a promising future for all children, future generations, and youth
What would be your final words to the parents and children watching us now who wish to join the center?
What we are offering them now.
Sometimes our children come up with ideas that shouldn't be underestimated.
We will look into their ideas, no matter what.
Because when we take it seriously, it will grow and develop, at least we will encourage the child to think.
So it's important to provide care and attention to the child.
And our problem is also spiritual that most parents
I support him.
Encourage the sons, so we encourage the fathers.
The imagination of the child should be given greater attention, for today's children are the pillars of the future.
We wandered around the exhibition and got to know their projects.
We lived the dream.
Dreams and thoughts from a vast imagination
And the dream came true, and many of them were realized and became a reality.
Praise be to God, we wish success for our children who were there.
Our hearts are with you.
"What Allah wills" or "As Allah wills"
Of different ages and nationalities
Projects reaching seventy
He is a very pioneer and deserves to be implemented.
Let's talk more about this national exhibition.
And the Children's Cultural Center as well.
Mr. Abdullah, please briefly tell us about the exhibition.
There were a lot of activities, for sure, what do you think about that?
The children demonstrated a new style in expressing their love and loyalty to their homeland.
Under the patronage of the Minister of Education
On the tour of the exhibition
He will reach thirty.
We started training children on Qatar's Vision 2030 across all three themes.
Human development, economic development, sustainable development, environmental development
First, to understand Qatar's position in 2030.
Then, to start thinking about
Creative ideas, and how to be innovative.
I suppose they have a broad mind.
But when we help him
I suppose their minds will grow and grow even more.
Sir, I have inaugurated this exhibition under the slogan "Dreams of a Generation, Facts or the Nation of Tomorrow."
A slogan reads "Dreams of the Generation"
It will be part of Qatar's future, Qatar's tomorrow.
We felt that when we were walking with the children, when the child said to the minister,
I want you to open my project, I invite you to visit my project in the last ten days of the month.
A child wonders what it will be like twenty years from now.
They express their love for their countries in the field they are interested in.
There must be some activities, events, and competitions.
One of them won the Stars of Science award.
And also the first-place winners from the Arab League.
Yes, all the boys.
On the sidelines of the events, there were various performances according to a set schedule.
To display the projects they have implemented
A very large existence, a unique existence.
Stars of science
Some of the winners of the projects that participated in the exhibition.
Who won one of the major prizes?
Which forests or creative and natural reserves?
We also want to talk about the colored ball.
The colorful playground ball is also the dream and vision of children for Qatar's future.
A thirty-year plan for twenty.
How can a child contribute a creative idea to "2030"?
Its main idea is the presence of an electronic chip in the ball.
The referee signals with a distinct color.
For example, the referee can see the ball's movements.
Or the playground is transformed by this electronic slide.
Fixed in the ball.
Of course, there are creative ideas. This is the main idea, and some people might ask...
And projects
We always say, we have reached this stage.
Developing skills and broadening their horizons
Giving them an idea of how to express their love for their country through these projects.
It gives them confidence in how to present the project, engage with the audience, and explain its idea.
In a field he loves, attached to something he takes pleasure in, all of this is achievement.
Support us, and we thank him for that.
Which is now in the development stage.
Both projects also enjoyed public support, the committee, and some officials.
The forest first, no, it was second because this girl
Pipes, channels for the audience to attend underground, and the way viewers enter need arrangements.
An enormous reserve forest
A place where visitors can enter and see animals and reptiles.
Sensors have also been fitted to some animals to examine their condition.
There is also the marine environment, and the way to access it is creative as well.
One of her other reasons for success is her detailed and expansive imagination.
All this qualified them for victory.
It was also mentioned who spoke about an underwater tourist city.
Butterfly City
A forest on earth.
Many tourist concepts
Extreme interest
Perhaps this is a need of their minds at this time, perhaps in the 2030s.
In the future, that will be achieved.
Three projects.
They said these are the projects we have to work on and they have been approved by the science club.
There's a project that utilizes unnecessary AC condensate water.
A glance at Al-Arab newspaper
The article states that Qatar University is celebrating the graduation of a new batch.
His Excellency Mr. Saad bin Ibrahim Al-Mahmoud
Minister of Education and Higher Education, Secretary General of the Higher Education Council

It is an educational achievement, and we wish them success in all specialties, God willing.
He is considered one of the young promising actors who are making a strong entry into the Qatari drama scene.
How long? Also Tsaniyev and colored ribbons.
Actor Abdelhamid Sharshani is one of the actors who made themselves.
If it's not convincing.
He will not be chosen to work on projects implemented within Qatar.
Currently, artist Abdel Hamid Sherchani is participating in two dramatic works: A Killer Feeling and Tasaneef Part Two.
We're pleased to have him as our guest this morning.
Let's talk to him about his involvement in these two projects and his overall experience.
Welcome and good morning
We are happy to have you on the Doha Morning program. This is the first time I meet you, and this is your first visit to Doha Morning.
With people who work hard for the program
And you, Ms. Lisa.
Welcome with us, before we start talking,
Alright, let's watch.
I am a responsible man and an executive manager.
And I enforce the laws.
The only thing I can tell you is,
Give me the best.
Listen, why are you asking me?
"Go and ask them, for if anyone agrees that you do not have to return the dish,..."
Of course, as a beginner, I have another question, but since we've seen this part of the series, let's consider it the second part.
He pointed to Khalid ibn al-Walid.
Some historians link the famous poet Amr ibn Kulthum al-Taghlibi, known as "Amr al-Qays," to the city of Marrat.
A lot of things and information related to that city in Saudi Arabia.
For more information, we will watch with you this excellent report prepared by our colleague Abdurrahman Marzouq.
We watch it together.
"Testimony should come from those who know, and there should be no favoritism or flattery."
Emphasizing the history of this city or that.
What we see of its ancient monuments and what we hear from its narrators, storytellers, and poets.
This register is an important document that adds to the city's historical and modern records.
Mura once was a city in Saudi Arabia.
Historically, it is an ancient town founded in the pre-Islamic era.
Is there a debate among historians about its naming?
Some believed that the name dates back to the famous poet Imru' al-Qais al-Kindi.
And the pool which is called by His name
The date of its creation is unknown.
In the pre-Islamic era.
The most famous thing in the city of Marra is Jebel Kumait, which inspired many popular proverbs.
Because it's within and close to the city.
Dry. These are historical places.
This panorama is considered a tourist attraction in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Al Merkhiyah Municipality has done a great job in planning.
And a garden above this mountain.
And seats for the people of the area and for everyone in the kingdom.
Named after the Prophet's companion Khalid bin Walid (may God be pleased with him).
To fight the apostates and the liar Musayyah ibn Hazam.
One of its effects is the Valley of Komait.
A place where water from streams gathers and is retained for a long time.
It was one of the most important sources of water in the past.
From its heritage is also the Dawah Heritage House.
Marat is a city whose historical roots date back to pre-Islamic times.
He was known for his poets who were influenced by...
With its beauty, its ruins, and its famous mountain "Komet".
Abdulrahman Al-Marshed in the Doha Morning Program
The city of Marrat, north of Riyadh.
Welcome back, esteemed guests.
I hope you can tell us and the viewers about those methods and techniques.
Initially, I stated that our infrastructure is very unique.
We opened a file for him and registered him in our system with a special record.
Email to her guardian.
This report contains the extent of increased attention, faster typing, faster reading, and overall deviation.
The guardian receives a full report.
Alright, this report will be added to the student's file.
For his son's online record
And he witnesses the progress of his son.
He can see his grades and interact with teachers.
Let's truly enjoy the cleverness of this beautiful girl.
Let's bring most of the children to the center and send our warmest regards to them.
Who registered at this center with a teacher who teaches there.
Let's assess her intelligence and the level she has reached since she joined the center.
Of course, this year.
Focus on one task at a time, and after Ramadan.
But this effect always comes at the expense of other works.
There are people who only watch TV during Ramadan.
He stays up watching television, while the people spend their worship months armed with it.
Lower, lower, lower the baskets, lower, let them do work every two years, isn't that better?
Of course.
I hope they love me in Ramadan.
But I would like to extend my utmost respect to you all.
Oh Lord,
And also with plays.
From drama to fashion.
Fashion show at Katara Cultural Village
"God willing, we will continue with you with great love and sincerity."
Develop the children's skills and abilities to a greater extent.
Unlike the diverse schools in this noble country.
We have a model and we've spoken to our guest whom we met earlier.
Now we have Mr. Ibrahim Hussein Abdelsalam among us, and welcome, good morning.
How are you, Ounissa?
I'm fine.
Which grade are you in now?
Professor Ibrahim, to start, could you please introduce us to the course offered by the center?
A wish is an example.
We will also try the technique or method that Ms. Nesima talked about with her.
Do you feel a difference in his mind?
Do you feel that these skills and techniques,
Things will change regarding his mental skills or even his educational level.
Scientific methods
Including initially testing the child using an international test called the TONI test before starting anything in the program.
I also start the second part of Tony's test.
We can measure the student's level or the change in their level through it.
Now a test or something like that will be conducted.
You'll consider it a wish and respond immediately live on air.
Of course, Amnia has no idea about the questions.
We surprised them with this thing.
Of course, I have another question first.
We would like to ask you about your participation in the second part this year.
What is your contribution? Can you tell us about it?
After presenting the first series of naturally occurring compilations.
Alhamdulillah, I've been lucky in several roles.
Mr. Ghaneem,
Distributes roles with CEO Ashraf Shohata and Mr.
A chance from a wheel to produce art
For the youth
Mr. Ghaniem nominated me this year for
Of course, every episode is different.
I have roles in more than one episode where I'll be portraying different characters.
On the contrary, it's a wonderful experience. In this job, we have
A pyramid among Kuwait's pyramids, Professor Saad Al-Faraj.
We have actors from Bahrain, Abdullah Malik, Ali Al Gharair.
Like Ali Mirza, we have
You also have a group of young actors like Abdullah Adham.
Yes, among our young actors we have Abdullah Al-Asam.
This happened a year ago, and last year we did two works in the year.
Maybe that's why I asked you before the live broadcast. You've been doing your role since 1997.
But you've achieved nothing, or your ambition to act.
Praise be to God for everything.
Did you study acting or was it just a hobby?
No, I consider it a hobby.
My translation of art as a talent. %PW I was inspired at the beginning by the artist Abdulaziz Jassim.
He is one of the actors who consider me their son.
If you need anything, I'll talk to him.
We were in all his chains.
We worked hard, praise be to God.
Now, without Tara, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Mr. Abdulrahman Al-Sulaiti, and with a very, very special thank you to Mr. Abdulrahman.
If we compare ourselves to Kuwait, there are between 12 and 16 new actors emerging every year in Kuwait. Why?
For them.
Of course, many thanks to you because it provides many opportunities.
But, let's assume,
Let's talk about the other series, we have an idea about Tsansaf.
We need to know about the killer instinct.
And also the foot.
We have a sample, with us here is the processor Mr. Abdulaziz Al-Muyouf Al-Tameemi.
Until this process is aired.
And we will look into how we deal with the person. Firstly, I would like to greet Mr. Sobhi bin Hamza in the morning, you are welcome.
Welcome and peace be upon you.
So please, go ahead, Sir.
God willing
In the name of God.
We hold hands.
We see the nerves.
It's as if it's a painting or a message from God Almighty, in which all the parts of your body are shown.
From within and its problems
You feel dizzy sometimes.
I had a headache and dizziness.
Loosen your hand... Loosen it... Let your nerves relax... Yes...
And thus, Mr. Abdulaziz, you will discover something about his hand that indicates he suffers from a certain illness.
On his left side. His ears, he has a mild infection in his middle ear.
Is that painful, Mr. Abdulaziz?
Ear, do you have an ear problem?
Since I was born and since I was a child.
Do you have pain here as well?
They are lateral nasal pockets!
Do you have a nose ache and a headache here?
I got a headache here.
He has a sinus problem.
It causes a headache between his eyes.
Weight increases without food.
Her thyroid gland is not functioning properly; she feels sluggish and lethargic all the time, as if her body is heavy.
I sleep a lot.
Either oversleeping or laziness, you always feel sluggish.
She always suffers from tonsilitis.
Yes. Look at the trembling, you can see the trembling.
He's under pressure, and this might be the last time you ever do this.
Are you from Tunisia?
Wow, you mentioned things about him.
Is this treatment also beneficial for children?
The hand of God is great, the mother's finger is like the size of the baby's palm.
Most children are not sleeping, why?
When you carry him, he doesn't like to be carried, but people think he does. He has gas in his stomach, may good fortune be with you.
As soon as the mother places her thumb extended on the thumb
In the palm of an infant's hand.
The hands are parallel and the child is parallel with them.
Download it so that every housewife can learn it.
You'll start by pressing like this. Right and left, right and left.
This thing belongs to the child, belongs to, belongs to, the child and it is nice.
That corresponds, in terms of discoveries, you have specific discoveries dedicated to women.
As we said, women in every household make up ninety percent, may God protect them.
First thing, first alert from ceramics and down to the floors.
When we walk barefoot on ceramic, it's acceptable to walk barefoot, but walking on uneven ground is dangerous.
Walk barefoot! The proof is when ceramic was used in homes, health problems increased.
Because it's cool and even.
When the carpet was present, there were problems, they suffered from shortness of breath.
Rise.
A woman should take care to focus on walking barefoot with her heels on her ankles.
This is the ankle and the area of the ulna located at the back, the ulna.
From here, this is the ankle and now down the ulna.
This is the first time for discovery, and the second time for facilitating reproduction.
Just focus with me for a bit.
In her seventh or ninth month.
Generally, just by being in the month of delivery.
I mean, they don't go to the eighth grade, the eighth grade is dangerous, and the most dangerous thing is that they walk barefoot.
A pregnant woman should be cautious about walking barefoot.
If she is in distress
"I seek refuge in Allah from the outcast Satan. And that a provision may descend upon you from heaven, or that there comes upon you a
Our lady Mary, peace be upon her, we know that her provision is apportioned to her.
I even discussed this with scholars, and they told me: "Why do you change the interpretation of Ibn Kathir?"
I told them that I give them an idea that God placed in this science and inspires to me.
Shake the tree trunk towards you, what does it look like when you shake a palm tree?
He is sharp as nails or thorns.
When you shake the palm tree, it gives an order to the womb, which is the uterine region here in the middle.
It's the entrails. They issue commands to facilitate birth and reposition the fetus.
Elevating the fetal head or repositioning it so that it comes out naturally.
Praise be to God, this is one of the benefits of this fruit.
He takes her hand and starts to soothe her.
Some consider it a practice, and some know it is a science.
That's why they're afraid to tell you, and you don't believe them.
Yes. Your discoveries are important, Mr. Abdulaziz.
But I'd like to ask you one last question because time has flown by.
If someone wants to contact you, or anyone wants to reach out to you, what specific email address can they use to get in touch with you?
Alright, the mobile phone number is in the control room. If anyone wants to contact Mr. Abdulaziz, they can call us after the program.
Of course, he needs to contact Qatar TV to get this number.
I was created only to serve people.
If we believe in this faith, God will bless your work and guide people to righteous deeds.
I have sins like other people and do everything you can imagine. I am an ordinary person.
But we aspire to more good.
We always think of good things.
Dear viewers, I hope you enjoyed this special segment on reflexology and hand massage.
And also through the foot.
We watched a live hologram and how it detected the diseases this person was suffering from,
And from what he suffers. I hope we can benefit from you, and if anyone wants to correspond with him, they can find him through the internet.
How it will be implemented in the coming days or years, and whether it will include other schools.
Good morning.
How do you evaluate this experience?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
The fat has fallen on the countries of the Gulf, a major dilemma.
That's why we were afraid that Qatar would become the fifth state among them.
This program, frankly, happened to be the first lady in New York.
He visited Doha and they had a program for this.
They presented it to us, we adopted it, and said it pleased us.
Our students alongside students from New York, Spain, and England,
Therefore, we can observe the level of our students in Qatar among the countries of the world, and this is what we strive for in the future.
Because we encourage students to eat fruit.
And he refrains from exercising.
Of course, the fifth week is your family meal with your family.
We kill two birds with one stone.
In the sixth week, he tells us about what he gained from this experience, and praise be to God that we conclude it today.
We are happy with the students.
You knew that there were three independent schools for boys, Abu Ubaydah,
Al-Mostaqbal Girls' School Ruwaiqiyah
And with a lifted spirit.
The family became more aware, and their siblings were excited at home and started eating this food like them.
The habits transferred to him and became part of him, passing them on to his family in his home.
He went and told them that they had given this to me or taught me this.
Training staff or those providing this information to students
How was he selected and how was the interview with the student conducted? Who provided the introduction?
Yes, there were many official bodies that helped us, may God reward them.
We have brothers at the diet center who educate them about food, of course, healthy food.
And learn from Lady A'isha Al-Tamimi the etiquette of eating.
How they arrange themselves, and how they prioritize!
To learn about cooking, sports, or to educate about the value of healthy food.
It was in the form of separate lessons, curricula or
How are these ideas presented to students?
In various ways, some within the school,
We organized a day at the beginning of the program in the Aspire zone, and gathered all the students, boys and girls.
These things are not linked to a specific person, but we are all responsible for them, responsible, because these are our children.
How they deal with students at first!
I said at the beginning that the results were satisfactory.
Are three sessions or specific sessions enough in those schools?
Now, when an experiment starts in the world, it doesn't start on a large scale.
Starts from a reasonable range that includes all features; boys, girls, independent, and private.
Because it is not suitable in our culture, environment, and family circumstances, where they accept certain things for their children and do not accept others.
They want to participate in it primarily, and frankly, this is very important.
The student who is twelve or thirteen years old, this is the right time for him to know his health condition.
This is a torment for many people who want to be thin, but think it's impossible.
Some of the actors we see in the movies are very thin, which makes this statement impossible!
We talked in detail, but there were many weeks we couldn't cover.
And through the morning of Doha, we can remind them of it.
And fruits rich in vitamin B that you can get from fruits and vegetables.
So a person should know the benefits of fruit and that by eating it, their health improves, making their mood better.
Regarding fruits, they went to the supermarket and picked their fruits.
So, that's a point.
Diversity is certainly there, and competition as well, where each school has excelled with its distinctive ideas thanks to its teachers.
Spirit of competition
We give them guiding principles, and it's up to each individual to be creative.
Do the teachers train the students, or do you have specific staff for that?
We trained them, we trained them.
But teachers added, for example, some schools like Abu Obeida, said they would dedicate Saturday to student activities.
This is a day outside of school hours, and they are deciding and approving it. Rokia's school said they will march in a parade.
They said they would have a healthy cooking day for the girls, but we didn't force the boys to cook healthily for themselves; the girls were more skilled at it.
I would also like to extend my gratitude to Rayan Water for providing free water to all schools, Rayan Water in this regard.
Of course, water is much healthier because it must cleanse his body of all these toxic substances that enter it daily by passing through water.
We said the third week.
This means that his body is moving.
He might be playing soccer or basketball and doesn't know that this is the game I love.
True, true, exactly, and some might want another game, perhaps they don't like team games.
Live with us.
Today, our program hosted Mr. Abdulaziz Al-Jaber, the founder and president of the Qatar Multiple Sclerosis Association.
We of course strive to focus on important topics as much as possible.
We would like to introduce and educate our dear viewers about multiple sclerosis. So, what is it?
Because this name might be unfamiliar to us as well.
The number of women was greater than the number of men.
All the treatments available now are preventive treatments.
The white blood cells that are supposed to protect us start
He hurts us by striking the nerve cell.
"He will make it easy for the masses, as if it were a thread."
Covered with a layer called myelin, we can say it's a nylon layer.
Of course, this generally leads to dizziness and double vision, diplopia.
It also led to problems in the digestive and respiratory systems.
In the worst case, it leads to madness, and results in quadriplegia or hemiplegia.
Of course, treatments.
The most important functions of the body will be severely damaged.
Or from these diseases another disease called multiple sclerosis.
Some theories suggest that it is transmitted by a virus.
The disease is not an epidemic.
It doesn't pass to children.
Some people consider it a disease, depending on the region.
The equator, for example, was not affected by this disease.
Currently, we have some cases of this disease on the equator.
So far, there is no cure for this disease because its cause is unknown.
So far, scientists have been unable to find the cause of the disease, and thus a cure for it.
Now the process is reversed.
They try to avoid the impact of the disease itself on the human body.
In other words, they start working from the back.
We might be a little afraid of this subject, which we can say that this disease comes suddenly.
Is there a particular group that believes this disease spreads among its members?
Globally, it was ranked between 20 and 40.
Currently, the international community has reduced the number of cases of the same disease from twenty to fifteen.
Because it has started affecting young people up to the age of forty.
But the wound in the human soul remains unhealed.
As a community, we are open to alternative medicine and prophetic medicine.
Yes, through the association, the Association of Qatar's Multiple Relations.
Why do we have this society?
I thought about establishing an association to address this issue due to the large group of people interested in it.
Of course, I'll give you some random numbers.
In Kuwait, there are reportedly sixteen thousand cases.
A thousand cases.
The rest of the Gulf countries range between one hundred and three hundred.
When I was diagnosed five to six years ago.
My decade was sixty or sixty-four
Are there any symptoms that appear in the patient indicating that he is actually suffering from this disease?
We're not certain if this virus is the cause, so we don't want to jump to any conclusions. That's the point.
Another point is how do I know if I own it or not.
This is very complicated.
I am perplexed! Oh Professor Abdel Aziz, in an attempt to understand a specific point.
