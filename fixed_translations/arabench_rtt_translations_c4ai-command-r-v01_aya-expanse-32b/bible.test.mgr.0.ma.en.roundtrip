� khoaen is the most important person in the kingdom?
� khoar when the disciples came to Jesus, they asked him, saying, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
And Jesus called a little child, and set him in the midst of them.
Jesus said, "What I tell you is the truth. You must change and become like little children. If you do not, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
khoa he who becomes like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
"Whoever welcomes a child like this in my name welcomes me."
"But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea."
khoa how severe is man's trial with wealth and children! And that it is only when he reaches his Lord that He will inform him of what he did. But they were strengthened with authority in the life of this world, and on the day when the witnesses are gathered, the day when wrongdoers will not benefit from their excuses, and they will have the curse and they will have the evil abode.
If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter eternal life with one hand or one foot than to be thrown into eternal fire with two hands and two feet. For the fire prepared for the devil and his angels will never be extinguished.
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. How much more valuable is a person than a sheep!
"See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven."

What do you think? Suppose a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders away. Will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off?
I am not really concerned about updating him. If he comes across that sheep, he will be happier about it than about the 99 that did not go astray.
Even so your heavenly Father does not wish for one of these little ones to perish. And if your brother sins against you, rebuke him.
If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother back.
But what if they do not listen to you? Take one or two others along with you. For by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be confirmed. Deuteronomy 19:15
But if they will not listen to you either, tell it to the church. And if they refuse to listen to the church, let them be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.
What I tell you now is true, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
And as I told you before, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask for, my Father in heaven will do it for them.
"Wherever two or three are gathered in my name, there am I with them." The servant who did not have mercy.
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you not seven times, but seventy-seven times."
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
And the king began to do so, when a man who owed him millions of dollars was brought before him.
The man was unable to pay, so his master ordered him to be sold along with his wife, children, and all his possessions to recover the debt.
The servant fell to his knees before him. "Give me time," he pleaded. "I will pay you back everything."
His master was pleased with his luck, so he freed him and forgave him what he owed him.
But that servant went out and found one of the other servants who owed him a few dollars. He seized him and choked him, saying, "Pay back what you owe me!"
The other servant fell on his knees. "Give me a chance," he begged. "I'll pay you back."
But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and threw the man into prison until he paid back all he owed.
The other servants saw what had happened. They were very disturbed by it. So they went and told their master everything that had happened.
Then the master called his first servant and said to him, 'Wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me.
"Did you not desire that He should forgive your servant, as I have forgiven you?"
His master was angry with him and handed him over to the jailers. He will be punished until he pays back everything he owes.
So will My heavenly Father also do to you if you do not forgive each one from your hearts his brother.
Jesus teaches about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Large crowds followed him. He healed the sick there.
Some Pharisees came to test Jesus. They asked him, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
They are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.
They said, "Why then did Moses command a man to divorce his wife with a written document and send her away from his house?"
Jesus answered, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of heart, but it was not this way from the beginning."
This is what I told you. Whoever divorces his wife and marries another is an adulterer. A man may divorce his wife if she is unfaithful to him.
The disciples said to him, "If such is the case between husband and wife, it is better not to marry."
Jesus answered, "Not everyone can accept this saying, but only those to whom it is given by God."
Some men cannot have children because they were born that way. Some were made that way by men. Others made themselves that way for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever can accept it, let him do so." Little children are presented to Jesus.
Some people brought their little children to Jesus. They wanted him to lay his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
Jesus laid his hands on them, and from there he went away. Jesus and the rich young man.
A man came to Jesus and said, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?"
"Why do you ask Me about what is good?" Jesus replied. "There is only one who is good. If you want to enter the kingdom of heaven, keep the commandments."
"Which?" asked the man. Jesus said, *"Do not murder. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness."*
Honor your father and your mother (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) and "Love your neighbor as yourself" (Leviticus 19:18)
"I have obeyed all those commandments," said the young man. "What more shall I do?"
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
When the young man heard that, he left sadly. He was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
And again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When the disciples heard this, they were astonished and asked, "Then who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter answered him, "We have left everything and followed you. What then will there be for us?"
Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, and all of you who have followed me will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
"Whoever leaves a house, family, or wealth for my sake will inherit an eternal dwelling place and be rewarded a hundredfold."
But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.
The Story of the Workers in the Vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
He agreed to pay them the usual wage for a day's work. Then he sent them to his vineyard.
Around nine o'clock in the morning he went out again. He saw others standing in the market doing nothing.
He said to them, "You also go and work in my vineyard. I will pay you the right wage."
So they went. And he also went out about the hour of the morning and again in the evening, and did likewise.
Around five o'clock he went out and found others standing. He asked them, "Why are you standing here all day doing nothing?"
They said to him, "Because no one has hired us." He said to them, "You also go into my vineyard."
And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to the foreman, "Call the workers and give them their pay, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first."
The workers who were hired arrived around five o'clock. Each of them received their usual daily wage.
Then when the first group of workers came, He hired them for a wage like theirs. And He gave each one of them his day's wage, and He made them happy.
Upon receiving it, they started complaining about the owner.
They said, "These people who were recently appointed only worked for one hour, yet you paid them the same as us. We did most of the work and spent the whole day under the scorching sun."
The employer replied to them and said to one of them, "My friend, I am dealing with you fairly, aren't I? Didn't you agree to work for your usual daily wage?"
Take your money and leave. I want to give those I appointed for the final work the same wage I gave you.
Am I not the master of my own wealth and free to do with it as I please? Do you feel cheated because I have given generously to others?
"So the last will be first, and the first will be last." Jesus taught his disciples for the third time about his upcoming crucifixion.
Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. Along the way, he took the Twelve aside to speak to them.
He said, "We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death."
Then they hand him over to the Gentiles. They mock him, flog him, and crucify him. On the third day he rises from the dead!
The mother of Zebedes sons came to Jesus with her sons, and kneeling down, asked him for something.
"What do you want?" Jesus asked her. She replied, "Grant that one of my sons may sit at your right hand and the other at your left in your kingdom."
Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?" They said to him, "We are able."
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from the cup that I drink from. But to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The other ten pupils heard about it. They were angry with the brothers.
Jesus called them together and said, "You know that the rulers in the Gentile world lord it over their people, and their high officials exercise power over them. But it shall not be so among you."
Do not be like that, but whoever wishes to be first among you must be slave of all.
"And whoever wants to be first among you must be your servant."
Be like the Son of Man, who did not come to be served, but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom for many who are set free.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, and a great crowd followed him.
When Saturday comes, mercy descends, forgiveness descends, blessings descend, and abundance descends. Mercy descends, forgiveness descends, blessings descend, and abundance descends. Mercy descends
The crowd ordered them to be silent. They said to them, "Be quiet!" But the two men cried out all the more, "Lord! Son of David, have mercy on us!"
Jesus stood and called to them, "What do you want me to do for you?"
Our Lord, we hope to see.
Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes, and immediately they received their sight and followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem
And when they came near Jerusalem, and had come to Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
He said to them, "Go into the village ahead of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied there, with a colt by her. Untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone tells you anything, tell them that the master needs them. The owner will send the money right away.
This happened in order to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet.
"Say to the city of Zion, 'Behold, your King is coming to you, humble, and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.' (Zechariah 9:9)"
The disciples went and did what Jesus commanded them.
They brought the donkey and the colt, laid their clothes on them, and Jesus sat on the clothes.
A great multitude of people spread their cloaks on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
Some people translated before him, and others followed him. Everyone shouted: "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest!"
And when Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up, and they said, "Where is this coming from?"
The multitude answered, "This is Jesus, a prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus drove out the temple money changers.
Jesus entered the temple and began to drive out all who sold and bought in it. He overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer' (Isaiah 56:7), but you have made it a 'den of thieves' (Jeremiah 7:11)."
And the blind and the lame and the sick came to him in the temple, and he healed them.
And the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonders that he did, and heard the children in the temple crying, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" And they were indignant.
"Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. Jesus said to them, "Yes. Have you never read, 'From the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth your praise'?" (Psalm 8:2)
Then Jesus left the crowd and went home. A large crowd followed him, and he healed many who were sick with various diseases. He also cast out demons with a word, and healed the sick.
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the wayside. He went up to it, but found nothing on it except leaves. And he said to it, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again!” And the fig tree withered at once.
The disciples were amazed and asked, "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?"
Jesus answered, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what I've done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and it will happen. Nothing will be impossible for you."
If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer. For the power of Jesus is upon you.
Jesus entered the temple courts, and while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and said, "By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered, "I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
Where did John's baptism come from? Was it from heaven, or of men? They reasoned among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'"
But what if we say, "of men"? We are afraid of people. Everyone thinks John was a prophet.
They answered him, "We do not know." And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."
What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, "Son, go and work today in the vineyard."
"I'm not going," the son replied. But he changed his mind later and went.
Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing to him. He answered and said, "I will, sir." But he did not go.
"Which of the two sons did what his father wanted?" They answered, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John came to show you the way of life, and you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and prostitutes believed him. You have seen this, yet you still do not repent of your sins and believe in him. The story of the tenants.
Hear another parable. A man had a piece of land, so he planted a vineyard in it. He surrounded it with a fence, dug a winepress in it, and built a watchtower. Then he leased the farm to some farmers and went on a journey.
And when the time of harvest came, he sent his servants to the tenants. He said to the servants, "Gather my share of the fruit."
But the tenants seized his servants. They beat one of them. And they killed another. And they stoned the third to death.
Then the man sent other slaves to the farmers. This time he sent more than the first time. And the farmers treated them the same way.
Finally, he sent his son to them. He said, "They will respect my son."
But the tenants saw the son coming. They said to each other, "This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours."
So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
When the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do to those vinedressers?
"Those evil people will be destroyed," they answered. "Then he will rent the vineyard to other tenants who will give him his share of the fruit when it is due."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a nation bearing its fruits.
Anyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces. But the stone will crush whoever falls on it.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables. They realized that he was speaking about them.
So they sought a way to seize him, but they feared the multitudes, because they regarded Jesus as a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Story
And Jesus told them another parable, saying:
Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,
He sent his servants to the dinner guests. The servants told them to come, but they refused.
Then he sent some of his servants, saying, "Tell those who are invited, 'My banquet is ready, my oxen and fattened cattle are killed, and everything is prepared. Come to the wedding.'"
But the people paid no attention. One went to his field, and another to his business.
The rest of the people kept their servants. They treated them badly, then killed them.
The king was furious. He sent his army to wipe them out. They killed the assassins and burned their city to the ground.
Then the king said to the servants, "The wedding feast is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come."
Go to the street corners. Invite everyone you find to dinner.
So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.
King entered to see the guests. He noticed a man who was not wearing wedding clothes.
My friend asked, "How did you get in here without your wedding dress?" The man couldn't say anything.
Then the king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet. Cast him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
"Many are called, but few are chosen." Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees went out and began to plot how they might entrap Jesus in His words.
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. They said, "Teacher, we know that you are a truthful man and teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You do not care about anyone's opinion, because you are not swayed by people's status.
So tell us, what do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
But Jesus perceived their wickedness and said, "Hypocrites, why are you testing me?"
Show me the currency that people use to pay taxes. They brought him a silver coin.
He asked them, "Whose picture is this? And whose words are these?"
They said, "To Caesar." He said to them, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
Upon hearing this, they were astonished and went on their way. The dead shall marry when the dead arise.
On the same day, the Pharisees came to Jesus with a question, because they did not believe in the resurrection of the dead.
They said, "Teacher, Moses wrote for us, 'If a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, his brother should marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.'"
There were seven brothers among us. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened with the second and third brothers. It continued this way until the seventh.
Finally, the woman died.
"Now when the dead rise, whose wife will she be? For all seven had married her."
Jesus answered them, "You are mistaken, because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God."
If the dead rise from their graves, they will not marry. Nor will their fathers give them in marriage. They will be like the angels in heaven.
What about the dead who rise from their graves? Have you not read what God has told you?
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob" (Exodus 3:6). Not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
The people were amazed at his teaching. They asked, "Which commandment is the most important?"
When the Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus, they gathered together.
And among them was a lawyer, who asked Jesus a question to test him.
The teacher asked him, "What is the most important commandment in the law?"
Jesus answered, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind" (Deuteronomy 6:5).
This is the first and most important commandment.
The second is like it: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"All things written in the Law and the Prophets depend on these two commandments." "Who is the Son of Christ?"
The Pharisees gathered together. Jesus asked them,
What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he? They said to him, "The son of David."
He said to them, "Then why does David call him 'Lord'? For David himself says in the book of Psalms..."
My Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool. (Psalm 110: 1)
So if David calls him Lord, how can he be his son?
No one could answer him with a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him any questions.
Jesus condemns the Pharisees and the scribes
Jesus speaks to the crowds and to the disciples.
He said, "The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat."
So you must obey them. Do everything they ask you to do. But don't do what they do. They don't practice what they preach.
They tie heavy loads and place them on people's shoulders. But they don't lift a finger to help remove them.
All that they do is to be seen by others. On their foreheads and arms they place small boxes bearing verses from the Bible. They make the boxes very wide. And they make the coat strings very long.
They love to sit in the place of honor at feasts, and they love to be at the head of the assembly.
They love to be greeted with "As-salamu alaykum" in the town's markets. And they are pleased when people call them "Rabi."
But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers.
Do not call anyone on earth your father; for you have one Father, who is in heaven.
I don't have anyone I call "Lord". You have one Lord, and that's Christ.
The most important person among you will be your servant.
He who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces; for you neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter to go in.

Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You traverse sea and land to make a single proselyte, and when he becomes a disciple, you make him twice as much a child of hell as you are. You blind guides, who strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!
How blind are you, O blind guides! For you say, Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is obligated by his oath!
You are blind and foolish! What is more important, gold or the structure that sanctifies the gold?
You have also heard that it was said, ‘Swear an oath by the altar, and your oath is binding. But I say to you, swear not at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God, or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.’
O ye blind ones! What is more important? Is it the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
For everyone who swears by Jerusalem swears by Jerusalem and everything in it.
And everyone who swears by the temple swears by the temple and by the God who dwells in it.
And whoever swears by the sky, swears by the throne of Allah and what is upon it.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin—but you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former."
You are the leaders of the misguided! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside they are full of extortion and wickedness. You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the plate, so that the outside of them may also be clean.
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the plate, so the outside may also be clean.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness. Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
The same for you. From the outside, you seem like you're doing the right thing. But inside, you're full of wrong. You pretend you're not.
Woe to you, blind guides, who strain out a gnat but swallow a camel! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of extortion and self-indulgence.
And you said, "If we had been with those who came before us, we would not have followed their ways, nor would we have associated anything with God in worship, nor would we have taken the gods and idols as lords."

"You will pay for every drop of righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar."
I'm not really in a position to talk about it, and it's going to affect everyone who's alive now.
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you to bring the message. How often have I wanted to gather you, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!
Indeed, your home is desolate, with its roofs fallen in.
"I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!' (Psalm 118:26)"
Signs of the End Times
Jesus left the temple and while he was walking, his disciples came up to him and pointed out the temple buildings.
Do you see all these things? I tell you the truth, not one stone will be left standing on another, but everything will be thrown down.
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, and when the disciples were alone with him, they said, "Tell us, when will this happen? And what will be the sign of your coming and the end of the age?"
Jesus answered, "Watch out, lest you be led astray!"
Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ!' and they will deceive many.
You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. People will also talk about future wars. Do not be terrified, for these things must happen, but the end is not yet.
Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in many places.
All these are the beginning of labor pains.
Then people will hand you over to be persecuted, and they will kill you. You will be hated by all nations because of my name.
At that time, many will turn away from the faith, they will hate each other, and they will hand each other over to be killed.
Many false prophets will arise. And they will deceive many people.
But evil will grow worse and the love of many will grow cold.
But he who endures to the end will be saved.
"This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached throughout the whole world, for a witness to all nations. And then shall the end come."
The prophet Daniel spoke of "the abomination that causes desolation" (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11). One day you will see it standing in the holy place. Let the reader understand.
Let the people of Judah flee to the mountains.
No one on the roof should go down to their house to get anything.
No one in the field should go back to take his jacket.
Woe to the guided ones in those days! Woe to the nursing mothers!
"Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets before you. But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's own people, that you may declare the wonderful deeds of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light."
There will be terrible suffering in those days. It will be worse than at any time since the beginning of the world until now. And there will never be anything like it again.
If time were not cut short, no one would be saved. But for the sake of the elect, time will be cut short.
At that time, someone will say, 'Look, the Christ is here or there!' Do not believe it.
False Christs and prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect.
See, I told you before.
If they tell you he is in the desert, do not go there. If they tell you he is in the house, do not believe it.
A lightning flash that can descend from the east and be seen in the west. So will it be in the time of the appearance of the Son of Man.
Vultures will gather wherever there is a corpse.
Immediately after the terrible distress of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light. The stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken. (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory.
He will send His angels with a loud trumpet call. They will gather His elect from the four corners of the earth. They will bring them from the ends of the heavens to the ends of them.
Learn a lesson from the date palm: as soon as its branch softens and its leaves sprout, you know that summer is near.
Similarly, when you see all these things happening, you know that the end is near. It's about to happen.
"Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.
The heaven and the earth will pass away, and only His Face will remain. As for the Day and the Hour, no one knows them except Allah.
No one knows the day or the hour. Not even the angels in heaven know. The Son himself does not know. Only the Father knows.
Remember the days of Noah. So will the coming of the Son of Man be.
In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving their daughters in marriage. They were living their lives as usual until the day Noah entered the ark.
They knew nothing about what was going to happen until the flood came and took them all. So will it be also in the day when the Son of Man is revealed.
Two men will be in the field, one will be taken and the other left.
Two grind with a hand mill. One is taken and the other is left.
"So rely upon Him in struggle, and do not know what your Lord will bring forth."
You must understand something: if the homeowner knew when the thief was coming at night, he would make sure to stay awake and not allow his home to be broken into.
Therefore you also must be ready, because at an hour you do not expect, the Son of Man will come.
Suppose a master made one of his slaves responsible for the other slaves in his house. The task of this slave is to feed them at the proper time. The master wants someone trustworthy and wise for this position.
The servant will do well if his master finds him working when he returns.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. The master will put that servant in charge of all that he owns.
But let's assume that the servant is evil. Let's assume he says to himself, "My master is late in returning."
Suppose he started beating other servants. And suppose he eats and drinks with those who drink a lot.
The master of that servant will return one day when the servant does not expect him. He will come at a time the servant does not know.
Then his master will cut him to pieces and send him to the place where the hypocrites go. There people will weep and gnash their teeth in anger.
A Story of Ten Girls About to Get Married
This is how the kingdom of heaven will be at that time. The ten virgins went out, taking their lamps to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were fools, and five others were wise.
The fools took their ladders but forgot to bring olive oil.
The wise men carried the oil in jars with their lamps.
The groom hasn't arrived for a long time. All the bridesmaids got bored and fell asleep.
The clock struck midnight, and someone shouted, "The groom is coming! Go out to meet him!"
Then all the virgins woke up and each one prepared her lamp.
The fools said to the wise: "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are about to go out."
"They said to him, 'See, we won't be enough for everyone.' He replied, 'Give me the oil press and I'll buy it from you for the lamp.'"
So they went to buy oil. But the bridegroom arrived on the way. And the ready bridesmaids entered with him to the wedding dinner. Then the door was closed.
Then the other bridesmaids also came. They said, "Sir! Sir! Open the door for us!"
But he answered: "What I am about to say is true. I do not know you."
"Therefore be alert, for you do not know the hour when the master of the house will come, whether in the evening, or at midnight, or at cockcrow, or in the morning. It is like ten virgins."
And thus does your Lord gather the good word like a good tree, whose root is firm and whose branches reach to the sky, yielding its fruit in every seas
He gave ten thousand dollars to one. He gave four thousand to another. And he granted two thousand to the third. The man gave each servant the amount he knew the servant could take care of. Then he set out on his journey.
The servant who received the $10,000 immediately went and invested his money. He made another $10,000.
He who won $4,000 gained another $4,000.
But the man who had received the two thousand dinars went off, dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master's money in it.
After a long time, the master of those servants returned. He wanted to collect all the money they had earned.
The man who received $10,000 brought the other $10,000. He said, "Sir, you trusted me by giving me $10,000. Look, I made another $10,000 from it."
His master said, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!"
The man who had four thousand dollars also came and said, "Teacher, you entrusted me with four thousand dollars. See, I have made four thousand more."
His master said, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!"
Then came he that had received the two thousand talents, and said, "Lord, I know that thou art a hard man: thou reapest where thou hast not sown, and gatherest where thou hast not strawed."
So I was afraid and hid your money in the ground. Here is your money.
His master answered, 'You wicked, lazy servant! Did you know that I harvest where I did not sow and gather where I did not scatter seed?
And so, you should have deposited my money in the bank. Upon my return, I would have retrieved it with interest.
Then his master said to the other servants, "Take the two hundred from him, and give it to the one who has ten thousand."
To those who have, more will be given, and they will have an abundance. But from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away.
Cast that worthless slave into the outer darkness. There, people will weep and gnash their teeth. The sheep and the goats
"The Son of Man will come in his glory with all the holy angels, and then he will sit on his glorious throne in heaven."
All the nations will be gathered before him. He will separate the people into two groups, like a shepherd who separates the sheep from the goats.
He will put the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right, "Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world."
I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me.
I was in need of clothes and you gave them to me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to see me.
Then the righteous will answer, "Lord, when we saw you hungry, we fed you, and when you were thirsty, we gave you drink."
When did we see you a stranger and welcome you? And when did we see you in need of clothes and clothe you?
When did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?
The King will say, "Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me."
Then He will say to those on His right, "You have the blessing from your Lord, and [His] mercy. Have [all] good [deeds] been reserved except for you?" Then He will say,
I was hungry, but you gave me nothing to eat. I was thirsty, but you gave me nothing to drink.
I was a stranger, you did not invite me in. I was naked, you did not give me clothes. I was sick and in prison, you did not visit me.
They also will answer and say, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to You?'
He will answer, "Believe it or not, whatever you did not do for one of these little ones, you did not do for me."
Then they will go to everlasting punishment, but those who have done good will go to eternal life.
Plan to kill Jesus
Jesus finished saying all these things to his disciples.
As you know, Easter is in two days. And the Son of Man is handed over to be crucified.
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, Caiaphas.
They plotted to arrest Jesus by stealth. They wanted to kill him.
But not during the feast, they said. "For the people may make trouble." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in the house of Simon the leper in Bethany.
A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, poured it on his head as he was reclining at the table.
When the disciples saw this, they were indignant. "Why waste this perfume?" they asked.
The perfume could have been sold at a high price. The money could have been given to the poor.
Jesus knew this. He said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a good deed to me."
The poor you will always have with you, but me you will not always have.
She poured perfume over my body to prepare me for burial.
I am not about to update it with something truly correct. What she did will be told everywhere this good news is preached around the world. It will be told for remembrance.
One of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests.
He said, "What will you give me, and I will deliver Jesus to you?" And they paid him thirty pieces of silver.
From that time on, Judas watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them. The Last Supper
That first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"
He said to him, "Go into the city, and a certain man will meet you. Tell him, 'The Teacher says, 'My time is near. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.'"
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover.
When it was evening, Jesus was at the table with the twelve disciples.
While they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."
The disciples were very sorrowful, and each one began to say to him one after another: "It is not I, Lord, I tell you the truth."
Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me."
The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. Woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.
It was Judas who was about to betray him. He asked, "Surely not I, Lord?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is you."
While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take, eat; this is my body."
Then he took the cup, gave thanks, and offered it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you."
This is the blood of the new covenant. It is poured out for the forgiveness of many.
This is what I'm telling you. From now on, I won't drink wine with you again until the day I drink it with you in my father's kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said to Peter, "You will deny me three times."
Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away tonight, for it is written: 'Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)
But I will go before you into Galilee, after I am risen from the dead.
Peter said, "Everyone else might leave because of you. But I never will."
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, today, even this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times."
But Peter said, "I would rather die with you. I will never deny you." And all the disciples said the same. Jesus' prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane.
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there to pray."
And he chose Peter and the sons of Zebedee, and took them with him. And he began to be sorrowful and very distressed.
Then he said to them, "My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me."
He went a little farther. Then, falling on his face, he prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter, "Could you not watch with me for one hour?"
And know that your wealth and your children are but a trial, and that it is Allah with whom lies a mighty reward. [And remember] when you say something, there is always an observer ready to record it. And worship Allah.
Jesus went away a second time and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned and found them sleeping again. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
So he left them and went away again. And a third time he asked the same question.
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners."
"Rise! Let us go! Behold, he who betrays me has come!" Jesus is arrested.
And while he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came up, accompanied by a great crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Judas, who was to betray Jesus, agreed to a sign with them. He said, "The one I kiss is the man; seize him."
When Jesus said this, Judas, who was betraying him, stood there with the crowd. He said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Do what you have come for." Then the soldiers stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' companions drew his sword and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
Jesus said to him, "Put your sword away; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you think I can't ask my father for help? He'll immediately send an army of over seventy thousand kings.
But how can the sacred books be fulfilled? They say that it must happen this way.
At that time Jesus said to the crowd, "Am I leading a band of rebels that you have come out to capture me with swords and clubs? Every day I was with you in the temple courts, teaching, and you did not arrest me."
And this was all done to fulfill what had been spoken by the prophets of God. Then all the disciples left him and fled. But Jesus went with them to the synagogue.
And those who had seized Jesus led him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had assembled.
In a place not far away, Peter followed Jesus. He went as far as the courtyard of the high priest's house, where he went in and sat down with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.
But they found no evidence, despite many false witnesses coming forward. Finally, two other witnesses arrived.
They said, "This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God, and I can rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Do you not answer? What is it that these men testify against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us: Are you the Messiah, the Son of God?"
Yes. It is as you say, Jesus answered. "But I tell you all: In the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One, coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? You have heard the blasphemy.
"What do you think?" they answered, "He must die!"
Then they spat in his face. They struck him with their fists. Others slapped him.
They said, "Tell us, Christ, who struck you?" Peter said, "I do not know Jesus!"
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A servant girl came up and said to him, "You also were with Jesus the Nazarene."
But Peter said that wasn't the case for all of them. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.
Then he went out to the gate leading to the courtyard, and another woman saw him and said to the crowd, "This one was with Jesus of Nazareth too."
And he swore, saying, "I do not know the man!"
And after a little while those who stood by came and said to him, "You must be one of them, for you are a Galilean, like them."
Then Peter began to curse and swear, "I do not know the man!" And immediately a rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered the words Jesus had said to him: "Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.
Judas hangs himself.
It was early in the morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to kill Jesus.
They bound his hands and feet and led him away. Then they handed him over to Pilate, the Roman governor.
Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned to death, and filled with remorse and shame for what he had done, he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
I said, "I made a mistake. I shook the hand of an innocent man." They said, "And what does that matter to us? That's your problem."
So Judas threw the silver into the temple and went away. Then he went and hanged himself.
The chief priests said, "It is not lawful to put this money into the treasury, for it is blood money, money received for the life of a man." So they took the money.
So they decided to use the money to buy a field to bury foreigners.
That is why it is still called "Field of Blood" to this day.
Then were fulfilled the words of Jeremiah the prophet, saying: "They gave thirty pieces of silver for him, the price of him that was valued by the children of Israel."
"They paid the money to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me." (Zechariah 11:12,13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) The presentation of Jesus to Pilate
Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "You have said so."
And when he came to them with the proofs of his authority, the chief priests, the rulers, and the elders did not answer him.
Then Pilate asked Jesus, "Do you not hear what these are testifying against you?"
But Jesus made no answer, not even to a single charge. The governor was greatly amazed.
It was the governor's custom at Easter to release one prisoner. The people chose that prisoner.
And in that prison there was a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.
So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Whom do you want me to release for you? Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Messiah?"
Pilate knew that the chief priests had handed Jesus over out of envy.
And while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message, saying, "Have nothing to do with that man, for he is innocent. Today I suffered much in a dream because of him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus put to death.
Which one do you want me to release? asked the governor. They answered, "Barabbas."
Then Pilate said to them, "What shall I do with Jesus who is called the Christ?" They all said, "Crucify Him!"
"Why? What evil has he done?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
Jesus, and when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood; see to it yourselves."
All the people said, "We and our children will bear the guilt of his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas. But he had Jesus scourged and handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mock Jesus.
Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor's headquarters, which is called the Praetorium. And the whole company of them gathered around Him, and they put on Him a purple robe.
They stripped him and dressed him in a purple cloak.
Then they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and handed him a reed as a scepter. Kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!"
They spat on him. They hit him on the head with a stick repeatedly.
And after they had mocked him, they took off his robe and put his clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him. Jesus is crucified on the cross.
And as they led him out of the city, they found a man of Cyrene named Simon, and they compelled him to carry his cross.
They came to a place called Golgotha, which means the place of the skull.
They mixed wine with bitter spices and offered it to Jesus to drink. But when he tasted it, he refused to drink it.
And when they crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots.
They sat there and watched him.
They posted above his head the charge against him, written in large letters: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
ترجمَة النص إلى العربية المغربيَّة: صُلِبَ مَعاه لَصَّان. وَاحِدْ عَن يَمِينِهْ وَالآخَرْ عَن يَسَارِهْ.
And those who passed by him derided him, wagging their heads and making faces at him.
He said, "If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross, save yourself, and rebuild the temple in three days!"
Likewise, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders mocked him.
They said, "He has saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
"He trusts in God. May God deliver him now, if he is truly God's son."
Likewise, the two criminals who were crucified with Jesus also mocked him. Jesus died.
From noon on that day until three in the afternoon, darkness came over the whole land.
Around the ninth hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" that is, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of those who stood there, when they heard Jesus cry out, said, "He is calling Elijah."
And immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, put it on a reed, and gave it to Jesus to drink.
The rest said, "Let him be, so we can see if Elijah will come to save him."
And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.
And at that moment, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, and the rocks were split.
The tombs are opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep are raised.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus had risen from the dead, they went into the holy city. There they appeared to many people.
The Roman commander and the guards saw the earthquake and all that had happened, and they were terrified. They cried out, "Surely this was the Son of God!"
A large crowd of women was also there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee and had provided for him.
Mary Magdalene was there. And Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee, were also present. They buried Jesus.
As evening approached, a rich man from the town of Arimathea arrived. His name was Joseph, and he was a follower of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. So Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Joseph wrapped the body in a clean linen cloth.
He placed her in his new tomb that he had hewn out of the rock. Then he rolled a large stone against the entrance. Afterward, he departed.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The guards were at the tomb.
The next day, which was the day after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
They said, "Master, we remember what that deceiver said while he was still alive: 'After three days I will rise again.'"
So he gave orders to secure the tomb until the third day, lest his disciples go and steal him away, and tell the people, 'He has risen from the dead,' and the last deception will be worse than the first."
"Take a few guards with you," said Pilate. "Go and do what is necessary to secure the tomb as best as you can."
So they both went hastening to her grave, and they were mourning over her, and they were (all) weeping.
Jesus rises from the dead.
The Sabbath was over, and dawn was breaking on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to the tomb.
There was a strong earthquake. An angel came down from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled away the stone and sat on it.
His body shone like lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so terrified of him that they trembled and became like the dead.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified."
"It is not here! He has risen just as he said! Come and see the place where he was lying."
Go quickly and tell his disciples: 'He has risen from the dead! He is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' Behold, I have told you!
So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples.
Suddenly Jesus met them and said, "Greetings!" They came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me." So the guards went and told the chief priests everything that had happened.
And as they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and told the chief priests all the things that were done.
When the chief priests met with the elders, they devised a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
They told the soldiers, "We want you to say: His disciples came at night and stole his body while we were sleeping."
If the governor hears this report, we'll satisfy him financially. This will keep you out of trouble.
The soldiers obeyed their orders and took the money, and the Jews continue to tell this story to this day. Jesus' final commands to his disciples.
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
And when they saw him, they prostrated to him, but some of them doubted.
Then Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you, and know that I am with you always, to the end of the age.
He who prepares the way is called John the Baptist.
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Long ago, the prophet Isaiah wrote: "Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before you" (Malachi 3:1).
A voice proclaims: "In the wilderness prepare the way for the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God." (Isaiah 40:3)
And so John came, baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
All the people of Judea and Jerusalem went out to him. They confessed their sins, and John baptized them in the Jordan River.
And John wore a garment of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
This is what John the Baptist proclaimed: "After me comes one more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie."
I baptize you with water, but he who comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.
At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
And as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.
And a voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."
And immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.
He was in the wilderness forty days, and was tempted by Satan. Wild beasts did not harm him. Angels took care of him. Jesus chose the first disciples.
And after John was imprisoned, Jesus went to Galilee, preaching the gospel of God.
He said, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel!"
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting their net into the sea. They were fishermen.
Come and follow me, said Jesus. "I will make you fishers of men."
So they left the fish and followed him immediately.
Then Jesus walked a little further and saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in the boat mending the nets.
And afterward he called them immediately. And they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him. The casting out of the unclean spirit by Jesus.
And Jesus and those with Him went to Capernaum. And He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath and began to teach.
People were amazed by his teaching; he instructed them with absolute authority, not like the religious scholars.
And at that moment a man in the assembly who was possessed by an unclean spirit shouted out, "What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!"
What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!
"Be silent!" Jesus said sternly. "Come out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Then it came out of him with a scream.
And everyone was amazed, and they were saying to one another, "What is this? A new teaching with authority! Even the unclean spirits obey him."
The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus left the synagogue and was followed by a large crowd. They came to the house of Simon and Andrew, and James and John were with him.
Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed, feverish. They told Jesus about her.
So he went to her, took her by the hand, and raised her up. The fever left her, and she got up and began to serve them.
That evening, after sunset, all the sick and those possessed by demons were brought to Jesus.
All the people in the city gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many who were sick with various diseases. He also cast out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was. Jesus prayed in a solitary place.
It was still very early in the morning, and darkness hung in the sky. Jesus got up, left the house, and went to a place where he could be alone. There, he prayed.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they cried out, "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus answered, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages—so that I can preach there also. That is why I have come."
So he went about among the villages teaching. He called the twelve to him, and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits. And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were sick and healed them.
A man with leprosy came to Jesus, pleading on his knees: "If you choose, you can make me clean."
Jesus was moved with compassion. He reached out his hand and touched the man, saying, "I want to do this. Be clean!"
So he was immediately healed of his disease.
Jesus rebuked him sharply and sent him away.
He said, "Do not say this to anyone." Then he said, "Go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded. This will be a proof to the priest and the people that you are clean."
But the man went out and began to proclaim it freely, and to spread the news so widely that Jesus could no longer enter a town openly. He remained outside in secluded places, but people from all quarters were coming to him.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk.
A few days later, Jesus again entered Capernaum, and the people heard that he was in the house.
A large crowd gathered around him, so that there was no longer any room. Even outside the door there was a large crowd. And Jesus was preaching the word of God to them.
Four men came carrying a man who couldn't walk.
But they could not get near him because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after removing some tiles, they lowered the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying.
Jesus saw their faith. So he said to the man, "My child, your sins are forgiven."
Some of the scribes were sitting there, thinking.
Why is this man speaking like this? He's saying something very evil! Only God forgives sins.
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?"
Is it easier for you to say "Your sins are forgiven" or to say "Get up, take your mat and walk"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus said to the paralytic,
He said to them, "Get up, take your mat and go home."
And he arose and chose for himself a procession, and went on his way while they watched. And the multitudes were amazed beyond measure. And they praised God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!" And Jesus followed him to baptize Jesus the son of Heli.
And again Jesus went away to the seashore of Galilee, where a large crowd gathered around him, and he taught them.
And as he walked, he met Louhi the son of Halphai. Louhi was sitting at the tax collector's post. Jesus said to him, "Follow me." And he rose and followed him.
Then Jesus was reclining in Levi's house, and there were with him his disciples and a large multitude of tax collectors and sinners, eating with him. For there were many who followed Jesus.
There were some Pharisees and scribes sitting there. When they saw Jesus eating with tax collectors and sinners, they said to his disciples, "How can he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said to them, *"Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick; I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."*
The disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came to Jesus and said to him, "John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but yours eat."
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them;
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them. On that day they will fast.
People do not put a new patch on an old garment, or else the new will tear from the old, and the tear will be worse.
People do not pour new wine into old wineskins. For the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine will be spilled, and the wineskins will be ruined. But they pour new wine into new wineskins." Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On the Sabbath, Jesus was walking through the fields with his disciples. As they went along, the disciples began to pick and eat the heads of wheat.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! It is not lawful to do this on the Sabbath. Why do your disciples do it?"
He answered them, "Have you never read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with
That was in the days of Abiathar the high priest. David went into the house of God, and ate the shewbread, which was lawful to eat only for the priests, and gave also to his men.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
Therefore the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.
Healing on Saturday
Again Jesus entered the synagogue, and there was a man there with a withered hand.
Some of the Pharisees sought a reason to condemn Jesus. They watched him closely. How would he heal the sick on the Sabbath?
Jesus said to the man who had a withered and weakened right hand, "Rise up and stand before everyone."
Then Jesus asked them, "What does the law say? What do you do on the Sabbath? Is it right to do good or to do evil? Is it right to save a life or to destroy it?" But no one answered him.
Jesus gave them a stern look and was deeply distressed at their hard hearts. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians against Jesus, how to destroy Him. And the multitudes followed Him.
Jesus went with his disciples to the Sea of Galilee, and a large crowd from Galilee followed him.
When the people heard all that Jesus was doing, many came to him. They came from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and around Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowd, Jesus asked his disciples to prepare a small boat for him. This was to keep the crowd away from him.
Jesus healed many people, so the sick were pushing to touch him.
And when the people who were possessed with evil spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone about him, saying, "So that no one will say that he is the Messiah." Then Jesus chose the twelve apostles and gave them the name "apostles," who were also sent out.
Jesus went up a mountain and called to certain people, and they came to him.
He appointed twelve of them and called them apostles, and they remained with him. He also sent them out to preach.
They have authority to cast out demons.
So Jesus chose twelve disciples. Simon was one of them, and he gave him the name Peter.
There were Jacob, son of Zebedee, and his brother John. Jesus gave them the name Boanerges, which means "sons of thunder."
And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus. Also, Thaddaeus and Simon the Zealot.
Judas Iscariot was also among them. He was the one who would later betray Jesus to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebub.
Jesus entered a house. And again the crowd gathered, so that they could not even eat.
His family heard about it. They came to get him. They said, "He has gone mad."
Some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul, and by the ruler of the demons he casts out demons."
So Jesus called his disciples and said to them, "How can Satan drive out Satan?"
If the kingdom fights itself, it will not stand.
If the family is divided, it will not stand.
