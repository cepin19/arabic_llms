"Therefore, let Yusuf not despair over the loss of your journey. We are all striving for it!"
And also, I'm not intruding. I have a right to take, and indeed you have a right to take before me.

"Salih, don't be foolish... God forgive me!"
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Is there a brother who advises his brother with what you say?

And you found a great feast.
The holiday doesn't belong to anyone.
Say that to yourself.
This holiday won't come around again.
Don't be a stranger, Saleh!
And deprive us of the opportunity.
No, no, no, no, don't try to convince me, it's impossible, impossible, I won't do it.
The problem is that he is afraid.
Afraid of what?
This is a government project! Everyone is working on it.
That's the rule!
Even people who don't participate benefit from it.
He is the head of a huge project.
This means he's in control of things.
Third International Millennium for Beaches, specifically the first phase of infrastructure.
How stupid this man is!
Here we can loot and pillage!
If he refuses to take it.
Who gave you the right?
You don't have the right to benefit from that.
When his car broke down
Who used to drive him to the project site? Wasn't it me?
No, if that's the case, you have the right.
Who gives you money to wash your car four and five times!
Leave it to me.
Don't be foolish and turn a deaf ear.
Make use of some time.
Look at your uncle Khamees.
And now, as you say, they call him the millionaire.
A third of the project.
And the other third is currency.
The musician in a folk band.
They say there were national celebrations.
And he bought a hundred lanterns.
Learn what they did.
He added a zero.
No use, auntie!
No, God will guide him if He wills.
Let's eat with him.
I spent last night trying to convince him.
It is an opportunity.
For the triumph of good.
And with God's will, good will triumph.
This is usual.
Just between us.
Don't tell anyone about it.
Do we have to worry?
But my friends
Neck pain
The man began to change his mind.
I spoke to him today.
Two hours in the morning.
He began to be convinced.
We'll meet him in a moment.
And we have to convince him.
It cuts off the benefit from us.
They were truthful when they told him at the meeting to change his opinion.
Brother Ali, Brother Uthman.
I don't know.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. My first day at work.
Make me work
How can you not come!
"But certainly. But am I sure I'll get some of it?"
I want to ask you
If you are hungry and walking in the street
Will you eat or not?
I am a person who eats a lot.
Don't worry.
The plate is large.
We are currently working on the first article for the meeting.
If you're not well,
If you have any concerns
What do I really want to know?
It is permissible
O Salih, Allah guides you.
This is logical because you are a boss for the first time in your life.
It's very simple.
We will join our share.
In the project budget?!
What do you think?
No one doubts our affair.
Let's put our share as a separate article!
This amount of money was looted.
By the people in charge of the project.
Cannot
No, no, no! Oh! Alright!
You know how these things happen.
But it seems you have some concerns.
This is their right.
First and foremost,
Everything is in our hands.
I told you he was lying.
What's wrong with you?
He says the new car belongs to his friend, and you believe him.
He said that!
Let's assume it's his friend's car.
In a very special place, too!
Except for a very rich man.
I have not heard this from people.
He told me that he bought the land and registered it in his name.
"Please say" o
He has the money now.
Now he will start lying.
Aren't we his family?
Is that all?
We're not going to get anything?
We won't get anything in the end!
He wants to eat it alone, bit by bit.
Don't shake your head!
Your brother too
Sit down, and everything will be alright.
I talked to him all night long.
I told him, "No matter what, they are your relatives."
Finally, he agreed.
This is how things should be.
O Lord, make it easy for us and not difficult, and guide us to honor. Our Lord, grant us the visitation of his noble grave, honored time and again.
These are the beaches of the third millennium.
البنية التحتية، على وجه التحديد.
After that, they will begin the second phase.
And it will continue with him.
May God reward you with good.
It's good that you pressured him to agree.
You're no different from them.
But, it doesn't matter.
I hope you made it clear to him.
We want a percentage.
They all take a cut.
He said even after I convinced him.
Their friends want to attend the meeting to set the project budget.
They have to follow through, it's their money.
We placed it with confidence.
Submit it as soon as possible for approval.
Take your time.
Who is this? Do you know him?
He is my wife's brother who shares with me.
Do you mean him?
Responsible for doors, windows, and all finishing touches.
Good, good
How much do you want to get this done?
How much will you earn?
Do we take the money?
Let's give ourselves a week to think.
The amount of money we'll get
I have people waiting and wanting some things.
Abdulaziz is right.
If someone decides to take half a million,
During this week, everyone will think carefully.
They specify the amount they want.
By next week, they will decide exactly what they want and determine the required amount.
It's none of your business.
Then, it's up to you?
Neglect it.
Hello friend, what happened? What's wrong with him?
I don't know what brought him here.
Hello! Who invited you to this project?
It's a government project.
Salih, is your brother's name Sultan?
This is our neighbor's driver.
He sometimes drives us when our car is broken down.
Write
Supported Abdallah
No, no, there are three other people.
What can I do next? I'm bored with this.
I told him, "Enough, man. Just propose the budget and be done with it."
No, no, that'll cost some money.
How much should I give him?
Does this poor man have children?
Yes, he has, let it be twenty-five thousand four hundred.
Four hundred
They increase it by force.
How much will you give them!
This is too much.
This is my mother, as we were just talking about her.
Yes, Mama.
Yes, no, no, no, this is the last one Oh! My son
No, my son, she wants to travel to Thailand for treatment.
Wait, wait, what's the matter?
Why are you angry?
فقط من المرحلة الأولى، البنية التحتية تحديداً.
Not used
Add three thousand.
Buy me some watches from Thailand with sparkling rhinestones.
Did you add it?
Yes, Mom.
No, Mom, I added her, I just wanted to make sure of the name.
My love, Mama
Let's expand the feast.
Yes, but the budget needs to be defined; it can't be open-ended like this.
Tomorrow is the final meeting and everyone should decide on the amount of money they want.
I can do that.
Is a million enough!
More than necessary, my dear.
Hey! Hey, guys, guys, wait, it's noisy in here, give us a chance.
The committee is in a meeting now to approve the project budget, and no financial topics are being discussed at this time, that's all.
I want more
We told you not to embarrass us, we are in the ministry's square.
Yana is wise, don't draw our attention.
If someone comes and asks what has happened to all of you here
We'll tell him that the electricity is out or shocking.
Do not make a noise in the ministry's courtyard.
Be quiet, be quiet
Sew it! Do you hear me?
What's the budget now that you've been with them?
Without counting my brother
Fully, 50 million percent
Fifty million for the first phase only.
What's the price now?
What, Saleh?
Sharing is caring, man!
At your leisure, Bon Appétit.
Quickly, let's get to work, all the beneficiaries are waiting for us.
No problem... The main thing is that we don't get into any discussions, let them agree on the budget and that's it.
Tomorrow we start implementing.
And it serves a very large segment of society.
<h1>God bless you, this is the International Millennium Beaches Project.</h1>
This is the first stage.
Infrastructure
For future generations
<h2>Certainly, on behalf of our program's team, we would like to welcome and congratulate you on the launch of the project, which will take place tomorrow, as far as I know.</h2>
It took us a year and a half.
One and a half years
And may God bless you, regarding future achievement programs,
This project
And the coming generations
May God keep the blessing of oil upon us.
Second, third, and tenth stages.
Actor
Welcome aboard the flight.
Why have they gathered us here? And when will the buses arrive to take us?
What? Where do they want to take us?
Praise be to God, you have become old and senile.
Let's sit down, the sun is hot.
Yes, a nice girl.
But I don't see anything.
Everything but the sea.
Why did they dismiss you?
Iman told me that my sister Manira is here.
Around my father's land in the wilderness.
I wondered who had lied to her and provided her with misleading information.
That is not the land.
You saw a farm in the wilderness and thought it was your father's.
In addition to that, why do you ask about these things?
You have brothers.
Those who work hard, invest in land, real estate, and businesses, and make an effort.
Far from headache.
I am disappointed in you, Aman.
And my sister too.
How don't you know?
They must give it to me.
They are your brothers.
And there is nothing better than the truth.
Because money is the reason.
Now we help her and drive her to the hospital.
I don't know how many years she spent fighting her brothers in court.
Nine years or ten... or more.
But
The brothers of Umm Salma are thieves.
"God is sufficient for me against her; she was telling me yesterday that"
She wants to build a mosque before she dies.
Do not teach.
I don't mean her brothers are like yours, God willing, they are not like them.
How many years have passed since my father died?
Why are you asking now?
And she saw the farm.
What else do you want?
Isn't the check paid to her every three months?
Falcon, calm down, let's understand the story first.
It's none of her business.
If it were someone else, his sisters wouldn't get even a single riyaL.
Upon her
From where
As if it's not my money.
Look what, Monira
Please take a look at it.
Becomes fifty thousand.
I searched for my father's land in the desert because I had the courage to ask.
I'm sure my share is more than that.
Everyone lives in a villa like this.
Their children are in the best schools.
What can I say... Oh, Manira
I will not stop fighting for my right.
I will get my rights.
It's better for us to invest your money in the company! Thank you, I don't want to.
Everyone fights each other.
People today have no mercy.
Don't think that your brothers will be better than my sons.
Look at me.
Twenty years.
I used to go to court a lot.
And in the end
I didn't understand anything from that.
Why do they do that?
Therefore, I say to you, my dear, deal with them gently.
Work with them with mercy.
And you will be weary of them.
And why do courts take so long?
We are four hundred thousand in total.
If we reach a million like other countries.
I really doubt that any orders will be issued, dear.
Look at my two brothers.
I swear I don't want all that.
What can I say, dear!
I have said all that can be said: "According to us, Allah is the best disposer of affairs."
There is no power or might except by Allah, the Most High, the Most Great.
Didn't you have a court session last week?
As usual, my dear.
The judge asked us to file a brief.
We've been through this many times before.
My love, they will invest millions, and you will just watch.
As I told you, you'll get tired of the courts.
And they will not take your right.
Therefore I say to you, if I were in your place
I'll make do with what they offer me.
Because the woman
We owe you nothing.
Men ask you!
She has some.
Some questions regarding her share only.
She just wants to know one thing and then leave.
If you don't find him.
I'll drag you and show you.
He will find his way.
I signed the waiver.
Two hundred and five, that's more than enough, her husband works.
Take it or leave it.
Why are you asking now?
But he is stingy.
As if it's not my right.
My father's estate, and he wants to decide how much I receive, take it or leave it.
It's not up to me or him to decide.
This is God's command.
Why are they tormenting my father in his grave?
I didn't expect that from them.
It's because of the money.
Opened thirty years ago.
I don't know what to do, Nasser.
Lands, buildings, and properties, easy to comprehend.
I don't know how much they get.
Even the company
It's your right to go and ask about everything.
And I will not leave them alone.
How will you get back to them?
It's none of your business.
And it's not up to you either, I have the right to know everything.
In
Your sister gave him power of attorney.
Who is empowered to inspect everything in the company.
Falcon, Saad
Shouts in our faces
Falcon, enough.
Brother of Nasser
Excuse me, I'll take it.
Yes, sir.
Go away from here now.
Excuse me, go away.
Don't give him a reason to attack us.
Now, if he goes and sues us,
He said that you hit him.
So shall we let him do as he pleases!
He has an official document.
Official! We cannot prevent it.
It is his legal right to examine everything.
If he examines the budget and the accounts.
We give her forty thousand every three months.
If he examines his budget
Multiply twelve by eight.
Part One In the name of God
Thirty-two
Learn how much is a lot.
This is what we owe her.
Except for lands and projects
We are free to do what we want.
We have nothing to fear, there's no reason to be afraid.
If he doesn't agree, this is what we have, and if he agrees, welcome.
Let them go and attend to their own affairs.
Her brothers give their sisters just enough money to live on.
She is married.
She has a husband she can rely on.
What do you want to do with the money?
This is how it was supposed to be from the start.
Yes, sir.
Just as he loves.
Even my office.
My brother Rashid, this was supposed to happen earlier.
As you wish, sir.
Volume after volume
When she learned her true heritage.
It turned out that she also owned several apartment buildings, villas, and lands of which she was unaware.
It turned out that there were seven of them.
They turned out to be sixteen.
You didn't teach.
She was poor and shocked.
Not fair
Don't leave them alone.
Please, my son! I don't want to hear the word courts.
The more anxious you are
Seldom is the judge
Half a minute
Then he will say his usual phrase,
To the seventh, the fourth, the thousands, I don't know how much it is.
They will rejoice greatly, my son.
You must never leave your bed, mother.
May God heal you.
No, no, please come.
Nasser and my sister Manar
After we slammed the door in his face and kicked him out of the company.
One of my classmates from school writes to me.
Abdullah is called.
And now
I won't allow him.
I mean, can he influence them?
Inshallah
Yes yes yes
Do not rely on fate.
Courts do nothing but reports.
Delays, procrastination, and useless lawyers
Years pass.
And the years pass by.
And you won't earn a single Riyal.
God have mercy on Umm Salman.
You advised me on the day before she died.
Never go to court.
He said that our courts
She died without taking any of her inheritance.
She passed away before the judge could rule on her case.
What if we were like other countries?
Hello Abdullah
My brother Abdullah
Years have passed.
This is my brother Saad.
You become more beautiful and radiant.
The most important thing
Brotherhood
My brother Rashid
You are a brother to me.
Don't let money come between us.
Do you have anything else to talk about besides my sister?
Sorry
Why should I ask him to stop talking?
It's true.
They don't even want me to get my inheritance from my father.
My mother told me yesterday that my brother Saad's wife
Her father is a messenger in the ministry.
It's all my father's money.
We waited for a very long time.
We'll try one last time.
I sent them to your friend, Abdullah.
They didn't respect him, they threw him out.
Let's see what Sheikh Abdul Rahman will do.
He is a very kind man.
He said yes, Nasser.
Don't worry.
They intimidate them with the law.
Did you forget what the poor woman, Umm Salamah, said about the courts?
Perhaps the brothers of Salmen's mother don't fear the courts.
Except my brothers
He may be afraid of backbiting.
They might be ashamed to go to court.
Let's wait and see what will happen after Sheikh Abdul Rahman's visit to them.
May God bless you.
Is this a Friday sermon?
If you don't have it, get out.
What are you saying, my son?
He spoke the truth.
Go away, leave.
Tomorrow morning, I will go to the court.
Why should I postpone until after tomorrow?
I decide, not you.
What will happen if you wait until the day after tomorrow?
Hello, brother Rashid
This is a promise.
I've told you before.
Let's deter them with the law.
Now he's begging me to postpone our court date.
Because they knew you were serious about it, my love.
It's important that we visit your sister Manira.
What is this?
She asked me what this is, this is it.
May God bless you all.
A small model of the Courthouse building.
May God bless you.
And all of you
May God bless you.
Haven't you said?
I told you not to go today.
It was postponed until after tomorrow.
To get that form, go to %pw this building %pw for the court.
Ready for you to show you the way.
Enter through that door, this door.
When you enter through the door,
You put all your things there.
Portable and any metal object so as not to make noises: beep beep beep beep beep
Register the case, you will be asked to go to the eighth floor. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Elevator, go up.
Wandered through the offices.
Look at the judge, if you really need a particular judge, for example.
And also these
He was eager to sue us.
We're here to show her the way.
We'll see when you'll get your due.
Either you take the six thousand.
As he said.
Goodbye
We will spend the day at my sister's house today.
Or has the ministry approved his project?
My sister told me that he was very happy, and I didn't believe it.
He said, "If they agree on the project, I'll invite you to dinner at my house."
Praise be to God, luck comes in pairs.
How happy you are, Abu Walid!
Luck is on his side.
My sister told me that he was so happy that he couldn't sleep last night.
Praise be to God, Manal.
Reassuring, not comprehensive in keeping up with work, but righteous men helped him.
Okay, tell your father.
I hope you enjoyed the food.
Thank you, Waleed.
Thank you, Waleed! God bless you.
**May God fill your life with wealth**
Very delicious food, Umm Waleed.
Hire an accountant and a secretary to organize your business.
They just told me to rent an office and they would take care of everything.
Go ahead, this is my uncle.
Oh my darling son
I want pomegranate seeds.
We want a bigger house.
Look, it seems to be better now.
Father, didn't we agree that you would give a speech after lunch?
And now, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to welcome the owner of the project, my father, Bou Waleed.
Sorry
Congratulations, Abu Waleed.
You deserved it.
But, frankly, you are not an expert in business and trade.
Ah! Man, there's a story behind this project.
I'll tell you how!
Praise be to God, %pw
Last year
When the Japanese team played against our national team.
Souq Waqif
I'm not aware of that right now.
This is a manufacturer's catalog for multi-purpose halls, which we are looking for in our ministry. Please submit a bid.
Any contractor can build it for you.
He doesn't understand.
Any contractor
The Japanese are wonderful.
When opened, the computer says
Cinema, if you want.
If you want a kitchen, click on the word "kitchen."
When I presented the catalog to the ministry committee
And what about your contract with the factory?
I paid some.
Deposited currency
Most importantly, your contract with the factory.
I signed it, praise be to God.
And give me some time until I place the first order.
What are you waiting for?
It's true that they agreed to it.
But we are still waiting for Abu Fahd's signature.
What did the secretary say?
He said that Bu Fahad didn't attend.
Would you like to drink some tea?
"Bou Walid, tell me, what did you do!"
As for Abu Fahd, he might come and he might not.
It will appear one day.
He doesn't have time.
Come.
You are the boss here.
Do you want to kill me?
No, he has to sign.
Look at all these files on my desk, they all need Abu Fahd's signature.
So what should I do?
May God help you.
A quarter to two, oh! Bou Walid
It's time to go home.
I don't think Bou Fahd will come.
Tomorrow, God willing, He will assist you.
I said that you've known the manager for a long time and he's your friend.
What's wrong with you?
He is a useless manager.
A very stupid manager, they don't do anything,
It is a shame for them to appear wise when they are not.
They don't do anything useful.
Do they do anything?! Never!
They don't move a chair without Abu Fahd's permission.
The manager didn't ask about you yesterday.
People's issues are pending.
It seems you're going to them today as well.
I'm in trouble.
I face problems every day.
The factory gave me limited time.
No, we hope not.
And if they ask about you
You are not the only one waiting for Abu Fahd.
Look at these files.
All of them require Bu Fahad's signature.
I think he will come today.
Please sit down.
Strolled
I'll talk to you when he comes.
If anything happens, I'll call. Don't scare them.
Goodbye
I'm sorry if I scared you, she's my wife.
Ah! They agreed to my appointment two months ago,
I just need him to sign... What is this?
Oh my son! It's registration period now, my daughter will lose her university scholarship, we must prepare her documents.
My problem with the factory, the deadline, the deadline.
Wait a moment.
All your transactions will be signed.
He's drinking his coffee; you can meet him after he finishes.
Please, all of you be quiet.
Yes, sir.
Goodbye
Wait, wait people!
Wait, where are you going? Wait.
Know what happened first.
What happened?
He has an urgent trip.
Special exit
I'm tired of this.
Our interests have stopped, brother.
We wait for you every day, Abu Fahd.
What can we do? We'll wait for Abu Fahd.
Peace be upon you, my father.
No blame.
Everything is deteriorating.
A factory in Japan.
Inform him that the deadline has passed.
And your aunt is another story.
For her mercy, the mercy of Ramadan.
Brings problems from all directions.
Mama, I'm very worried about Papa.
Don't leave him alone.
Who will you call on the phone?
Yes, who's with me?
Bu Waleed
Talking about the factory and your sister's marriage money.
Abu Fahd waited.
Father, how long must I wait for you?
They always say
We are waiting for Abu Fahd.
"O my father, indeed I have expended [all] effort."
Tomorrow all my friends will join the university.
What are you looking for?
The phone, my love.
Don't worry, just give me some time.
And who will you speak to?
Abu Fahd waited.
Sister, I don't know what to say.
You have been very patient with us.
May God help you.
Bu Waleed is in a miserable state.
And he shivers like a leaf in a cold gust of wind, due to the fever.
That's because the deadline is about to expire.
Five days remaining.
He will lose all his money.
For our war
What's better! He's pulling me, pulling me, pulling me.
I hope to recover, I feel like
I was struck by an unusual fever.
The top is shaking.
The other part is completely stationary.
Fifty percent of my body isn't working due to the fever.
It's a discount.
Don't worry.
Everything will be alright.
My sister helps.
You will wait until we return it to her.
God can reward her better.
We're not worried about your sister now.
The owner of the operations too, God help me.
It seems he heard.
Glorified is He who knows what is in the hearts.
He and Bu Fahd annoyed me.
He drags me, and it's a problem.
Tomorrow is the last day.
My wealth will vanish.
Don't drag us.
In the brain, in the brain
How will you be able to speak?
Give it to me, let's see who's calling.
Mr. Bou Bled
I'm calling you because I feel bad about you.
On standby.
Goodbye
You were a committed person throughout your life.
You were an example.
Don't think I'm unaware of you leaving work early every day.
I can deduct that from your salary.
What happened to your mobile phone?
Instead of deducting an amount from you
I'll put you on the stock committee.
You will go to the market with them today.
Never leave work during working hours.
If you do
So do not blame me.
Today is his last chance.
Don't you see him nervously holding his phone, waiting for a call from them?
I feared that he would be fired from his job.
This is my phone, oh! Bou Walid
The situation mourns him.
Let him go, damn him.
Ah! The smell of Walid.
Yes, hello.
What's wrong with you, Waleed! I'm talking to you, not the phone.
Go finish your paper.
Don't worry.
Many thanks
It seems that Bu Fahd is here.
What can I do for you?
He is a very important officer.
Where is he heading?
Let's go to Uzbekistan.
Brother, where is Uzbekistan?
It's the third office on your left.
You should not cough.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't sit.
Don't look at me.
Or do you want
House to house
Go ahead.
Oh people, this man is crazy!
Do you know how much I spent?
For years, you
Taking the papers and returning the papers.
My knees are relaxing now.
Going back and forth between all these ministries.
But we were young.
I carried the bags of rice on my back, just as children carry bags of potato chips.
After that, God willing, I learned to ride a bike.
Especially the bicycle that I learned to ride and bought.
Olive green
They always try to tempt me when I ride this bike, oh my God.
Our daily bread, and raising our children.
The manager arrived.
We should celebrate after it's over.
Praise be to God, praise be to God.
So, will you quit your job?
I testify that you are truly a good citizen.
Now I want to rest, brother, goodbye.
We are all yours.
Don't you want us to grant you an extension for a year?
Enough, enough
May God reward you with good.
You've already given me four years.
I was supposed to retire a long time ago.
All my children have jobs now.
The latest one yesterday was his first day at work.
Oh, Abdul Aziz,
I want rest.
And you are just a runner.
By Khanfoush
Do you believe that?
I haven't eaten khane frash in four years.
How delicious!
I can smell it now.
We will do whatever you want.
Transfer me to the Human Resources department.
Have you finished all the paperwork?
Yes, since yesterday.
Your transactions will be delayed.
I'm annoyed.
Finished
Get in touch with me.
My son, Khalid
From this moment on,
"Insha'Allah I'll rest, dear."
Great, great
I'm at work and I can't leave.
Can you stop by the Human Resources Department?
I have some papers there.
I want you to take them to the Civil Service Department.
Thank you, thank you, Father.
Where are you going?
I had to go to the bank.
And she calls to all of us.
Yes, now.
I had to go to the bank.
Send it with someone else.
No, sister, I can't get out of work.
Agreed, goodbye.
It seems he didn't agree, did he?
He said he couldn't quit his job.
What will you do?
I will go to the bank tomorrow morning.
He is accustomed to going to work every day.
I'm sure he'll get bored.
This is good for him.
Will you let him rest?
Enough for him, he is pleased that he will return from work early.
He called and said that Khalid...
I sent him to finish his paperwork.
Fear God.
Everyone should rely on themselves.
My mother regrets the hamster.
Mom won't spoil it.
I regret it so much, oh my daughter.
I've been saying this ever since he quit his job and left.
Khalid assigned the man tasks to complete.
He is sleeping in his room.
Those who are lost in their sea (are singing)
Good morning, Father.
Hello, my daughter.
O my father!
But they called me and said the manager was angry.
Show me your papers.
Yes, Saeed's mother.
I told you to let the children be independent, why don't you listen to me?
As if you hadn't resigned.
Oh, wretched state of mine!
I'm waiting for you, and the khanafrish is in front of me.
We will eat it today.
Goodbye
I forgot to tell you.
Sorry, my dear father.
May God help you.
Yes, that's the one next to the market.
Get out of here quickly.
I have left, my daughter, I have left.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
God willed it.
Praise be to God that you found a house.
Sit, sit, sit
I told you to stay home.
Teach your children self-reliance.
What can I do, O Mother of Saeed?
They are going through a tough time, and I have to help them.
Enough, enough, relax.
And I will bring you a cup of water.
And the mouse to eat it.
Poor him, he's very tired.
And of the bells,
He is naive.
He went to the market branch.
They want her ID card.
She didn't take her car until...
And she gave him the papers.
Better now, God willing.
Work independently.
I told you.
I want you to rest.
Take a chair and sit with us.
Lunch is very delicious.
I was moving from one ministry to another.
I run between one ministry and another.
Finishing my children's paperwork
You cared for them when they were small, and now you attend to them; you are spoiling them.
My children are in good positions at work.
They are busy all the time, what can I do?
Daily meetings are held with the manager, director, or minister.
They have good jobs, and when they're needed they have to be there, it's their job.
"Go and get your work done; others are holding you back and forcing you to sit all the time, what did you expect?"
I'm coming now. May God reward you kindly.
Coming soon, goodbye.
Excuse me now, hey! hey! Bou Shahin
They called me and said it's ready.
Tomorrow, when you send your father to do your work,
So, I'll be late for work.
Fear God.
Impossible, especially tomorrow, I won't be able to.
It's because he loves you.
Although he is upset and tired of your bad behavior towards him.
You don't even respect his age.
He is exhausted and has been sleeping in his room for two days.
Due to walking in the streets under the hot sun.
To give you the papers.
And he immediately set out to accomplish it.
Committee, from early morning until noon.
Did you hear that, Mom?
Do you want to delay my project?
Since you have a deadline for the project and a committee you're meeting with tomorrow
Tomorrow, you must finish your transactions.
Some at night.
He has a committee meeting tomorrow, he must be there.
What's bothering you, sir?
He choked back his tears.
Indeed, I did not lie to my father.
The committee changed its mind.
They said they would come by the end of the week.
Why didn't you tell him?
O my father, do not go!
I will go because the committee hasn't come.
Instead of sitting in the cafeteria with those girls
Deceived him.
Okay, enough. This is enough.
I apologize
I will do it.
Thank you.
O my father, eternity.
He is wrong.
And I'm also selfish.
When he learned that the committee would not come.
We are blessed by you.
From now on, my father.
We'll do our personal work ourselves.
He stayed at home.
I will kiss your forehead.
Hello, hello oh! My son.
Good morning.
My dear father
The whole world is equal to me.
I don't want you to trouble yourself.
Not annoying
As I told you
After finishing this paper
I wanted to do it myself so badly.
And he asked me to submit urgently.
I have a meeting.
With the happiness of the minister
Fragrant
To meet important personalities (VIPs)
I feel happy when they say my children are with that one or with him.
Don't worry and go to your work, [Ghaniyah]
Where is Bou Saada?
Balsham, my father.
The letter is with me, I will send it with the tea boy.
Just pass it to me, I'll send it with the next person coming.
My dear father
Do you mean he didn't sign?
Perhaps he forgot.
Because the committee will meet in an hour.
No, God bless you.
My son has a meeting with the minister today.
Give me the papers.
This is my daily routine, work, home, work.
I see no one.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, hello.
Yes, no, I didn't tell him anything.
He takes a week off and goes to the sea.
They said, "He is enjoying himself in the farm."
He goes out at dawn.
He enjoys good times there.
And imagine what will happen.
They say he's a good cook.
And he will go to him.
Goodbye
What happened?
What's wrong with you, sir?
God guides you.
No, no, my son, I'm fine, nothing.
Your scattered papers.
He is at the farm.
And she
Her friend's paper.
I am thirsty, I want water.
Give me water, water.
My dear children
No, no, take that out, I don't want it.
Don't write that.
I want them to be baffled by my predicament.
Thank you, sister.
You are right.
No, no, no, I said to him.
You are right, my sister.
My beloved has traveled.
They call him "Dauri" and "Kass."
Talk about the referee of the match.
He began to speak nonsense.
They nicknamed him "Stop Corruption".
People started inciting him.
And bring him some gossip to say on television and radio.
And also
They imprisoned him.
Believe it or not, sister.
These days, everyone is only concerned with themselves.
Why are you looking for problems?
Now, I will never do that.
Let him speak and say his famous words: "Eradicate corruption."
Praise be to God that he is well.
We are blessed by your arrival.
Goodbye
I'm late for work, Mom.
Listen, my son.
I was warning you.
Last night
Now I just want to remind you.
Okay, Mom
I will never call.
No radio or TV, and I won't call Qatar Telecom.
Your sister Aisha has been injured.
And your fiancée has been crying all day.
O Allah, have mercy upon us, for You are merciful to us. Do not punish us, for You are able to do so. O Allah, have mercy on them, forgive them, be pleased with them, and admit them into the gardens of bliss.
As you said.
I will stop my nonsense.
Because I don't want you to be upset.
Your uncle, Abu Munira
I came here two days after you entered prison.
He said it was over.
Cancelled
After many attempts, he regained his sanity and rested.
But he will sue you next time to get his daughter back.
Okay, Mom
I promised you.
You won't see any good if you call a TV or radio show again.
I told you I wouldn't do it.
Sorry, I must go now.
I'll tell you, but discreetly.
The manager told me
Who wants you to work here?
You might even talk about management.
And he started to involve us in trouble.
How will the manager justify that decision?
He has millions of excuses he'll say.
Where am I going?
Are you serious about your resignation?
What did I tell you before?
Hello, yes.
Goodbye
I told you.
Learn, in the public interest.
We need to reduce the number of messengers in the ministry.
You're right, but
Say "enough corruption" just once.
Refrigerator
Halting Unlawful Gain
Correct, yes.
You're still here!
We have work to do.
It's a catastrophe.
Until this issue is resolved.
What did I tell you?
I told you they would fire him.
And Munira was standing here and heard me say that.
Yes, Father, I did.
I heard them say it with my own ears.
Please go, and let me talk to your father alone.
I want to talk to your father.
He went to prison, we considered it a slip and forgave him.
We can't forgive him after he was fired.
We are not friends for this reason alone.
Did you hear that?
Calm down.
Inshallah, everything will be alright.
May God guide you to the straight path.
I didn't come to drink coffee.
I know you.
I feel bored.
Your uncle gave you two weeks.
I swear he will force you to go to court to divorce his daughter.
Even if I went out.
Why do you want to get into trouble?
But beware.
And if anyone asks you
Neglect him.
Isn't he the man who fights corruption?
Yes, man, it is.
It seems he's not doing well these days.
We want to hear it, at least once, please let us hear it.
No, it's fine.
Are you police officers?
No, no, Mother, you didn't understand the matter.
I asked him to speak on a radio show about a problem my cousin faced.
He was hesitant.
We felt he was hesitant because we spoke to him publicly.
I thought it best to suggest to my cousin that we go to his house and speak to him alone.
Did you feel that he agreed?
He was hesitant.
And go.
Enough, enough, enough
I'll be angry and never talk to you again, did you hear that?
Are you Saleh Saad?
No, please, enough. I've already gotten rid of that habit, thank God.
You have a very wonderful sense of responsibility.
Ideal employee
But unfortunately,
Even if I tried
Peace be upon you
We came to you, but you had already come, though you were not expected.
I was about to call the secretary to tell you not to come.
Shahin .. what's wrong with you?
You didn't know him.
Is there anyone living in Qatar who doesn't know Saleh Stop Corruption?
Are you Saleh, known as "Stop Corruption"?
Stop corruption.
Yes, the job.
No vacancies, as you know.
It's good that you didn't hire him.
Am I crazy to hire him here?
I went everywhere, Manira.
Someone told me that five minutes before I arrived, there was a vacant apartment, but they rented it out, I mean, they gave it to someone else.
My sister Ayesha got divorced yesterday.
I'm responsible for them now.
I have a big responsibility now.
I don't know what to do.
The season flatters the minister.
But I didn't feel it was the right thing to do.
I'm afraid this man will take my place.
Enough, stop.
Who said I would be silent?
But I want it done in a way that doesn't affect me.
I'm thinking of a way to get rid of it.
I will finish it.
But how?
I know him.
Is he the one rambling on the radio?
I'll take him to your house.
Give him only the information.
You are loyal and a patriotic zealot.
A very enthusiastic citizen.
Thank you.
I really quit that job.
I consider your voice the voice of justice.
Bu Fahad, I spoke with him.
Salih, believe it or not.
He says, "It's been a long time since we heard his voice resonating, demanding the fight against corruption."
Wanted to meet you.
This is natural, Saleh.
I am ambitious in the tent.
Forward, forward, forward
You are one of a kind.
Your kind words
Your words on the radio are much better.
We've heard enough corruption for one time.
Yes, please, just one, Bou Fahad will say, listen, listen, listen to him.
Stop corruption.
This is the original, sir, this is.
Continue, I don't want you to stop.
I can't.
Then the cold set in.
I want you to keep solving people's problems.
Salih is listening.
I'll give you one problem.
Voice of Truth
I want to talk to you alone.
He is a very important person.
Don't say no to him, you must say yes.
Yes, correct.
This is your chance.
Opportunities don't come twice.
No, she is %pw.
Do you not understand?
Wait, brother, please.
From these issues and problems
Dear Minister
The ministry requested eight thousand tubes for its latest projects.
It can withstand pressure of one hundred and twenty centimeters of water.
But this employee
To rely on pipes that
Because he wants to withdraw the balance.
Stop corruption.
Thank you, thank you very much, Brother Saleh, for stopping corruption.
No, God bless you.
This call is a special request.
I hope you hear it.
The last station: Stop corruption.
Know
Necessity compelled him to do it.
This is the last one.
Sultan is banished.
The minister dismissed the employee from his job immediately.
He provided accurate information.
Now Abu Fahd can do as he pleases.
I'll do all the tasks.
Yes, sir.
Yes, Your Excellency the Minister
Goodbye
Stop corruption.
It was certainly the last, and I won't repeat it.
And here's a job application, sorry, I was joking.
They got what they wanted.
Listen to me.
Because he fears the day will come.
And ties his misdeeds together.
For his criticism and exposure of corruption.
They fear you.
They tricked me, my sister Aisha.
You are kind.
My uncle, Father of Manira
I assure you that I will find a job.
People who criticize are fools.
They are vindictive people, harboring hatred for our country.
Do we have any problems?
We have no favoritism.
I haven't heard this word before.
In our government institutions
We don't have a bribe.
We don't know him.
Employee
Does a foreigner get more than a citizen? No, no, never.
We produce everything locally.
The problem of the family you belong to, we never face such problems.
If a manager or supervisor gets angry at you,
We are the best of people.
Our country is the best country.
Free of any problems
And thank you.
What did you say on the radio yesterday?
Mom, I want candy.
No dessert before dinner.
No candy, then.
Why is your shirt torn?
Mama, Adoul and I were playing.
I know you were playing.
But what tore your shirt?
Glory to Him, the Sufficient, O Just One.
Come and see what your wicked nephew has done.
I told you it was expensive and we don't need to buy it, but you said it doesn't matter, the important thing is that it will look good on Waleed.
Look what he did.
The shirt is now unusable.
Therefore he does not fear, and nothing will hinder him.
Mama, where is the candy?
Look how he intended to tear it; his intention was exposed as deliberate.
Poor Waleed
He was happy wearing this shirt for the first time.
He will see.
Where is Adol?
In the garden.
Why, what happened?
Something between me and him.
Don't tear it.
Be a little ashamed.
Don't argue with a child.
The child is not left to do as he pleases.
Unrepaired
Don't ask me to watch my words.
Are you a repairman?
We will raise them.
Sufi
Don't argue with him.
Why are you behaving like children and arguing?
Stay away, you!
Do not trespass against anyone.
Tell him to bring up his children well.
He is a boy.
You can't tell the difference between a child and an adult because you're crazy.
Learn
It's not your fault.
Let's go upstairs.
They don't deserve it.
We waste our time replying to them.
No one should do that.
Where people loved each other.
Okay, okay, bye, goodbye.
Sir, there are some files that require your signature, and the minister wants to see them.
Okay, okay, I'll talk to the minister, don't bother me.
Did you see the disaster, the tragedy?
It's new, oh my God! Aisha
Not child's play.
You are right.
He ruined the clothes.
Look, look
This cannot be worn.
Look at Adol's pants; he can wear one leg while the other remains exposed.
It's clear that this wasn't torn by hand.
It appears to have been cut with a power saw.
I said all I had: "God is sufficient for us."
I'll tell you
Who wants candy? Come on.
I know too.
If you know, take a tour around the villa.
I love you not only because you know how to ride a bike.
Likewise, because another command
She tells the truth straightforwardly.
Do you want candy?
Yes, I want two.
I'll give you four pieces.
Who tore our clothes in the closet?
How did your father cut them?
He has a large pair of scissors that can cut through a car.
Under the bed, take all the candy.
What is this boundary?
No one else could do that thing.
Why do we remain silent?
The most important thing
that we insist on what we say
He who tears clothes is a child.
Which computer?
What is he talking about?
Those cracks are impossible for a child to make.
Why don't you believe me?
Go and look for your friends.
One second
You're always like this.
Fighting every day, my son.
The past days
I ask Allah for pardon and well-being.
May God guide you.
Who can carry such a large pair of scissors?
Go and find friends.
How much you lie, mother!
He went and fetched those big scissors.
Imagine, Sultan, dawn is breaking.
Come and find a solution to this, come on, son!
How will I start?
Each one of you
You are fathers.
A child was born.
When a child is born,
You are my companions.
"Hear me and make peace with one another."
Tell me, what will you do now?
So what, they tore their clothes.
It's nothing compared to the disaster he caused. I lost all my documents and information. He corrupted everything.
I won't let him go.
He speaks Classical Arabic as if he were in a museum.
Neglect it.
He knocks on the door until he gets tired and leaves.
He is crazy; my brother knows him well.
And you took his hand in greeting.
He is filled with hatred and envy.
He got angry because I broke the computer.
Ah, Fahd
Sultan, punch, punch, punch
Fear God, O my children.
Hit him.. Hit him.. [Be quiet] Beware.. [Be quiet]
Take your brothers and go play outside.
May God guide you.
May God grant you a safe journey.
Old men
What did you leave for the children?
Okay, I'm going.
Your brother, Abdul Rahman
Perhaps it is the Hereafter, my son!
You know he's the oldest brother, girls!
He knows how to talk to people.
And he argued.
Don't be angry with me.
You are supposed to
Play has a role.
May God guide you.
And you, too, have become like them, my son!
Mother, they hit my son, it's a conspiracy against us, and you say: %pw, stay away.
Go away.
Blood is coming out of my son.
You are a disgrace to us, my sons.
It was children who were throwing them.
He doesn't believe it.
I saw them.
We told him they were children, but he didn't believe us.
He said from his window.
He saw children throwing stones, and because of the distance, he thought they were adults.
I am not crazy.
You can go.
Perhaps you are tired or feel dizzy.
Do you know who they are?
And you told me that they were throwing stones.
They are
Oh, dear!
I tell you to go home and rest, they've signed a promise, what more do you want?
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Oh my God, what is this?
"There is no power or might except by Allah."
Mother, mother.
All this is for you.
Because of you
Your men, but they act like children, sick minds.
Take me to the hospital, I'm going to faint, I'm going to die.
Yes, and it's not the first time I've seen him.
And I noticed that he never takes his eyes off you.
He is not registered for the Commerce course.
But he has been attending the class with us for a week.
It's clear he yearns to meet you.
Don't be like this, he loves you very much. Don't be so reserved with yourself.
No, my sister.
I don't want him to think I'm easy.
I ran after him.
We let it go to waste ordinarily.
Now he's chasing after you, longing to know you.
It's true that I'm also fond of him.
But I don't feel that the time is right now.
One hundred percent
She looks at you and *
Are you waiting for her to say, "Sorry, can I meet you?"
Take the initiative.
You are right.
But I'm waiting for the right opportunity.
The right opportunity
What are you waiting for? You're enrolled in the same class as her.
What did the teacher say?
Please ask her, miss.
And now what's her name?
We've been exchanging glances for three months.
But they never get to know each other.
You are very old.
It means you go and say, "Sorry."
Can I get to know you?
Not to this limit
I have to wait for the right opportunity.
A quiet and polite girl.
I don't know what you're looking for.
We finished filming all the episodes yesterday.
Yes, in fact.
You will never forget us.
I am a free spirit.
The goal is to buy the villa behind our villa for our father Walid.
Tomorrow, when he gets married, he won't live far from us.
It's of no use now.
You're late.
You didn't teach.
I saw it empty a few days ago. Who bought it?
And they bought it through a housing loan from the Development Bank.
"O Allah, bless their home."
Hello, hello, my son, good morning.
Brother, start the engine.
Thank you, my son. May God reward you.
Hello Nora, come outside, the car is running now, come I'll take you.
Peace be upon you too.
What do you want?
Neighbors talking to each other, what do you want?
It's better for you to leave us alone.
The neighbors talk to each other, O diverse beings.
A man parked his car behind mine, I can't get it out.
So, if it's not too much trouble, give me your car keys.
Car key as well.
I'll leave you in this Titanic environment.
See you later.
Goodbye
Now you know a lot about me.
I just know that you are Waleed.
Walid Rashid Abdullah
Surely when people hear your father's name, many will think you are the son of the famous actor.
Inshallah the same name
In fact, my father is Rashid Abdullah, the actor.
Rashid Abdullah, the famous actor, is your father?
Eat the biscuits! So why didn't you have dinner with them?
Tell me,
How did you know that the famous actor, Rashid Abdullah, is our neighbor?
Yes, correct.
My friend at university, I know them, told me that.
He loves his acting and is content with just watching his works.
He finally said that we live next to a famous and important person in the community.
My heart, what joy!
He's very nice, he has a sense of humor.
And his son is a kind man, he helped me, may God reward him well.
It is said that
Do you know what?
Do you know why I want to take pictures with him?
Mama, speak to my cousin Abd.
I can read an interview with him in the newspaper.
He said they would film a series about diving.
Your luck is like a promise, it brought you a lamb, a gift for the new villa.
It has been proven that he is a good neighbor.
Hello Saleh, any news?
In fact, we have many names.
They said, "O Abu Saad, may Allah prolong your life, my name is there."
That will be determined based on the needs and experiences of the staff.
We don't know.
We may not move you.
I'm sorry, I can't do anything for you.
Thank you.
We wanted to move and settle first, then buy furniture when God blesses us with money.
You did the right thing.
Ah! Bouali
Do not consider me a stranger.
Whatever you need,
I'm ready to help.
Neighbors for support and assistance.
And I heard now and saw.
That's good, God willing you are an expert in furniture.
So I'll go with you.
Don't worry, sister!
When you want to choose the furniture, let me know.
My love, your father applied for a loan, and if approved, we will replace all the furniture.
And I repeat it again,
Feel free to ask me anything.
We are a family now.
Can't your sister study without your help?
But I want her to be independent.
I'm sure you were talking to her!
Do you want me to lie and say she was my friend?
Hey! Son, hey! Ali
I don't have a problem with this.
Integrated, she loves me and I love her, I will swear to find a solution to the problem.
You dream.
I'm introducing you to my cousin in marriage.
Leave it to me.
As you like it
They will return you.
We will see.
Good night
Good night
What bothered you, Abu Ali?
Ah! Brother, the car broke down.
You bother me every now and then.
My daughter, God bless her, has a lecture.
This car is always breaking down.
Your daughter is our daughter.
It doesn't matter.
There's no need to torture yourself, my brother Rashid.
May God not bless you.
The car is parked in the yard and the driver is sitting idle.
It seems that the development bank bought you a house and a car.
It's not our car.
Our neighbor Rashid Abdullah's car.
I see relationships evolving.
We will discuss matters of mutual interest that benefit both parties.
Ah, this is a huge development.
Come on!
Mama, remember to buy spinach.
Did not agree
Nora said, "Like my daughter, the driver will take her to university every day."
Did you tell her that Dad's car will be in the shop for a week?
Swear, no.
She said the driver would pick her up every morning.
Martyr of God, O Mother of Ali!
They are good people.
No, no, no, man!
There is no power or might except by Allah.
What troubles, what troubles, what am I to do now?
No one can do anything, but I have duties.
Who will drive my daughter to college?
Ah! Ya Bou Ali, as long as it was Mr. Rashid Abdullah who recommended me to you.
We cannot refuse your request.
Bu Saad, Bu Saad
I have succeeded, O Abu Sa'd.
Bu Ali knows how much we love him.
Thank you, may God reward you, O Abu Saad.
They love you, God willing.
This is one sweet.
People, Mr. Rashid is busy, leave him alone.
Sorry, sorry, Mr. Rashid, if we wasted your time.
No problem
You are connected on a pink sheet.
We are your friends and brothers, take care of us when we need something.
Just tell me where you want it, I'll get it for you.
What happened, what's wrong, why are you dragging me?
Manal will offer me the friendship of marriage.
The mothers agreed.
Manal talked to her mother about me.
Why don't you believe?
Mother of Al-Waleed
Dresses too, do you have any suitable for parties?
I don't understand.
That Waleed will also get married soon, the apple of my eye.
She called me, "Oh, what a difficult one!"
Some accessories are bought.
Not accessories! Jewelry.
Is this my mother?
You will also go in a fancy vehicle.
God willing, if God wills.
God willing, I cannot look at you.
That's kind of Mother-in-law.
In addition to all that, he gifted you the car.
With the driver.
If I go with you looking like this, they won't believe that this weary man is the husband of that queen.
Oh God
Are you going in clothes like these?
No, no, no, no, no, there's no need to worry.
I'll change my appearance, and you won't be able to recognize me.
They will be surprised, thinking I am a sheikh.
Coffee must be brought to him, so that he may live long.
Bu Ali, I didn't know you at all, by God! I thought you were a very important person. You're not Bu Ali, you're not Bu Ali.
What do you think?
Your walk is completely different.
God will send you among them with a blessing.
Are they very important people?
I arranged everything from the headgear to the car.
I'm sure I'll find it with you.
In the final series, in which you played a role.
There was an action, as I remember, a wedding.
You were wearing a shiny black cloak.
And I will also learn how to wear the bishts.
Never, God bless you, I've never worn a suit in my life.
Insha'Allah, you look great.
Thus, upon entering the guest room
This is not correct.
My brother, Rashid,
Do you have cufflinks?
Good afternoon
My constant companion and eternity.
Therefore
You are my child.
We are a family now.
And we do not want our daughter Nora to leave us.
Noura suits Waleed.
He told me he sees her at university and he won't find a better wife than her.
We are blessed in this.
I will tell her father, and we ask God to satisfy us with what is best.
Why did they reject it? For what reason?
Because his father is an actor.
Ask your father to come.
Quickly, tell him that Rashid wants to see him.
Where are you, !
I scream with bitterness.
Because his father is an actor.
There is no shame in you.
I am an actor.
But I act with integrity.
I perform my task in the laboratory for a few hours, and my role ends.
When the acting is over.
You play roles.
I act
Convey a beneficial vision.
But you are
I wear costumes to act out roles.
On the test
But you
I wore it in the guest rooms.
The role of the wealthy and rich woman.
Who is the actor?
Who is the real actor?
Don't be sad, Waleed.
Lift your head up.
Shame
You missed the scene.
I heard her scream at him, "Don't look back, don't look back, it's forbidden, you break my heart."
And he walks straight.
Like a horse.
It's Thursday, man! Thursday.
Thursday
His wife is crazy.
Jealousy of other women
That's why he walks like this.
To shield him from women, and let no woman see him.
See how his wife drives him crazy.
Be upright, and do not turn your face.
I'll show him at the office tomorrow.
Thursday, Hello, Hello, Show them the city center.
Thursday, show me the city center.
Isn't your wife calling you "the city center"?
Come Thursday.
I'll go see what Salem wants.
It is forbidden for him.
When will you change!
If you only hear what they say about you.
Even in front of me, they say more than that.
Why are you doing this?
Jealous women who are around me.
Why are you so excessively jealous?
When I sometimes sit in front of the TV
It's her, her.
I swear by God.
No, no, this is normal.
Peace be upon you, my sister.
Do you see that?
I just spoke to her in front of you, she heard a man's voice.
I swear by God, sometimes I throw my clothes in the street.
Have mercy on yourself and let her go.
I find it hard to divorce her.
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Do not come near me, but stay there.
What's on your mind!
Nothing is bad.
Who are you talking to?
You spend time with these good-for-nothing people.
Especially this fat man, he is the most hated among your friends.
Who has fat cheeks and hair like little plants.
That rude person has no shame.
You want to torture me in my grave.
Let me tell her.
Tell me, what's going on with you?
Who are you talking to!
I don't see anyone here.
Salem, what's wrong! What happened!
Our friend Khamis has lost his mind.
After a short while, he faced the wall and started talking to himself.
Greatly disturbed
Khamis is a poor man.
He always pictures her in his mind and imagines talking to her.
He is sufficient for his wife.
They say Thursday is with you.
He is busy now, he has an international call, very far away, even the call drops.
What does the message say?
May God help you, Khamees.
Stay awake!
I can't sleep.
Regarding tomorrow's meeting
With the women's delegation at the ministry
Can they do it, then?
O Thursday, may Allah facilitate your steps.
These names were selected by the Office of the Minister.
But, amazing!
Why do you fear her?
If you were talking to Salem, then why did you hit him?
Speak the truth.
Why are you hiding behind the water tank then?
Likewise, by itself.
I saw the last number connected to you, read it, it's with you.
Last number!
I called the last number after deleting the woman's number you were talking to.
Tell me, what's her name?
I told you, I told you, I told you.
I told her that I was talking to Salem.
My friend at work, Saloom.
You didn't believe me.
What are you wearing?
Are you going on a diving trip?
I swear to you, brother, I won't change my clothes.
Who do you want me to call!
Call my wife.
Call my wife.
Tell her, my brother, give me the password, a pen, call, I will give you the number.
You support one another.
You men are always like this.
You're just like him, a liar, and I'll show you.
If you interfere again, I'll go to the minister's office.
She cursed me.
And she threatened me that she would complain about me to the minister's office.
She's really brave.
She is planning to ruin my career.
I dared to listen to you, so I contacted her.
Listen, Thursday.
She suspected me at the minister's office.
You will come with me and tell the whole truth, and keep me out of this problem.
This is not about me.
You are a coward.
Sisters and brothers
Good morning, everyone.
I'm glad you attended the meeting.
Where are the others?
Fled
Where is Thursday?
He's coming.
Turn off your mobile phone.
Okay, don't turn it off, leave it in the office.
The meeting will be only for one hour.
This is not my phone.
The war began.
Oh my God, since that day, he has been living with you.
Where can he go?
He can't go.
And since that day, his condition has not changed.
Jealous, he gets jealous of women being around him.
This is not envy.
He sits alone here in the living room at night.
He says she is my mother.
His mother! His mother is dead.
Therefore, I called to find a solution for myself.
I asked you to move from the section with women.
Is it a military decision?
Look at the very clear signature at the bottom.
Brother, sorry, I've moved to the social welfare department.
Ministry of Welfare! Are you sure they transferred you there?
Why is he strange?
Thank you, and may God bless you.
Are you, pardon me, Sir Thursday?
The minister's office called and informed us.
Have you been to your new office?
Who's with you in the office?
Article, Saleem, Jasim,
Ah! Thursday, the minister decided to transfer you only yesterday.
And today you just moved to the new department.
I explained to you my problem with my family.
The minister decided to transfer you.
So I must go to the minister.
He started his annual vacation today.
He will return after a month and a half.
Great hardship
If you want my opinion
The minister will tell you the same thing.
Work there until we find you another place, this time your transfer is due to many reporting your problem with your wife.
I'm telling you the truth.
And what should we do!
Do not speak when your wife calls you.
You never know, they might agree with you, so persuade them.
I asked them to put the abayas in the car, they put them in the trunk for you.
How many?
I put ten because you are five in the office, meaning one for each.
It seems that he is very afraid of his wife.
Imagine he gave us all male names.
And he calls me Abdul Qadir.
What is his name?
He is kind and handsome, so she is afraid that other women might fall in love with him.
In the name of God, what's wrong with her?
Who called me?
Yes, Abdelkader, who is sitting next to Hassan, is there behind Khalil.
Here are the cloaks; each one can choose what she likes.
Look at this one.
How much is this?
What happened? What went wrong?
Sorry
Where is the social welfare office?
He assumes that there are five employees.
What is your name?
I am handsome.
I'm crazy, my wife made me that way.
I am crazy.
You laid out the project before us.
And he met them.
What did they say?
They said.
Muna, prepare some tea.
I can't.
Do you want me to go back to the kitchen and ruin my clothes?
Go now and make us some tea.
Bring it, bring it, nonsense.
Go and listen to what the men are saying.
Don't forget that we're the Scorpion clan.
Go and get me some tea without sugar. Go, go, go!
The bank said the project was sound.
I've called him many times, his phone is busy.
They have the preference, for they were waiting for you for a long time.
My brothers, as usual.
One of them took a month-long leave, she has been traveling for three months and hasn't returned yet.
God is kind, goodbye.
And all the changes are in our favor.
Pour us some.
Yes, but if you build a park
You'll need the space of one, two, or three villas.
The park is a relaxation spot for the residents of the complex.
Men don't need women's opinions.
Keep it to yourself.
Put the tea and go.
No vehicle.
Just a moment.
Sister, you know I love football.
Your uncle and brothers will kill you if they find out you're playing it at school.
What do you plan to do? Do you want to kill yourself?
Look, I told you.
I advise you to forget about it.
Do not harm yourself.
No, no, no, no, I'm angry with you.
I was busy.
Forgive me, you are our blessings.
Hello, Uncle Shahin has arrived.
God willing
Is this Thursday?
Grew up
Now he has become a man.
I am less inclined to search for a woman for him, as I could not reach her.
From a family of deep origin.
You know,
Leave his marriage to me.
Is this from the HR department?
Yes, God willing, your life will be long.
Close your eyes to it.
I have some remarks on his suggestions.
God willing, long life.
Except for that.
No, may God grant you a long life.
Take care of them, and I will meet them when I find the time.
What did you do about the employees I sent you yesterday?
What happened?
I'm leaving now, I'll call you later.
What happened?
Are you crazy?
We are your elder sister.
We are weary of them.
Do you know they asked me what I play at school?
I told them that you play table tennis.
It's good that they didn't kill you.
Those were just appetizers.
Do you know who we are?
What is our origin?
Do you know what that means?
This time, we crushed your face.
Chief of the Scorpions
Small scorpion
Uncle, let me slap her in the face.
That was enough.
Keep it until next time.
You've changed your mind! Didn't you say you wanted to study architecture?
Are you crazy?
A Scorpio woman can't work on the streets with men.
Engineering and Architecture
Embarrasses us
I will break her head.
No, no ruler, no.
Lord of the Scorpions
You thought you just defeated Fatoum.
Let him choose a falcon.
Shame
Oh, my dark-skinned darling, at least you got a slap in the face.
Look at my face.
Why do they want you to go with them tomorrow morning?
What do they want?
Come here.
Walk in front of me.
Where are we going?
Don't utter a word.
Where are we going?
I told you to shut up, don't say a word.
Education instead
Or even nursing, it doesn't matter.
What else do you want?
You have two choices.
To know that we open our minds to everything.
Never say that we forced you to change.
Nursing or teaching
Go away.
Bring us a copy of the app.
Go, go away.
Master of the scorpions, my son.
The big scorpion himself suggested it to you.
Thank you, Uncle! But when is the engagement?
Miss Manira
What you ask for is difficult.
I can't travel, oh! Father of Khalid
I have personal circumstances.
Recommended by the minister.
Difficult
Think about it again.
Don't decide now, think about it until tomorrow.
How do they allow you to work then!
Therefore, they say nothing.
I have a suggestion.
Ask one of them to travel with you.
Girls shouldn't travel.
This is nonsense.
No shame!
You should be grateful that we allowed you to go to work.
Tomorrow, go and tell them you can't travel.
"Let's go... We don't want to discuss."
Listen and be silent.
Thursday, son of the scorpions
He is close to us.
It's true that he's stupid and doesn't have a degree.
It's a scorpion.
What will you do, sister?
What can I do, Fatima!
I am weak and poor.
What can I do?
I can't do anything.
What can you do?
The wedding will be next Monday.
I will ask you to come depending on the sheikh's arrival time.
How beautiful her laughter is!
Go and buy new clothes.
Go and get some new clothes, son.
I love this laughter.
Brother, I ask for your forgiveness.
I don't want to hear a single word.
They prepare tea, coffee, and cake for us.
"Lucky you, Oisha! You're now the minister's friend."
I'm afraid it's a rumor. Oh! Abu Khalid.
Mounira is a candidate to be the minister of a new ministry in the new cabinet structure.
Muna deserves all the best.
I hope it's not a rumor.
Will you work tomorrow?
And we must all cooperate to serve this country.
With the effort of each one in their position, thank you.
I wish you all success.
Thank you, Your Highness.
Thank you = Your Excellency
Thank you.
Hello, please come in.
Peace be upon you
Yes, with soap as you requested.
He is the overall supervisor of the women's football league.
Ask him about Fatima's playing.
God willing
Team captain Fatima scored two goals like professional players.
Captain Fatima is talented, brothers.
Captain, what do you think of Fatima's playing?
She is a good forward player.
You will travel to China.
Captain, isn't China a bit far?
O Allah, grant him success.
Your sister will play an important match.
She was studying education, but I went today and submitted a transfer request for her.
You will study architecture.
There is no difference between a man and a woman.
Go ahead and serve the coffee.
Where are you going?
Waiting has exhausted my patience.
Dumber, are you dumber?
Go, greet your mother and tell her you've been fired.
Go!
How foolish that man is!
The coffee in the pot you have is cold.
They don't call you all year round, but once they know you have their chains, they'll be calling you.
Hello, how are you, how are the kids!
What did you say to her?
I told her you would be in the series with us.
Barcelona will be the main character.
Look, Ali, Shaoula will play the role of Nouf.
There's something called makeup that can make her look younger.
Mary's role is limited to only twenty-six or twenty-seven episodes.
"Make use of it, Saul."
He will deliver endless lectures to us.
I'm afraid he'll become a nuisance to us.
The most important thing is that he doesn't know that the producing company belongs to you and Hamed.
I hope I'm not late.
And Rashid is here too.
The manager and the actors are ready.
For the sake of time, folks! Let's start the meeting.
Tell us your opinion.
Hamad, do you want to say something?
Frankly, I think she's the best.
When the maid committed suicide.
You know the most influential part of me.
And it is the state in which the maid committed suicide.
When she hung herself from a fan, she spun around and bled to death.
They found him, and she wept for her child, saying, "O sorrow of the heart!"
And he kept kicking her until he reached the yard of the house.
I find it exciting.
The police come, search the house, and lock up the mother.
It's really a great series.
You were about to undergo the operation here on this table.
In fact, it's artistic blackmail.
My community
All about strange events.
That which is unbelievable.
72 murders
And what prevented the weeping?
You are known to obstruct people.
"Not sensitive, Professor Hamid. Let's be open-minded."
The majority voted.
Mr. Nasser, don't claim openness and use the majority as an excuse, it doesn't work with a critical evaluation of artistic production.
Due to your government job, you're entangled in this matter.
Goodbye
I heard the doorbell ring.
There was an Indian man with a bag in his hand.
He asked me, "Are you Ms. Hessa?" and I replied, "Yes."
I opened the suitcase.
There was a ring worth around seventy to eighty thousand.
I'm afraid the Indian man brought these things by mistake.
No, it's not a mistake.
She is Samira.
Hamed's wife, the supervisor at the company.
A gift from her to you, and may Allah bless you abundantly.
Yes, you.
A very luxurious ring.
I never dreamed of owning such a ring.
God bless you, dear Hessa.
Yes, that's it, I call it the chain of blessings.
Ali and Hamad own the production but they are employees there, and they cannot provide it under their names.
What more shall we have than a ring?
Don't involve anyone else, keep it between you and me.
Am I crazy to do that?
Your creative husband
Who is called the wizard?
Only five percent, it's too little.
No, this is good if they agree to four million for them.
Your husband will get two hundred thousand riyals, that's great.
I think we'll cast Nada as the college girl.
It's a wonderful role, I fell in love with a man and ran away with him on a motorcycle.
The series we will produce is called Conscience Extortion.
They talked to me about a role in a TV series.
I want to know,
Gulf drama is always high quality... blackmailing is the fashion of this year.
Alright, tell my courage, what's my role?
And you are also my love, your role is preserved.
Don't embarrass me.
I am coming, coming, now.
I prepared all that breakfast, don't go and leave me.
This is Omar, the manager's secretary.
God protect our homeland.
No one has asked to see me today at this hour.
He told him it would be a feeble and silly series.
Do not waste your money on that.
And what happened after that?
God protects me, what should I say? I'm afraid Rashid told them something bad about the series.
Do not be afraid.
Leave it to me.
Mentally ill
Social series
I just saw her on TV.
May God grant you a long life.
The series that is currently airing on television is called "Blackmailing a Young Flower."
But I think the budget they're asking for is too high.
You need a large budget.
But don't forget that the producing institution is local.
We should support her.
It doesn't matter.
Have you read the arts page?
We heard they'll start filming the series "Blackmail of Conscience."
And that a massive budget was allocated for it.
Nevertheless, it is said that the series is weak.
Others said the series consists of a school that teaches moral decay.
Perhaps they will stop shooting.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
Hello, hello, please have a seat.
Good morning.
Good morning, welcome.
I'm Eli Mounir, a journalist, and I have an appointment with Mr. Hamed, if that's not a bother to you.
Yes, please sit down for a moment because he is in a meeting.
Zuhaym, this will enable us to use a design for a world.
By the way, we will be corresponding with all the correspondents in the world to communicate with us.
That's your task.
Mercury Media Production
He discusses his issues in a manner that allows him to reach the highest level of production in world history.
Do you believe that the one who wrote this ...
Does not feel shame
Do we have such a journalist?
Do we have such a journalist?
The professionalism of a worker in the media field requires that he be familiar with the basics of ethics.
They work.
Do you think they're here now?
Indeed, I met his happiness, the minister, do you know what he said to me?
A true tragedy and its events are very strange.
Tomorrow will be the premiere, I'll watch it with the people.
What do you think, Mother?
"Don't worry, Mom, this is just the first episode."
Have you seen people talking to themselves, except in Gulf series?
Have you ever seen a mother who wants to kill her children? Except in the series you watch.
Ah! My son, art is a refined sense, not anomalies that you generalize about people and society.
Mother, it can be done in the fine arts, but the theater is a completely different matter.
Don't give me a headache.
It seems they are following the Turkish people's example.
Don't judge now, at least watch the first five episodes.
This chain has failed.
We cannot allow our children to watch it.
What's this limit for, brother?
Worse shows are aired on TV.
Indeed, not everyone.
It's your fault.
For every one, in every house
Go and gather the people who understand these dimensions and hidden lines.
And look at them.
We have not
Tell me, what happened?
The minister passed by with some guests.
I stood up to greet him.
We agreed to produce the series.
How will the minister like this?
Alright, let's hear Nasser's opinion.
My colleague wrote that.
I only publish messages that say something good about the series.
No, no, don't worry.
Read the newspaper tomorrow, and I will publish the praise letters from me and announce that the viewers sent them.
God willing
The experiences will please you.
For this year.
Agree
It is considered the best series in the history of Gulf drama.
They are all in agreement with them.
All parties agree on that.
I will only read the translation.
I hope they rerun the series Extortion of Conscience.
Thank you, Minister of Arts, for this series.
I wish they would show it again.
When the minister's office first called me
We can come to pick up the final cash installment from the series.
They were right to call you the wizard.
This wasn't everything.
We made profitable amounts and received our money.
The series is also a failure.
The writer himself told me that he regrets writing it.
I'm here to propose a second season for the series.
The minister believed the press hoax that was fabricated.
Believe in the illusory success we created.
He is not satisfied with the series.
Which means that his consent to a second term is impossible.
I assure you that the minister himself will request a second portion.
I can only
Thank you.
For all people
Who worked on this series?
Congratulate them on his success.
They all deserve it.
Indeed, we won those awards for best festivals.
That proves it.
This is what you believe.
You are creative.
He will win the gold prize without a doubt.
What was he saying?
He said that readers and the press lie to me.
Yes, why not a second part?
As long as Arab and Gulf television festivals are a laundry for genres.
Artistic washing!
I've heard about money laundering.
It is not art.
Unlawful money
The series are the same.
What can we do with "one two"?
What do you mean?
Haven't we signed a contract with them? They should abide by it.
Write them.
Our bread is exported to the world, flatbread, large, small, triangular, in various types and shapes.
What did we agree on in the contract?
Two million dollars
What did you do to the Australian baker?
He is the inventor of bread.
Has anyone told you about his product?
No, they just said it's bread, but I don't know what it contains.
It is bread with oil.
You call it a zipper.
Instead of cutting bread, call it (sammoun), as you call it, semolina bread.
The inventor tried to make it easy.
Genes Bread
This is the secret.
You eat bread with a zipper.
These people make very strange things.
This zipper is really amazing; it's made in a way that makes it melt in your mouth as soon as you put it in.
It can have different flavors: strawberry, ketchup, coffee.
Do you know how much money I invested in this project?
Three million dollars with patent rights.
Enter, Sameeh.
Yes, Abu Nasser.
Yes, sir, I am at your service.
We delivered it to him today, my lord.
Say to him: "O Samih!"
I was with your son Nasser yesterday, playing football with his team.
I agreed with him.
To form his team of drivers and security men,
It's also an incomplete team, we only have one goalkeeper, and if he gets injured we'll be in trouble.
Assumes that I also have fans.
When you accompanied the seventeen players,
I didn't say anything.
Important people in the company
Indispensable ones
The bakery delivered the pastries to the hospital.
Why are you bothering the boy?
You said he couldn't, that he's from a well-known family, he can't run after a ball and make a fool of himself.
He can do what he wants.
And do not remove the living ones.
What can I do, Mom? My team has a match and I need four players.
No more excuses.
Well, whatever happened, happened.
Hamdy didn't show up for work today, sir.
I went with him.
The cat said "Meow".
And I would position myself in the penalty area.
The match started.
Then I didn't feel anything.
They told me the ball hit me while I was unaware.
Have you ever been a goalkeeper?
I only played because Nasser asked me to play.
"There is no power or might except by Allah."
We're tired of your love for football.
From now on! O Nasser
It's not a football.
You need to disband your team.
And all the baggers must return to their baggerzates.
What do you think?
He opened it, this is it.
I don't want to hear anything.
Please, Abu Nasser.
Listen to what he wants to say.
Okay, I'll do it because you asked me to.
Speak, what did you want to say?
Tomorrow, we will play the last match of the tournament.
Don't bother him, Abu Nasser, please, I beg you.
Alright, mates!
Congratulations, congratulations
Good, good, good, congratulations!
Hello! Mr. Nasser, I want to speak to you for a minute, please.
Thanks, my team was on time today.
Mr. Nasser, we must
You promised us a great party.
Do you want me to call and book a room at the hotel?
Call the newspapers and journalists to be present there.
No, Rashid! We'll hold it at our house.
Perhaps when my father sees the players and their success, he won't cancel it.
They won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup.
I hope so.
No, no, I saw him taking pictures with the players and he was with them, talking to the press.
It seems that Sami, the sports page editor, is interviewing him.
Solar image
Leave it close to me.
Use your voice wisely.
He is happy.
Your comment on your children's, the bakers', victory made them the happiest.
High spirits
And the effort.
Loyalty to the bakery.
Excuse me, Abu Nasser, we saw the team playing with a 4-4-2 formation.
Loyalty to the bakery and the coach's plan.
Thank you, Uncle Bo Nasser.
Good health to you.
Hello, goalkeeper.
Journalists from The League and The Cup will be present to interview you.
No, it is not from the councils.
They sent their representative to conduct the interview.
They brought the cup, they brought the cup, they brought it, they brought the cup.
Learn, we encourage youth
I expect a bright future for them.
Yes, goodbye.
Insha'Allah your phone is always ringing and your pictures are in the newspapers. May God keep you for us day and night. May God grant you success in football.
Do you know who was talking to me on the phone?
Lower the price of the engines, said the consenting party.
Yes, you've become famous now. They write under every picture of you in the newspapers: The first athlete in the International Bakeries.
I wasn't interested in football.
What are you saying?
Since I was in school
The one who sat next to me loves football.
You say I wasn't close to soccer.
Since the person next to me plays football, I am close to football.
Proximity to sports does not make one an athlete.
So we are no longer the International Virgins, we have become International Football.
I heard him say yesterday that he would make it a sports club.
And today we meet with the first man of sport in the International Bakeries, Bo Nasser.
To promote football
Before the match, tell us about your expectations before stepping onto the court.
The game is difficult today.
The team that controls the midfield will be *excellent* today.
Yes, God willing, we will communicate with professional player agents to develop the International Bakery Team.
He is called Saud, listen, we want a commitment.
Yes, he wants the previous treatment with the players.
He had no use for it.
When I gave you the prices.
I gave you the international price.
So, is there any successor to the Gulf in this world?
Of course not.
This is not your business.
Just let me know when a buyer from the Gulf arrives.
Open the fax line.
Two of them are defenders, one is a midfielder, and the other is a center player.
Look, these four players.
Three of them cost.
$200,000 per player
Take them all in one box.
The amount will be six hundred thousand dollars, I'll give it to you for five hundred and eighty-five thousand dollars.
Beautiful, that's for the African players, now for the Brazilian player.
He's the player of the season, he costs one million two thousand dollars alone.
They said this price, but I received a fax, I'll show you, it's here. Wait, look, look, I received it from a club in the United Arab Emirates.
The decision is up to you.
Thank you.
God willing, I will examine his leg.
How is she?
Knee, knee
The knee cap is in place.
We don't want deception, I hope there is no hard connection.
Ah! Ya Bu Nasser
What is this connecting muscle?
Butcher! Open the door.
Frankly, you're lucky to have Brazilian and African players, congratulations, congratulations.
Thank you.
To the store, store.
Ah, God willing, you'll have another profession.
No, no, no, only the players.
I see them unloading the boxes.
Young players! Yes, we want them from the jungles of Africa.
Yes, why this?
Karim, open a box for him.
He is a human being like the rest of us.
A young man said, "Didn't you hear him?"
He said they were young.
Integrated
Why don't you give us this boy as a free gift?
Listen, Abu Nasser, if you raise him well and take good care of him, he will benefit you one day.
Go and release him in the playground.
Come, come, come, come
Have mercy on him, for he is still young.
Put it in the annex, let him raise it.
Don't hesitate if you need anything, all the players are with me.
Your trainer should understand.
We won 2-0 and dominated the game.
His father is a coach for Spain.
What I love
Successful coach
The match should be controlled.
And this ball is the opposite way.
You shouldn't let your coach do what he wants.
He spent less than two months with the team.
And it is upon us to bring this to an end.
If he were an expert in football, he would have activated the players on the flanks, rather than attacking from the center.
Yes, I rely on the offside trap.
Oh mother, don't give me a headache.
He should fire Kakuno Malalawi.
And they replaced it with Shinamo Hababo Htawala Htawa Hawa.
No, no, no, no, no, I don't want him to play.
Forget Shoulolo Hbabo Tabla Lava
Which line?
Implementing the plan
And the moon forgot its orbit.
This kind of conversation shouldn't happen between the coach and the team manager.
Player of the match, team's star
Do you mean we're not soccer experts?
Listen, Sultan.
Let him go home.
Don't take him in the bakery van, let him take a taxi.
It's none of your business.
Get the latest updates
Do you see what my father did fairly?
So the trainer was dismissed and sent back to his country.
What is he doing?
Corrupts the team.
Our team said goodbye.
Mama, Mama
No, he's crazy. That means he told you you're divorced. Tell me the truth, what happened between you two?
From the first day I saw him, I told your mother I didn't like this boy.
I feel he is incapable of taking responsibility.
Forget all the nonsense and talk about the past.
You have to go to his father and find out why your daughter was divorced.
I don't know what to say... Oh, Brother Rashid!
Why did he divorce her then?
"It can't be! Oh, Abu Abdullah, we have the right to know, we have the right to ask why he divorced her?"
Don't interfere, it's none of your business.
How can I not interfere? The man is waiting in the lounge to find out why his daughter was divorced.
She doesn't know how to appreciate her husband and respect his feelings.
Who is she to Barcelona?
It's not your fault. You don't know La Liga.
Barcelona is not a lady.
This is Guardiola's team.
That means I'm going now to the man who's waiting for me in the lounge.
If you don't go, I will. Alright, stay here and leave it to me.
She should leave and not shake her head.
It wasn't enough for her to insult Barcelona.
Messi, the football wizard, who scores a hat-trick in every match.
Maradona himself said that Messi would be better than him.
And your wicked daughter mocks him. Listen,
Your daughter isn't a Barcelona fan and doesn't suit us.
What do you mean!?
Listen, may God guide you.
Don't tell me you want my son.
To apologize and please her.
My cousin
Praise be to God, we have a lot of money.
What's the point of our money if it doesn't make our son happy?
Oh, stop it.
Most importantly, I'll look for a Barcelona fan.
Mom, I'm not angry.
It's a paradise, my son, he forgot it.
Drink your tea, son.
Do you know, son, they are the ones who are losing.
A thousand girls wish to marry you.
Drink up, son.
I feel sorry for her.
She is miserable; her husband divorced her two days ago.
After a marriage that lasted for one month.
What's wrong with you? You want me to interfere with him.
I don't want to be in trouble with him.
Who told you these illogical stories!
Don't listen to her.
Doesn't she know who he is?
What more do you want!
Her wealth only.
Do you remember the building I want to buy and convert into an apartment hotel?
The one in Mansoura.
His father owns it, and when his son marries our daughter, I will ask him for this building.
If you can't.
Talk to her sister.
Listen well.
A millionaire's son asked you to marry him.
Do you know what a millionaire is?
Opportunity knocks but once.
They are so rich that they bought a palace in Spain to spend every summer there.
Excellent, what's the story of Barcelona?
Perhaps the girl's family was the one that spread this rumor to prove their daughter's innocence.
Let's assume the story is true and the man loves Barcelona and is loyal to Catalonia.
His wife must respect that.
Do not mock the team.
Assuming this story is true.
May God bless you, he is called Abu Burjan because he owns two towers on the corniche.
He designed it in an odd shape like interwoven threads.
When the people saw the tower from afar, they thought it was a single tower.
What do you think? Luck is on your side.
Welcome
May God bless you. Get something and eat.
Thank you, my love.
But tell me, light of my eyes, that my son Abdullah is waiting for your reply.
No, don't worry, O my eye's light, Umm Abdullah.
If I searched all the GCC countries, I wouldn't find anyone better than you.
Tell them to give us their own estimates for building the structure.
I'm done, sir. Is there anything else?
Yes, the family will contact you.
Observe their needs for marriage, prepare the check, and I'll sign it.
In the name of Allah, Allah has written and decreed, in the name of Allah, Allah has written and decreed, after your permission, O Most Honored Happiness.
Abdullah divorced again!
I wish you offspring from you and wealth from him.
May God bless you, my aunt.
She wears it because of the cold.
Yes, but I don't know where my mom booked us?
Where did you book us, mother?
Mother says she booked us a trip to Malaysia.
What's not working in Malaysia, everything is fine.
Safe journey
What's wrong with you? Have you ever heard of a bride who came back from her honeymoon crying?
What bothered you, my daughter? Tell me.
Tell me what happened, my daughter!
Mom, she's too proud.
Why?
She is haughty, forget her.
You did the right thing by firing her.
I feel sorry for her.
That's her mother.
Why is she sad?
What happened to her?
God's eye watches over you. Don't forget to bring us some olive oil from Spain.
Yes, Spain. Where are we going?
Okay.
Mother says she's booked us a trip to the Maldives.
Okay, okay! The Maldives are still beautiful.
And unclog your %pw as well.
I thought you would come back happy from your trip.
What really bothers me is why he took the kids with him?
Come on! Carry the bag.
What's wrong with them?
Why are you angry, Hajar!?
Go! May my Lord grant you health, you will tell me about my son's face.
Oh, my son! Why are you sad?
When I see the scales, I'll feel depressed.
He who troubles you, my son, may die.
Forget her, divorce her, divorce her.. Your father is rich and there are many girls.
Accompany me, and I know my son, what little thing disturbs him, why should he live troubled!
Oh son, call her and let her go.
May God curse her.
Say it to her three times.
You are divorced. Wait, wait, don't hang up, there are two more remaining.
Divorced, divorced.
Terrified
Oh! My son, calm down and don't worry, there are plenty of girls, as they say, oh! My son.
Oh, a problem.
Just because they saw you at the disco.
Call him, call him, I want to talk to him.
My mother... he divorced me a moment ago, saying: "You are divorced, divorced, divorced."
Why did he divorce you? He has no shame.
Now, if a girl goes to a nightclub, what will she do!
One if necessary %pw.
What's wrong! The world is upside down!
You'll see, I'll go to his house and mock him, and he won't know who you are?
I, I, my daughter is divorced from Abu Abdullah!
My daughter is divorced!
Your daughter is different.
You buy and sell them at Toys R Us stores.
You now feel the bad taste in your mouth for what you did to your daughter, and you are depressed.
They did nothing.
Divorce her if she does not bring you the apple peeled.
Divorce them however you like.
She is still married to a man.
Is this good for you, let him go to hell!
And count me as you have counted people.
What you would not accept for yourselves.
Do not accept it from people.
Do you know who owned the land of this mall previously?
And in a strategic location?
Trust in God.
And at a low price, too.
Out of the market
I must get Abu Sakr's approval.
Yes, I went to his office and didn't find him.
I visited his office last week and they told me he had traveled.
He has a meeting; come tomorrow or the day after. I'm out of the office, and the problem is I need to get Abu Sakr's approval. This is unavoidable.
Go to his office.
No, no, no, no, this is an official transaction.
The right place for that, God willing, is the office, not the house.
Does he eat as well?
What will this father eagle fill?
Everyone has a key.
Tell me, O Abu Fahd.
Do you know him?
I don't know him, I only see him on TV, and you told me that you meet him during Umrah.
But we don't know each other well.
Run with the criminals.
"O Lord, guide her, for she has come quickly to me, and at least ask her about the reason for this holiday."
There is no occasion for that. May God guide you.
The month is thirty days long, and he throws fifty feasts.
I suggest, O Saada Qadi of the Saada, that they include your name in the Guinness Book of World Records.
The best wedding planner in the world
Who's this guy with you?
Hello, this is a blessed time.
Your presence is an honor to us.
Easy, Abu Flah.
She says Abu Saqr throws a feast every day.
This is what we see.
But oh no! Abu Falha is hosting dinner tonight for a special occasion.
Today, may God protect you, my son Falcon.
God willing, he deserves it with pride.
He is here, welcome, my son.
Peace be upon you
Why?
In this regard, my son's falcon should visit the agency tomorrow and choose the car he likes.
I waited a year and a half for accreditation.
I retired from business.
But when I reached him
And I will give him the money.
"O Lord, guide Abu Sa'd."
Things won't go this way.
I told him "okay."
He has to go to the showroom and choose the car he likes.
We will buy three for him.
I will take you to him!
They took me to him.
You told me you met him during his Umrah pilgrimage last year.
Today, his younger son Shahin
His game was feasting.
This is your chance.
He passed by and congratulated him.
He deserves to be well, Sir!
%pw Shahin! Abu Sakr
Translation: God bless you, thank you people!
Praise be to God that Shahin is fine, my lord.
May God bless you.
On the other hand, who are you?
His Excellency
You didn't recognize me.
I can't lie to you.
Your Excellency, I was with you on the Umrah pilgrimage last year.
I remember you bought a red bead necklace.
May God bless you.
I was in the hospital.
Visiting a relative
It is an honor to meet you.
So are you still undecided, Sakr, about entering the field of trade, or have you made up your mind?
I'm fed up with him.
Why, my son Falcon, trade is wonderful!
You should start, open an office and then see.
Abu Sakr
Your Excellency, I beg you to say yes.
Why?
I have a gift of a falcon.
An entire generation
And if merchants love you and draw near to you, do not say no to them.
Who has everything available to them like you do today? Since you got the license, everything has come easily to you, a free car and the best office on the corniche.
Abu Abdul Aziz told your father yesterday that if Saqr wanted to enter the business, I would make him a partner with a 50% share.
Mom, how can I balance business and university?
Mama, don't force me to do something I don't like.
And you're lucky because agencies, offices, and cars are thrown at you for free.
Is there an opportunity, my son, to start a project without capital at this time?
Your only capital is the people's love for your father.
Invest it wisely.
Believe in me, my son, this is the opportunity of your life!
Rush and prepare lunch quickly.
He also reached the pickles and pepper.
He didn't leave anything, he didn't leave anything, I'm afraid he'll take the samosa agency.
Your son has a good appetite for work.
I was looking forward to seeing him. Do you know what he told me today?
He told me, "Mama, I want to expand my investments."
He wants to enter the Caribbean and invest in the islands there.
And may Allah protect him from the evil eye of the envious.
Abu Sultan told me yesterday that your son joined you in the business.
He has twenty agencies, six restaurants, and is a shareholder in two banks.
In
I think and know, and God knows best, that they haven't opened it yet.
Yes, that's the one in the northern area of our office, what's wrong with it?
No, but I love him.
Thank you and may God bless you, congratulations Abbas!
In the name of God.
May God watch over you all.
Don't be sorry now.
What are you saying, man! A whole year of misery and toil to set up the supermarket.
What's happening! I thought he passed by the store every day.
He saw him, so he sent me his secretary, whose name is Samer.
This is what Saqr, son of Abu Saqr, told me: He wants to be your partner instead of taking over the business from you.
Does he also want to be your partner?
"There is no power or might except by Allah."
Haven't you started talking to him?
He asked me, "Who are you, brother?"
I said business!
Why do you own an Iranian bakery?
When we were walking past the bakery, there was a small sign that read: "What's in a name?"
It was written "Neighborhood Bakery".
No, I want another name.
Peace be upon you too.
So how are things going at work for you?
Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, God willing, we will submit the workers' housing drawings to the Future Company.
No, no, Mr. Falcon, this is my wife Eliza. Let me introduce you to Mr. Falcon, the owner of the company.
Hello, how are you?
Take one of the company cars.
Thank you very much, you're very kind.
Even cooking now relies on science and study.
Today, if someone says they want to work in business, they have some money and want to invest it.
But he lacks sufficient knowledge, understanding, or expertise in economics, not to mention business.
Such a person
Do you think he will succeed? I don't think so, he will waste his time and lose.
Listen up, Abu Nasser!
Did you hear what these two parrots are saying?
What is this?
You have my son, Falcon.
Look at him.
Look at him today.
Your Excellency, we are not talking about your son, Saqr.
We're talking about the law.
Your son, Saqr, is what he is, God willing, and may he never be affected by the envy of others, except for one day.
Thank you, he's talking about the rule.
You scared me, my son Falcon is building himself by himself.
He once gave away a car.
He sold it and invested the money on his own advice.
"And what Allah intends for them is not injustice. Look at them how they wander in the land and say, 'Peace be upon us and upon the righteous servants of Allah.'"
Ah! Falcon, we are talking about ordinary people.
One of them was a falcon, and what Abu Nasser did with it was that he took it and put it on the road.
Saquar has business talents.
Strong economic features.
Who should we ask about his father?
I swear I'm confused.
God willing.
"Gulf Money Magazine in the Economic Referendum"
Please come in.
Peace be upon you, hello hello Salim.
What's wrong with him?
I swear I don't know what I'm saying. Oh! Salim.
Yes, I remember.
The story was true.
They say the company sent a fax to my father.
And they said to him
Poor him, he couldn't bear it.
As you see.
They said, "When he heard the news,"
He signed in the office and the fax is in his hand.
And He bestowed upon him much of His grace.
As they say, I taught him archery, and when he mastered it, he shot at me.
What did the doctor say?
Pray for him, O Saleem.
I was shocked.
I can't believe there's a people like them in this world.
A man who gives to the poor without his right hand knowing what his left hand spends.
The donations collected by this organization are distributed to Muslims across Asia and Africa.
But I would also like you to explain your goals and future steps, God willing.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Our goal at Saker for Charitable Works is to achieve solidarity within this nation.
In addition to sixty blankets for our brothers affected by the Pakistan earthquake.
Last but not least, we are now also supporting seven poor families.
With a monthly salary of only one hundred and thirty-two riyals.
We won't be late.
Then We will come to you swiftly.
Who is this beautiful girl?
This is Khalid and his wife; they are inviting us to the hotel tonight.
Yes, everywhere we are together, I am happy.
My love (I hope you stay safe for me)
Oh, my darling
This is not fair. This is my livelihood.
This bakery
And take the money for your interest.
Five riyals for falafel, and three riyals for hot bread.
Two chickpeas.
Five beans, two, two.
Cook six field beans!
Come on, divers!
The captain arrived and brought breakfast with him.
The job needs men.
Please be kind, sir.
So what's the matter?
No, no, what I'm asking for is to hear the word "yes" echoing in my ear.
Hello Nora
I'm angry with you.
Can I bear your sorrow?
So, what's happening?
Why are you angry?
Nora chose a simple, unadorned dress.
Don't say that Anoud will get angry.
Good heavens, Lebanese people speak with astonishing fluency.
And do not multiply talk with him.
I'm jealous of her, too.
The best dress for the most beautiful Nora.
He heaps praise on her, calling her a flower.
Your blood boils, when will it calm down?
I paid twenty thousand and twenty thousand riyals remain.
Congratulations, may it be a blessing!
May God be with you.
Hello, Ms. Umm Saleh
Hello Fadi, it seems you're busy, I don't want to delay you.
I am at your disposal.
Hello, hello.
Did you receive my text message yesterday?
Got it, you fool!
Did you like the joke?
Did you bring the design with you?
I didn't have time to do them, show me your designs and I'll choose from among them.
To be honest, you have a better taste.
They leave us, and envy begins its work.
When he realizes that my project is good and starts generating income.
They say he will carry out a project similar to mine.
Boutique for design and tailoring
Women's clothing
This is Abu Nasser who has nothing to do with trade.
There are banks.
He will hurt his relative.
That's how it is these days.
Yes, yes, my uncle's son.
Do you know that I was sleeping and they woke me up by saying your cousin wants you?
Everything is fine! Ask me anything!
Everything is alright, everything is alright.
Inshallah.
Don't you intend to work on any project, for example, like a costume?
Are you coming to find a partner or something similar?
I heard you were a designer, so I thought I should drop by.
Welcome.
If you need more, we'll give it to you.
Praise be to God, the work is going very well.
What should I do, Abu Saleh!
But we're too late, they hired him last week.
Yes, they did.
God willing, goodbye.
So be it.
Are you sure?
And with haute couture, do you know what the great disaster is!
What is this?
He rented a shop next to yours.
(Announcement) A wicked, envious sinner! (Announcement) A hateful, spiteful one!
Before you know it, the market is open to everyone.
You must know.
That her heart may be open to you, O son of my uncle.
I'm not coming to ask you.
You deny, lie, and mock me, and you said it to my face.
I wanted to work in secret.
To take that is the place beside us, you want to create chaos in my workplace.
But they didn't say come and be a pain next to my wisdom tooth, you're driving me crazy.
This is jealousy and hatred, I swear, I'll slap you. This is hatred, leave him alone.
Come, you relatives, ah! People?
Shame on you, Abu Saleh!
Leave me alone, I swear I'll hit you, you and your annoying voice!
I will defeat you as you defeated me by stealing my wealth.
Come on, welcome everyone!
Say, "May Allah's blessings and peace be upon him," O people of Arabia.
I swear, I swear, I didn't do anything.
He advised me to hire a designer from the Philippines.
Don't let anyone lie to you.
Why specifically Lebanese?
They talk to him playfully, joke, laugh, and feel very comfortable.
Therefore, Abu Saleh brought a Lebanese man.
He started teaching me some nice words and trying to convince me.
He bewitched me with his words.
He convinced me and pushed me to pay twelve thousand riyals.
And after two days, I went to the auction market and found the same cabinet, its twin, for nine hundred riyals.
And make money,
Bring in a Lebanese designer.
Can I meet with the gentleman? You told me yesterday that it was difficult to meet with him, and today it's difficult as well?
Yes, today is very difficult too.
I feel that Abu Saleh has changed lately.
What's wrong with him?
"Oh yes, I have no idea? What's wrong with you?"
Abu Saleh was very psychologically exhausted after his relative opened a shop and hired a Lebanese designer just like him.
The store has seen a decline in sales for the past two weeks.
This is the problem here in Qatar. No Qatari opens a store without another Qatari coming along and doing the same project, opening the same store right next to the first one. Can I go in there?
No, no, no, no, he is now with Fadi the designer thinking about a solution.
What should I do now?
Sitting as if we ate poison.
If we keep like this, I think we won't even make enough to cover the rent of the store.
A place far from them.
So we'll leave them the field.
And what is the discount percentage?
No way, why don't you offer an evening gown for free with every wedding dress?
There's no way to do that, let's go.
What went wrong? What's the matter? We're going to the store next to you, today they put an ad on every wedding dress they get with an evening dress for free plus a 25% discount.
Okay, go, go.
And now wait for two weeks, they will announce the same advertisement, buy a wedding dress and get an evening dress for free with a twenty-five percent discount.
They are fighting us.
I'm thinking the same thing, if we leave them they will destroy us.
Don't tire yourself out.
What else did he do?
So it's a real challenge.
Of course, this is a challenge.
Bravo, this troublemaker deserves it; he doesn't want anyone to earn their daily bread.
If it happens, you'll hear the news within two or three days, and I'll close his shop.
Very good.
Wait, wait, pick up the phone, pick it up, I'm coming to you now, goodbye.
What's up?
Saud says the shop is unbearable and no one can sit in it, and he doesn't know the source of that bad smell.
No, the smell has nothing to do with these air conditioners in any way.
It will smell in the store for at least six days.
Completely confident
He came at night.
He cuts the electrical wires from the store.
Is this fair?
Now you will sign an undertaking, or we will start legal proceedings and open a case file?
Don't do anything for him.
I will end his existence in this life.
Ah! Abu Nasser, something strange has happened. No one is coming to our shop.
Abu Nasser, hang up the phone, hang up quickly, a customer is coming in, I'll call you later, strange!
He is moaning in his bed.
He's in a bad mood, so I didn't tell him that the bank called about the installments.
Debts piled up on him because of his miserly companion.
What happened to him this time?
It would be evil enough for them if they mistakenly entered and saw Saad the determined, they would scream in his face and run away from him.
Asleep! Poor thing, he never closed his eyes, they are wide open, staring at the ceiling.
I don't know what he did to me.
Saud is in the store.
He bewitched him, I don't know what he did to him.
When women see him, they are afraid of him.
I don't know what's wrong with him!
He cost me, he cost me.
I have a lot of debts.
I'm afraid they'll imprison me.
And I have no evidence against him to sue him.
I don't know what he did. I don't know what he did.
Forget him, he deserves it.
Tell me what kind of magic you did to him; you've turned his designer into a monster, and women start to be afraid when they see him.
A popular rumor.
She's not doing well, people! Tell him the shooting team needs him urgently.
Oh people! May God bless you, may God protect you, tell him they urgently need him, urgently.
I swear to God they will raise my blood pressure, they will kill me, they will paralyze me. This is not fair, Mr. Abdullah.
I seek forgiveness from Allah, dear Ahmed. Do not be angry; you have a heart condition, and this is not good for you, my friend!
I swear I've called him repeatedly, my ear hurts, but he's ignoring me. These extra people are going to drive me crazy, they're going to drive me crazy.
You're not doing anything, I'm the one taking care of everything!
Listen to me, I'll fill your ears with boring talk.
Episode twenty-five, scene sixteen, Ahmed finishes.
So I'll stop filming because a background actor didn't show up.
What is this brilliant productive process?
I have nothing to do with this! Sir Abdullah, why are you shouting at me?
My love, if you don't want anyone to shout at you
What happened to you, Abdullah?
A late addition, and they are in trouble.
Ah! Ahmed, I don't need anyone, my darling.
Look for someone with a commanding presence who can convince people he's a genuine millionaire and billionaire, not just anyone.
Please, sir, come in and fire away, and your request will be ready in half an hour.
No one, Ala', no one, I was just explaining to him.
I'll manage with two scenes instead of one.
You are responsible, and as the production manager, you are accountable.
What are they doing now?
They will do everything, look at the manager as he twitches and makes a mess, but they will sort it out.
He needs someone with special qualities. Where do I find such a person now?
Are you serious?
Didn't you hear what the manager said?
I know someone, may Allah help you with him, and I hope he is suitable.
% A B S A'arar Shaiyik
Saud Qanous! I remember him as Saud al-Qanous.
Yes, when he was young, they called him Saud al-Shuraf, and when he grew older, they called him "old man."
Why the cans?
I'll tell you the reason. He's miserable, wandering the streets collecting cans and selling them by the kilogram.
Ah! My brother, blessed with fortune and honor.
His appearance was presentable. As I remember, he was stocky and had a full face, neither tall nor fat.
Are you sure it's appropriate?
Insha'Allah, but you have to do a good makeup for him and I guarantee you that he will be suitable and also funny.
Okay, what are you waiting for? Call him!
I don't have his number.
I'll take Amer with me and go to him.
Where is Saud Kanz's house located?
What is he saying?
Be quiet, be quiet.
Saudi cans
There is no one in our neighborhood named Saud Kansa.
Yes, I'm sure he's from this area, but I forgot which house.
This house belongs to a person named Saud and he lives with his mother.
Yes, that's correct.
But this is not Saudi cans.
This is Saud's laptop.
Certainly it is, but it evolves over time because the laptop is like a box.
He is tall and fat with a slightly tanned skin.
He cancelled the cans and started collecting old laptops. Come on, come on, come on, man.
He went to the vegetable market to buy them for me. Am I a goat? Where are the others?
I don't know, my son.
This is what you always wear.
I have another one, where is the other ghutrah? Where is it?
Eid
This is what I'm looking for.

Use the iron a bit on this shirt before you wear it, it's wrinkled.
But I've been feeling worse lately.
Mom, may God guide you, I've been insisting since yesterday that you go to the emergency room, but you're refusing.
Yes, Mom, they said they would pay me.
Thank God you're working now instead of being unemployed.
Okay, Mom, goodbye.
You'll argue with her, get angry, and go upstairs.
You sit and move slowly, and the camera slowly moves with you, it will move beside you.
Yes. Jaber! Yes.
Whose laptop is this?
What slavery is this, he is a very famous actor, Abdullah Al-Lama'.
That's for you, but I'm %pw's son. How are you, Abuud?
How are you, Abd?
Imagine your mother's sanctity; you should behave a little respectfully in front of people.
Yes, we're from the same neighborhood.
Calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, be quiet, be quiet.
I love acting, I hope they give me a role where I can slap you.
She's not what you think, brother!
She is very sick, do you know she didn't sleep last night, my brother!
Asthma, my brother, may God heal you.
I ask God to heal her.
Your life is just like a basket of cherries.
Oh! My Lord! Oh! My Lord!
Does he have a cough medicine for my mother?
He is a director, not a doctor.
Look at you... Listen to what he's saying... He's not making any sense at all.
What is his mother's name?
He spat on you, what do you think?
You heard what she said about you.
You say you're trivial, you should be more serious.
Give me, give him, give him, give him, give him half a million to fix my flat car tires.
And give him three million to bring me dinner.
I was wondering why you're talking like this.
Because I am reasonable and at the request of some people.
Watch Mr. Ghafel, a neighborhood production, with a high level of actors.
Now excellent, he is suitable for the role.
Excellent, I'll help you, I don't have a sense of that, do I?
Did your family buy this?
Your life is just like a basket of cherries.
Take the gentleman to the dressing room, apply makeup to him, and I will ask Salman to bring you the costume and come to you.
Go, go, go, this is great!
Alright, alright.
Listen, brother, leave the car with us until we finish shooting. I'll call you when you can come and get it.
Doesn't matter, but is there any helper who can travel with me?
For picking you up! No problem, I'll ask our driver to pick you up. Okay, thank you, brother, thank you, thank you, wait a minute.
Alright, call your extra friend, call him.
People, call the laptop from the makeup room Saud!
Let him clean my teeth, then.
It's already written in front of me.
Shall we review what we've mentioned before?
This means I!
I didn't expect that from you.
Fighting for what?
We will fight for our rights.
Yes, wait.
And you have to know who you're talking to, Abu Abdulaziz.
Why did you divorce her, brother?
He divorced her, period.
And we do not marry her to the son of a thief.
There is no need, what do you think?
He will clean it, but later. The important thing is to get ready because you are going to enter the fitting room to change your clothes and we are ready to shoot.
My teeth, the toothpaste is expensive.
Oh people! The shooting of this scene has been postponed.
Why this?
I don't need tea, brother. I'm upset and my stomach is bloated from tea. What's this? I've been waiting for an hour, and I'll wait until he comes.
You haven't seen anything yet, it's very common.
May God bless you with health and well-being.
They are fast.
Thank you, may God protect you.
Convey my greetings to your people.
Tell them Abu Abdulaziz sends his regards.
Alright, sir %PW.
Wasn't it enjoyable?
Someone like you greets you and kisses your nose like that.
The first time someone kissed my nose.
How do they kiss them on the nose?
This is a problem.
His nose is like an ice cream cone, it cuts your lips. That was funny, that was cute.
You didn't laugh!
Do not mention him.
Can I be an actor?
What's wrong? What's with your voice?
Oh my son, oh my son, I am very ill, I am waiting for you.
Come quickly.
Hello Sheikh, hello.
Look there or here for yourself, man!
Listen to me!
Alright, go now.
I see a lot of respect.
What happened, my son!
Peace be upon you, what's wrong with you, my lord?
Leave, leave, leave, leave
Don't bother, God willing it will be, Dr. Hassan come, come here.
Yes, oh! What happened, Dr. Hany?
Let your honor rest in the office.
Don't worry.
She is the mother of all, God willing, she will be fine.
Hello, welcome, kind sir, you are welcome.
Keep silent, or someone will break the silence.
Here my name is Abu Abdelaziz.
Call me, sir.
How are you, sir?
May God curse you.
Yes, sir.
Welcome, sir. Please have a seat.
Divine providence watches over you.
With this ugly face
Go with him, Abu Rashid!
I swear I haven't done anything to you. Tell me, and you'll see my business with him.
Oh! Comrade, can I find a doctor quickly?!
Doctor, my mother is sick!
Wait in line, your turn will come.
Listen to me!
Can I ask you, my friend?
Oh my son, quickly, I am sick!
You go to the hospital too often, you take your mother every week, you haven't found any of them, they are good and accept anything.
In contrast to female citizens.
And don't forget the female citizens.
Alright, then look for a wife in the hospital.
I like her.
But, my brother, she's ignoring me!
Alright, try to be close to her, smile at her, give her admiring looks, give her your number with pure intentions.
No hay problema, moreno, moreno, moreno.
Follow the rules.
Get out, get out, if you don't leave I'll call security to teach you a lesson.
No, no, I don't want anything.
Sir, you need to drink.
Listeria, please.
No, thank you, I don't want any.
You can take her and leave the hospital.
The one speaking to you is Falih Al-Marzouz.
You will marry him.
No, no, I need the cash, the clothes, and I also want to rent the car from you.
I will give you your money.
No, no, no, wait.
Shall we go?
What is this %PW value?
Welcome, welcome again and again.
The light of my eyes signed his marriage contract yesterday.
I wish you had come.
They were surprised by what I did for them; it was a very elegant and private party.
One is regular and the other is diet.
Now you have no excuse.
What is this?
Mama promised my friends to meet them after tomorrow at work.
Will you take this for them!
Yes, what's wrong?
Noor, come here!
What is this?
He will take this matter to his friends, to cause a scandal.
Don't think about taking it, everyone will talk about you.
Give me the money, tomorrow I'll buy you something nice.
Yes, but I've already promised them.
I'll pick it up tomorrow.
Don't worry, they're still open. Go change your clothes so we can get something that everyone will like.
What's wrong with you! Come on.
His price is considered reasonable, and its quality is excellent.
Above average, not the best!
Of course there's premium chocolate, but I thought you were looking for a good price.
This is very expensive. Why are you looking for the most expensive one?
That's unbelievable, look at this artistic fingerprint.
This is called royal chocolate.
The same chocolate that was always requested at the Spanish court
Give me this one.
Congratulations, and by the way, it comes with a warranty.
Welcome, welcome, welcome, a smile!
Come here, brother, give us some of this chocolate, brother.
What's the occasion, man?!
No, Saleh Abdul Qader, the one in accounts.
By the blessing of God, he deserves it, give me another one.
And hurry with the coffee.
Auntie, did you attend their wedding party?
Yes, dear, I went to their wedding, it was embarrassing and disgusting. Don't believe it, sister!
Did you hear your aunt's words?
That's why I want to give you an unparalleled wedding party.
You have no time, you only have one and a half months.
I will arrange everything.
But he doesn't let me do anything.
You don't live in the community, so you don't see how people spend everything they have on their weddings.
And you have seen with your own eyes.
When you bought something beautiful, they praised you and your taste.
Didn't they tell you she's amazing and wonderful?
True, but how much did we pay?
The money we paid for the chocolate could buy four sheep for the wedding.
Don't interfere, your mother knows how to do everything, just give her the money and that's it.
This means they'll accept whatever we choose.
Oh peace, your taste is truly terrible.
What do you think about this stage?
But the privilege costs a lot of money.
Oh, the past was sweet!
What do you think about this?
The team of innovators from the Qatar Small Innovator Competition collaborated with the stage designer to create a theater shaped like a computer mouse.
Excuse me for one minute.
Look, they talked about everything except the stage and the arrangements. This is where the women who have nothing but gossip will stay. Just be quiet.
The man is waiting for us.
We will go to the mouse stage.
A very strange phase.
Latest model in 2011
We've already chosen the mouse.
You can sit aside, all this is for your own good.
So you have to choose, if your choice is Noah's Ark, you will have to pay an additional twenty thousand, but if your choice is the mouse, you will pay one hundred and twenty-five thousand.
Decide and we're ready.
You're not the first one to get married.
What do you think of yourself, are you going to get married in the Comoros? That's how things are done in our country.
We're just at the beginning, too.
If you don't need a stage, where will you put the bride? In a box?
Iron, paint, and wood.
And the people are happy.
They exploit us and lie to us; they are really thieves.
So what's bothering you now?
Angry and upset?
If you don't want to get married, that's fine.
I'll speak to the bride's mother and tell her that Saleh is in a very critical condition.
Does he want to get married? Can he afford to get married? I have no objection. Do you want me to call her? I'm serious, I'll make the call.
We received a bouquet of flowers from the Netherlands.
In my opinion, if you place them on the wedding tables.
Are you sure this is your first time in Doha?
Likewise the Middle East!
Put it on the bill.
How much will it increase?
One hundred seventy-two, alright then.
But Samir, I don't want to see this group at any wedding.
You know people's chatter.
Alright, it's booked.
Your salary is higher than mine.
A problem we can't handle will start.
May God help you, Saleh.
But God guides you, you should have tried to reconcile with them.
For me, Alhamdulillah, I have decided to look for a wife from any Arab country.
They say that the cost of a wedding there does not exceed two thousand dollars, and you can enjoy the celebration.
May God bless you, my dear.
God willing, his wedding will be next month.
You just need to decide how many cards you want and let me know.
If the invitations are sufficient, that's good, but most importantly, people need to know they're invited, where and when, and that's it.
All that matters is that you're happy, don't care about what others will say.
People know the wedding topic from the invitations.
Tomorrow when they see these invitations, I know what the ladies will say.
Look at their wedding, if those are their invitations, no one has seen the invitations of so-and-so and so-and-so.
We didn't say such a thing, we'll order it online.
Its cover is made of a fabric that resembles the skin of a peach, with a shiny silver sheen.
No one can blame you, and you can't stop me.
I won't be the ladies' hot topic, we'll request the invitation cards, means we'll request the invitation cards!
May God grant you patience, man!
Poor him, his family must have put enormous pressure on him.
Dude! He's begging for money from everyone.
What do you say, he sold his car after all.
He looks twenty years older, this morning I saw him talking to himself.
Don't blame him, brother. His bad luck is enough for him. I don't know when we will evolve.
Close the door, please.
Pardon me, brother!
Did you try to convince them to have a wedding within your budget?
What do you mean by "within my budget"?
Why do I live alone?
The problem our society suffers from is the illness of pretension, boasting, and flaunting appearances.
It forces you to be sick with the same illness.
If you want to live in it.
Omit pointed to the bride's mother.
She attacked me with her witty remarks.
Trust in God.
By the way, tell me,
How did you get married?
I'm not crazy to get married.
Even if you decide, my brother, to get married,
I will consider marrying a foreigner or even an Arab woman.
He said, "It's your country!"
We decided to bring a DJ for the songs.
But because Nasser's mother brought a well-known singer to her son's wedding party.
He is a very famous singer, but I forgot his name.
Why are you so annoyed?
It seems you don't like what I'm doing!
It is enough that he sold his car, and every day one of his friends gives him a ride.
I entered the room before and found him talking to himself.
I saw, now you've changed your mind.
Mom, let him be. My brother is tired.
It doesn't matter to either of us.
I am not less than people.
Do not make us a joke.
Please, Mother! This is enough; my brother has spent everything he has and taken money from everyone.
Please be quiet.
New demands for the party, and my brother said, "I have no money," so she screamed in his face, saying, "Then I'll cancel the party, I don't want to get married."
Where is she now?
She is inside and they are giving her first aid.
He said she was much better now, and we would find a room for her at the hospital.
What a scandal!
Relax, sister!
The doctor told you to stay still and gave you an injection to make you sleep.
How can I relax when he wants to joke with us through thick and thin?
I was telling him to bring Abdullah Roishd, and he said to me, "I don't have any money."
Your sincere apology is appreciated.
Take care of her.
Go to her, go and kiss her head.
And tell her that I will do what you want.
I'll get Abdullah Roaished for you.
Abu Yusuf is kind, and I don't think he won't help me.
What's equal... Did you find anyone other than Abu Youssef?
What's wrong with him?
You're crazy, Saleh!
But the minister kept him because he was an old man, and more importantly, he was disciplined and honest.
Do you want my opinion? If you tell him the same thing you told me, there's a good chance his heart will stop.
Yes, I did.
That's because of the financial crisis you're going through, and you want to ask Abu Youssef for some money, of course from the ministry's funds.
And only Allah knows when you will return it to Him.
And when the accountants came to him and asked him about the money,
Of course, he might face troubles.
I am a monster. I am a monster. I am a monster. I am a monster.
Here's the thing, the man is in his office and you're responsible if anything happens to him.
I am stealing in my last days!
My uncles don't call it stealing.
In the beginning, a staircase.
Come back, come back with the white box wrapped in blue ribbon, inside of which is a circle drawing of a dove's wing.
So, Uncle Abu Yusuf, I am who I am, if I didn't have difficulties,
I'll pay it all back.
They call me Abu Yusuf.
You came in my latter days.
Corrupt me, O Thursday.
Salih, Salih.
Alright, listen to what I'm saying, if it were someone else, they would have been beaten or something unpleasant would have happened to them! Oh! Oh! Oh! Khalid.
Salih, Salih.
All the methods I've tried are useless, Uncle Abu Youssef, I'm drowning.
I can't undo the marriage.
And you know them, they are all bald.
What's wrong with you?
No, no, the other one, the panic pill, the panic pill.
In the morning, in the morning.
Uncle Abu Youssef, the stairs are full of medicine pills, which one do you need?
The box with the picture of a frightened man on it.
We've already booked two rooms for hair and makeup, just for us.
And we'll be there from tomorrow.
We brought Abdullah Roayshid and his band.
You will see, my dear.
No, I won't tell you.
This will be the hit of the season.
We were the first in the world to use it.
Mmm mmm
Goodbye.
There is no god but God.
My son, don't forget to read the Mu'awwadat when you enter the dance hall.
The women here have fiery eyes.
I told you before, it's amazing.
The best groom ever, may God preserve you, I don't want to envy you.
Mmm mmm, the police are knocking on the door.
I was wrong to obey you, O God.
That's not fair, today is my wedding day.
Those who insisted on the contest came.
And now solve it, for I will be imprisoned, O Lord.
Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf!
It's still early.
But this is injustice if this happens!
The giant offered a contract for three million, two million of which is just for equipment.
Wrote a memo to the minister.
We knew there was corruption, but it doesn't reach this extent.
It seems you don't live in this world.
Tell me, what did the minister say to Uthman?
And why didn't our president object? They say he was with him!
I know nothing about it, I swear I don't know him.
Where is morality?
Truth has become falsehood and falsehood has become truth!
Oh! Saad, are you sure the minister has sacked him? Oh! My God, what has happened to the world?
He just fired him!
What else?
It is owned by the minister's sister.
This girl is having an affair with the minister.
What a strange world!
What happened to you? Didn't you recognize her?
This is the new employee whom the minister appointed in place of the unfortunate Uthman.
Go, go, go.
What do you want me to do, Saleh!? I object to the minister.
Are you crazy!
Listen to me, man.
We have children, we want to live.
We want to live.
What happened?
He is standing next to the elevator.
This is the reward of honesty and integrity, brother Saleh!
I hope we can do something for you, brother!
Praise be to God, praise be to God for everything.
What's wrong with you, Saleh?
These are among the strange things we see before us in this world.
We see things unconfined.
I'm at your disposal.
I want you to stop by the supermarket after work to buy some vegetables for the salad.
I'll try, okay, awesome. Goodbye.
Who's driving my sister home?
She was sitting in the front, laughing and chattering. Who was she?
This is my university colleague. What's wrong with him driving me home? It's normal.
Oh my god, I can't believe it, why do you look like you're from ancient times!
What are you saying?
Did I hear what you were saying?
You are retrograde.
No global, global, global, global!
Truth remains truth and falsehood remains falsehood.
Life has evolved, and we live in the age of technology.
The era of international variables that suits the world and no one keeps up with it.
The more you live, the more you see!
Don't blame me, Munira! My nervousness and anger are against my nature.
This is what he sees in his day.
Tell her that he apologizes.
Life doesn't go the right way.
Don't be sad, let's go eat.
Let me sleep to rest.
The president is not angry with you.
Is the president not angry?
No, he's not angry, go wash your face and have lunch.
Present, my dear.
I'm really looking forward to meeting you on my first day of work.
Your presence is an honor to us.
Of course, of course.
Of course I know that you don't need anyone to remind you of the principles of the work.
On the contrary, at the very same time, it is a matter of the utmost importance.
To remind you of some of the values and principles you work for.
For general information.
This is what your honor should be.
We all have to.
The division by lot is of the utmost importance, sir.
Let them be thieves.
Thank you all.
What I also want to say
And I warn you of my first day at work,
There is an employee among you.
Whoever is trustworthy, truthful, sincere, and free from these evil deeds,
Just thank you.
There is a loyal employee.
Let's take the necessary legal action against him in our ministry.
No, it won't be as you wish, sir.
Praise be to God, we are all thieves.
As you wish, sir, I'll say it in front of my colleagues and after them.
Where is Khalid?
Yes, sir.
Khaled, you were highly praised, may God reward you with good.
All right, sir.
Ah! Sir, you know how to choose.
Perhaps Allah will guide you.
Why did you let the devil control you as he pleased?
Thank God it was only about honesty.
Mama, why is my father imprisoned?
Keep quiet, girl!
No, no, I won't do it again.
Mama, why does Daddy spend time in prison?
Stop that.
It means he became trustworthy.
I can't say your father is honest.
Costumes!?
It covers your whole body.
What will people see?
And it would be better if you were looking for a job, as no one will hire you in your current state.
Is there a respectable woman who covers her body and beauty?
She covers her chest, dresses like this, chokes herself.
I am fed up with it, my son.
And I bought her a shirt and pants that revealed her midriff above her navel.
It's a hopeless situation; she doesn't want to take the right path.
There you go!
You will blame yourself alone.
To ask for the hand of your daughter Sarah for our son Rashid.
Only one of us is looking for a suitable groom for her daughter these days.
I will tell you, my son Rashid.
He is a very kind man.
What never leaves.
He's drunk twenty-four hours a day.
Drunk, reckless, and continually intoxicated throughout the day.
And do not ask about barter.
He is brought up on virtue.
And let me tell you also that he is a hypocrite.
And how is theft?
This is what I expect from you... And how are the drugs?
It's clearly over. I'll give you five riyals if you can find his pupils, I bet you can't.
"That's right, Abu Sara! .. We came just to ask you for it."
Know fun and gathering.
We learned that she came from a noble family.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. May Allah bless you, my son. May His blessings be upon you. This is how life proceeds with its blessings.
I'm drunk.
I can't walk.
Alright, come on.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Goodbye.
Done, call your father to come and pick you up.
Why should I talk to him?
Let him come and take you.
Where is he?
Look, he's over there, with his tribe and accompanied by a blonde girl.
May Allah grant that your father walks straight, and he is enjoying it.
Hello, my dear daughter Mona!
Majid! His name is Abdulaziz.
Yes, that's correct.
My daughter, you've confused me.
And you know that since the establishment of the State of Palestine with its capital in Jenin in the year two thousand and ninety, after signing a comprehensive peace agreement with the State of Israel,
And Israel continues to practice terrorism, pressure, and siege against it.
The latest being the claims raised by the Israelis and their Arab friends against the Palestinians.
They smuggle plastic knives through the tunnels.
Especially Article Two, Paragraph A, which states that the Palestinian people should cut their nails every day.
Now we move on to the fateful meeting.
A miserly man.
When Israel agrees to the establishment of a Palestinian state,
Hey! What are you saying, man?! Man, you're ruining our reputation, leave me alone!
Please!
Sorry, Mr. Tiger, sorry, Mr. President.
Can you give me a chance to speak?
We fully committed to the comprehensive international agreement.
What does the Israeli representative say?
To find anything tangible, a stone or plastic as a commitment
Ah! Man, even our houses.
What do you call it, people of the Gulf?
In all of Palestine, everything is made of wood.
American companies are making wooden cars for us according to the agreement.
And all the doors of our houses are made of thermally treated wood.
We don't need speeches.
Don't change the subject.
Mr. President,
It is a very important point and it deserves to be voted on because growing nails during this period constitutes a violation of the agreement.
If you agree, raise your hand.
However, I had a very strange dream.
To control the students.
I lost interest in telling him.
Tomorrow you will start your work at the fourth school.
Because I asserted my strong personality from the beginning as a teacher.
The young men followed him and tore his clothes, but he did nothing.
How many times has he come to me without a headscarf.
The school principal told me.
Rashid is kind and we don't want to fire him.
The boys throw chalk at him.
And they drag his tribe in the schoolyard in front of everyone.
They said that this teacher is very lazy and will ruin everything.
Tell them the story of ketchup?
Come here, Mary.
What's the story with ketchup? That's new, no one told me!
They poured an entire bottle of ketchup on the chair.
He came and sat down.
He didn't know anything.
He didn't feel embarrassed until he saw the children laughing at him in the schoolyard.
Stop that.
Tomorrow, your manager whom you will be working with will call you.
But, never mind, we'll give him a chance.
For I am waiting to tell you
The era of kindness and weakness is over.
Ah! O father of Abdullah, Ah! O cousin!
You will see a different Rashid.
And there is no need to remind you of the important educational wisdom.
You are an education graduate and I am an education graduate.
And we all know this saying,
The teacher is the first child of the class.
You will watch the strong man Mr. Rashid.
And if anyone makes a mistake,
He will be in great distress.
When you start talking, he just told her to shut up.
You'll see what I'll say to him.
Who among you mocked me and said just shut up? Who?
You're the one who told me to just shut up!
No, not me.
The one next to you, it's you!
Jump and go to the school principal.
And tell him that Mr. Rashid let me out.
I don't want to see your face here, did you hear me!
What do you think about my anxiety?
You should be just as enthusiastic as on your first day, indeed you should be throughout the whole year.
Know the consequences.
If you hear someone's voice
I explain or speak.
You know what that means.
Tension, do you know what the word tension means?
Means tension.
Did you hear what I said or not?
I heard him too.
Get out of the class.
Go to the school principal.
Take your things and leave now!
Take your things.
I don't care.
It is clear that he is still looking for it.
No, sir, we didn't see him.
Thoughts, ice cream with milk, and if it has a scoop of ice cream from the side, it's very delicious.
My dear friend Abdurrahman
Everyone makes mistakes, and man is fallible.
I'm just kidding with you, son.
But the most important thing is that your father doesn't know the story!
What I want is the chocolate in my bag.
Where is your bag? Where is your bag? Where is your bag?
In the classroom.
I'm at your disposal.
She says she's happy with you.
You don't know how to distinguish between a rich boy and a common boy.
Is sharbark, sharbark possible to be green or red?
Come here, where are you going?
In the bathroom.
Are you still in the bathroom?
Knock on the door quickly and tell him that the first class started half an hour ago, quickly.
I was before them all, one juice and one chip.
I took it before them all, I bothered them. My friend Abdulrahman, and by the way, this is very healthy.
Alright, go to Saud now and get the PlayStation CD from him.
So what did we learn from this story?
That man
He must have moral principles.
He also told me to bring the PlayStation once.
Do you want anything else, my friend Abdulrahman, my friend?
Nothing at the moment.
We learn for the story.
You all know that I'm leaving this week because my graduate school acceptance has been confirmed.
So I thought I had to hand in the event file before my trip.
How can I pick you up this afternoon? Abdurrahman told me but I'm not sure where he wants us to go, and he didn't tell me what time he wants to leave!
As long as his father came back and didn't say anything, praise be to God that you guaranteed and reassured him.
We said what you took this afternoon, and tomorrow he's upset and tells his father: No, no, no, a disaster, no, no.
Hello, my friend Abdul Rahman
May God help you.
What must be done, is orders.
Do you love him like this?
Today, oh students, we will explore a new resource in the realm of knowledge.
Peace be upon you too.
Thank you.
I need water.
Whatever you ask, whatever you inquire about, I am at your service.
Teacher, teacher, how can you ask the teacher for water?
Is there any teacher who brings water for the student? Are you his personal servant? This will not be overlooked, I will note it in the report.
And you also mock me.
Don't raise your voice or shout at me, do you hear me or not?
How many does this serve?
Okay, how many cars is this for?
4 to 5 cars
Excellent, this is excellent, wonderful, excellent.
What is he doing?
As you can see, he will be parking in front of our houses at the expense of our comfort.
Don't tell me about the days of Abu Nasser.
Abu Nasser is finished.
He studies abroad.
Good, you broke the table.
Don't get tense, brother.
Why?
Are you different?
Change your behavior towards me.
Me or you?
We didn't say anything. Oh, brother!
What is this?
Listen, leave everything as it is, it's better for you.
I am not threatening you, brother!
What do you mean by "there's no need" and "I want to ease your burden"?
What are you saying?
What do they call it?
It seems you want that thing.
You want this, as you like.
Faster, faster.
Is this good?
That's not right, it's not fair!
What the whole neighborhood owns.
Coming to Uncle Naif for discussion, *not* for shouting.
Who is this Rashid who does as he pleases in the neighborhood?
Did you give me a chance to speak?
Listen, people, be quiet and listen to our uncle Abu Nayef's words.
Now, this good-for-nothing is playing with your nerves!
I'll take care of it.
If I hadn't slapped him in the face, he would have clung to the umbrella he made.
The game is played by its players.
Is this good?
Goodbye
You haven't seen anything yet.
Do you know he now has a jewelry store!
That's why I see her here wearing all these rings and chains.
May God compensate us.
Just walk, will you stay in the heat?
I can't believe that Rashid, that simple, poor young man, has become like this.
He became the deputy director of the Global Education Center.
Tell him he teaches you, tell him he instructs you. You are a teacher and he is a teacher, but look where he is now and where you are now.
Don't mention her.
Never mention her, Abdullah!
I'll tell you what the secret is.
The professor came, the professor came.
Teacher, I didn't do anything!
Teacher, don't you know who he is?
Yes, dear, I know who he is.
This is what I tell you, we won't get a good chance like this.
I'm looking for a job! This is funny, I swear this is funny.
There's no brother, the job is in the crotch of my pants.
Thank you for everything you've done, thank you very much.
Convey my greetings to him.
Your mother sends her greetings, may God protect you, I will convey his greetings to her.
In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate. Farewell, my beloved. May God protect you.
What more do you want? Your brother is going to become a minister, can you believe it, my son!
Oh, our mother! We will work, we will work to a high degree.
And as for you, my son, if you work with him, won't something be said?
He's just giving it to you like that.
Is this thing right, isn't it?
Alright! This is automatic, without a shadow of a doubt.
So, my darling, please make my dream come true.
Before your dream, my dream.
It will be among the Corniche Towers.
Come on, let's go! What are you waiting for!
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You can do it, Abu Saleh.
It seems your friend is angry.
It never seems like wow! Oh brother.
You can do it, Abu Saleh.
Do you think he stood up, took the phone, and gave it to Abu Saleh?
Look, there's something Abu Sultan is hiding, and I'm 100% sure he harbors ill will towards him.
His relationship with Abu Saleh is not good.
No, Abu Sultan won't do that unless he intends to do something else.
Is it really that bad?
Open the car door for him!
Finally, he works on opening the minister's car doors.
Ah! My son, don't break my heart, don't break my heart.
For your information, all the stories we hear in cafes take place in the country.
But I can't believe what I'm hearing!
My heart stopped, my heart stopped.
"My fear, my daughter, is that women will start talking about it. Don't mention it to Lutf, the page collector, for she spreads rumors about me among the women, my daughter!"
Say something, Abu Sultan, speak. I am struck dumb, I will perish.
I know what I'm doing.
"What do you care about this matter?"
Manira, I'm playing it cool.
By opening the door for him, this is the beginning of the plan in my head.
I deserve to be a minister, not him.
So I must work, for I have a plane to catch.
So that an order may be issued to them to expel him.
Yes, a plan.
Trust me from the beginning.
They said we appointed him as a minister because he was appointed two months before me.
I'm quite sure he'll be fired from his job.
Magic can be undone.
What is this?
What is this too?
And at every event he attends, the photographer takes many pictures of him until his photo becomes very common in the newspaper.
And it continues to fizz until it floats on the surface.
Are you sure?
Just wait... Let me deal with him and you'll see.
On the contrary, sir.
Certainly, Your Highness.
So tell me,
Did you thank him for the lamb? By the way, the meat was very delicious.
The man is outside, go and see him.
Don't be foolish, people want you to be respected and you want to humiliate yourself.
Only the minister, come in, come in.
No, no, no, please don't take my picture. Only take a picture of His Excellency the Minister, one picture, one picture, Your Excellency.
Take another one as well.
Ah! Brother, I love this plan of yours.
I want you to take it to him.
Pictures, pictures, pictures.
Yes, he is a minister, he has that too.
Alright, I'll tell you, wait!
Go to the second-to-last page.
Look how big his picture is with the groom.
Say: "There is no god but Allah."
Yes, one or two pictures every day.
As you say, he is a social activist, alright, alright, goodbye.
Everyone loves you, but I don't know what's wrong with you.
He is everywhere.
Envious, they envy you. Only the fruitful tree is pelted with stones.
Take me to the market!
Aren't you ready?
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you and God's mercy, hello.
You are very famous.
Yes, your name is Abdulaziz Abdullah, isn't it?
This is my husband.
How many times have I told you?
Three hundred and fifty
This famous person
You're home today, what happened?
Leave me alone today, I have a headache, my head hurts, I feel pain all over my body and my colon pain is getting worse.
I'm tired, so tired... I've been running around with him for a month.
Today I want to rest.
Hello, Umm Sultan.
Can I say something?
Ah! Woman, I just want him to take me.
You liked the matter.
I've seen with my own eyes the trappings of fame!
I know. Thank God you're convinced.
Be honest.
Your minister is anxious, it appears he is delighted by this news.
I will send you my brother Saad.
No, I didn't follow any activity and I didn't read the newspaper, I don't know.
We are at your service, goodbye.
If God wants to destroy an ant, He gives it wings.
Peace be upon you, do you have a conference here at the hotel tonight?
Wedding procession?
Don't you have any events like a party, birthday, or wedding?
I don't know, but you can see the hotel behind us.
Ah, there's a hotel behind you, right?
Is it okay if I leave you in the car and go into the hotel to ask?
Go, go, go and take your time. Go and ask, go.
May God help everyone.
Does this minister allow us to sleep or rest?
It means he couldn't find any occasion for him, no party or wedding, or any issue to insert his name into.
He took him to the Sixteen Thousand Hotel and couldn't find anything for him. He has bad luck, just like his face.
Just shut up, hello.
You didn't find his birthday, nor a dot.
Go, you might catch the second leg!
In every issue, he has a hundred pictures.
He doesn't sleep! And he doesn't get tired, my brother.
Ah! Man, the editor-in-chief says the priority is to set up his picture, then make the newspaper.
She said my children participated in a drawing competition to depict your husband the minister.
How many pictures of the minister are in the newspaper?
The winner wins a prize.
The story isn't like that. You should come to the cafe and listen to the daily comments about his pictures in the newspaper. It's endless gossip.
Wow, his death is very imminent.
As they say, when God wants to end a butterfly's life, it draws near to the light.
People greet him and leave you.
He became one of the most famous people in the country.
Don't mention him. Who is he?
You insulted me.
God bless you and her.
She said that all of us got married except poor Amal; she is the only one among us who didn't get married.
This is my fate.
This is not up to me to get married.
And forget about marriage.
"Allah is sufficient as a Guardian, and He is the Most High."
Do you see the spoiled ones sitting over there?
Yes, what's wrong with them?
Do you see the one playing with his hair?
Is this a boy or a girl?
After my father's death, I mean they killed him.
You saw him grow up, didn't you?
It's not right to leave him attached to the maid.
Go and make some tea.
Talking to my mother is annoying. But she doesn't have one servant, but two.
I've told you a hundred times not to interfere. Khalid is my son, not yours.
Your only problem is Khalid and the maids, the maids and Khalid.
Mama, this is not good, Khalid spends all her time with the maid and doesn't want anyone else.
Get out. I want to rest, I want to sleep. How?
Oh God, Saud, your sister Khalid has become a girl.
Wait a minute, I haven't told my father about you yet.
I'll tell you something, what's up with Khalid?
Saud says Khalid wears makeup and acts like girls. What's wrong with them? What's wrong with them?
Alas, alas, alas! Oh, Saud!
Khalud puts makeup on his face! Just a little bit of makeup. A child saw a makeup palette and played with it.
I saw a very small spot, barely visible even.
He is kind, good, and gentle.
I will scold Saud.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
The last time I asked you, Saad, what you want to be when you grow up, you didn't tell me. Tell me now, when you grow up, what do you want to be?
And you, my dear Khaldi, what do you want to be, Saad?
This year, we will go to London just like last year.
Yes, contact the Rufa'a in Bahrain.
Tell him to bring Susan, Kholood, and Fahda.
And say, "Peace be upon Sumra."
I seek forgiveness from Allah.
Today, my father ordered me to choose.
Do you want me to build the land overlooking the sea or the nearby land?
I said I don't want to choose.
I can live with you, my love, anywhere.
Thank you, my love.
And you taught me how to fish?
Wow! Amals, I want to open my eyes and find that you've graduated from university.
It doesn't seem to be a men's perfume.
I don't know, but it smells really strange.
Oh Lord, what's wrong with me?
Your speech has become feminine.
I forgot you were a man.
I wish you would talk to people like this outside as well.
I never believe her! Oh, Khalid!
Get out of my room!
Alas, Khalid!
You disappointed me.
Come, don't hurt my feelings, I swear I'll tell my mom.
This is my son, and I know him well.
Alas, Khalid, my light, I wish all children had your warmth and sensitivity.
And when you see a gentle and quiet person, you say he is gay.
Shame on you, it's wrong to say such things about your brother.
Enough, you've made a mountain out of a molehill.
This man has a bad feeling because he's wearing very nice perfume. What's the difference between men's perfume and women's perfume?
I tell you, do not tell that to your father.
I have it.
I'll show it to you, but quietly, so Mohammed doesn't notice anything.
How do these girls get together?
It is ugly to do such a thing, a beautiful girl like her!
Don't look at him, don't look at him!
I'm afraid he felt that there was something wrong with him.
Cast away your worries.
I know that you are following the widespread distribution of Bluetooth today.
I am waiting for Saad, let him come.
How are you, Saad?
May God protect you.
We were waiting for you, we didn't play cards.
Yes, why?
Do you want to drink anything?
I saw him sleeping here in your apartment for two days!
Because of the Bluetooth story.
Yes, his older brother threatened him.
He is afraid of him.
Don't try, I told you not to try.
I am leaving from the airport. I am leaving from the airport. I am leaving. I am leaving. I am leaving. I am leaving.
I booked in advance.
I will leave... How do I face people? I can't!
And what should I say to your father?
Tell him anything.
Oh, these children only bring trouble.
That's the end, mother.
I remember when Khalid was little.
Of course, this will be the result.
Enough, please leave.
The right thing always hurts.
The jar broke.
It's impossible for me to live in Doha.
I can't face people.
My phone has been off for a while.
And you blame me, Amal?
You are a girl and you spend all day at home.
What can I say when I'm a man who spends every day outside meeting people?
Tough one, Amals!
I cannot live while spending my day and life constantly staring at the ground.
The father feels for a while that there is something different in the house, that there is some change.
How long will my father be absent from the events happening here at home?
Sometimes I blame my father and sometimes I don't.
I can't blame him! Hope, when I recall his dedication and loyalty to his work, so that we can live with dignity among people.
I really blame him.
When he leaves the house and the responsibility of the children to the mother.
We don't want to dredge up the past now.
Does the father know or not?
But I'm ready.
Turn on his Bluetooth.
But I won't give it to him.
I don't want to see the shock on my father's face.
I will be wreckage.
Whatever! Amal,
Ramina knows.
It's much better to know her from someone else.
How sorry I am that our house has come to this state.
Because a dirty bomb called Immortality exploded in it.
And customs and traditions.
You'll find them rude.
They have stopped their ears against it.
And they do not want to hear him.
They only listen to one voice.
Which one is dirtier and more crooked?
They trample on all the good.
What comes to mind?
That you suddenly decided to study abroad.
We've done our part, and God will help you, my son.
May God help you.
It's the people who come back who bring gifts, not those who travel.
You're right.
This is a rule.
And every rule has its exception.
I hope, come with me quickly.
Did you see her, my daughter?
My hearing isn't good.
Abu Saad!
Abu Saad
Abu Saad .. what's wrong with you?
Father, what's wrong with you?
Daddy!
Do not be sad.
You are a wonderful person.
A Muslim man desired you.
I did not divorce you for any fault in you.
I divorce you.
Because it's impossible.
I accepted to marry my nephew's uncle.
I am gay, just like your brother.
Console him.
You're here every day.
Before you ever come
You were hidden in the hole.
That was back when we were in the lower class.
Can you handle such very strong words?
You get a thousand and two hundred, you make a lot of money!
Say, "Everyone acts according to their own inclination."
Go, go.
I've only been here for seven months, enough chattering, take me home.
How embarrassing and humiliating! Every time he takes me to someone's house, he asks their driver: "How much do they pay you?" Nothing satisfies him, and today he asked for a raise.
The driver is making fun of you.
He came less than seven months ago.
Annoy me, my son, annoy me.
Let's get rid of it.
Return it and bring another one instead!
Tell your son, he doesn't know what lies behind this word! He doesn't know what it gains you in terms of time and money.
Leadership training. Send it back to us and keep it away from us!
The first time you came to my house was six months ago.
Alright, then I'll say something new to you.
Petroleum is now at $114, and before it was a kilo for half a riyal, maybe five riyals. Everything has become expensive, boss.
Open your mind and listen to what I'm saying!
What was the salary I used to pay you when you first came here?
You gave me seven hundred.
You're still new, new. You've only been here for six months, and this eight-hundred-dollar salary is too much.
I need money.
The drivers you're talking about are old-timers, you're the new one.
This seven hundred is now eight hundred.
Go!
He said, "I'll give you a bonus of only one hundred riyals."
And there's no point with three hundred.
What I told you is correct?
No, no, screen. I'll be in trouble if I run away.
No, I'm afraid that won't be possible.
Those who flee their bail.
Why are you afraid?
For these people's shepherds were
Give them a salary between six hundred and seven hundred. Do you know how much they're paid?
How much do you earn?
Why are you afraid then?
I'm not afraid.
Glorified and Exalted is He, and in Him do we place our trust.
I woke Nasser and told him to go and see it.
There was no one.
He even steals the phone I bought for him.
What did you do?
What have I done!
They did everything they could, took his passport, and put it with them.
You may go, sir! You are excused.
We will look for him everywhere.
That is the problem, that is the problem.
And after all this, they flee.
They put us in most of the problems and harm us.
I told you to send it back.
And do you think I'll leave him?
I will find him wherever he is.
It will mean that he will return.
I'd rather pay for his ticket and send him home than let him stay here and make money.
I've reached my limit, I hope I find him.
Come on, man, now. No one's buying now.
At the beginning of the game, you seemed anxious, as I noticed.
But what were we worried about? We were worried that our team wouldn't score goals.
We need more than three, we want ten, twelve, fifteen.
You made me feel before the match that you were afraid, you were scared of the rival team.
I'm not worried about the opposing team, but about our own team. I'm afraid they won't score more than three goals.
This is our team's level, I know. I'm talking about our team's level.
That's a great trust from you.
The rival team has nothing.
Fantastic! The Foxes have scored, you're now leading 1-0.
Where are you going?
I'm going home.
Do you have a car?
Come with me, I'll take you there.
Thank you, brother.
Come on, try... You can't defeat us!
Sir, the match has just started and the league has just begun.
Did you hear what he said?
He said it's a big problem.
Mahmoud, bring the tea!
Now my friend is coming to pick me up to go to the stadium, quickly.
Take them, oh! My friend Sajid.
Take it, Pasha.
What has he made of himself?
Yes, he is the Indian man.
Yes, my God! He's crazy about football.
Don't say such things about my team of foxes.
They will win, they will win.
Come on, Sajid, come on! Quickly, quickly, the match is about to start. Hurry up. Bring a water bottle with you. The Foxes are playing today.
Dear viewers, we have with us today one of the most famous fans of the Foxes club, known as the Fox.
They say you defeat them because they are incomplete.
What they say is not true.
What is incomplete? Each team has ten players.
If there is neither one nor two, nothing will change.
This fox is very clever.
This is our best fan.
Alright, on the occasion of the victory, welcome Foxes, a final word you'd like to say to the foxes!
All words stop.
When they mention the name of foxes
Her name is high in the sky.
These fans are good.
Listen to me, brother.
You can find him enthusiastic like this.
Here we are, oh! Beautiful
So where is the football-loving Indian?
I haven't seen him in a while.
Oh! He's become a big star now, he doesn't come here.
I saw the man a few days ago and didn't recognize him. He was sitting in a cafe in Villaggio, called Starbucks or something like that.
I remember this boy, he came and sat with us at the café, but he didn't have any money to buy a cup of tea.
The man gave the boy a tip of twenty riyals in front of me.
What made him like this?
Ah! [The man], sitting with the top executives of the club, helping him and doing everything he wants.
Can I say something important?
Yes, Uncle.
My uncle says: Whether you go or come,
I don't know why you support such a bad and weak club.
This team is my favorite.
In my chest, your heart is open.
You can catch many foxes in it.
You haven't heard the poem of Al-Fadl, which Al-Hakam narrated, with a rhyme that astounds.
When we played with them.
Please, oh you critic, read, read this poem, read, read.
My uncle... Lord, he's someone who knows my secret.
My soul hurt a lot.
I don't sleep at all at night.
Learn that we are the Foxes' fan club.
You can't tell me who the winner is, so I can be the one to reveal the name.
We will have a press conference, and God willing, we will announce the winner's name.
The Spender
Fame is a fox, this fan who was honored today by the Fox Club management in a kind, rare, and wonderful gesture.
Go away!
Congratulations to the Foxes on this lovely honor and this wonderful gift, of course.
What do you think, is this a pen or a watch?
This is it, Dad, I swear.
This is a sign.
I assure you it's him.
We must inform the police.
Don't go anywhere!
All fans, all of them, all, all fans.
No, no, no! Oh! That's not him, it's his doppelganger.
I tell you, this is not it.
You're late.
I don't know the game times, brother.
Now how can we catch him?
We just have to wait until the Foxes play their next match.
He is here, he is here, I saw him.
Alright, let's follow him.
Brother, you're late!
He is here, he is here, he is here, he is here.
Catch up with him, follow him, follow him, catch up with him.
The problem we're facing is that we're not sure if it's him or not.
I swear by God, father, that's the man.
I say it is right and wise to go to them and inquire from them by asking: "Where did the driver who is with you come from? How did he come to you? And when did he come to you?"
Oh father, you always make things complicated.
We tell about him, I'm sure of it.
The country, O Lord, protect it. Yes, it is mine.
Yes, it's registered in my name, yes.
Also the other land beside it.
Tell your father that Abu Abdurrahman Al-Salti sends his regards, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
No, no, God bless you, but I think we're mistaken! Oh, my son, we came to a friend and mistook you for him.
Glorious and Exalted is He, who creates many people who resemble one another.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you ma'am, thank you.
No, no, God bless you. Sorry, sorry, and thank you, thank you.
With your permission, excuse me, I am here to help you. Goodbye, may God protect you.
And you claim to be certain!
I don't know what your father will do! I'm very scared.
What have you done, Waleed?
When, when, when was I walking, she caught the handle of the bag in it.
Try to fix it now!
Go to your room, go.
I hope nothing bad happens.
I hope nothing bad happens.
Now, try to make your father understand this!
Before my father finds out?
Shattered into a million pieces.
I'll buy exactly the same one, mother, as soon as possible.
Before my father arrives.
Welcome, Mother!
Get to know your father, when he gets angry, he goes crazy.
Go to your room and don't leave it.
He did nothing.
By accident, he hit the pot with his bag, causing it to fall and break.
Mom, I'm worried about him.
I don't know where he is.
No, no, no, no, his father is crazy.
Why are you doing this to the boy? Oh, my daughter!
You terrified him and scared him, do you want the boy to go crazy?
May I say something, my daughter?
Where do you think the boy went?
Okay, if he comes I'll call you.
I hope nothing bad happens.
Auntie, I know where Walid is.
Come with me, I'll show you where it is.
Come on. Oh, God.
Behold!
I don't want to go home, please, Grandma.
Hide me in your place.
I didn't see the glass jar.
I swear I don't know.
This is how your father, may he rest in peace, used to scare you.
Come with me, my son.
Do not be alarmed, my son, as long as I am in the house; do not be afraid, my son.
I have the solution.
We didn't say anything, Abu Waleed!
I implore you, O Abu Walid, to help me.
This time, I'll forgive him for your sake.
I wasn't at home.
Where is he? Where did he go?
Where is he? Where?
Alright, my son Waleed, your father won't do anything for you.
Are you sure, Dad?
Yes, my son, yes.
Will you leave it here? I'm afraid one of the kids will kick it and break it.
He asked me and told me to bring him one like the one I brought him that Waleed broke.
He wants the same one. I went and found only this, the last one in the store. He was very lucky. Where are the boys?
In the room, he studies.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Please go ahead, I am interested in it.
I'll just stop at this game.
Oh my God!
Alright, then study!
My father just wants this game and we'll study.
Be patient, father, don't say anything to my uncle.
Dad, don't tell your brother... This is the last time, I swear.
I will speak to him.
And you, in particular, have wronged me. Am I your friend at the café?
You'll see if I don't tell my brother about you!
Alright, I won't call. That's the phone in my pants pocket, so if you're going to study, that's fine.
Girl, why don't you take him to the doctor?
O Allah, guide her, O Mumah.
He terrifies him to death because he beats him all the time.
Every year is better than the previous one.
Wait.
Mama, where is Amoula? I don't see her with you today.
And you go with her.
My sister is not satisfied with the abayas.
Oh, oh! My daughter, I didn't tell you the story of Manira and her son Naif.
Her son is the age of a newborn, may God keep him safe.
And at the same height.
She told me yesterday that she didn't know what to do with her son.
She wants to take him to the hospital, but her husband Youssef
I learned about the story yesterday.
He quarreled with her and shouted at her.
He says, "Why didn't you tell me?"
This is a psychological condition.
This is against the boy's will.
A father takes his son and ties him in the middle of the courtyard.
Then he later tells him to do it again and pee in your bed.
Much ado about nothing.
What did you say, Mother of Munira?
Eat, eat.
"May your every bite be delicious and easy to digest."
Wretched am I.
Mama, Mama.
It's better that your father didn't know about you.
Or he will beat you to death.
Alright, go to the bathroom and take a shower before your father wakes up, or he'll be very angry with you.
I won't listen to what you say.
Allah is sufficient for them.
They weep and tremble.
My fear that something bad will happen to my children.
I have to take them to their uncle to punish them.
I'm nervous.
They didn't fail, they succeeded.
Why will you take them to their uncle?
Nasser got forty-four out of fifty.
Why don't they get along perfectly?
Their uncle told them that he had warned them.
Frankly, I agree with his point of view.
Ignore the emotions.
And it is upon my brother to punish them.
Okay, I'll get it, I'll get it.
This is the last time, this is the last time.
Fifty out of fifty.
He is wasting our time, and I assure them that he is our son.
Why don't you get a perfect score?
"Accompany me in silence... silence... silence... I have warned you enough, so heed what you hear of my words."
Don't listen to what I say.
You're so rude, boy!
Strike him again, let me punish him.
Ah! Stop it, Uncle.
In order to review well next time, review!
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Completed and sufficient.
Do you know what I'm going to do?
I'll let you jump one by one, and you'll be falafel.
Beware of going out with your family to public places.
He creates trouble for us.
Teacher, Waleed is crying.
Why are you crying?
This is an excellent sign.
It's strange to cry.
You must be happy.
Oh son, everyone has left, even the buses are gone. You're waiting for someone to come and pick you up.
At the school entrance, meaning he is waiting for the bus. The bus has arrived and the children are getting off.
Did you hear about the boy who committed suicide today?
They gave him his certificate.
His father threatened him if he didn't get full marks.
Walid, Walid. Come back! Walid, come back.
Hello and welcome to a new episode of our program "Without Borders" live on air.
Oil accounts for more than thirty-five percent of the total diverse energy sources.
While the rest goes to natural gas, coal, and hydroelectric power.
That's why oil is the number one source of energy in the world.
The Gulf countries and Iran together have 688 billion barrels.
Followed by Iran with twelve percent, then Iraq with ten percent, then Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates with nine percent.
Each of them, then Venezuela comes with seven percent.
Then Russia by five percent.
Gulf countries and Iran possess two-thirds of the world's reserves.
Unprecedented prices surpassing one hundred and nine dollars per barrel for the first time in history.
In this episode, we aim to understand the many complexities surrounding oil.
And the problems faced by oil-exporting countries.
However, its prices reach the heavens.
As citizens and residents in these countries face problems.
Due to inflation and unprecedented rise.
What will soon appear on the screen or they can write to us through our website "www.aljazeera.net".
Because the market is the main factor today.
And not the producing countries.
What determines the price today is market power.
Not OPEC
Of course, supply and demand play a role in that.
But other factors
Other political factors charged with tension
In the world
Real estate markets
and stock exchanges and others
And moved to prices in speculation.
Goods like oil, for example
And tomorrow it will reach a thousand dollars, God knows best.
The price of oil rose to forty dollars in 2004.
And today we see that gasoline prices are also
Changes from day to day.
Oil prices fell below $90.
And it increased in the second quarter.
Especially with the arrival of spring, and secondly because most of the world's filters are under maintenance.
"Which is always, for the second chapter."
Seasonal demand for oil decreases.
In winter, the temperature drops below ninety degrees.
And all these things indicate that expectations now have authority and control over the market.
A lot has changed when we return to the traditional market in the past.
The market used to be influenced by supply and demand.
Seasonal supply and demand
Today, we see that economic growth
Today or yesterday, General Fallon, the commander of the Central Command in Afghanistan and Iraq, resigned.
His resignation sparked a major reaction due to its connection to the so-called expected American war.
Political or Geopolitical Implications
It could quickly affect the oil market, either negatively or positively.
It will surely have its effect and make an impact.
Even speculators are influenced by political influence.
That may confirm, he will say, some will tell you that an American war on Iran is imminent.
Here, what will happen to the market? The market will be somewhat optimistic.
This question, Mr. Deputy, is now in light of what the White House has said.
And that returned the area to an atmosphere of tension.
This duality.
But Fallon might see this scenario.
A Quick Reflection on the Oil Market
Today, we are, and the numbers have proven that there is no shortage.
I'll give you an example: In the past seven weeks.
In the United States of America, oil reserves have increased by more than half in the last five years.
Today, I don't mean to say...
Not even for the next war, because I tell you that the world has a profitable stockpile to this day.
Even today's global consumption, you can choose any country and find long queues in front of gas stations.
These are other matters.
What risks does this issue pose?
What number do you expect it to be? I don't know.
Two hundred dollars or maybe three hundred dollars, perhaps less.
It could come to a confrontation if these tensions turn into real ones.
Because the Gulf represents sixty percent, as you said.
In a country far even from the oil-producing countries
You will see how that will negatively impact the oil market.
And it can reach three hundred dollars.
And moved from stocks and the like to the oil market. Today, you will see more than two trillion dollars or two trillion dollars.
Today we see the printed.
The trading volume exceeds one hundred per day.
These tensions in the region and in anticipation
April, as we mentioned before, will be the month to put an end to this war.
God knows I didn't do it, I swear to God I didn't, I swear truthfully, believe me.
In the area because now
This year is an election year.
And the current American government still has only a few months left.
George H. W. Bush launched a war on Somalia and sent thirty thousand Canadians in his final days in the White House.
We see, but do not expect events.
But I don't think this scene will happen.
Because this scenario is very expensive.
America will not pay anything, you will pay, as well as Iran and the consumer countries.
America Today
Now it depends on Africa's oil and has many other alternatives.
Look, there isn't, let's talk clearly.
You said at the beginning of your talk that the ratio is sixty percent.
Oil reserves
But they now export twenty-two...
I get oil from West Africa.
I am from West Africa and what products do they export from any other region in the world?
Oil production
Because this is a difficult number and fixed reserves and reserves.
Deep-sea mining or seabed mining
Therefore, the Gulf will remain a tough number.
The Caspian Sea
I consider them dreams because they are neither truth nor reality.
They destroy it and ruin it.
The one present there is the meaning.
Today, Qatar is the world's largest source of energy.
Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is therefore a difficult number for these countries.
And the energy needs of countries
<h1>There is no doubt about the existence of something called "reliable supply."</h1>
And despite internal objections in the United States, even at the level of General Fallon
But there are still some concerns.
President Bush turned and said that he...
Political risks do not emanate from Gulf countries.
No, no, no, not here. Generosity is not from here at all. None of us deal in generosity.
No, there is a lot of generosity in the treatment.
And not "in the current field"
We are not part of a charity.
Or charity.
But he is generous to Westerners, not to anyone else.
With the Americans accurately.
Where is the market?
Wherever we find economic returns, we will go.
We won't do it.
Like oil and gas
You will do it out of kindness.
The guide has it.
The guide has it.
It's no more than sixty to seventy dollars.
Not price increases.
But the decline of the US dollar that you insist on
You are primarily a citizen of the GCC and OPEC countries.
The export is in dollars and you refuse.
Currency exchange despite its collapse and therefore
And if you return, We will return.
I didn't say it has to be seventy.
It's the experts' latest talk, not my words.
The dollar's drop of thirty percent was offset by oil's rise of more than that percentage.
If we take the base year as 2004
We observe that oil prices range between thirty-five and thirty-six dollars.
Of course
The price of oil rose.
But it's a minor increase, honorable deputy.
If we take it.
We are looking at it now.
Even at these prices
I mean if we compare that to 2004.
Surpassed even the decline rate of the US dollar
Exciting
Interacting with the Dollar's Depreciation
When the dollar falls, oil prices rise.
This is also something the market is starting to give a sense of.
Our interest now is to reduce.
No, the situation has changed now. At the beginning of the workforce reduction two years ago, it was different, but it has changed now.
And the dollar began to lose value against other major currencies like the euro and the pound sterling.
So the question is: Why did you peg your currency to the dollar?
Weak currency with no backing.
This is a historical era.
Petroleum and its derivatives are priced in dollars, including Europe's production from the North Sea, Russia, and Norway.
She says America in the mid-seventies.
The gold standard that the US dollar once enjoyed was abolished.
This is not the truth.
Tell me the truth.
OPEC comprises
Four Gulf countries
Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
Today, OPEC's share in the global market
Forty percent
Today, if we say that the world consumes eighty-five million barrels
Those that deal in dollars for oil pricing.
If you price in another currency, everyone will do that.
You can't
All oil-producing countries must agree to that.
You, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries, are arrogant and proud.
Adults own 66% of the world's wealth.
Reserves, but I consider them an export.
Including Venezuela, Libya, and Iran
Cameroon, Angola, and all these countries organized under the umbrella of OPEC.
Her share in the market does not exceed forty percent.
Non-OPEC producer and exporter
This may not be linked in any way to the forty percent figure.
He can't do that by himself.
Some countries strive, but
Not a genuine attempt.
It's you who is rejected because of American ties.
From dollars to another currency.
All oil-producing countries
Before you export a single barrel
It's a pity if they import it.
His currency rose sharply.
And he sells his oil in dollars.
On his future device or recipient he received it, he got his money in dollars then converted it to his local currency.
His salary is not linked to the dollar.
True, but
But it's also your problem; you sell in dollars, but if your currency isn't tied to the dollar, you won't have any issues.
My main question now is
What are the concerns and implications of pegging your currency to the dollar as its value declines?
I've been attached to her for many years.
Especially in the 1970s when the dollar was a very strong and prestigious currency.
This withdrawal is not that simple.
Divorce is clear.
Not here
The cost of divorce is high.
Works in the interest of these countries, not against them.
Profit and loss
Dow Jones announced yesterday that there are four countries, one of which is Qatar.
But there is also a report by the Gulf Finance site stating that four Gulf countries will adopt the unified currency, of course after Oman's exit from the Gulf single currency.
I read a statement in "Dow Jones" and I don't think it's a genuine statement.
The Governor of the Qatar Central Bank has been exiled.
He said yes and that a study would be conducted, but all Gulf countries must also participate.
Profit and loss must be examined with great care, free from emotions.
Leave the matter for study and until their arrival.
Look, I can get you other economists who can prepare another study.
What contradicts this study?
The Global Home said something very simple and organized and issued a report on March 8th.
Just four days ago.
A global house is the simple solution and a non-political decision.
The political decision can be summarized in two things.
Not three, first thing.
Intentions to issue a unified Gulf currency in 2010 by the five countries in addition to Kuwait.
The second point is to issue a decision to separate from the dollar.
Firstly, concerning the unified currency.
From my personal point of view
To see the unified Gulf currency
This currency will be strong.
It will be
Perhaps one of the strong currencies in the world, as you said.
And what will come from the reserves and the great revenues.
Therefore, the Prime Minister emphasized this when he said
Gulf countries, because no single country can do it alone.
Unless it has a strong economic content
And the barren growth today until they see it.
Of course, you must not forget that the central bank plays a crucial role.
Assessment
Determining profit or loss
From all this news
Tense situation
Two thousand eight hundred, as observers said, the global housing market said this inflation will continue.
Long is the wait in the Gulf countries, but the solution lies in the hands of governments.
Some countries have raised salaries by seventy percent, such as the United Arab Emirates.
To stop the inflation process
And here is my question now, when will you raise the salaries of those poor people?
I'll hear your answer after a short break.
Today's episode: Oil reserves and daily production of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Saudi Arabia.
Has reserves of four hundred and twenty-three billion.
And two barrels of ten.
And produce nine out of ten daily.
One million, one hundred and fifty in Kuwaiti dinars equals two hundred and seven million in production.
Qatar, with a population of fifteen and a half billion, produces eight hundred and fifty-five thousand barrels of oil per day. Oman, with a population of five and a half billion, produces seven hundred and seven thousand barrels.
Bahrain is thirty-five thousand.
The total revenue was thirty-eight billion in the year.
From one thousand two hundred and three to one thousand two hundred and seven.
Europe one hundred billion
Sixty billion in the Middle East and forty billion.
In Asia and other countries
The GDP of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries reached $716 billion in 2006.
The total for the year two thousand and seven is expected to be seventy-seven and seven tenths billion.
It was in the year two thousand and eighty-twelve and one-tenth billion.
As inflation continues to devour the salaries of employees and wages of workers in this field.
But it will rise in 2008 to three tenths and eight hundredths.
Kuwait is fourteen percent, but it is expected to be eight and nine tenths in the United Arab Emirates in 2008.
The number in my basket will be half as many as in Saudi Arabia and will reach six.
And eight out of ten
Salaries are being eaten up.
So, what amounts and percentages will you give to the poor here?
If we want to solve the problem
A real solution
Salaries are always on the rise.
It is not the solution.
I'm not against raising salaries.
This is not the truth, me, this is not the truth.
We always
Of course, there is a belief.
In the event of an increase, inflationary increases will eat up all these bonuses if inflation is not controlled.
To solve the inflation problem, a high-level committee including all experts and specialists was formed.
And now this committee places
Because salaries are rising in the world.
And of course, the golden rule of economics says:
It will have no end.
And whatever it is
Salaries often increase, but it doesn't matter how much they increase.
Inflation will rise.
The solution is an imperative necessity and must be achieved.
With the help of Bayt.com, the specialized employment institute, the British company YouGov Seraj conducted a scientific study that showed
They conducted a survey of fifteen thousand employees working in the Gulf countries in twenty key sectors.
Especially for experts and those with career paths, there is no job satisfaction.
Because inflation here has started to devour everything.
Especially experienced ones.
You're considering moving from these countries where inflation rates keep rising and devouring everything.
Now you will lose.
This simple concept, put it and get ready to implement it.
The solution to inflation is to increase salaries.
The balance is available.
He is there.
We are concerned, the state is concerned, and we are doing our best.
To solve this problem with a real solution.
Temporary solutions never solve the problem, they only make it worse.
Increasing it means
We hope to have more time before this committee puts forward its recommendations.
All applications
This boredom and you, my master.
Boredom will always exist.
True, but the government tried and capped the increases at 40%.
Yes, there's an important point regarding raises.
Regarding bonuses, you only want to hire Qataris, as if non-Qataris work in Burkina Faso or Zimbabwe.
You consider Qataris but you don't consider expatriates.
It has the highest proportion.
You, Ahmed, live in Qatar, not Germany.
Everyone is talking about this matter and suffering.
Much higher salaries than in the public sector.
And conversely, we saw
In the government sector
On the contrary, the public sector has become...
Because the best units and competencies started.
I also read a report, as you know, we are in an oil field.
Work
Follow our experts.
Engineers and workers come from outside Qatar.
We also deal with the global market.
Rate of salary increase for all these things
Hope is in Allah, the Most High, but we say:
The government has a plan.
And I say that controlling inflation is more important.
Temporary solution
And we'll see, I'm sure.
There will be
Positive results
It will be on the verge of fifteen percent.
Okay, the second nice report says you will receive $22 billion from oil and $43 billion from gas.
It's not a spraying operation.
"Of course, we are procedures.
But talk of economic growth must also reflect on people.
And that reflects any economic growth today, as Qatar has the highest economic growth in the world.
Translate the following text.
And the huge carriers in the land are also part of it.
And were it not for these great "carriers" and large projects
In this country, that won't be part of inflation either.
This resulted in some increase in the inflation rate.
This also led to a lot of liquidity being pumped into the market.
Firstly, regarding the link between the dollar and oil.
He mortgaged the olive oil for protection.
I am from the United States of America and thus have a stable energy supply.
Thank you.
Saad al-Ghamdi is from Saudi Arabia, your question, Saad?
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
You are right, it is a wonderful ring and a wonderful title.
What I really want to talk about is that the region is now subject to American policies.
American policy in its current war, in addition to the cultural war it is trying to wage against Islam, there is a global economic war.
Now in China
The U.S. deficit with Japan also reached sixty-one billion dollars.
Japan has already invested in two projects worth $2,000.
With America to the equivalent of nine.
Billions while now investing with the European Union in excess of twenty-seven billion dollars
To keep up with American politics and make the dollar an indispensable currency worldwide.
Brother, I say buy now.
And the Gulf region will become
Place
Thank you, Brother Saad.
Mohamed El-Wasif from Egypt
Hello, Your Excellency, the deputy with you.
His Highness the Arab, Your Majesty reminds me of the princes of the Middle East.
When it is
When there are demands to adjust prices.
Adjusting salaries according to prices, as Your Highness has directed.
In Qatar, we used to look up to you as a role model.
And he insisted on not promising an increase. This is the genuine Arab style.
We want, we consider Qatar as Abu Turka.
He has the right to say what he wants, do you have a question? That's certainly his right, and he's responsible for this policy.
The question first.
His Excellency must take into consideration.
This is one second in which he should respond to public opinion.
With the poor, as I said, because they are the people of the countries that need special care.
Arab leaders who do not care about the poor.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
Good evening to you and good evening to His Highness.
I want a raise, too.
Salaries are excellent and good, which is a positive thing.
Thank you for the topic we need and suffer from.
I am with the poor and will remain so, God willing, and we know that there are no poor people in Qatar, and we are sure of that.
And Qatar, as he said, directs funds to the ruling family and the ruler.
And this is the important matter now.
We answer the brothers first.
Cannot judge
What happens to wealth?
Now there are new cities about to be like Pearl Island, Lusail, and other places, which means Qatar is also expanding.
This is not the case, the case is
Suitable urban planner
In short, because we only have two minutes, tell us what Qatar will choose?
Qatar now, there is a post-oil and gas Qatar.
There is a clear policy of the state.
Because she
Non-renewable ownership
Because it is a non-renewable protected area.
Therefore, the prevailing trend today in the State of Qatar.
The capital of the Middle East in education is:
Today we see the educational city.
Today, this scientific city encompasses the best universities in the world.
Building medical cities, media cities, and financial cities
By today's standards, oil and gas
No, of course we don't imitate anyone.
Other satellite channels
Not just an island, you will make a hundred islands, and we certainly do not stand with the island.
Because our countries are Gulf countries now, my brother.
In the 1970s, a transformation took place. Now everyone remembers the transformation of the 1970s.
Now, when we see the growth Qatar is enjoying
And that calls for a special episode about post-oil Qatar.
Our vision regarding oil, its future, and its resources in the region, especially in Qatar. Finally, I send my greetings to the program team.
I am Ahmed Mansour, sending you greetings from beyond the borders. Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Peace be upon you, the broadcast is live this week from the Qatari capital, Doha.
And I welcome you to a new episode of our program "Without Borders"
At the same time, Qatar hosts the largest U.S. military base outside the United States, Al Udeid Air Base.
With enemies of the United States in the region
Like Iran and Syria
Its gates are open to visitors.
In fact, Hamas leaders enjoy special relations with the Qatari leadership.
The Emir of Qatar is also the only Arab leader.
Who visited the southern suburbs of Beirut, destroyed by Israel during the Lebanon War in the summer of 2006?
And the support continues unabated to rebuild what Israel destroyed in Lebanon.
And at the time when Qatar reconciled
With its older sister, Saudi Arabia, for about two years.
Simultaneously, clashes with the regime in Egypt.
Like the Lebanese file in which I succeeded when others failed.
To gather the Lebanese leaders in Doha where they signed an agreement that brought them to safety.
To the final elections
Complex, difficult files
Who ensured to be the driver of these files, not the train.
The smallest Arab country
In today's episode
We try to understand the foundation and principles upon which Qatari foreign policy was built.
Whose interest?
Qatar, the smallest country in area and population, plays these significant roles.
And what qualifications enable him to do that?
And this will be in a live dialogue with the Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister.
For viewers who wish to participate, they can contact us through the program's phone numbers, which will appear on the screen now.
Visit of the Emir of Qatar
Al Jazeera's Roars for Better Relations with Saudi Arabia
From the past like Saudi Arabia's attempt to seize the Qatari government with the help of the Al Murra tribe.
In its issue of June 20th last month
What is the nature of the secret operation?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Many things that are not
I don't think it's correct.
In many interviews here on this program, I have always said that the correct thing is that
And we consider it the backbone.
I am from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
There was a misunderstanding.
And likewise
And varying degrees of gaze.
It is true that the issue of borders has been resolved, and it was a major obstacle.
The historical Saudi-Qatari relations were distinctive.
These links, if we ponder them.
Between the two countries and the two families.
It was ruined by misunderstanding.
Neither from us nor from them.
Because there are no conditions between brothers.
And the matter is settled, and relations are now in a state that I can assure you is excellent.
The Cooperation Council has a benefit.
But how did the situation improve between the island and Saudi Arabia, which was the obstacle and the reason in 2002?
There is an important point.
And I repeat, if you go back to all the programs, I always said
Not just the elder sister, but I used to say that our reliance in the Cooperation Council is on...
That Saudi Arabia is an important country in the region.
We value our relationship with her.
There was a heated exchange of words between the two parties.
These countries find themselves
Failure occurred when the brothers agreed.

They found themselves in conflict.
Where there are no camels.
And I don't think it's a strategy for any party to this conflict.
But excuse me, Sheikh, let me put things in perspective, or dot the i's and cross the t's.
Many observers find that the island has changed significantly in the past few years.
At a time when the positions criticized by Al Jazeera screen are still ongoing.
What is happening in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia?
Are the detainees, dissidents, or others still holding firm to their position?
An island stopped dealing with these issues.
Al Jazeera's broadcast transformed into Hajj coverage.
He praised the system and what the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques is doing in a time of disagreement.
You can inquire about this matter at the island's administration; don't ask me because I
The corridor that connects the two towns.
For the stability of the region
This strategy continued and reinforced the stability of the region.
The area you're referring to is the Gulf region.
Gulf Region
There are many issues surrounding the Gulf region.
An invitation from the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques in Kuwait
He influenced all the listeners and the entire Arab world.
He spoke from the heart about repairing the Arab rift, overcoming differences, and burying them.
Not just from a point of view
No, it's in politics, and politics are perspectives.
In the Arab world, it is considered
A kind of war
And as for the developed world
Talking about the same interest.
Now you have stayed for many years.
The current situation
Listen first.
There is a difference between this topic and the other.
The idea of a small nation facing powerful nations and making them feel weak.
Any difference or misunderstanding
He had his reasons.
And his reasons ended.
In the end, our wise leadership prevailed.
Are there any warranties on the future relationship?
There are guarantees between the two parties.
The relations between the two countries are based on the brotherhood of love and the common interests that unite them.
And the leaders, their words are taken with great seriousness and importance.
Between Qatar and Saudi Arabia to develop this relationship.
We hope for much from this Saudi-Qatari relationship to develop.
For the better and there will be more fields.
This relationship is similar to the one we have with other Arab countries and other Gulf states.
Qatar is of great importance.
Alright, Saudi Arabia is an important country.
What does Egypt represent to Qatar? Because what is bad is that you reconciled with Saudi Arabia at the same time.
And three organizations, namely Hezbollah.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Are you pro or against the regime in Egypt, the largest Arab country?
Start with this first.
Egyptian people
And we respect the Egyptian nation.
And her interest
With the multitude of Arab causes and the sacrifices of the Egyptian nation
In this case
Would anyone believe that through this case we are trying to reach an understanding with our brothers in Egypt?
In light of what you say about your respect for Egypt and the Egyptian people
And we see him as a righteous man.
Our difference with Egypt lies in two points.
For one point.
We were accused of planning to overthrow Gaza, and I don't think...
And we will not interfere.
In cases pertaining to other countries
He does not believe in interfering in the affairs of any state unless there is room for reform.
Does that mean you intervened in Hamas' coup against the authority in Gaza?
Of course, I don't deny that. Indeed, we didn't know about this as much as others did through the media.
We have relations with Hamas and we have relations with others.
What makes Egypt different or creates a disagreement between you two on this topic?
I will attend this.
Hezbollah plot
Hezbollah and
But I speak on behalf of my country.
We were very astonished by this subject.
A thorn for the eye of Qatar.
What did the pyramids say?
The pyramids said.
To attack Egypt and its heartland.
Can I reply?
We return to the plot they mentioned.
The days will reveal that.
The matter did not start from the Gaza Conference.
And I also absolve the Egyptian people and President Hosni Mubarak of any blame.
If we go back to the conference in ancient Germany
After the Madrid conference, do you remember the port of Doha?
That was an agreement, and when the conference was to be held with us.
They said we don't want to hold the conference.
Oh people, we know that you are coordinating with Israel.
Towards Qatar and this
What are we striving to understand the cause of?
We sat and talked, and talking is always good.
It consists of two parts.
What are they?
There is a dispute.
In political orientation
If we look at the conference that was held in Stockholm,
His Highness the Prince spoke with all the presidents, including his brother President Hosni Mubarak.
And an foreign state informed us.
Our brothers in Egypt have an opinion on the matter that the summit should not be held.
And people are being killed while we watch.
If you don't want to hold it in Doha, we can hold it anywhere in the Arab League.
And it would be shameful to discuss the issue at the Kuwait conference regarding it.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. And they ask you, "Is it true?" Say, "Yes, by my Lord, it is indeed true."
When we all said, "Well, this is common and there is no power or strength except from God," we Arabs cannot stop it, and no major country can stop this fighting.
Egypt's announcement of a request to cease hostilities in Gaza, and the fighting stopped an hour later.
Even we
We should not view the Arab street with such naivety; our disagreement with the brothers lies in one point.
And this is in accordance with international customs.
The number of hospitals and doctors is not sufficient, and they are subject to detention at the borders.
It was you who stood at the borders.
There, and no one can enter.
The brothers didn't take it well.
Because Gaza is adjacent to Egypt and is considered part of the national domain.
When we talk about any human issue anywhere in the world, we are talking only about a human issue.
And we respect sovereignty in Egypt.
And we know her position, but this does not harm the Egyptian position.
We place great hopes in Egypt.
It is the largest Arab country.
And we believe that we can amplify our voices and the voices of others from the Arab world.
For all other parties
Gaza and even the rescue mission that followed it.
The Europeans tried to save her.
What happened in Gaza?
Is it a conference to provide some kind of service, and do I consider it a rescue for the government?
We were not invited to a conference, but were asked to coordinate among the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
We met at the Cooperation Council.
These amounts will not be issued to any party.
It will be issued to him.
Affected parties in Gaza
Directly, and that was it.
Because entry is not allowed from any side.
I rejoice for Egypt, and all the people in Qatar rejoice for Egypt, because it is Egypt.
Egypt's victory in political issues is very important to us.
Nevertheless, you expect that.
Just give me two minutes.
A minister boasts of what has not been proven and says:
And whoever harms Egypt, we will cut off his leg and break his arm.
Frankly, I think this official has done his country a disservice.
In truth, they did not fail and they did not talk about anything but themselves.
What helped them in that, and I said this to our brothers in Saudi Arabic, the Saudis intervened because the King has wisdom in this matter.
In a nutshell in the Arab world
We agreed.
The king will decide that it is for the best.
We accepted King Abdullah's decision because we respect and trust him.
But the statement of one of them, that we have left them standing, is an insult to those who were made to stand.
As if they were students in a school.
I think this is it.
Maximum limit reached
He thinks he must assert his strength.
We apologize, we apologize for this matter.
If you think that a small state does not have the right, then its right has been taken from it.
And as you enter, penetrating and managing your affairs in Darfur
It's an Arab decision at the Arab League.
African decision and a United Nations resolution
I think the main problem is
Hezbollah plot plus Qatar
A plot for something I don't know in Qatar.
If that happens, perhaps after the swine flu, and it appears somewhere, Qatar will be the cause of spreading this epidemic.
Qatar is a peaceful country that knows its size and capabilities.
But Qatar has its own point of view.
Qatar has a secretive policy.
If Qatar can solve any Arab issue, we consider it an honor for us.
Because any Arab conflict
We believe that any Arab disagreement can weaken our position regarding our major issues, namely Palestine and all the other challenges we face.
The Arab world has become a recipient.
Until we made it lawful for them as they had made it lawful for themselves.
Western analysis
But there is one thing we know about what happened in Pakistan.
I want someone to greet me in Washington with a red carpet.
Does anyone blame Qatar?
Did Qatar insult any Arab country?
I tried to contribute money.
These contributions are controversial.
I could drop by to say hello, and you'd say: You're only welcoming me to provoke my jealousy.
This is another case, which means you have some problem or deficiency.
This matter doesn't concern me. It's up to you.
And if you are suffering from internal problems
We always say it.
Especially after the speech of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah.
In Kuwait, and I know this man is honest.
A man says what is in his heart.
"I always say that his heart
I always say this.
I always said, even at the height of our dispute with Saudi Arabia, that I always said that I
And you can refer to all the documents you have on the island.
No, the subject doesn't change.
From our side, we said no, that's all, we stop here.
We did our best.
I'm not inclined to get into this topic.
Let them see their own affairs, where their mistakes are.
And seeing our mistakes does not mean that everything we have is correct.
Are you referring to this, Your Highness?
To the existence of internal problems in Egypt.
And they want to get out of it.
Do you deny that Qatar is in any way involved in a conspiracy against Egypt on the international stage and is trying to break its relations with Turkey or any other country?
It seems we have superpowers.
They are seventy million, if we could, not eighty million.
They also have a problem that needs to be solved.
That you played a role in the Shalit file, despite your knowledge that this issue is important to the Egyptian government.
And you sought advice from the French.
We received a call from a friendly country.
Indeed, there is an issue we must address. We said, "O brothers, this issue concerns the Egyptians." They said:
We want to see this issue as a request.
From Israel and another country, we want to see another part to witness this matter.
When we saw this, we said to them, "If this is the way of the wretched, we will speak to the wretched people in Egypt."
And we declared that, I mean, is there a responsible official who can say "we" in the sense that he means he deceived the Arab League.
This means he is an unhappy man.
How did he manage to pass us?
Long live President Mahmoud Abbas.
We endorsed that.
Is he addressing his people? Is he addressing us? Is he addressing the Arab world?
The problem is from you.
I think this is a healthy phenomenon.
I am not the owner of the island, as I have been accused.
And the island must engage in media competition like any other media outlet in the West, for example.
There are many media institutions, and during their teenage years, they curse each other.
But after a while, they will reach maturity.
It can be or it may not be.
First, we aligned with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on various matters.
Even if we concede for Saudi Arabia, we accept it in Qatar.
Important relationships
Egypt is an important country, but there is a special relationship with Saudi Arabia.
There is also a special relationship between Egypt and any other Arab country, as Egypt is the largest Arab country.
True, but we have a history with the Saudis and the relationship is different.
This is a personal dispute between some officials here and there.
We respect the Egyptian president.
I hope it's just a difference in policies and perspectives.
I told you about the problem when the attack on Gaza was happening.
The second problem is that they have issues with us, and so far we don't know what Qatar has done to cause this.
Why don't you try to arrange a meeting between the Egyptian president and the prince now?
Saudi Arabia intervened in this matter.
As was leaked to the newspapers, they initially said it was a secret meeting, but we found out about it the next morning.
A meeting was held between me and Omar Suleiman.
In Saudi Arabia
Irrevocable rupture
And I cannot tell you that we agree on everything.
We said that so none of you would interpret it as you comparing yourselves to us.
But dignity remains dignity, whether with the young or the old.
The minister said, "If Egypt obtains the appropriate satisfaction."
Reda among the children
I don't think Egypt is bigger than this. I think he didn't find the right expression.
Do you have a vision for solving problems with Egypt, or are you, like the Egyptians, waiting for divine intervention?
I hope we don't talk about divine intervention or the like, because only God knows who will live and who will die.
And I pray.
He was convinced that there would be some way.
And our pride in Egypt.
In some way
He will stand with me or against me.
And every pain felt by the Arab citizen
In the Arab world, we struggle with it, and this is the policy of His Highness the Emir.
Countries derive their strength from sources of power.
The United States has the sources of China's power and the sources of France's power and the source of power of a small country like Qatar.
Our faith in God
That which is clear and evident.
You're trying.
But we are a small country, and I keep that in mind.
And I will repeat it a hundred times.
So that no one can say we have tender feelings.
No one will take it from him.
Israel, I tickled you now.
"Okay, before I go to Israel."
How can you resolve the issue with Egypt?
What's the problem now?
And every day they lodge a complaint against America if I can tell you the major countries you were talking about.
They deal with us based on self-interest and always will.
All complaints and all
Dislike of the relationship.
I think that any great country that does that will affect its image.
That will also affect our pride in Arabic if we go around complaining to each other.
Everything comes, and we know everything.
Our solution is based on Arabic interest.
And we are here for them if they need anything.
Are there any additional steps to repair the relationships?
But I know that there are good relations between the President and His Highness the Prince.
If there's someone pulling the strings.
Opposing the close ties between the two countries and their leaderships will be a loser.
Whether tomorrow or ten years from now, I really don't know, but from our side, if we are invited to any conference, we will be there.
We will attend the conference if we are invited, and if we have an opinion, we will express it at the conference.
We can't
Because Egypt is our elder sister, but we have our viewpoints and we discuss them together.
This is all that is required, and when the time comes, we will be very happy.
Cancelled due to this policy.
As I said, we respect the Egyptian people.
Of course you ask about the number of contracts that were cancelled, and ask about the number of Egyptians who came to Qatar at the same time.
But as a state policy, as I told you, the Egyptian people in Qatar are very close to our hearts.
Now, on the fourth of last June, it stirred the feelings of Arab countries when it closed the Israeli office, and this news was published in the arts section on June 4th.
Why do you say we're ringing them when we wanted to ring them, we would've hung up twelve years ago.
When everyone had a campaign before reconciliation with Israel and before secret meetings between Arab states and Israel.
And after most Arabs made peace
With Israel, whether under the table or on it, or whether they had spoken to her in any way at all.
If we wanted to stir emotions, we would have done that at the previous Islamic conference.
At the United Nations, Nasser's ally hosted a dinner for Israeli Ambassador Gabriela Shalev.
He was one of the many guests who attended this party, and I don't know what reason the ambassador had for hosting it.
In the United Nations, we sit alongside Israel, and no one can deny this.
Or we find a glimmer of hope to defend our Palestinian brothers from need.
Now the management has changed, and I had a small space for the Egyptian issue, but unfortunately
It wasn't me, but you.
My question is about the United States and the new administration and its impact on your (Qataris) relationship with the United States, given the presence of the largest military base in Qatar.
There are differences in opinions.
Serious about resolving numerous issues in the region.
And if they are serious, we will help them with all our might.
We expect a special relationship or a solution to the problems that existed between you and the Bush administration.
Many of these issues have been resolved.
The Emir of Qatar spoke yesterday in Paris about what is happening in Iran.
You have special relations with Iran despite its poor relations with the United States.
First, it must be placed in the context of internal affairs because we must respect every country and its internal affairs.
Lebanon after the elections
Before the elections, Saad Hariri said on this program that the Doha Agreement ends with the conduct of the elections.
Is this also your vision, or do you think the agreement is still valid, or will you have to reach a new agreement?
The Doha agreement was for a phase that would enable them to hold peaceful elections.
A year and a half has passed since the Doha Agreement.
We were following them day after day and minute after minute until they reached the elections according to the Doha Agreement.
We recently intervened in a constituency to correct some misunderstandings that had arisen.
But you have some tasks related to arrangements in Lebanon.
We are always close to Lebanon, and you know how much Qataris love Lebanon and want to go there.
The first country I visited after a Western country was Lebanon.
<h1>Question: What is happening in Yemen?</h1> <h1>Answer: A civil war.</h1>
You intervened in the case of the two whales and there are some accusations that you supported them.
Or your interference that put them in confrontation with the state, and now there is an even greater danger, the danger of the South.
We have suffered a lot, and that explains why we are standing here and not there in Qatar.
And indeed, we faced a lot of pressures, but this was our vision, and this is the stance of His Highness the Amir.
The topic of the Houthis.
Her stability inspires us positively, and her instability affects us negatively.
We intervened with honest mediation between two parties.
And we signed an agreement.
But I understand if it's meant to be used for other reasons.
And we were there with them, and we always stood by them in all circumstances.
It has no basis in truth.
I see no need for us.
We sell it.
I say this with apologies, as I know there is a large Arab audience that disagrees with me.
Dear viewers, thank you as well for listening, and I hope we have clarified some of Qatar's foreign policy to you.
In conclusion, greetings from the program team, and I, Ahmed Mansour, greet you without borders.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Dear viewers, peace be upon you and welcome to this special meeting.
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani is the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the State of Qatar.
Of course, why do I say it's a special and exceptional interview? Because
Qatar and this man in particular was the main sponsor.
Sir, one direct and simple question.
I think it happened because there has been an Arab consensus since the beginning.
We experienced that when we went to the United Nations.
The Arab consensus was important, and the Lebanese management from both sides was crucial.
To achieve some results
It is very important that there be no external interference.
An abundance of external opinions and suggestions.
Lebanese and international Arabic if you want to say
He went through stages but achieved his goal.
Nothing signifies the passage of these stages.
Do you mean the complexities in Lebanon?
Since the time of truth
I mean when you gathered and directly intervened in the Lebanese line and the Lebanese file now.
Did you find out that the Lebanese mall is huge?
Lebanese Arabic international and regional codes that need important decoding
Or it's a simple compound but magnified due to external interference.
Because we know that Lebanon is a beacon for journalism, a beacon for culture, a beacon for tourism, and a beacon for many other things.
Lebanese should not be allowed.
Affects peace and security in Lebanon.
Problem number one
What are the spillover effects in Lebanon?
I suddenly decided after twenty-four hours to take everyone on one plane.
From the plane directly to meet the Emir of Qatar.
They would not have hoped for it, nor would they have rested, not even for a moment, except that You bestow upon them a mercy.
The secret is to not let them rest and think too much.
Make a lot of calls.
We propose bringing them to Doha because we need an atmosphere.
Or you will gather them with difficulty.
In many circumstances
We take them out of these circumstances into conditions where they can find a solution.
If we want to succeed, we have to get them out of this atmosphere.
Quickly
"True is the promise of Allah: Verily, We shall raise up those who have been humble on earth and We shall gather them together. And We shall establish them in power on earth, and We shall show them Our signs in all things, and they shall know them."
We realized that they agreed to head towards 12 Dhiya13.
The parties decided to head to Doha.
Some thought that Qatar leaned more towards one side than the other.
And I'm from Beirut but
His Highness's policy if we are mediators
In this process
Frankly
Did you consult seriously?
With the main parties concerned at least about what is happening here in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Syria.
Especially the brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, I spoke with Prince Saud.
And he showed his support for the idea.
We benefited from Prince Saud in that.
Everyone needs a solution.
His justifications are flimsy.
If we rely on logic
His justifications are flimsy.
It had to be removed because there is tension in Palestine.
There is a file on the Iranian nuclear program.
The Arab League must have a mechanism to resolve issues.
Is the African Union better than us at solving issues?
And gather the limbs.
If conferences can be held to find solutions, why can't the Arabs with their ancient ties do the same?
Unite the Arabs or unite the parties if there is injustice or interference to support the oppressed.
That needs to be under study.
If we want to wake up the Arab League from its slumber, not the Arab world.
The Arab League is nothing but a tool for implementation.
A high-ranking official, President Nabih Berri, was here.
Requires a connection between them.
Now it seems that the Lebanese have agreed.
We will listen
And on their heads, Qatar.
Never led to a result.
In the interest of the Arab world
That will be considered a source of strength for the Arabs.
We tested it.
At the United Nations when we went to conclude the Doha Agreement
And the tables set for solution, not for other reasons.
There is no doubt that
And play a more important role in the entire Arab world.
to put
Stop it with our consent.
Let others come and help us.
For this is a serious matter.
Why have we reached a stage where everyone plays in our playground?
In our courtyard.
It is very important that we put the interests of our people first.
Now we need an Arab university after this agreement to see what we will do with our Palestinian brothers.
What will we do for Somalia?
What will we do for Somalia? Isn't it a member of the Arab League?
Sudan is not in the Arab League! Iraq is not in the Arab League! Why don't we give it a try?
We are part of the Arab world, a small part of it.
I hope this proposal is not just an idea.
Qatar has good relations with Syria and Saudi Arabia.
I think that in the beginning, if we weren't asked to do something, we would do our best.
But I am certain that His Royal Highness Prince Abdullah
King of Saudi Arabia
And his brother, President Bashar
Because Saudi Arabia and Syria were historically parties to an agreement.
Just a passing phase.
With God's permission, we will find.
Could you play a part in this scene, even though I insist on asking if it pleases you?
Even if it's not public yet, you somehow own the confidence.
What rapprochement between Arab states do we seek?
And this has been His Highness's policy since the beginning, but this matter...
Does what happened in Lebanon indicate that the region is on the verge of serious changes?
Or is what happened in Lebanon a local Lebanese affair, and the affairs of the region are still unresolved?
It is not related to this case.
I hope otherwise, I hope this is not true.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. A new era in the Arab world.
We are capable of innovation.
That will happen somewhere else.
In another sense, Your Highness, are you afraid of the rise that occurred in a previous period?
From now on at least until the end of George Bush's presidency.
There is no doubt that I am still concerned about Palestine and now the issue of Gaza.
I want to ask
We don't need anything else.
I hope to pay attention to the human aspect in Palestine.
We can't deliver the medicine to them.
No food.
Electricity for the patient in the hospital.
Who will die when the power goes out?
I wish
The Arab League agrees on an amount for this food and medicine matter, we call it food and medicine.
We don't want the Red Crescent to distribute it.
Deliver it to the Red Cross.
But excuse me, the Arab side is committed to this Israeli siege.
I don't want to go into details, I'm just saying that as Arabs, we should deliver medicine and food, even if we don't agree with Hamas.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has made a great effort and pledged at the Sacred Kaaba.
Because this difference will only benefit the other party.
Their saying "Don't deal with this party because we will find you a solution" is incorrect.
And I
So far, I have no clues to the solution.
Do you fear an American-Iranian confrontation in the coming period, or do you expect it?
Of course, this is possible.
I talked at least about Qatar.
Iran is an important neighbor of ours.
We may not agree with all of their policies, or they may not agree with our policies in Qatar.
They don't want us to have any relations or ties with Israel.
Perhaps there are those who consider you an essential part of it due to the existing American rules there.
We know how to deal with this.
Some said after the visit of the Emir of Qatar to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
The Saudi guest may have met, consulted with, or spoken to someone.
In Istanbul, there are negotiations between Syria and Israel.
And I can say that it was just a coincidence.
The second issue was one that the Saudi kingdom was keen to find a solution to, and I was in contact with Prince Saud about it.
What happened in the last few hours.
Change the plan. Change the negotiation plans.
From your side or from other sides
We are responsible for
And from all the groups, and We sealed the chamber upon them.
Finally, we found ourselves... and then His Highness's intervention was of great importance.
From this, interventionist actions are derived.
Everything is over without mentioning it now.
And his message was clear when he said, "We know our size, our place, our role, and so on," as if...
Wished to play a role without provoking any other party.
Is it Arab, national, or regional?
But still
It became a responsibility.
Did you want that or not?
We try to prevent some jealousy because we are a nation.
These countries
It can be done.
I think this will be a profitable mix.
Last question, your relationship with Washington, is it a long-term relationship, is it a regular or special one?
I can say that our relationship with Washington is good.
It doesn't mean that we don't differ in our views on some issues.
But this is our right if they talk about democracy, this is democracy.
How is it good? How can you interpret it in real life?
If we talk about the economy, it's excellent, and if we talk about education, it's excellent as well.
Although health is good, but if we talk about politics, I can say it's good.
In your opinion, and we will clarify it in the next stage.
In my opinion, we should set aside confronting Israel.
And if we want to stop the display in the Arab court
And heal the enmity between the Palestinians.
We agree on one opinion so that we are a respected force.
I don't think we own
To be effective.
Thank you for watching, dear viewers, and we'll meet again, God willing. Best regards.
Welcome, viewers, to this dialogue with the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani.
In this dialogue
We attempt to explore the political reality of the Arabs and Arab efforts.
His Highness Sheikh
To investigate what is happening in Gaza.
And I hope through this dialogue that we can
Highlight some of your questions.
The brutal Israeli incursion into Gaza
Our goal was a unified Arab stance.
Dealing with friendly nations
Sister countries
And how can we find a clear and strong Arab stance on Arab issues, one that is effective and able to influence, at a time when the international arena has become a battlefield of intense conflicts, and is almost devoid of any Arab presence or impact?
Then we find areas of agreement.
From our perspective, we know that more than one Arab country has been violated.
In a demeaning manner
And no one was punished.
We are punished for everything, whether intentionally or unintentionally.
We are the specialized people.
In the world, and they are the only ones who always hit the target.
Always disciplined in a way.
I think
Insofar as we cannot
Meeting at the leadership level
Halting the disciplinary surveillance campaign
We did not wish to find a rift in the Arab world.
And there were five other oral statements.
By a two-thirds majority
But the purpose of the meeting is not
They wish their opinion was right and ours was wrong because it has no goals.
To solve the problem, not to hold a summit.
But will that be solved by the blood of the Palestinians?
What we are asking for now is that the ministerial request to Qatar not be canceled.
His Highness confirmed that.
In the speech he delivered, we said that we do not insist on holding the summit in Qatar if it will cause any embarrassment. We don't insist on that. The summit can be held anywhere.
An Arab stance that others respect us for.
Yes, and the ministerial.
We want to inform them that the Security Council resolution has been issued.
and Israel
He was not involved in the decision and continued killing and bombing in Gaza and still is.
The Arab asked: What are we going to do about it?
What will we do?
Is it when Israel ends?
To implement the rest of the Security Council resolution
Or a market will be held because Israel has not stopped.
Shooting, and we do not force our brothers.
Until a decision is considered final.
A few days ago
We will talk about the ministerial meeting.
We'll support you in the end.
Of course we support holding an Arab summit, and this was our idea, and some other countries also requested it, including Syria and Yemen.
An excellent Arab from before
Or classify us in the camp of moderation.
And the camp of the non-mediators.
And what do they mean by immoderation?
What the West has sorted out.
Moderate and non-moderate Arabs
You won't find a moderate or non-moderate state.
And we want to know what is moderation and what is extremism. Is moderation following Israel's plans?
And end the matter in a humiliating way.
Or we just leave the file open.
I mean, this is an important matter.
Is this the countries?
They follow Israel's plans and want to solve problems in their ways.
I don't want to say that he follows Israeli plans, and I don't want to accuse anyone.
But I say
The Camp of the Justifiers
What is the modifier from the Western perspective?
Do we agree to slaughter a certain category of Palestinians?
Of course, the elections were held.
I am neither a supporter nor an opponent of Hamas, but I am speaking from reality.
The current reality is that there exists
Idea
What some people call the radical movement
But we must ask ourselves: What does this radical movement demand?
Demanding something other than her rights or demanding her rights.
Or will we sort them?
And create other blocks as well.
Against because we
Arab and intellectually domestic peers
And it begins to happen.
That's why we don't want to fight a war on behalf of others.
Yes, Your Highness, in brief.
Who convened the Arab Summit?
I can't say they prevented it; there were some attempts, and the matter is almost known.
Subject of prevention
But as I said, we could have.
Voted and got two-thirds of the votes.
But that was not the goal, because it's not a matter of challenge as much as it is a matter of urgent need, that's what we believe.
While others saw it as a non-urgent need.
We went to the Security Council.
Or there could be a resolution in the Security Council.
But the decision rests with the Security Council; Israel said it would finish the job and then consider the matter.
All I want to focus on again
We will not exert efforts to implement the decision regarding the weaker party.
What will make it different from the first match?
In programs where conversations are exchanged, disagreements and lack of consensus sometimes occur.
As much as
Will we be ready to take a clear Arab stance?
Humanitarian aid
Greatly support our brothers
And also to address the Israeli side and say
I think everyone is not ready for that, we are supposed to investigate the matter.
Why don't we freeze it?
84 And we are committed to a truce, 84 but the Israelis are not committed to it.
It is inevitable that there will be disagreements in meetings, but in reality, these disagreements
They represent their attitudes and what's in their hearts.
One of the reported altercations
He described Hamas' movement as "scattered."
Not even a few of them.
This situation arose and we responded to it; I and a brother of mine among the ministers.
And I think this is what the West says.
These are radical moves, twists, and other names for actions.
And we do not want to be slaves to others.
And thus they always and forever mean, and I do not intend them to refer to anyone in particular.
Every foreigner they found.
A Western country or Western countries
Among the Arabs
Now, Your Highness
A Call for a Second Ministerial Meeting
Her agenda should be one thing.
Where are you, Arabs, from all this, and what is the position of the nation of three hundred and something?
One million Israeli products are on sale.
Issued following Resolution 1068
The issued decision.
Israel has not carried it out, it will carry it out after completing the mission.
And there is no doubt that the Arab delegation has made an effort.
Ladir yerye miyere yishker herye herye haker haker haker haker haker.
We have the right to demand the application of Chapter VII because Israel is above the law, Israel.
And when they are asked about it, they say, "We have knowledge."
It's not the Arabs' fault if they were
If that's the case, Israel won't be asked.
He is above international law.
This is a fact.
Why did you go to the Security Council, and why did you link the Arab summit to what the Security Council will issue?
At the summit, the Security Council will try on our behalf.
He needs a difficult decision.
Decision
He can bring down a high-ranking official's website.
We were terrified of the West.
And we work hard after they make their decision.
I don't want to stray from the topic.
It is the responsibility of the attackers to rebuild the entire Iraq with their own money, especially since they are the ones who destroyed it.
We do not demand from the Iraqi government, nor do we demand for those who died.
No compensation.
The same thing happened in Sudan when talks began about prosecuting Bashir.
His Excellency
His Highness Sheikh
A Major Arab Diplomatic Victory at the Security Council
Listen, there were some difficulties in the Security Council because the first speech was about issuing a presidential statement.
Results
Israel did not comply with it.
He will comply with that in two days, after a week, after completing the task.
After they didn't agree with her.
Unfortunately, people have to assemble it.
After Israel completed the tasks, it agreed to that.
Do you have an alternative to the decision now?
All we did
Some brothers, unfortunately, make some effort.
They participated in the siege of Gaza.
I am pro-West and it doesn't bother me that we have relations with the West, and I am not anti-West.
Anti-West is not anti-America.
But these people understand the language of interests.
Your friends if you are strong.
Or do you have a different opinion?
And in the end they'll take one percent from us and say we WON.
What is victory?
"By what it contains" or "with what it includes" (depending on context)
I cannot say anything about precautions at the moment because the decision has not yet been made.
The council is master of itself.
You participated in the formation.
Yes, we participated in the founding to some extent.
But you weren't invited to the meeting with the Arab ministers and the US Secretary of State.
But I think the brothers who went were enough.
I pointed to Arab parties in some matters that concern you.
In this regard, Sir.
For two years up until this moment
Listen, I don't want to talk about accusations.
I can't pretend that we knew everything.
They are people.
There was Israeli rejection, international rejection, and we also participated in this rejection.
And from there the conflict began and the siege started.
During the ceasefire agreed upon last month, Israel killed twenty-eight Palestinians.
"And we seek refuge from them until they are hungry and taste the punishment. Wish we had offered them a sacrifice beforehand, but they came like a darkness from the dawn."
Those parties, Your Highness.
Say clearly that the Palestinian conflict is your raised flag.
I mean, if it exists.
Who created the Palestinian conflict? Perhaps there was a Palestinian conflict.
Tell one party: "You are one hundred percent correct."
I'm not saying Hamas is 100% right.
I neither claim that nor say it.
Yes, the mediator is usually in the middle and equidistant from everyone.
We are not like the Arabs, who are closer to anyone than they are to each other.
But we don't want it to continue existing, so we must end it by any means necessary.
Once training soldiers on the left and once on the right
And once by besieging them and not giving them any money or salaries.
And after we establish a positive lifestyle in the West Bank.
Let the people of Gaza see how people live.
Luxurious living
In Gaza, the opposite is true.
I was invited to a second ministerial meeting, an Arab ministerial gathering this time.
Gentlemen, the talk is still revolving around her in the corridors of Hamas through Turkish mediation.
This meeting you were invited to attend seems to want to trick you.
It would be a trick if we made another move.
We have no initiatives.
With this number
Because Egypt is an important Arab country.
Taking a role is requested, and we support any Egyptian effort made to reach an understanding.
But it's important.
Do not come.
Tomorrow, with a party, she overcame another gathering.
Path of Harmony
Balanced Egyptian Initiative
Between international requirements, Arab requirements, and human requirements
And the requirements of Egypt's role, which is an important role.
It is a leading Arab country that we all respect and appreciate.
In your opinion, this is what is required from Egypt.
The current proposals, the current initiative, do not meet these requirements, Sir.
I have a vision for this initiative.
We hear some information from time to time.
I can't comment on something I don't know.
With all due respect to the Palestinian government or presidency that should be there, we all recognize the Palestinian presidency.
And there are also people
Those injured on another side, we must also take their perspective.
Until we complete these intermediate tasks
On the other hand, adopting this perspective
Hamas' position is clear that this decision did not take our viewpoint into account, so how was it issued?
The decision to involve the Arabs in its formulation without referring to or listening to the viewpoint of the main party concerned about the issue.
All we want, of course, we deal with Palestine as a state.
And we deal with the authorities as one party.
But now there is a split in a party somewhere, and another party elsewhere.
This does not mean that if we deal with people from Gaza, we have to stop dealing with people who are in the bank or in the Palestinian presidency.
We deal with the Palestinians as one people and one government.
They ask a person from Gaza to be with them.
And now we start coordinating with each other.
What was announced about him.
He decided that he hadn't said mechanical, welcomed the Egyptian initiative and any other initiatives.
Some considered it a mechanism.
This is an interpretation, but from my reading of this decision, it welcomes the Egyptian initiative.
We hope that the Egyptian initiative will succeed in carrying out its tasks.
The fighting stopped.
I have no doubts about our brothers in Egypt.
Because Israel did not accept the Security Council resolution.
And you consider this resolution to be non-existent because Israel did not accept it.
Even if he accepts it later, things on the ground will change.
Yes, Your Highness, when talking about Egyptian efforts.
In cooperation with Turkish efforts at the same time
An Arab excuse
Or the Arab conflicts that cannot be resolved, so he came to fill a vacuum.
Arab parties are supposed to fill it out.
I welcome Turkey's stance.
An appreciable stance from Arabs and Muslims.
Turkey is an Islamic country.
Therefore, this role is natural.
And that people follow him.
There are no Arabic pronouns to solve the crisis.
Someone will say, "Let them complete the task."
There must be a clear Arab stance and an end to all this aggression, its continuation, and its procrastination.
There will be an opposing Arab stance.
Israel can postpone the decision, I am not talking about an Arab-Israeli war, and we have always been advocates of peace.
And we are a country that loves to live in peace.
But I do not call for an Arab war, but I call for
A clear Arab stance
In the context of initiatives and proposals, you follow what is happening.
Hamas' proposals and packages of conditions
Do you think?
Now as an on-the-ground observer
The politician who emerged from the military operation will now enable Hamas to impose its conditions.
Must he be right?
We agree on this point and disagree on this point.
The second one.
I don't know about these negotiations, as I told you, they are not there. Ah, now they are negotiating.
The second one.
Vacant positions for experienced Arabs
This Arab reality
We witnessed it after the start of those operations.
It seems that there is a very advanced position being taken by the Arab street.
Our governments
Of course, I feel sorry that some people describe this gift, offered by the people, as...
Once again, they are telling me this issue.
Represents the views of the people.
The presidents now.
I mean, if they want to.
At least they see what.
The course has both a high ceiling and a low ceiling.
Against normalization and diplomatic relations with Israel.
Qatar to
Closing the Israeli representative office in Doha
Qatar, which adopts this position
The Arab side should be radical and take radical positions.
What Arabs agree upon is a collective agreement.
Absolutely, if an Arabic agreement is found.
A treaty is one thing, and relations are another.
We are ready.
Marching with our Arab brothers
Just if there were a clear Arab decision and credibility.
They are dealing with others, not just countries with which they have relations.
But also countries that do not have any of them.
Very important
Don't be agents for others.
He says, "Why shouldn't Qatar be a model in this field?"
If this is the only model, we are ready to join it.
But we also want
An Arab model that Qatar adheres to as part of its Arab commitment.
Like
"And let them not deprive one another of their rights in transactions."
Our problem is the lack of trust between Arab countries.
Even if the water of the lush, overflowing heart were darkened by secrets... I would not reveal them to the volcano of revealed stars, nor would I say them to the trustees.
Therefore, it is very important.
For formal invitations anywhere because we must rise above this.
Some called the ambassador a persona non grata and demanded his departure like Chavez.
And this is part of the disagreement.
Some of them invited the ambassador, and those who invited also invited the permanent member states, and all of these are films about our people.
We talked about the modest ceiling of people's demands.
For fleeting hopes, some seek the opening of fronts, and some ask Syria to open its front with Israel.
I told you we call for peace, not war with Israel.
"And we do not intend to fight Israel."
To confront Israel
And how do they agree?
This is also a problem.
What makes us talk to each other and helps us overcome our differences.
What you said, Your Highness, has truly captured my attention.
Provided that countries do not sell each other.
What do you mean?
I mean now.
The street won't spare us.
His Highness Sheikh
Is what's happening today a continuation of a project that started during the Lebanon War in 2006?
Or there may be a disagreement.
I don't think there are some differences in the goals.
Lebanon is a free land.
Some parts of the course are designated as a deposit for the United Nations.
We live in a time.
Lebanon, I mean that we have dealt with the Lebanese situation remarkably.
Israel, of course, needs weak states around it.
To dominate and control with long arms.
A foreign country or countries, of course, there are states that support them.
Therefore, she wants to remain the only power in the region.
And now they want
For change, an example with Gaza.
In Lebanon, people speak to you in several dialects.
And how many sides does it have?
And in Palestine, there is only one side.
But I assure you once again that the problem in Palestine is that they listened too much to many Arabs and foreigners.
And from here the void began, and everyone thinks they can control the other side.
In your opinion as a viewer and follower
It will end as planned, with broken bones.
Do we, the Arabs, accept this because it might happen again to those who disobey?
Or he expresses his opinion.
Are Israelis or others in the future?
We set a great example.
Obedience and assistance in breaking bones.
We have a moral saying: "Me and my brother against my cousin, and me, my brother, and my cousin against the stranger."
Now we are supposed to have any dispute with Hamas, and I am not saying that Hamas or anyone else is infallible from making any mistake.
Everyone has flaws.
Now we must leave this matter.
He made a part kneel on its knees.
Because failure here will not be the failure of the group.
His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar was trying to make suggestions, as I recall, some time ago.
Initiatives to reach solutions happened in Lebanon.
That happened in Darfur, and we will talk about it in a minute, even if we are in a hurry.
That we
We don't want to rely on our brothers because there are some sensitivities at times.
That single country will undertake all these initiatives, we do not object as long as there is a solution.
Our goal now is not to make Qatar a headline in the news.
It was not among His Highness the Amir's objectives.
One of his goals was to stop the bloodshed.
And stop the hegemony.
What happened was greater than imagination.
And we are in Qatar.
Do we know anything they don't? I don't think so.
But the most important thing is to have good intentions.
To reach a solution that preserves dignity.
Talking about initiatives, it is useful to know what has been achieved by the initiative concerning Darfur regarding the Justice and Equality Movement.
The Sudanese government in Khartoum
And the discussion will mainly revolve around resolving the Darfur issue, as the Darfur problem initially stemmed from...
The Arabs helped.
But we don't ignite an issue we've made international.
On the basis of revenge against the regime, and here we are now wanting to solve the issue, and we do not know how.
And we always strive, as I mentioned earlier, to implement decisions. We are the best at implementing decisions.
Disqualifying the case from the competition, is there also a competition in the Darfur case?
I don't want to go through this.
Before we conclude, Your Highness, there is an economic summit.
Will this summit be held, will you attend it?
We will not attend the summit.
We wished it could be held in a different atmosphere than the Arab atmosphere, but it was programmed.
It will be a disgrace.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Welcome to all the Arab leaders attending this conference.
When Palestinian blood was shed in Gaza, and now they gather there for financial and economic reasons.
Assistance with heating
But it seems that no one is afraid of this street.
Circumstances are unknown. Of course, I hope nothing bad happens to us, but safety is the priority.
And for prevention
But no one puts anyone in their little pocket.
Thank you very much, His Excellency the Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani.
Dear viewers, wherever you are, peace be upon you.
So how useful is this celebration and the credibility of the statements of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights?
People with disabilities are the most neglected in the world.
What about our Arab region and the extent of its interest in this matter?
Will we have any other questions besides these in today's session?
Former Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
She holds a Bachelor of Arts in Social Work and Sociology from Qatar University.
Master's degree in Social Planning and Social Policies from Helwan University in Egypt
And held several positions in the field of disability.
She was a founding member and general coordinator of the National Committee for Disability Affairs.
In nineteen eighty-nine
And Vice President of the National Committee for Disability Affairs since 1999.
Until the year 2003
He also contributed to the establishment of the Shafallah Center for People with Special Needs.
For people with disabilities in Qatar
Our guest has overseen the launch of numerous programs, projects, and media campaigns.
Activities related to people with disabilities in the Arab world
I also contributed to delivering lectures and participating in meetings, conferences, and forums.
Welcome Mrs. Hassa to our show.
People with disabilities
Initially, we never used the term "disabled" in the 1980s and possibly earlier.
A broader educational concept
Those who provide them with this instruction
An important document was found at the United Nations in eighty-nine and three.
We will mention the details later on.
From other regions, although there are regions that are not from developing countries or classified as poor.
And Latin America in particular, where this trend is stronger in Latin America than in any other region.
However, the statistics proved otherwise.
There is a trend toward legal rights in the Arab world, and it is found in many countries.
Resources and political will may also exist.
Okay, listen, there are some statistics you might know.
Eighty percent of them are from poor countries.
UNESCO says that around ninety percent of children with disabilities from poor countries do not go to school.
Professor Hissa, how can you not comment on these statistics?
It is largely true.
I have seen in Darfur, Gaza, and in areas subjected to such events, wars and conflicts.
There, you cannot distinguish between a disabled person and a healthy one, due to the large number of disabled people.
In fact, the illiteracy rate among children is almost thirty-five or forty-five percent.
And in other countries
Many barriers prevent these children from attending school, even without disabilities.
In fact, the city doesn't have the infrastructure even if this child finds a school.
He can't access it.
For children and other residents
These plans and projects are great, but we barely hear about them.
What's the point of this celebration, except when we talk about the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, which the world celebrated just a few days ago?
The situation in the world
Better than people without disabilities.
Organizations arrived and established numerous projects.
Implementing a critical health strategy
Through this strategy
There are intersections between humanitarian affairs and working with marginalized groups such as people with disabilities.
Now there is a level of awareness in the Arab world, and things are better.
At the point of awareness, we pause to receive calls and continue our conversation.
Thank you.
I have two questions I'd like to ask her because she used to work at the United Nations.
The second point
United Nations laws calling for the fight against systems that hinder society, such as the Syrian intelligence system, are now in effect.
Is there a law that allows for the prosecution of the entire regime, as in the case of Syria?
Yes, Suleiman, your question is clear. Suleiman Kraou from Syria, thank you. We also have Nayef Saeed from Kuwait, welcome Nayef.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Peace be upon you
Good evening
Good evening and welcome.
Mentally and intellectually disabled
Arabs say: "A free man understands by gestures."
"It is He who created for man speech. Is it not Allah who is the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate?"
I sat for thirty years without uttering a single word or two a day.
Let the Lord be praised, for He has given me speech.
I referred to the Holy Quran and found
People attack me because I use the Quran as a reference and consider me a hypocrite.
They attack me, unaware that they are in the depths of hell.
I have nothing but lies.
And they do not speak the truth.
If your house is made of glass, don't throw stones at others.
Of course, psychological disabilities.
Regarding Brother Suleiman's inquiry, it also falls within the same definition.
United Nations programs or their reactions regarding the causes of disability, such as political or other goals.
Reach out to various agencies and organizations.
Talking to them, convincing them, and knowing the extent of that.
There are disability issues and cases on their agendas.
UNESCO, the International Labour Organization, and UNICEF, and the fact that these organizations already pay attention to the issue of disability.
It is one of the programs that strive to not lose track of disabled children.
With good opportunities and great schools.
From various environmental aspects
UNICEF as well
But we must acknowledge that there are shortcomings at the United Nations as well.
What are the main weaknesses and shortcomings you've mentioned?
United Nations
The issue of routine and bureaucracy
I was in my country, Qatar.
However, it embraced the monotony and bureaucratic routine that hinder.
My work is especially challenging during times of scarcity or restriction of certain resources.
Their struggle or attempt to grapple with those who suffer from disability on their behalf for the recognition of their rights.
Until it reaches a somewhat acceptable level, unless it is included in a separate article as requested by the Global Disability Movement.
Just take up a somewhat suitable part.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. There is no bond between them except the mercy and blessings of Allah.
That is one of its most important shortcomings.
Special Rapporteur's questionnaire circulated to States
Among the employees or individuals working on these programs
We consider ourselves unlucky to have received only three responses out of the forty-eight organized bodies and agencies, and these three organizations were the only ones that bothered to reply.
Do not put.
The issue of disability is persistent, stable, and ongoing for many years, despite being primarily a human rights issue.
In the recent period, praise be to God, from two or three years ago.
The issue of disability has been raised at least through events such as seminars and the like.
Peace be upon you
Madam, why are there no binding laws and decisions for Arab countries? Who is responsible for activating these international systems?
Regarding Arab countries and salary allocation, for example, the salary of disabled individuals.
Are there funds allocated by the United Nations?
Will this money go to governments or to UN agencies? And will this aid actually reach people with disabilities?
**Final Note** **If there are no binding decisions for Arab states**
Thank you very much, Ahmed Halabi from Greece.
With us is Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia. Hello, Ibrahim.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
Let her adopt this proposal.
Addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations
Converted to this box
A productive factory.
Allocating only one percent of the annual net profit
I return to our guest to answer callers' questions.
He said that the doctors advised him to have an operation.
It costs a lot and he can't afford it, so where can he get help?
He is from Algeria.
I think it's important to meet Brother Naji's needs.
Like any other rights, the rights of persons with disabilities.
It is the citizen's right to acquire all these rights and duties.
To join the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, this agreement is legally binding.
Fulfilling the rights and needs of people within the national framework.
Or even at the non-governmental level
A binding sequel for all nations, the sole purpose of which is to ensure the implementation of these laws.
At the very least, there should be awareness, especially among top officials.
That is inevitable at least if we work on those treaties in this way.
Even if there is no strong commitment to that.
Are there any responses to the follow-up reports you're making, and has there been any interest in them?
But don't forget customs, it's a morally binding document, not a legal one.
He has an obligation to be legally documented.
Recognizing that these issues will be resolved, discussed, or addressed within the context of a community suffering from numerous problems.
Najee Zakherneh, Manager, National Center for Deaf Experts in Sign Language in Al Jazeera
First and foremost, Mr. Ali would like to extend his sincere gratitude to Al Jazeera.
This episode is now broadcasting live.
Now Ali is speaking and saying that he is very proud.
She was a servant to all the special needs people in the place where she was and still is.
We support her and stand with her always and forever.
I also say that there are many people with special needs.
Some people are unaware of this agreement because no training sessions have been offered.
Around them, especially in schools, hospitals, or in public and private institutions.
And it is necessary to publish this agreement.
Law dealing with people with disabilities in all countries of the world.
I emphasize and urge these countries for the sake of
Adoption and signing of this agreement
Like the State of Qatar, some countries have signed this document aimed at serving people with disabilities and serving us.
Many thanks to my colleague Naji, who speaks on behalf of Ali.
Thank you very much.
Your opinion might make a decision.
The former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, we can start with a suggestion from caller Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
Creating a fund to support
A charity box that accepts any donations from countries.
This means that the fund is supposed to be spent on the activities that the Special Rapporteur carries out when he is busy with
And even the Arab states have once offered donations from only one country: Syria.
Fulfilling those commitments is a problem within the United Nations, hence
Box
Lack of commitment and interest from member states, unfortunately.
And unfortunately, many people boldly say: "We don't care about the situation now."
In fact, it's a matter of duties.
On human rights.
In its broad and general form
The marginalized, especially
For this reason, there is that covenant.
It is a good idea from the noble brother that these countries should fulfill their obligations.
Above all, it is essential that there not be a separate box isolated from the others, but rather that the organizations already present in the region be autonomous in their forms.
from what is in their balances
Special projects were presented for people with disabilities in Gaza.
Assistive devices for people with disabilities
The issue always involves political factors.
The state or government of this country guarantees its strong support.
Reducing the number is extremely regrettable.
For nominal amounts
The father is disabled.
Of course, she was stripped of her citizenship.
They took his daughter from him.
Sometimes from
Teaching problems
Traveling or going out, we are confused.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Peace be upon you too.
And we can
They intend to rebuild it, while they have knowledge of it.
I hope that Arab countries will allocate a portion of their budget
Many thanks, Bahjah Qaran from Kuwait.
Aisha Mohammed from Qatar, hello.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
Good evening to you and Sheikhah Bint Khalifa.
I just want to send her a message of thanks and appreciation.
In recent years
With our warmest wishes, from us, the parents of children with special needs.
For the continuous support of Sheikhah Hessa to them.
A noble standard-bearer from Tunisia, welcome.
Another level is the genetic one.
I think there is genetic care that reduces the percentage of disabled people.
In our Arab customs, a cousin marries his cousin and the tradition continues like this.
In this way, at this level, the level of disability and thank you.
Can you comment on what the viewers said?
Indeed, as I mentioned on the national level.
I know there are programs for guidance and support.
Fall under healthcare services
Which is also under the umbrella of Hamad Medical Corporation.
I think within the psychiatric clinic as well as the programs in the Supreme Council for Education.
The Ministry of Special Education, to be honest, I don't know if it still exists or not.
Certainly, within healthcare services, yes, there is support and there are medical services.
Rehabilitation is available for these cases.
Prevention is better than cure, he pointed out the genetic factor and consanguineous marriage. Are there any awareness campaigns?
For example, to raise awareness.
In this area
Certain that this is a very important and serious point.
One of the things that I and others have addressed with many words and numerous posts.
Yes, there are awareness campaigns, and they are not limited to any specific entity.
Implemented by the World Health Organization
And also UNICEF.
Now in many Arab countries, including Qatar
And certainly Tunisia.
Now there is a binding decision for early inspection.
Implemented in many countries.
All this is from the perspective of prevention.
And do such campaigns receive any positive reaction?
Especially when you clash with customs and traditions.
Of course, the difficulty lies when it clashes with the collective culture.
Let us have the desire to make decisions, strategies, and the will to deal with them and be committed to them.
The issue of early detection, for example, is a very important issue before marriage.
I ask if there are statistics on people with disabilities.
Especially people with disabilities from the Arab region.
Text translated to Arabic.
Especially
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. With the recent events that have occurred in the region.
In regions and places that witness disputes, wars, and especially wars, confrontations, and other such events.
For every death, there are three disabled people.
And what happened in Lebanon, Darfur, and many other places.
This is not enough by any means, and firstly the subject.
Human rights principles
Plans and schemes for the disabled must exist.
Agenda within established institutions in government and non-government ministries
In circumstances such as war or unrest
Only the words of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay.
In the world, the strangest thing is what the International Committee for the Monitoring of Disability Rights said about the population census.
To this extent, people with disabilities are not included in statistics conducted on the resident population.
They don't always announce.
For example, in the census that was conducted in the State of Qatar, I think it was more than five years ago.
Frankly
In collaboration with the Planning Council and
The Council prepared it as a fait accompli, with our participation as the Special Rapporteur's office.
Adding more categories to the deficit
Needs are assumed to exist.
The types of those needs, all these important details that should lead you to a conclusion.
Is there a person with a disability or not?
But at least
Statistics are advancing in some way in this regard.
Peace be upon you
Lady of high standing, thank you for this program, and thanks also to Her Highness Sheikhah Hessa.
But I thank God that I am Qatari and receive all this care from my country.
My daughter is now a student at independent schools and is receiving a good education, praise be to God.
I would like to extend my gratitude to Ms. Hessa.
Its motivational role and its role in making us not fear or worry about our children.
Praise and thanks to God, and thanks to her and those who rely on this category.
Many thanks to Fatima Al-Dosari from Qatar, along with another Qatari woman, Latifa.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
My dear sister, reality, expectations, and what we anticipate is the solution to our children's problems.
What is the role of the sheikha for our Qatari children?
I hope you can answer this question.
Peace be upon you
And I attest to the special services provided by the State of Qatar for people with hearing impairments.
We had a program for early detection of hearing loss.
Supreme Council for Persons with Disabilities
For individuals with special needs, regardless of the type of their disability.
Even civil society associations, non-governmental organizations, or other local communities
Because reality and what we hope for after five years, when compared,
What was not available to the disabled five years ago is now.
Many thanks to Karim Naseem from Jordan, now we return to our guest.
Of course
The society as a whole, its individuals, and especially its families with children.
Children with disabilities have great ambitions and expectations.
Whether at the planning level or the actual substantive level
Respecting one of the points you mentioned, which is of utmost importance.
Children who cannot obtain documents or otherwise, whether in Qatar or elsewhere.
The international convention, like many international documents, ...
I committed to translating that into plans and strategies.
To provide those services automatically
Based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, regardless of religion, race, color, gender, or sexual orientation.
Okay, Sheikha Hissa, you were a Special Rapporteur in the past and worked at the United Nations on disability issues for six years.
Did you want to?
Perhaps there wasn't enough time or the financial aid wasn't sufficient.
There are many achievements that have been accomplished, and I am proud of them.
Through my participation or through existing organizations and government institutions in many countries.
Especially in the Middle East
There will be more research and comprehensive studies.
We started with a global survey and had more than one report.
Awareness is an ongoing process that must be continuously and significantly worked on.
Coordination among Arab countries
And among the people themselves, persons with disabilities and their organizations because they
But they have a duty they must fulfill.
They have to fight for it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Dear viewers, at the end of this episode, I would like to thank everyone who shared their opinions and comments with us.
Tomorrow, God willing, we will welcome a new guest.
Join us with your messages and contributions in a new episode of "Live" with safety.
Good morning.
I'm very glad you came to us.
First, before we start asking you various questions and talking to you this morning,
Thank you, Shaima. I might have already congratulated you.
The entire Middle East deserves that international achievement.
Qatar has marked a precise spot on the global football map.
Thank you, Qatar.
Also me, go ahead oh! Ali
First, I'd like to greet the viewers with a beautiful morning.
I express my congratulations to him and to all Qatari citizens on hosting
And God willing, as Sheikh Mohammed said,
It was a dream, and with God's permission, it will become a reality and a practical reality whose work will start from today or from the announcement period.
Did you expect Qatar to host the World Cup in 2022?
Weren't you afraid in this particular field, despite the strong files of countries like America, Japan, and Australia?
No, look, to be honest with you, I said the chance was ninety percent that Qatar would win it.
Very strong
Has global and competitive plans
We were rivals.
Why do we fear?
But praise be to God, Qatar's bid was very strong and deserved to win.
It is true that the 2022 World Cup bid will be in Qatar.
So what do the athletes themselves feel?
They are in the field, of course they feel overwhelming happiness, God willing.
I'd like to do that off the air, but we want to hear it on the air.
The moment of announcement.
Where were you? How did you receive the news? Were you surprised? Tell me and the viewers.
On the radio
Then all the people joined us.
They heard about that announcement.
How did she find the international media?
At the level of sports channels, the support was from everyone, especially the Arab channels, and praise be to God, everyone supported us.
At the moment they announced Qatar's win and hosting of the championship.
All Arab states announced their full support for Qatar through media, human resources, volunteers, and so on in the future.
Arab countries are known for their generosity.
Shaima, even at the level of global media.
I went to Souq Waqif at that time to celebrate.
Even the France-Presse news agency was filming there.
We also conducted interviews.
Everyone cooperated, Qatar is now mentioned daily.
a hundred times a day, considering it the smallest spot on earth.
I suppose everyone will know Qatar even online.
To host the World Cup in the year two thousand and twenty-two.
I mean, any footballer dreams of serving his country, of joining the national team.
Of course, any professional, whether in the Qatari league or elsewhere, wishes to play for the national team.
Therefore, it is a positive thing to make a huge effort at work.
He joins the upper class and employs all his efforts, even if he is in the upper class.
Whether in training or matches, because he wears the league's logo on his shirt, he must dedicate his energy.
Look, the officials have made a great effort in taking care of young players, teaching them professionalism from an early age.
Food, sleep
Tell me about your experience. You've played at several age levels. How was your experience, and what was the most important stage for you?
Of course
I progressed step by step in the league, from the youth teams to the first team.
Learn camps with the club and with the association.
Every stage has a special mark.
Yes, for us, God willing, you were moving between
We're used to you now as sporty Lana.
We always see you as an outstanding athlete. We loved watching you and keeping up with sports news through you. So, how is sports with you?
Frankly, I don't see a difference between them and talk shows; in talk shows, we hosted famous stars in their fields, and in sports, we also host stars.
Like Ali and the others in their sports arena.
On the contrary, the sports field is thriving.
Especially since we are the capital of sports.
And now Qatar has become the capital of sports and football in the world.
Instead of offering diverse programs that address social, economic, and cultural issues
There are different fields, volleyball, basketball, different champions.
But it's still a sport.
Dazzling, wonderful
I truly wished.
I wish I were ten now, not twenty-five.
So I think the young players have been given a very precious opportunity.
I hope they benefit from this opportunity.
Great, Ali, what do you want to say to the players?
With God's permission, the young players who will have a bright future in the coming days, God willing.
Of course, I told you it's an opportunity and they should seize it.
A golden opportunity.
So they have a great benefit in it.
Tell us, what are you doing? And what are the new upcoming shows that you will be presenting? I know we asked you to come during your vacation.
So tell us about your news, God willing.
We always keep a close eye on events and are gearing up for the Asian Cup, which will kick off in January.
We finished the Gulf Cup a few days ago. By the way, we congratulate Kuwait and its noble people on winning the Kuwaiti league.
The news bulletin is also available to cover events.
My first appearance in the media was on Qatari TV, of course, as I have roots that go back to Qatar TV.
I am grateful for their kindness.
Carrying the media message on a diverse channel.
Special channels, sports, or others
So, thank you, Qatar TV.
We wish you good luck, we're still on the same subject.
First, I would like to thank the Al Wakrah management.
I've been in Al Wakrah since I was young with its fans.
My childhood
The sheikh was here with us yesterday, Sheikh Nesr was with us.
I'm still at the club.
I'm still a son of Al Wakrah.
But, as I told you before the program started, professionalism.
Belonging to every individual in Qatar.
We know that young people love and are addicted to sports.
How can we make sports a social affair?
Media awareness primarily, the media plays an important role in promoting sports in various aspects of life.
I said that youth are addicted to it, as schools have also realized the importance of sports in the school curriculum.
Their celebration of any sporting event, for example.
In Qatar as well, you see signs on the streets, reflecting a sports-consciousness.
Allocating seats for women in stadiums and elsewhere
This also points to women's awareness and participation in the field of sports.
We now have a national league for women, dedicated to female players.
So I think that sports are evolving.
I also believe that this period of time
For producing massive projects and raising athletic awareness, I believe this period is sufficient and remains.
If considered and accomplished carefully.
Sufficient at the same time, and should be used wisely as you said.
Also, there's another point, which is how the young generation benefits from the league.
Everything is available, capabilities, experiences, and equipment.
Also, there's an important matter, thank God we're in Qatar, as all Arab and Gulf societies, as is well known, are famous for their passion for sports.
How can we attract this audience to follow sports news and football matches in Qatar?
And attending the games at the same time
Most Qatari audiences love sports and football, but the problem is that they do not attend matches.
When browsing forums on the web, you will find tremendous interest, especially in most club forums.
There is great interest in the football championship.
As a Qatari citizen, in your opinion, what is the best solution to attract you to attend events, aside from being a sportsman or player?
So what is the best way to attract the audience, for example, your friends?
It depends on the individual themselves, and there is no universal concept.
Some people like to watch it on TV on a Friday night at home.
For example, Japan has devised a wonderful plan to attract a wide audience.
When they attend the matches, they collect points or something else, so they are looking for solutions, therefore we should hope they think about this.
And Arab TV
The most important point is that every player will be here in Qatar, specifically in the year two thousand and twenty-two. Lana, what do you think we need?
What do we need, in your opinion, besides financial support?
Providing the means to make them ready as a national league and participate in the massive World Cup.
Time passed quickly with nice people, and when the producer told me the time was up, I said, "Really? God willing."
Always achieve the impossible, achieve the dream we thought was impossible, praise be to God we live it as a reality.
As Sheikh Mohammed said, these were moments to celebrate, but the hard work has just begun.
And with God's will, the year 2022 will be a landmark event for Qatar.
I congratulate everyone living in Qatar, and frankly, Qatar has become a global landmark.
Hosting 2022
Thank you, Lana, the brilliant presenter. I wish you success, and I will always make sure to watch your shows to know the sports news.
Thank you, certainly happiness.
Young Qatari talents
They sing a new, popular type these days.
But in a repetitive manner with music and a fast rhythm.
And also an amateur rap group, God willing.
Stay with us, we start now and good morning.
We try to take a quick look at it.
We can simply define rap as fast music.
Singing the words again but not in a fast and rushed sing-song.
Consists of numerous rhymes, addressing a variety of different topics and issues.
It can be personal sometimes,
Social, emotional, or political.
He is often controversial.
And very tolerant.
Rapping, our viewers don't echo the song lyrics.
But he repeats it.
He praises with his voice, which is considered a secondary element.
Phonetics are often irrelevant in rap songs.
For this reason, he is not called a singer, but a rap performer or rapper.
Rappers focus on the following elements in songs:
For example, flow, the flow of sounds, synchronization, and delivery.
They have followers, an audience, and fans.
They have their own style in rapping.
And I think they will give you a better idea than I personally can.
Good morning, welcome.
First of all, it was a time when we wanted to do something new.
To be distinguished in something.
So we said, "Why not rap?"
Hip hop art exists in all countries of the world.
So why is it not available in Qatar?
So we said, "Let's create something new."
We gave him an idea that includes a message.
We talk about the advantages and disadvantages that occur in society.
Art is therefore to convey a message, then a second message.
It is an art form, for science, that has addressed many social and psychological issues among youth in a radical way.
Time changes, and I think this has something to do with the change in time zones.
There was little acceptance before.
We've been singing since around the year two thousand and five, and the acceptance was little at first.
We can say that our new beginning was in two thousand and ten.
There is greater acceptance and popularity.
Have you noticed that people love to sing and perform in a way similar to rap style these days?
Yes, of course, a high percentage of people.
There's also something we want to talk about, you've been founders in many musical groups.
A beautiful gang, and I think you have parties. Can we talk about this gang?
How was the band formed? How did the idea of creating a musical band come to one of your minds? How many members are there in the band?
Initially, before we formed the band,
Rap arrived in Doha starting in 2005.
This means that anyone who loves the concept of rap and can rap, can sing it and upload it to the website.
I can download, Salman can download, someone can download, so there was a competition.
We met the people.
So we started competing with each other.
After all this time, after all these years, we have reached the year 2010.
Before 2010, the system was based on groups, meaning that this group was on its own, and another group consisted of three or four together.
So we said, "Why don't we unite as one group under the name 'Qatari Rappers'?"
Qatari rappers
So we agreed on this: we all said the same thing, and we stood together as one.
And we present this thing and say the idea itself.
About twenty-five people
Twenty-five! Wow, hopefully a large group.
Does any of you, or, or, or all of you want to rap?
Formatting and composing.
You could say it's personal.
Excellent, how does this number twenty-five organize in the band?
Every individual has their own future.
It means that every member of the band can make a whole song by themselves.
Without the help of anyone else.
But their abilities might differ; for instance, Salman is better than me.
He listens to her and tells me, "Change the word 'she', change something about her."
Each can turn into the other.
We help each other a little.
Or a company that accredits you, until an official body adopts these works,
And there will be appropriate distributors.
To present the work in a high-quality manner and give it an official stamp in your eyes.
Be frank, we hope to get support from a company that comes and adopts our actions by producing an album for us.
We don't have any problems.
Some things are a little difficult.
So why don't you think it could be your initiative first?
Introducing an individual to their first compact disc.
That way, you can attract companies in the future, what do you think?
Around the year two thousand and seven, I produced a CD.
I distributed to my friends.
How were the orders?
I think.
Average because rap in the second half of the seventeenth century was not dominant in the Gulf.
But they weren't as popular as they are now.
We were talking before the broadcast started, there are great groups like Valencia and Castro.
Shall we talk about her?
They said they would organize the party for you.
They provided all the costs, procedures, coordination, and work; we honestly didn't expect this level.
Frankly, we were surprised, and it was a great job.
But there was little pressure because there were no ads or anything before the show.
There were no ads or anything else two days before the party.
We assumed that no one would come due to the late notice.
When we were inside, before the party started.
That was a good point.
Which means that our voice reaches families as well, not just young people.
We thought the idea would appeal only to young people.
But at this point, we discovered that there were several age groups listening to us.
Is there a particular song the audience prefers?
The audience interacts with most songs.
Yes, most songs, but there were a lot of songs and we were many.
all the group
What are words, and how do they address different issues?
We're talking about the current situation.
At least
Even if they spoke
Haler smere halle.
I mean, there's a rhyme.
We think about every word and try to find better synonyms for it.
Agreed, you have some songs, let's listen to one of them.
One of the songs I produced.
We listen to him and see the public's opinion.
I hope they like the words.
Thank you, Ali. I loved the introduction because it mentioned the name of my show.
This is a KD and DJ AMR El-Eldoh's program.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
This Lady Bobo with Mr. KJ wants to get a hot body tattoo.
Don't forget, the show airs at 9:30 sharp. Everyone must watch.
Produced by Hassan Neama, presented by Shaima Al-Hamadani
The director is Nasser Al-Maliki, and the guests are Qatari rappers, of course.
Because it really contains the name of the program, thank you, gentlemen!
Warm applause to you and the people in the control room.
We streamed it last night.
And who wrote the words, was it him?
Each of them writes his own words.
For if I write to Joseph
It is not my intention to write this only because I love singing, but also because it is my passion.
I suppose you have to write about the 2022 World Cup and the Asian Cup, if possible.
Yes, certainly, we will personally compose a song about this topic.
But I don't think it can be official at this stage.
So I assume there must be some national songs.
Through the art of rap
Yes, in fact, today, everyone.
We are watching a live broadcast now.
The cup has arrived and the streets of Doha are decorated.
Dear viewers, as you saw, Doha has adorned itself in celebration of the Asian Cup.
Participating agencies have completed all preparations to host the event.
And there will be more crowds.
I suppose they'll gather along the corniche.
I'm sure they're ready to host that important sporting event.
Are there any parties coming up?
There are offers from an official entity, they promised to organize a party for us.
Yes, there are still some complications.
We are unsure due to some procedures and issues.
For we are trying, and I will see Joseph.
Some have a song as a theme.
If we find that it fits the song.
And the possibility of implementing them.
When I am at home.
Yusuf, hello my friend! How are you? I hope you are well.
This part of the song is dedicated to Joseph.
Do you also travel abroad?
In this field, those who have millions of fans.
Don't try to imitate anyone, but we listen to those who are pioneers in this field.
But we strive to be competitive.
Why don't we draw inspiration from some ideas and borrow a few things?
I'm taking the idea and applying it differently to my song, but in the opposite direction.
I formed a band and have more than one CD.
A person named Abdullah Al-Dail.
He has the experience and ability to detect groundwater.
This talent is the ability to detect groundwater reserves.
One of the residents of Marat town.
And the experts increased.
Who determines the location of groundwater before drilling?
Some wells require pumping, or it may be necessary to dig some wells in waterless areas.
With copper rods and pomegranate branches
Dates or figs, with them he finds water reserves.
What tools are used?
To discover groundwater
That was in ancient times.
Now, they have been replaced with copper rods.
And so we place the two rods parallel.
Walk slowly.
We notice when we walk along the watercourse.
The sticks will open.
Now, we are crossing a flowing river.
It opens like this.
When we crossed it, she started.
Now we are in the middle of a watercourse.
And here will be the middle house.
And thus, we can determine the path of water, or groundwater beneath the earth.
The process is repeated more than once in more than one location to find the site of greatest intensity.
Abu Ibrahim confirmed that.
At an advanced stage of this career path
For his great precision in his discoveries.
Once upon a time, outside once, in Shaqra, Harmala, and Al-Athithiya.
More than one hundred and fifty wells have been discovered.
The error rate does not exceed five percent.
He needs training, experience, and a gift from God.
Surpass modern equipment and laboratories.
In a short time
Abdulrahman Al-Marshed
Doha Morning Show
Northwest of the Saudi capital, Riyadh
We watched this report and promise you more reports from Arab and international countries.
And the Gulf states, if Allah wills.
And we reached various addresses, but they were all the same.
Meaningful
I assume there is a large group of Gulf youth in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
Are there specific people you follow as role models?
Follow him instead of imitating him.
There is a common bond among all Gulf dancers performing the "Daha."
It's not a competition, I mean if you write a song.
Dealing with a specific topic.
We can call it a meaningful competition.
We have acquaintances, but no one I can introduce you to.
In Saudi Arabia, there is Qusai, God willing.
He has fans and a CD.
Many companies want to adopt it.
Do you want to reach this stage, perhaps surpass this stage more and more, if God wills.
We wish you good luck through this team.
There, upon receiving the cup, let's watch some footage from the corniche.
In addition to a group of Qatari youths
That, even if borrowed from the West, is in a Gulf style.
There are also rap love songs, and a distinctive gang of twenty-five individuals.
It's important for us to stay in touch with you to know how you're doing.
Assume you have an email, website, or forum.
How can people communicate with you?
We had our own website.
There were some issues with the hosting company.
It would sometimes close without apparent reason.
As a result, we faced many problems and eventually closed it down.
No use, the site will definitely be closed.
So what's the solution? What are the alternatives to solve this problem?
United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, and even Morocco and Egypt
You have to keep interacting with them to know the latest news and the songs they produce from time to time.
So, what's the alternative now?
We currently rely on special pages like
By what name?
Okay, when you search for our name on Google.
Qatar's rap or rappers in Qatar
You can produce your own music video.
Regarding the program, you worked on it yesterday.
We uploaded many videos to YouTube.
Songs accompanied by images
Song with pictures 🌅🌊🦞🐚🏖️🌳🌻🍉🍦🍃 <h1>Sunrise over the sea</h1>
I think we need to see more improvement from you.
One place to gather you all is better than having the equipment in each of your homes.
Mixer, piano, computer, guitar
Frankly, I hope we find support.
For example, a company.
CD production
They allocated a special place for us.
We work alone.
At the end of the day, we still work for ourselves.
We don't want that.
It's not different from what Joseph said.
We need a music video.
And album
Videos make the song go viral quickly.
Transmits ideas quickly.
If there is support, everything else will eventually fall into place.
And your sweet throat sings in every place.
It is a kind of art that deals with various issues and problems.
Thank you, Youssef Al-Naem and Salman Al-Abdullah, for attending.
"A glance at it and we wish them all the best in the name of our program, men."
These projects, yes.
There is also a project that is almost ready but needs some technical development.
Expiration Date
When you go to the cashier, have the total amount and all the details ready.
Describes the goods instead of reading the components of each commodity.
While walking with the cart
It is attached to the shopping cart, so one can choose the desired item.
Most projects reflect children's perception of the problem.
He has many activities and goals.
The center offers a range of programs and activities that focus on one central idea.
We have ten goals set by Her Highness Sheikha Moza when establishing the center.
Also possible, yes
He takes it directly to the metro from his house.
But his idea is that it's meant for clothes.
All shirt shops in Qatar will appear here.
It can also be with the car key, I make a button.
He locates the things I've lost and takes me to the key.
Yes, let's get back to the projects the center will work on.
Raising children in their early educational stages
Developing skills and nurturing talents
Therefore, it varies from child to child according to their different skills, media, and research skills.
Personal skills, such as public speaking and persuading audiences
Skills vary, and we have developed a special program to cater to them.
We started with future media, achieved great success in this project, and reached the end, the project graduated.
We also have numbers of children and young speakers.
And their creations pleaded with them...
Do you have young presenters?
On television, it is important for children's channels to broadcast programs specifically designed for children.
We're getting them ready for the TV show.
Through their television, Qatar TV
We raise them until they reach eighteen springs.
We welcome them wherever they are.
Our national television as well.
We need to attract, explore, and develop these talents.
Whether it's media or research.
Intellectual dimensions
Reading and various fields
Is there collaboration? Do you exchange ideas?
In all fields, such as the promising speakers' programs sponsored by the Ministry of Endowments.
Our exhibition, the Generation Exhibition
The scientific club played a significant role in improving projects as well as providing technical support.
The main role was for the Higher Education Council, with the support of schools and partners.
Mr. Abdullah, moving to a building like Katara,
which also embodies a variety of activities and clubs
Do you consider that a push towards more success?
In addition to moving to a separate building
Regardless of the enormous place
Facilitated dealing with the public.
It is one of the pioneering and excellent projects.
And receiving the guest and introducing him to the programs presented to the child
Our main project for the next three years
National Reading Development Project
Under the patronage of Sheikhessa Hessa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani
Adopted and supported this project
It is a flagship project that addresses the development of reading, storytelling, and child development.
Various cultural skills related specifically to reading
Certainly, there are different programs.
We recently moved.
We are rearranging some activities.
Its design and improvement to keep up with Katara visitors
We wish you good luck through this center.
It contains very important ideas.
First, I'd like to thank you for hosting.
The most important thing is, whenever we deal with children, we discover that
Today's childhood is different from ours.
They need more care, focus, and time.
Listen to his hobbies, imagination created him.
I address him intellectually.
They ... %bou, their way of treating their children as if it's a hotel, providing accommodation.
Or like a bank, provides money.
Children really need someone to listen to those ideas and imagination.
Over the past few days, we were relocated to another site in the second third, somewhere between two and three thousand.
At this exhibition
I wish success to the winning projects.
Thank you for being here, Mr. Abdullah Al-Jamali, Director of the Children's Cultural Center. We wish you success.
Let these projects become a reality and not remain dreams forever.
Hello ladies and gentlemen, the Children's Cultural Center opened last night at the Diplomatic Club.
Closing ceremony of the National Exhibition of Future Generations' Dreams under the slogan: "Dreams of a Generation .. Realities or the Nation of Tomorrow"
Organized on the occasion of Qatar's National Day, with the participation of more than seventy children from Qatar.
There were many activities and numerous competitions at the exhibition.
Children's Creative Projects
We would like to welcome Mr. Abdullah Al-Jumaili, Director of the Children's Cultural Center. Welcome and good morning.
Good morning, dear sister.
First and foremost, I would like to thank you for taking the time for us.
Talking about this exhibition, it's truly unique.
We are pleased to have you here with us on the program to cover as many activities of the exhibition as possible.
This is the National Exhibition of the Dreams of a Generation
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. This is the exhibition.
Contribution from the Children's Cultural Center
To celebrate the National Day
Who was
In an attempt to entertain the children
Live with a dream.
With the project
This project or dream
Children's imagination is very vast.
So we determined it to be twenty or thirty.
Qatar's Vision 2030
We started training children in four stages.
Then consider the brainstorming mechanism and the tools that expand the scope of thinking.
What do you mean by this phrase exactly?
Is it facts or the nation of tomorrow?
Which means, everything the child dreams of today.
He will grow up seeing the project expand.
In fact, that was the true interpretation of the vision, that the children should live from this day forward.
With a big dream
Whether in the environmental, health, human development, or other fields
Serves the country
I think when we know there are children somewhere
Or in a special exhibition
All that was available through
At our exhibition, there were also guest speakers.
For children, as they learn from them as role models.
Yesterday, a couple of days ago, there was a star.
There were also winners of various awards from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
There was a schedule for presenting their projects.
Yes, the pictures are the best evidence of what you say.
This is a collection of photos from the exhibition and various activities.
Here is also the owner of the last project, the forest.
We also want to talk about the colored ball.
It's a truly brilliant idea, we can simplify it for the audience, it's one of the children's innovations.
What is this specific topic, the colored ball, let's talk about it.
Suddenly, there are four or five projects dealing with this subject, one of which is the colored ball.
And the stadium was also called the Smart Stadium.
After the ball left the playing field.
Colors differ.
I suppose this will help a lot in future matches.
What after all these dreams?
And it relates to matters that fall within his field of interest.
I assume especially when there are responsible people looking into these small projects that spring from small minds.
But we don't know, maybe these projects will benefit us, what does the football federation president say?
Think about the idea of the colored ball.
Is he fond of her?
Visited several projects related to football.
He supported and adopted these projects from the moment he saw their potential.
Also adopted these projects.
People also voted for many projects just as our children did.
Good projects, which projects were in place and received the most votes from people?
There is an evaluation committee that has a method for evaluating projects.
First, Second, and Third Prize Winners
The forest won first prize.
He was very precise in the details of the projects, and the project was ready for implementation.
Of course, it requires many administrative elements.
There were very fine details in the brochure distributed to visitors.
Yes, these are the pictures we are seeing now.
Some of these big projects
Perhaps they won't try to do what they see in movies and cartoons.
The real Barcelona, part of which is adopted by the institutions.
For example, let's name the projects. What are these projects?
Collect, use, and recycle.
Two hundred and seventy-four students
Qatar University celebrated yesterday the graduation of two hundred and seventy-four students from the thirty-third batch.
And His Excellency Dr. Khalid bin Mohammed Al Attiyah, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs
A large number of parents and teachers
The university is celebrating today the graduation of seven hundred and seventeen female students.
We thank our colleague Salman Al-Majad, and we will remain in the same artistic atmosphere. We have a very dear guest today.
I am from the family of the series "Tsanif", artist Abdel Hamid Sharshani.
He proved himself through numerous works such as "Hearts for Rent."
They worked hard to prove themselves in the art scene.
Especially since the field of art doesn't know flattery.
Any meaning
Thank you and good morning. I'd like to send a morning greeting to the viewers.
No, I'm impressed with the actors' choices in the show.
We'll watch a very short clip of your work and then start talking to you.
Are you mocking me?
Take the fake coat and bring me the real one.
Go and bring him.
You have the cloak, you will return it.
What? Give me the best, return it! How can I return it?
The goat swallowed it in her belly, according to Allah, yes.
I am a member of a five-member committee.
In the Higher Committee of the Conference
I won't approve it for you.
I have no objection.
This is a quick look, a very short clip from the series "Tasnif" whose second part we will watch.
We would like to ask you about your participation this year in Part Two.
Can you tell us about your roles in the "Classification Series," where each episode covers a different topic?
What is your contribution? Can you tell us about it?
Then, of course.
I passed by Maraath at that time.
She is also famous for the mountain.
A dark-complexioned beauty, poets have sung of her throughout the ages.
When history is a witness and remains in the memory of cities,
It illustrates the depth of her history.
One hundred and seventy kilometers north of the capital, Riyadh.
Some believe it was named after Imru' al-Qais al-Tamimi.
It is distinguished by its ancient ruins, sweet water, and pure air.
The mountain concealed its poets and dazzled them. The famous Mount Kumayt made it well-known.
They call it Wadian al-Kumit
Certainly, balsam that the city of Merat is an ancient city.
Founded before Islam.
There were some ancient things with an unknown history, such as the well of Khalid ibn al-Walid.
which we are in now.
The companion Khalid bin Waleed (may Allah be pleased with him) ordered the digging of a well when he passed by it during the Ridda Wars.
It's still ongoing.
The proverb says, "Ensure your commitment, and I'll ensure your success."
If you see the colt, you can see the marathon.
Another effect is the Wadi Kom Ombo.
O sweet torrent, flowing through the years many times.
It was enough for the city for a whole year.
From the beginning of the rainy season until the next rainy season.
The date of the creation of these ancient monuments is unknown.
And there are also the Aros.
Mount Komet is one of the landmarks of the city of Marra.
There were many proverbs, sayings, poems, and verses spoken about this mountain.
Many people come to it from various parts of the kingdom.
One of their important antique possessions is the Al-Waleedi Well.
He remained in Madinat al-Nabi during the Ridda Wars and was on his way to Yamama.
He descended upon her, encamped, and ordered his men to dig the well.
People still drink from its water and perform ablutions with it.
Yaqut al-Hamawi mentioned in Mu'jam al-Buldān that Khalid passed through Marrat.
This old house made of mud bricks was restored to its original state.
It consists of diverse sections reflecting the area's architecture, heritage, and antiquities.
The poet once said of her: "When we crossed the water, it was free water."
We passed by Wadi Kamit, not Wadi al-Anajil.
Mr. Ayman, God willing, there is cooperation between the family, the guardian, the sponsor, and the child as well.
And I think there's a different way he can be with you at the same time.
Generally to run the training process
Whatever comes to us from the trainee, the student, or the child.
This record contains his full personal information.
Even his monthly grades, for example, are subject to evaluation every month.
We were responsible for the Minds program.
In every four sessions, there is a report.
Guardian through a password and user alias
We gave it to him, can he get to it?
Yes, he can see the level he has reached, since he registered at the center until now.
Yes, we have different models we'll be looking at.
We have a girl.
With Mr. Ibrahim, who will join us later,
We'll see different models; I wish we had a big enough place.
While we brought models for a girl
You will have various tests before appearing on live broadcast.
We will ask her questions about mathematics and various other questions.
We'll take a short break, then we'll be back with more of this smart girl. Stay tuned.
The actor's performance is excellent, the audience is very intelligent these days.
If he doesn't like the show from the first, second, or third episode, he'll change the channel using the remote.
He won't bother, he has another chain of twenty thousand.
True, the Twenty Thousand Leagues series.
Twenty thousand episodes. Some people don't focus on one task.
He can see other works.
Correct, that's the majority.
It is claimed that I only watch TV during Ramadan.
Of course, we welcome you as our dear guest, Abdul Hamid Shershani.
Do you want to say something to the viewers or to your loving audience? Of course, I am one of your fans.
Do you want to say something?
And I tell them every year, I meet you in the best of health.
It's true that we don't go out much, don't show up much, and don't do many things, and the reason for that is what I mentioned before.
What's to come will be better.
Insha'Allah, we wish you success and prosperity in your endeavors this year.
If God wills, we will conduct another interview with you to discuss those plays.
Everything leads to the other.
Because fashion shows are very popular among many people, and fashion enthusiasts look forward to them.
Welcome, dear viewers, to Sabah Doha. We are live with you this morning.
Barcelona today talks about the Skills Development Center and a group of students registered in this center.
This center offers a variety of different sciences.
Of course, they focus on developing other talents.
And also to fully engage their minds.
Mrs. Nesma and Mr. Ayman Khalegly, CEO of the Skills Development Center.
Hello and good morning.
Welcome to our restaurant.
And with us also is the beautiful Ounaya, good morning Ounaya.
Good morning.
How old are you, dear?
I am in the seventh grade.
"God willing. We wish you all the best."
What do we provide for our sons and daughters?
It has been clarified with Mr. Ayman and Ms. Nassima that these are specifically directed towards the benefit of our children.
Minds Program for Mental Mathematics
By fingers and abacus.
To achieve certain specific goals, we tried to show a small part of them.
Did you really feel a difference, Mr. Ibrahim, in the early days of the student?
And after three or four months?
If taught in public, private, or even independent schools,
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. A program that operates scientifically in a specific manner.
After completing the first level of the program,
that show lost potential or potential that needs to be further developed
Has he reached a certain level or what are the latest updates on the child's condition?
So, we work on a scientific method, a scientific program.
Not all methods and mechanisms are routinely applied.
But in a scientific and systematic organized manner.
Before the start of the program and after completing this course or the levels he has passed.
Mr. Ibrahim is with us now, as you can see, viewers, a wish of a student among those registered in this center.
We wanted to do that right now, to show you, the viewers, how important these things are.
If you prepare the dish, I have no objection.
So this is a very quick clip and a small part of the taxonomy series whose second part we will watch.
But as we've seen this part of the series, Tsaneyev is the first part.
Can you tell us a bit about your roles in the "Classification Series," where each episode covers a different topic?
This year, he emphasized that he would do it.
Inattentive virtuous
Those who are encouraged by creating opportunities.
Sixteen episodes in two seasons.
He will be a director in a play, and in one scene he will play an old man, and in another a baker.
So, it's a collection of rings.
Mr. Ghanem Al-Sulaiti is from Qatar.
We have representatives from Qatar.
Many actors I can't remember now and of course we have actresses from Bahrain such as Zahra Arafat and Ibtesam Abdullah.
We have
Fahad Rashid and Muhammad Adel
Of course, Tara.
Without Tara, the young actors won't perform.
We now have a few projects in Qatar. There are two projects per year.
Qatar TV also produces dramatic works, we can say that.
Qatar TV provides an outlet product.
Qatar TV did its best, but there is one production per year that all Qatari actors want to participate in.
And that was the reason.
I replied to you. All artists in Qatar want to work on it because it's a one-off project.
So if anyone finds a good thing, let him praise Allah.
Praise be to God for everything.
Return then to your beginnings.
Of course, I want to reward him very much.
I consult him on various matters.
Of course, artist Abdulaziz Jasim in "Human Judgment" from after the band to the word "yes or no".
We started working with him in theater when he became the first executive producer of our shows. Abdulaziz Jassim, we worked with him in television and theater productions.
For it is He who has nurtured us, taught us, and raised us.
Then Mr. Ghaniem entered his life story, doing his best, in the Tosh win of 2000.
Because it gives us opportunities as youth.
They work from thirty to thirty-two days a year.
We have two jobs a year, so thank you, thank you very much, Tara.
Production also killer by Tara Arts.
The chain manager is Mr. Monir %PW.
We are back with our dear viewers, and today we will talk about reflexology.
The message is in the hand, the hand of the hand.
This treatment has indeed been practiced since ancient times.
We have a guest with us.
The examination method is as follows.
The pain increased and intensified.
One feels in one's hand as if there is something like sand or shattered veins inside it.
Loosen your grip.
You are right, my brother is short-tempered.
You feel pressured and a little tense, tense.
Left side
Now, dear viewers, we are examining the left side of his body.
So they may know what we are doing.
Any health problem will become apparent, and we now know about his headaches and dizziness.
Is there any pain here?
Pain means trouble.
Problem! What does the problem mean in this context?
In this case, the cavities of the nose, ear.
Do you have a sinus problem or any previous issue? He is shivering.
I had surgery, but that was a long time ago.
Is it a nosebleed or something else?
His weight increases without eating.
Alright, your left shoulder.
This is due to nerves, when I told him his nerves were frayed.
Ten years ago, he walked barefoot on the beach.
We know that when someone walks on the beach, I think they empty their mind.
It's not just the sea that has an uneven terrain.
Negative energy may %PW.
And you may be surprised to find that you discovered these things through massage.
Balm and children are certainly the most important.
Children, glorified be God. This is for the mother, focus with me!
What hurts him is the milk and the food he eats.
Her child is parallel to her, she will put him down and he will automatically close the baby.
Close your hand.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Praise be to God for a little relief from the pressure.
You'll find it in a few seconds and the baby will be happy. First, it will hurt here because it's painful.
In a moment, you will see the gases suddenly escape.
What are the discoveries you have made, Mu'adh, O Sheikh Abdulaziz?
But people now suffer from less severe problems, such as obstacles, fragility, headaches, thyroid gland, and obesity.
Secondly, for menstrual pains or period pains in general
She should focus her gaze on a rock or stone, and when pressing here, you give orders, glorified be God, to relieve lower back pain and menstrual problems, and if there is pain,
In seconds, God willing, it will disappear.
Pregnant woman
Delivery became easier for her.
Either here or there, God knows best.
If they tell her there's a chance of giving birth in the seventh month or she can give birth in the ninth.
Except on the dust
If she walks on sand, no problem, but if she walks on rocks, no.
You should eat seven fresh dates for breakfast, as fresh dates are better.
If she doesn't have fresh dates, dates alone are enough.
"I seek refuge in Allah from the outcast Satan, my discoveries are from the Holy Quran."
It means that Allah Almighty could not make it easy for her to get these fresh dates, yes, He could not.
Praise be to Allah, and I seek refuge in Allah from the word 'I'.
She has to bring a stone or small balls.
For example, if you forget and come to the delivery bed, you hold onto the handles.
You will notice in private hospitals the arrival of an East Asian lady.
So, this is a common practice in East Asia.
There's no need for that, as you already have my mobile phone.
Mobile!
Cooperate with each other, I advise all the listeners hearing me now.
We have made you an honorable nation, so fear Allah and seek lawful means of livelihood. And remain steadfast.
Serving people is the top priority. Secondly, I'm not a cleric or a sheikh; I'm an ordinary man.
Thank you very much, Mr. Abdulaziz, for this wonderful conversation, and thank you to our dear guest.
Thank you for coming, and I wish you all the best.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al Thani, Director of Public Health at the Supreme Council of Health, will speak about this topic in great detail.
Good morning, Sheikh.
We start by looking into these activities.
Healthy Steps Program towards Qatar
A program that falls under the national strategy to deal with and combat obesity.
Around four of the top countries in the world for obesity are Gulf states.
We launched a strategy at the Supreme Council of Health, of course in collaboration with the Ministry of Education and other bodies, to combat obesity.
For fear that it might spread further and further soon.
One of the programs that provide protection against obesity is "Healthy Steps towards Qatar."
We can make this competition an international one together.
The program lasts six weeks.
Every week is different from the next.
To raise awareness among seventh and eighth-grade students about the importance of health at this age,
Because it is the first age in which they become self-aware.
In the first week, as you remember, the question was about your favorite fruit.
The second week is walking.
You have to walk! The more you walk, the more points you get.
A country map, and when any participant gets points, he and his school move one step forward.
A beautiful competition was created among the students.
In the second week, he drinks water, and we don't want him to drink soda.
We tell him to drink water, there's no need to drink a lot of soda. Whenever you feel thirsty, drink water!
In the fourth week, your favorite sport later.
Some school games are not liked by everyone.
We are looking for a sport that he loves.
Let's force him to exercise.
The child is eating a healthy meal.
And his parents know that it is their duty to feed their child a healthy meal.
And Al Jazeera Academy, an academy for girls and boys, we can join.
God willing, we will expand this experiment in the coming years, if it is successful.
The students are happy and feel more energetic.
We need more games, we had so much fun with our colleagues.
The girls say their skin has improved now, and there's less acne.
True, true... and it becomes consciousness.
Parents know about their children.
And they ask their classmates in the various classes: How are you? And they learn from their classmates.
Praise be to God, news is starting to spread about the enthusiasm of many schools to participate next year.
Inshallah
Ktel was the official sponsor in supporting this event.
We had received support from Aspire Zone, which organized sports competitions and raised awareness.
On the dining table
Praise be to God for the many competent authorities, I have mentioned some of them and others have escaped me.
But praise be to God, everyone participated in part.
And others did it in the form of individual lessons, or separate curricula, or
There was variety.
We tried to do different kinds and involve as many people as possible.
She is the next generation.
To generalize this experience or disseminate it as widely as possible in Qatar.
When you assess matters, you will find some things that need fixing.
And now that it has spread and achieved satisfactory results,
God willing, we will spread because there are people asking us, saying: "Why weren't you in the right place at the right time?"
Live, buy healthy food and own this, and you won't face any problems.
When we start at this age, when it starts from a young age, it will reach what it wants by the age of twenty or twenty-five.
His Excellency mentioned a series of titles, and each group has its own title.
If we return, we will try in today's paragraph to be about closing events,
And when we remind people again, we have hosted more than one guest on our show.
What information do we want to convey to the student each week, and how do we repeat it?
Alright, the first week will be your favorite fruit.
Every lesson was about fruits and their benefits.
Benefits of fruits rich in Vitamin C
So he began to like some fruits; not all fruits were his enemies.
He might be allergic to one or two, but why doesn't he eat the rest?
The second week is walking, people think that walking is only for the elderly, and why would young people walk?
It means that I walk when I grow older.
On the contrary, you walk because it soothes your mind and brain.
And this is what alleviates the individual's burden, enhancing the clarity of mental vision.
I took the students on outings.
Yes, everyone was asked to walk either at home or at school.
They record their points through the class coach.
from what they used to walk daily
It was an event, there were people who formed a procession, the girls' school formed a procession.
I want them to love it this way, creatively with unique ideas.
The spirit of competition should be present, and we want teachers to think outside the box and not limit their ideas to a specific framework.
Everyone has their skill in this area.
Of course, the third week is dedicated to drinking water, where we strive to make them drink water all the time so that they do not feel thirsty and want to drink soda.
Of course, the fourth week is your favorite sport.
If we can find out his favorite sport and support him in it.
He will be interested in sports.
His love for sports is in the game itself; he plays it unconsciously.
We previously said that we would talk about the Qatari Polyamory Association.
Welcome our guest for today's episode in the studio.
Thank you.
We're happy to have you here at this show.
And some of it is this disease that some of us may not have heard of before.
Initially, as the Egyptians say, we will go straight to the point.
Chronic disease
It affects the nervous system in the human body.
The period ranges between twenty and forty years.
There is no cure for this disease yet, and the causes of infection are unknown.
It affects the active segment of society, which is usually made up of young people.
One of the treatments used for cancer patients, may God protect you from all harm and other illnesses.
This infectious disease affects the brain and spinal cord.
Which one is the central nervous system in the human body?
The body assumes that a foreign body is entering the body.
Neuron
Cover this wire.
White cells, or white blood cells, start to kill or dissolve this insulating layer.
Which leads to the neural signal not arriving, being weakened, or disrupted.
Leads to paralysis, God preserve you.
With the development and progress in medicine, there is still no cure for this disease.
Okay, in addition to the solution, we want to know how we got it.
And also, a person should have protection against this matter.
The main reason for that is quality of life, nature of food, or lifestyle?
Or what is the direct cause that leads a person to suffer from this disease.
All we have now are theories.
Even through marriage.
They are trying to solve the health problems that humans suffer from.
Yes, yes.
All these topics may be somewhat controversial in society.
So far, we don't know its causes.
Alright, the age group that might suffer from this disease, multiple sclerosis.
Of the two genders
Of course, after forty years of illness, calm begins to take over the person.
So far, we haven't found a cure for this disease.
Are these indications of the presence of many people in the Gulf, the Arab world, or are we talking about Qatar?
In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, statistics indicate that they have twenty-five thousand cases.
And also Qatar.
I was recently informed, just last week, of three to four diagnosed cases.
Currently, we have one hundred and twenty-five patients, and this is recorded in the files.
Many people, upon being diagnosed with the disease, travel to other countries for treatment.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Mr. Abdulaziz, are there any symptoms similar to someone being affected by this disease?
Are there any signs that indicate to the patient's family or the patient themselves that they may have multiple sclerosis?
And this virus, for example, kills.
This is clear, so it is not a virus.
Because neurological diseases affect the entire body, as the nerves control it.
To give a specific reason for a particular location, type of food, or lifestyle.
