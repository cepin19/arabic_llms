Uzziah was the father of Jotham. Jotham was the father of Ahaz. Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh. Manasseh was the father of Amon. Amon was the father of Josiah.
And Josiah was the father of Jehoahaz and his brothers. At that time, the Jewish people were forced to go into exile in Babylon.
Then the lineage continued. Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zebedee was the father of John. John was the father of Eliah. Eliah was the father of Azur.
Azor is the father of Zadok. Zadok is the father of Akim. Akim is the father of Eliud.

So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen generations from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen generations from the exile to Babylon to the Messiah. Gospel of Jesus Christ, the birth of
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband, Yusuf, is a righteous man. He did not want to expose her to the people. So he planned to divorce her secretly.
But while Joseph was pondering these things, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.
All this happened to fulfill what the Lord had said would happen. For he had spoken through the prophet,
The virgin will conceive and bear a son, and they will call him Immanuel, which means "God with us." (Isaiah 7:14) The name Immanuel means "God with us."
Joseph woke up. He did as the angel of the Lord commanded him. He took Mary into his home as his wife.
But she did not sleep with him until she gave birth to a son. And Joseph named him Jesus.
The disciples came to Jesus.
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This happened during the reign of Herod, king of Judea. After Jesus' birth, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
They said, "Where is the child who has been born to be king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east and have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard about it, he was very upset. Everyone in Jerusalem was troubled too.
So Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time which he had ascertained from the wise men.
"In Bethlehem in Judea," they answered. "That is what the prophet wrote. He said,"
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will rule over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times." (Micah 5:2)
Then Herod secretly summoned the wise men and learned from them the exact time the star had appeared.
Send them to Bethlehem. He said, "Go! Search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, tell me. Then I too can go and worship him."
After they had listened to the king, they went on their way. The star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, they were filled with joy.
The disciples went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They knelt and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures. They offered him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod, so they returned to their homeland by another road. The flight of the Holy Family into Egypt.
When the wise men had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child to kill him."
Joseph arose and took the child and his mother Mary and went to Egypt.
They remained there until the death of King Herod. Thus was fulfilled what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, saying, "Out of Egypt have I called my son" (Hosea 11:1).
Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him. He became furious. He issued a decree regarding Bethlehem and its surrounding area. All boys who were two years old or younger were to be killed. This corresponded to the time when the wise men had seen the star.
In this way, the words spoken by the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled. He said,
A voice is heard in Ramah, a voice of weeping and great mourning. Rachel is weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted, because they are no more. (Jeremiah 31:15) Jesus' family returned to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise! Take the child and his mother. Go to the land of Israel. Those who were seeking to kill the child are dead."
So Joseph got up, took the child and his mother Mary, and went to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he went to the region of Galilee instead.
There he lived in a town called Nazareth. Thus what was spoken by the prophets about Jesus was fulfilled, for they called him a Nazarene.
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Repent from your sins! The kingdom of heaven is near."
John is the one of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke. He said, "A voice cries out: 'In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John wore a garment of camel hair, with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea, and from all the regions around the Jordan.
And when they had confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the place where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Bear fruits that prove you have repented for your sins.
Do not think that you can say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.
The axe already lies at the roots of the trees. All trees that do not bear good fruit will be cut down. They will be thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water, and I call you to repent of your sins. But after me comes one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
"His oar is in his hand to clear the chaff from his mill. He will gather his wheat into the barn. But he will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire." - Jesus is baptized.
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John.
But John tried to prevent him, saying to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you. Why do you come to me?"
Jesus answered, "Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this. It fulfills God's holy plan." And John agreed.
When Jesus had been baptized, he went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."
Isa is trying.
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness, where He was tempted by the devil.
After forty days and forty nights of fasting, Jesus was hungry.
The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'" (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple.
"If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here. For it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you.' They will lift you up in their hands, so that your foot will not strike against a stone." (Psalm 91:11-12)
Jesus answered him, "It is also written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain. He showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
"If you submit to me and worship me," he said, "I will give you all this."
Jesus said to him, "Go, Satan! For it is written: 'You shall worship the Lord your God and serve Him only.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
Then the devil left Jesus. Angels came and ministered to him. Jesus began to preach.
John was put in prison. When Jesus heard this, he returned to Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth and made his home in Capernaum by the sea in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
Thus what the prophet Isaiah said was fulfilled, for he said,
Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee of the Gentiles! The land by the Mediterranean Sea! The region beyond the Jordan River!
The people who walk in darkness will see a great light. They live in a very dark land, but a light will shine upon them. (Isaiah 9:1, 2)
From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus chooses the first disciples.
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake; they were fishermen.
"Come, follow me," Jesus said. "I will make you fishers of men."
Immediately they left their nets and followed him.
Then he proceeded from there, saw two other brothers. They were James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets. Jesus called out to them.
Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed Jesus. Jesus healed the sick.
Jesus went throughout Galilee. There he taught in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
His fame spread throughout Syria. People brought to him all who were sick with various diseases. Some were suffering from severe pains. Others were possessed by demons. Some were having seizures. Others were completely paralyzed. And Jesus healed them all.
Large crowds followed him. Some people came from Galilee, and from the region known as the Ten Towns, and from Jerusalem and Judea. Others came from the region across the Jordan.
Jesus blesses.
Jesus saw the crowds. He went up on a mountain and sat down. His disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them. He said,
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are the humble in heart, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
Blessed are those whose hearts have been purified, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are you when people mock you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil against you because of me. Blessed are you when they spread lies about you because of me.
Be happy and cheerful. Your reward in Paradise is great. Likewise, those who harm the prophets who lived from ancient times. Salt and light.
You are the salt of the earth. But if salt has lost its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden.
Likewise, no one lights a lamp and puts it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.
Likewise, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven. Jesus gives the law its full meaning.
Do not think that I have come to abolish what is written in the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish these things but to fulfill them.
What I am about to tell you is true. Heaven and earth will pass away before one jot or tittle of the Law perishes. Not the smallest letter, not a single stroke of a letter, will ever be erased from the Law until all things are accomplished.
Do not break even a small commandment of God's commandments. And do not teach others to break them. If you do, you will be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. Rather, practice these commandments and teach them. You will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
Thus I say to you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
You have heard what was said to those who lived long ago. It was said to them, "Do not murder." (Deuteronomy 20:13) Whoever murders will be liable to judgment.
But this I tell you: Do not be angry with your brother. Whoever is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment. Again, whoever says to his brother, 'Raka,' will be answerable to the Sanhedrin. But whoever says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell.
Imagine that you are presenting your gift on the altar. Remember that your brother has a claim against you.
Leave your gift before the altar. Go first and make peace with your brother. Then come back and offer your gift.
Assume someone has a claim against you and takes you to court. Settle the matter quickly. Do it while you're with him on the way. If you don't, he might hand you over to the judge. The judge might hand you over to the officer. And you might be thrown in jail.
What I'm about to tell you is the truth. You're not leaving until you pay the last penny! Adultery.
You have heard that it was said, "Do not commit adultery." (Deuteronomy 20:14)
But I tell you, anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. Your eye is just one part of your body. It is better to lose one part than to have your whole body thrown into hell.
If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. That hand is only one part of you, and it is better for you to lose it than for your whole body to go to hell.
He said, "When a man divorces his wife, he must give her a divorce certificate." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
But I say to you, whoever divorces his wife makes her an adulteress, and whoever marries the divorced woman commits adultery. It is not lawful for a man to divorce his wife except for sexual immorality. Matthew 5:32
Secondly, you have heard what was said to your ancestors long ago: "Do not break the covenant that you made with the Lord, and do not violate the oaths you swore to him."
But this I tell you: Do not swear at all: either by heaven, for it is the throne of God,
Do not make them in the name of the Earth. That is the footstool of God's feet. Do not make them in the name of Jerusalem. That is the city of the great King.
And do not swear by your heads, nor by the whiteness or blackness of a thing.
Let "yes" mean "yes" and "no" mean "no". Anything beyond that is from the devil. Be kind to others.
You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.
"If anyone takes your coat, do not withhold your shirt from him."
Suppose someone forces you to go one mile. Go two miles with him.
Give to him who asks of you. Do not refuse him who would borrow from you. Love your enemies.
You have heard that it was said, "Love your neighbor and hate your enemy." (Leviticus 19:18)
But I tell you, love your enemies. Pray for those who persecute you.
"So you are to be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect. "He makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous.
If you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Even tax collectors do the same.
If you only greet your own people, what more are you doing than others? Even those who do not obey God do that.
Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Providing assistance to those in need.
Take care not to display your good deeds before people. Do not do them to be seen by others. If you do, your Father in heaven will not reward you.
When you give to the poor, do not boast about it with loud words. Do not be like those who pretend to be righteous. They announce their deeds in the synagogues and on the streets, seeking praise from people. What I am about to tell you is true: They have already received their reward.
When you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
Then your charity shall be in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you. He sees what you do in secret. Prayer
When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
When you pray, go into your room. Close the door and pray to your Father who is unseen. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret.
When you pray, do not babble as the hypocrites do, for they think that the more they say, the more likely they are to be heard.
Do not be like them. Your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.
"This is how you should pray." 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
Your kingdom come. Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
We received our daily bread today.
Forgive us our sins, as we also forgive those who sin against us.
Deliver us from sin when we are tempted. Save us from the evil one.
Forgive people their sins against you. If you do, your Father in heaven will also forgive you.
But if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive you your trespasses. Fasting
When you fast, do not look sad like the hypocrites. They make their faces gloomy, so that people will know they are fasting. What I am telling you is true. They have received their reward in full.
But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face.
Then no one will know that you are fasting. Only your Father, who is unseen, will know. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret. Gather treasures in heaven.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
Instead, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
Your hearts are where your treasures are.
The eye is like a lamp for the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light.
But suppose your eyes were bad. Your whole body would be full of darkness. If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. They will hate one and love the other, or be loyal to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money. Do not be anxious.
I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
Can you add an hour to your life by worrying?
And why do you care about clothing? Look how the wild flowers grow. They don't work or spin clothing.
But I tell you, not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these.
If God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
So do not grieve. And do not say, "What shall we eat?" or "What shall we drink?" or "What shall we wear?"
People who do not obey God pursue all those things. Your Father in heaven knows that you need them.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Be just when you judge others.
Do not judge others, lest you be judged.
You shall be judged by the judgment you have made. You shall be measured by the measure you have measured.
You notice the small specks of sawdust in your friend's eye, but you don't see the big log in your own.
How can you tell your friend: "Let me get this little piece of wood out of your eye," when there's a piece of wood in your own eye?
"You hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye."
Do not give what is holy to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Ask, seek, knock.
Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.
Everyone who asks receives. And he who seeks finds. The door is opened to him who knocks.
Consider that your son asks for bread. Who among you would give him a stone?
Or imagine he asked for a fish. Who among you would give him a snake?
Even if you are evil, learn to give good gifts to your children. How much more will your Father who is in heaven give good gifts to those who ask Him!
In all things, do to others what you would want them to do to you. This is what is written in the law and the prophets. The great and small gate.
Enter the Kingdom of God through the narrow gate. The gate is wide and the road is broad that leads to death and hell. Many people walk this path.
But the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life. Few are those who find it.
Beware of false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves.
I know them by what they do. "Do they save grapes from the bushes? Do they rescue figs from thorns?"
Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree does not bear bad fruit, and a bad tree does not bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
Every tree is known by its fruit.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord! Lord!' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven.
Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?'
Then I will say to them clearly: "I did not know you before. Stay away from me, agents of evil!" The wise and the foolish builders.
"Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock."
The rain falls. The water rises. The wind blows and beats against that house. But it does not fall. It is built on rock.
But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.
The rain falls. The water rises. The winds blow and strike that house. It collapses with a loud noise.
Jesus had finished saying all these words. The crowds were amazed at his teaching.
Learn as if you were under the authority of someone else. Do not speak as the teachers of the law do.
Jesus heals a man with a diseased skin.
Jesus came down from the mountain. Large crowds followed him.
A man with leprosy came to him and knelt down, saying, "Lord, if you choose, you can make me clean."
Jesus reached out and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!" And immediately the man was cured of his disease.
Then Jesus said to him, "Do not tell anyone. Go and show yourself to the priest. Offer the gift that Moses commanded. It will be a witness to them." A Roman commander has faith.
When Jesus came to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached him and pleaded with him to help.
"Oh Lord," he said, "my servant is sick at home and cannot move. He is suffering greatly."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
The captain answered, "Sir, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof. But say the word, and my servant will be healed."
I myself am a man in authority. I have soldiers who are obedient to my commands. I say this: "Go," and they go. I say that: "Advance," and they advance. I say to my servants: "Do this," and they do it.
When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, "Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with faith like this."
I tell you, many will come from east and west and sit at table with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
But those who think they belong to the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then Jesus said to the Roman officer, "Go! It will be done as you believed." And at that very hour, his servant was healed. Jesus healed many people.
When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law. She was lying in bed, and she had a fever.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she got up and waited on him.
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to Jesus, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
He did it to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah said: "He carried our sorrows and bore our griefs" (Isaiah 53:4). Following Jesus comes at a cost.
Jesus saw the crowds around him. He ordered his disciples to go to the other side of Lake Tiberias.
Then a teacher of the law came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests. But the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
The last of them said, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow Me. Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus entered a boat, followed by his disciples.
Suddenly, a terrible storm came up on the lake. The waves crashed over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
The disciples came to him and cried, "Lord, save us! We are perishing!"
He said, "Why are you afraid? Have you no faith?" Then Jesus got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm.
The disciples were amazed. They asked, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and waves obey him!" Jesus heals two men possessed by demons.
Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake in the region of the Gergesenes. Two men possessed by demons met him. They came out of the tombs. The men were so violent that no one could pass by.
"Son of God, what do you want from us?" they cried. "Have you come to punish us before our time of judgment?"
Not far from there, a large herd of pigs was feeding.
The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" And the unclean spirits came out of the men and entered into the swine. And the herd ran violently down the steep place into the lake, and were drowned in the water.
Those who were tending the pigs fled. They went into the town and told everything, and told what had happened to the demoniac men.
Then all the people of the city came out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they asked him to leave their region.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk.
Jesus got into a boat. He went to the other side of the lake and arrived at his own town.
Some men brought to him a paralytic, lying on a bed. Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
Then some of the teachers said to themselves, "This man is saying something very evil!"
Jesus knew their thoughts and said, "Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Get up and walk"?
I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. Then he said to the man who could not walk, "Get up, take your mat, and go to your home."
The man stood up and went home.
When the multitude saw this, they were astonished. They praised God, who had given such authority to men. Jesus chooses Matthias.
As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he told him. And Matthew got up and followed him.
Later, Jesus was having dinner at Matthew's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" came. They ate with Jesus and his disciples.
The Pharisees saw this and asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
Jesus heard this and said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick."
Go and learn what this means: "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) "I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners." Jesus asks about fasting.
One day the disciples of John came to Jesus and said to him, "We and the Pharisees fast. Why do your disciples not fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast."
People don't patch new cloth onto old clothes. The new patch will shrink away from the old. That will make the tear worse.
People do not pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the wineskins will burst, the wine will run out, and the wineskins will be ruined. Instead, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.
While Jesus was still speaking, a synagogue leader came and bowed down before him. "My daughter has just died," he said. "But come and put your hand on her, and she will live."
Then Jesus got up and went with them, and so did his disciples.
Then, a woman approached Jesus from behind. She had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years. She touched the fringe of his garment.
I thought, "I only need to touch his clothes, and I will be healed.
Jesus looked at her and said, "Daughter of Abraham, do not despair. Your faith has healed you." And the woman was healed at that moment.
When Jesus entered the ruler's house, he saw the flute players there, and the crowd wailing.
He said, "Go away. The girl isn't dead. She's sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After sending the crowds away, Jesus entered. He took the girl by the hand, and she arose.
The news about what Jesus had done spread throughout that region. Jesus healed the blindness of two men.
As Jesus went on, two blind men followed him, calling out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus went indoors, the blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I can do this?" "Yes, Lord," they replied. When Jesus entered the house, the blind men came to him. He said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They said, "Yes, Lord."
Then he touched their eyes. He said, "Your belief will guide you.
They could now see again. Jesus strongly warned them, "Make sure no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They talked about it all over the region.
And as they were going out, another man who was mute and possessed by a demon was brought to Jesus.
When the demon was driven out, the man spoke. The crowd was amazed. They said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "It is by the prince of demons that he drives out demons." And some of the scribes said to themselves, "He is possessed by Beelzebul, and by the prince of demons he drives out demons."
Jesus went through all the cities and villages. He taught in their synagogues. He preached the gospel of the kingdom of God. And he healed every disease and weakness.
When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, for they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
"Ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest field."
Jesus sends the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him. He gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
Here are the names of the twelve apostles. The first is Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then James the son of Zebedee and his brother John.
After that, Phillips and Bartholomew, as well as Thomas and Matthew the Tax Collector. Two others are James, son of Alphaeus, and Thaddeus.
The last two are Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas is the one who will later betray Jesus into the hands of his enemies.
Jesus sent out these twelve, commanding them, "Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter into any city of the Samaritans."
Instead, go to the people of Israel. They are like lost sheep.
Go and proclaim: "The kingdom of heaven has drawn near."
Healed the sick. Raised the dead. Cleansed those with leprosy. Cast out demons. You received freely, give freely.
Do not take with you gold or silver or copper in your belts.
Don't take a bag for the trip. Don't take extra clothes or sandals or sticks. The worker should be given what he needs.
When you enter a city or village, look for someone willing to receive you. Stay in this person's home until you leave.
When you enter a house, greet those who live in it.
If the house welcomes you, bless it with peace. If it does not welcome you, do not bless it.
Some people may not receive you or listen to your words. If they don't, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that house or town.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. On the Day of Judgment, it will be easier for Sodom and Gomorrah than for that city.
I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as prudent as serpents and as innocent as doves.
Beware! The men will hand you over to the local courts. They will incarcerate you in their compounds.
You will be brought before governors and kings because of Me, to bear witness to them and to the Gentiles.
But when they arrest you, don't worry about what you will say or how you will say it. At that time you will be given the right words to say. However, when they arrest you, do not worry about what you will say or how you will say it. At that moment, you will be given the words you should speak.
It is not you who will speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks through you.
Brothers will deliver up their brother to be killed. Fathers will deliver up their children. Children will rise up against their fathers and mothers and kill them.
Everyone will hate you because of me. But those who endure to the end will be saved.
When people attack you in one place, flee to another. What I am telling you is true. You will not finish going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
A student is not better than his teacher. A servant is not better than his master.
It is enough for the learner to be like his teacher, and enough for the servant to be like his master. If the head of the household is called a fool, what can others who live there expect?
So do not be afraid of your enemies. Everything that is hidden will be revealed, and everything that is secret will be made known.
What is whispered in the dark, proclaim in the daylight. What is murmured in your ear, shout from the rooftops.
"Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell."
Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father's care.
Not a hair on your head will be lost!
Do not be afraid. You are worth more than many sparrows.
What shall it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul?
But what about those who say in front of others that they don't know me? I will say before my Father in heaven that I don't know them.
Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
I have come to turn "sons against their fathers, and daughters against their mothers, and daughters-in-law against their mothers-in-law."
"A man's foes shall be they of his own household." (Micah 7:6)
Anyone who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. Anyone who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
"And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me."
If anyone finds his life, he will lose it. If anyone loses his life for my sake, he will find it.
Whoever welcomes you welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.
Whoever accepts a prophet according to his prophethood will receive the reward of a prophet, and whoever accepts a righteous person according to his righteousness will receive the reward of a righteous person.
"Truly I tell you, whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones in the name of a disciple, will certainly not lose their reward."
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus finished teaching his twelve disciples. Then he went to teach and preach in the cities of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Jesus was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked Jesus, "Are you the one who is coming, or should we wait for another?"
Jesus answered, "Go to John. Tell him what you hear and see."
The blind receive their sight. The lame walk. Lepers are cleansed. The deaf hear. The dead are raised. And the poor have good news preached to them.
Blessed are those who do not abandon their faith because of me.
When the disciples of John had gone, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John. He said, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?"
If not, what did you come out to see? A man in fine clothes? No. Those who wear fine clothes are in the palaces of kings.
Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
It is he who they wrote about in the book: "I will send my messengers ahead of you, who will prepare the way before you." (Malachi 3:1)
What I am about to tell you is true. No one greater than John the Baptist has ever been born, but the least person in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he is.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with power. And those who use force are taking it by force.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you are ready to receive him, John is the Elijah who was to come.
"Let those who have ears hear."
What can I compare people today to? They are like children sitting in the markets, calling out to others. They say,
"We played the flute for you, but you did not dance. We sang the funeral anthem, but you did not mourn."
When John came, he neither ate nor drank as you do. And people say, "He has a demon."
But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank, and they say, "Look at this person, he eats too much and drinks too much. He is a friend of tax collectors and sinners." Those who act wisely prove that wisdom is right. Cities that do not turn from sin
Jesus begins to speak against the cities where he had performed most of his miracles. The people there had not repented of their sins. He said:
Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades. For if the miracles had been done in Sodom which were done in you, it would have remained until this day.
But I say to you, it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you. Rest for all who are weary.
At that time Jesus said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent and have revealed them to infants."
Yes, Father. This is what you wanted.
My Father has given me everything. The Father is the only one who knows the Son, and the only ones who know the Father are the Son and those whom the Son chooses to reveal the Father to.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
"Be my disciples and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls."
"My service is easy, and my burden is light."
Jesus is the Lord of the Sabbath.
On the Sabbath, Jesus was walking through the grainfields, and his disciples became hungry. They began to pluck and eat heads of grain.
The Pharisees saw this. They said to Jesus, "Look! It is not lawful to do that on the Sabbath. But your disciples are doing it anyway!"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him?"
So he entered the house of God. He and his men ate the sacred bread, which was only allowed to be eaten by the priests.
Haven't you read the law? It shows how the priests in the temple were to work on the Sabbath. But they are not guilty.
I tell you, something greater than the temple is here.
The scriptures say, "I desired mercy, not sacrifice." (Ezekiel 6:6) You do not know what this saying means. If you knew, you would not accuse those who are innocent.
The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.
They left that place, and Jesus entered their synagogue.
There was a man with a withered hand. The Pharisees were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they asked, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not lift it out?"
The man is more valuable than the sheep! Therefore, the law allows us to do good on the Sabbath.
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out. It was as good as new, just as good as the other hand.
But the Pharisees went out and plotted to kill Jesus, the chosen servant of God.
Jesus knew what the Pharisees were planning, so he left that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But warn them not to tell who he is.
This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah. He says,
Here is my servant, whom I have chosen; he is the one I love and in whom I delight. I will put my Spirit on him and he will proclaim justice to the nations.
He will not argue or shout. No one will hear his voice in the streets.
He won't break a bent branch. He won't quench a flickering flame. He'll make everything alright.
"The nations will put their hope in him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebul
A man controlled by demons was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Then the man could speak and see.
All the people were amazed, and said, "Is this not the son of David?"
The Pharisees heard this and said, "This man casts out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the prince of demons."
Jesus said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. And every city or house divided against itself will not stand."
If the devil casts out the devil, he is fighting against himself. Then how can he establish his kingdom?
"You say that I cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul, so by whose power do your men cast them out? Therefore, your wise men will be your judges."
But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you.
Or consider this. How can you enter the house of a strong man and take away his possessions? You must first tie him up. Then you can plunder his house.
He who is not with me is against me. He who does not gather the sheep with me scatters them.
This is what I tell you: Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But speaking evil against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come."
A good tree bears good fruit, and a bad tree bears bad fruit. You can tell a tree by its fruit.
O brood of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak any good? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
A good man speaks what is good. This comes from the goodness that is within him. An evil man speaks what is evil. This comes from the evil that is within him.
But I tell you, on the Day of Judgment, people will give account for every careless word they speak.
"By your words you will be justified or condemned." Wonder of Yunus Ayah
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus. They said, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from you."
He said, "The evil and treacherous people ask for signs and wonders! But only the sign of the prophet Jonah will be given to them."
Jonah was in the belly of a great fish for three days and three nights. Something like that will happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the grave.
The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and will condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, one greater than Solomon is here.
What happens when an evil spirit leaves a human? It wanders through the dry lands seeking a place to rest, but finds none.
Then he says: "I will return to the house I left behind." When he arrives, he finds the house empty. The house has been cleaned and prepared.
Then the evil spirit goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself. They enter and make their home there, and the person's condition becomes worse than before. So it will be with this evil generation." - Jesus' mother and brothers
While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak with him.
Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside. They want to speak with you."
Marveling, he said to them, "Who are my mother and my brothers?"
Jesus points to his disciples and says, "Here is my mother! Here are my brothers!"
"Whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother."
The Farmer's Tale
That same day, Jesus left the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
A large crowd gathered around him. He got into a boat. He sat in it. All the people stood on the shore.
Then he told them many things by means of stories. He said, "A farmer went out to sow his seed."
The seeds were sown on the ground. Some fell on the path. Birds came and ate them.
Some seeds fell on rocky ground, where there was not much soil. The plants grew quickly, because the soil was not deep.
When the sun rose, it scorched the plants. They withered because they had no roots.
Others fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them.
And other seeds fell on good soil and produced a crop, a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was sown.
"Let him who has ears hear."
The pupils came to him. They asked, "Why do you use stories when you talk to people?"
He said, "You have been given the opportunity to understand the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven. This has not been given to others."
Those who have that kind of knowledge will be given more. In fact, they will have abundance. But those who do not have that kind of knowledge, even what little they have will be taken from them.
That's why I use stories when I talk to people. I say, "They look, but they don't really see. They listen, but they don't really hear or understand."
In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: "You will indeed hear, but never understand; you will indeed see, but never perceive."
"The hearts of these people have become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn back to the Lord, and he would heal them." (Isaiah 6:9-10)
But blessed are the eyes that see and blessed are the ears that hear.
What I am going to tell you is true. Many prophets and good men wanted to see what you see. But they did not see. They wanted to hear what you hear. But they did not hear.
Listen! This is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message of the kingdom but do not understand it. Then the evil one comes and steals what was sown in their hearts. These people are like the seed that was sown on the path.
Others received the seed that fell on rocky places. They are those who hear the message and accept it immediately with joy.
But they have no root; therefore they endure only for a time. Then, when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they stumble.
Others received the seed that fell among the thorns. These are the ones who hear the word, but then the worries of life and the deceitful promises of wealth choke the word, preventing it from bearing fruit.
And others received the seed that fell on the good soil. These are the ones who hear the word and understand it. They are the ones who bear fruit, yielding a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was sown. - The Parable of the Weeds
Jesus told the crowd another parable. "What the kingdom of heaven is like," he said, "is a man who sowed good seed in his field.
But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. His enemy planted weeds among the wheat and then left.
Wheat has started to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds have appeared.
The servants came to their master. They said, "Sir, didn't you sow good seeds in your field? Then where did the weeds come from?"
"An enemy did this," he replied. "The servants asked: 'Do you want us to go and weed?'"
'No,' answered the landowner. 'When you get rid of the weeds, you may get rid of the wheat along with them.'
Let both grow together until the harvest. Then I will tell the harvesters to first collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned, and then gather the wheat and store it in my barn.
Jesus told the crowds another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. A person took the seed and planted it in a field."
It is the smallest of all the seeds you have. Yet when it grows, it is the largest of all the garden plants. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest in its branches.
Jesus told them another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast," and said, "A woman mixed it into a large amount of flour. The yeast spread through all the dough."
Jesus spoke to the crowds using parables about all these things. He did not say anything to them without using a parable.
For the words of the prophet came true. For he said, "I will open my mouth and tell stories. I will speak about things that have been hidden since I created the world." (Psalm 78:2) Jesus explains the parable of the weeds.
Then Jesus left the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
He said, "The one who sows good seeds is the Son of Man."
The field is the world. The good seeds represent the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the evil one.
The enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the day of judgment. The workers are the angels.
Weeds are uprooted and burned in the fire. That is how it will be on the Day of Judgment.
The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will remove from his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.
They will be thrown into the blazing fire. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then God's people will shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom. Those who have ears should listen. The Parables of the Hidden Treasure and the Pearl.
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then went and sold everything he had and bought that field.
Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of a precious pearl.
He found one of great value. He went and sold all he had and bought that pearl. The parable of the pearl.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea, and gathered every kind of fish.
When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up onto the shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish into baskets. But they threw the bad fish away.
This is what the Day of Judgment will be like. The angels will come. They will separate those who did wrong from those who did right.
The wicked will be cast into the fiery furnace. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
"Do you understand all these things?" asked Jesus. "Yes," they answered.
He said to them, "Every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure both new and old." A prophet without honor.
Jesus finished his stories. Then he moved on from there.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth. There he began to teach the people in their synagogue, and they were amazed. They said, "Where did this man get this wisdom? And where did he get this power to do miracles?"
Wasn't he the son of a carpenter? Wasn't his mother's name Mary? Weren't his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
Weren't all his sisters with us? Where did this man get all these things?
They were utterly astounded, but Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his native place and among his own kin and in his own house."
did only a few miracles there because they had no faith. because they had no faith.
John the Baptist's head is cut off.
At that time Herod the ruler of Galilee and Perea heard of the deeds of Jesus.
He said to his servants, "John the Baptist has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles."
Herod had John arrested. He bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, who was the wife of Herod's brother Philip.
John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have her as your wife; it is against the law."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he feared the people, for they believed John to be a prophet.
At Herod's birthday feast, Herodias' daughter danced for Herod and his guests. He was delighted by her dance.
So he swore to her that he would give her anything she asked for.
Her mother told her what to say. So she said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very angry. But he thought about his promise and the dinner guests. So he ordered one of his men to give her what she asked for.
Herod ordered the killing of John the Baptist in prison.
His head was brought on a large tray and given to the girl. She then carried it to her mother.
John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed the five thousand.
Jesus heard what had happened to John. He wanted to be alone. So he went in a boat to a quiet place. The crowds heard about it. They followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus reached the shore, he saw a large crowd. He felt deep compassion for them. He healed their sick.
When it was almost evening, the disciples came to him. They said, "There is nothing here. It is already late. Send the crowds away so they can go to the villages and buy food."
Jesus answered, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat."
"We have only five loaves and two fish," they answered.
"Bring them to me," he said.
Then Jesus commanded the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, and gave thanks. He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples gathered twelve baskets of the remaining pieces.
The number of men who ate was about five thousand. The women and children also ate. Jesus walked on the water.
Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, to Bethsaida. And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up into the boat and came to the other side.
After sending them away, he went up on a mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.
The ship had moved far from the shore. It was tossing about on the waves because the wind was blowing against it.
Early in the morning, Jesus came to the disciples. He walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and were afraid. "It's a ghost!" they said, and wept in fear.
Immediately Jesus called out to them, "Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid."
"Lord, are you?" Peter asked. "If it is you, tell me to come to you on the water."
"Come," Jesus said. So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid. He began to sink. He cried out, "Lord, save me!"
Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?"
When they boarded the boat, the wind died down.
Then those in the boat worshiped Jesus and said, "Truly you are the Son of God!"
They crossed the lake and arrived at Gennesaret.
The men who were there knew Jesus. So they sent messengers into all the surrounding country. People brought all their sick to Jesus.
And they begged him to let the sick just touch the edge of his cloak. And all who touched him were healed.
What makes people "unclean"?
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came from Jerusalem to see Jesus. They asked,
Why don't your students follow what the elders teach? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!
Jesus answered, "Why do you not obey the commandment of God? You prefer to follow your own teachings!"
God said, "Honor your father and your mother" (Deuteronomy 5:16; Exodus 20:12) and also, "Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death" (Leviticus 20:9; Exodus 21:17).
But you allow people to say to their parents: "Any help you have received from us is a gift dedicated to God."
They do not need to honor their parents with gifts. You make God's word of no effect by your traditions.
O hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you. He said:
"These people honor me with their words, but their hearts are far from me."
"Their worship means nothing to me. They only know human rules." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand."
What goes into your mouth doesn't make you "unclean". It's what comes out of your mouth that makes you "unclean".
Then the disciples came to him and asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus answered, "There are plants that my Father in heaven did not sow. They will be uprooted."
Leave them. The Pharisees are blind guides. If a blind man leads another blind man, they will both fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Don't you understand yet?" Jesus asked them.
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes to the stomach. Then it comes out of the body.
But what comes out of the mouth comes from the heart. These are the things that make you "unclean."
Evil thoughts come from the heart. So do murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. So do theft, bearing false witness, and slander.
Those are the things that make you 'unclean.' But eating without washing your hands does not make you 'unclean.' "The faith of a woman from Canaan."
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A Canaanite woman, who lived near Tyre and Sidon, came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon."
Jesus said not a word. His disciples came to him. They begged him, saying, "Send her away. She is crying out after us."
Jesus' answer, "I was sent only to the people of Israel. They are like lost sheep."
Then the woman knelt before him. "Oh, sir! Help me!" she said.
He said, "It is not right to take the boys' bread and throw it to their dogs."
"Yes, Lord," she said. "But even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
Then Jesus answered, "Woman, you have great faith! You will be given what you are asking for." And her daughter was healed at that very moment. Jesus Feeds the Four Thousand
Jesus left that place. He walked along the shore of the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up a mountain and sat down.
Large crowds came to him. They brought the blind and the weak. Also the deformed and the mute, and many others. They placed them at his feet, and he healed them.
The people were amazed. Those who had not spoken began to speak. The disabled were healed. Those who could not walk began to walk. The blind began to see. The people praised the God of Israel.
Then Jesus called his disciples to him. He said, "I have great compassion on this crowd. They have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way home."
His disciples answered and said, "There is nothing here, and where could we get bread to feed this great crowd?"
"How many loaves do you have?" asked Jesus. "Seven," they answered, "and a few small fish."
Jesus told the crowd to sit down on the ground.
He took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks. Then he broke them and gave them to the disciples, who distributed them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. Afterwards, the disciples gathered seven baskets of the remaining fragments.
The number of men who ate was four thousand. The women and children also ate.
After Jesus had sent the crowds away, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
Jesus is asked to show a miraculous sign.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
He said, "In the evening you look at the sky. You say, 'Fine weather will prevail. The sky is red.'"
And in the morning you say, "Today will be stormy. The sky is red and cloudy." You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you do not understand the signs of what is happening now.
A corrupt and faithless people ask for a miraculous sign. But they will be given only the sign of Jonah. Then Jesus left them and went away. The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
The pupils crossed to the other side of the lake. They had forgotten to bring bread.
"Beware," Jesus said to them, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The students are talking among themselves about this matter. They said, "He's only saying this because we didn't bring any bread."
Jesus knew what they were saying, and he said to them, "Why do you talk among yourselves about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened?"
Haven't you understood yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets full of pieces you gathered?
Do you not remember the seven loaves for the four thousand? How many baskets full of fragments did you gather?
How can you not understand? I was not talking to you about bread. But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not telling them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter said, "You are the Christ."
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They said, "Some say this is John the Baptist, others say Elijah, still others say Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
"What about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
So I say to you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church. The gates of hell will not overcome it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you throw on the earth will be thrown into heaven, and whatever you open on the earth will be opened in heaven.
Then Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. Jesus speaks about his upcoming death.
From that time Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem. There he must suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes. He must be killed, and on the third day be raised from the dead.
Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him. He said, "Never, Lord! This shall not happen to you!"
"Get behind me, Satan!" Jesus said to Peter. "You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but rather those of people."
Then Jesus spoke to his disciples, saying, "If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross and follow Me."
If he wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he loses his life for my sake, he will find it.
What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, and yet lose their soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?
The Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father, and His angels with Him. And He will reward each according to his works.
What I am telling you now is true. Some who are standing here will not die before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
Jesus is transfigured in appearance.
Six days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and John, the brother of James, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
There before them, his appearance changed. His face shone like the sun. His clothes became white as light.
Then Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three dwellings: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
And while Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them. A voice from the cloud said, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him!"
When the disciples heard this, they were greatly afraid. They fell on their faces to the ground.
But Jesus came and touched them, saying, "Arise, do not be afraid."
When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. And as they were coming down, Jesus commanded them that they should tell no one what they had seen, until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
The pupils asked him, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus answered, "Yes. Elijah must come and restore all things."
But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also will the Son of Man suffer at their hands.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus heals a boy who had a demon.
As they approached the crowd, a man came up to Jesus. He knelt down before him.
"Oh Lord," he said, "have mercy on my son. He is severely convulsing and suffering greatly. He often falls into the fire or into the water."
I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.
"You evil unbelievers!" Jesus replied. "How long must I stay with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the child to me."
Jesus commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it did. He was healed instantly.
Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why could we not cast it out?"
He said, "Because your faith is so small. What I am telling you is the truth. If your faith is as small as a mustard seed, it is enough. You can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
(No
They came together to Galilee. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men."
"They will kill him, and after three days he will rise from the dead." Then the disciples were filled with deep sorrow. Jesus pays the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples reached Capernaum. There, the collectors came to Peter and said, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
"Yes, he does," he replied. When Peter came into the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "Who collects taxes from the kings of the earth? Do they collect from their sons or from others?"
"From others," Peter answered. "Then the children are not to pay," Jesus told him.
But we don't want to anger them. Go to the lake and cast your line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. There you will find the small coin you need. Take it and give it to them as a tax for you and me.
