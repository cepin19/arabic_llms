Jesus called a little child to him and put the child among them.
Jesus said, "What I tell you is true. You must change and become like little children. If you do not, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."

Whoever welcomes one such child in my name, welcomes me.
"But what if someone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble? It would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea."

If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or one foot than to be thrown into eternal fire in hell with two hands and two feet.
If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. The Parable of the Lost Sheep
"See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you, their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father who is in heaven."
(No
What do you think? Suppose a man has 100 sheep, and one of them wanders away. Won't he leave the 99 on the hills and go look for the one that wandered off?
What I am telling you is true. If he finds that lost sheep, he is happier about it than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off.
So it is with your Father in heaven. He does not want any of these little ones to be lost. When someone sins against you...
If your brother sins against you, go to him and tell him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother back.
But what if he does not listen to you? Take one or two others along with you. The scripture says: "By the testimony of two or three witnesses every word may be established." (Deuteronomy 19:15)
But what if he refuses to listen to the witnesses? Tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen to the church as well? Let him be to you like a pagan or a tax collector.
What I am about to tell you is true. What you lock on earth will be locked in heaven. What you open on earth will be opened in heaven.
Here is what I tell you again. If two of you on earth agree about anything you ask, my Father in heaven will do it for you.
"Where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them." "The servant who had no mercy"
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
When the king started on that, a man to whom millions of dollars were owed was brought to him.
The man was unable to pay. So, his master issued an order. The man, his wife, children, and all his possessions were to be sold to repay the debt.
The servant fell to his knees before him. "Give me time," he pleaded. "I'll pay everything back."
His master felt sorry for him. He forgave him and set him free.
But then the servant went out and found one of the other servants who owed him a few dollars. He grabbed him and started choking him, saying, "Pay what you owe!"
The other servant fell to his knees. "Give me time," he begged. "I will repay you."
But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and threw the man into prison until he could pay back what he owed.
The other servants saw what happened. It disturbed them greatly. They went and told their master everything that had occurred.
Then the lord called the first servant. He said, "Wicked servant! I forgave you all that you owed me, because you asked me.
"Shouldn't you have shown mercy to the other servant, as I showed mercy to you?"
In anger, his master handed him over to the guards. He will be punished until he repays everything he owes.
"This is how your Father in heaven will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart."
Isa knows about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Large crowds follow him. He heals them there.
Some Pharisees came to test him, asking, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that the Creator from the beginning made them male and female? (Genesis 1:27)"
He said, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
"They are but one body, as long as they abide in Allah's decree, no human can separate them."
They asked: "Why did Moses command a man to write a certificate of divorce for his wife and send her away?"
Jesus answered, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning."
Thus I say to you: whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery. It is not lawful for a man to divorce his wife except for marital unfaithfulness.
The students told him, "If that's how it is between husband and wife, it's better not to get married."
Jesus' response, "Not everyone is able to accept the idea of remaining single. Only those who have been helped to live without marriage can accept it."
Some men cannot have children because they were born that way. Some were made that way by other people. Others have made themselves that way for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever can accept living that way should do so. "They brought little children to Jesus."
Some people brought their little children to Jesus. They wanted him to lay his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he departed from there. Jesus and the rich young man.
A man came to Jesus and asked, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?"
"Why do you ask me what is good?" Jesus answered. "There is only one who is good. If you wish to enter the kingdom, keep the commandments."
"Which?" asked the man. Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness."
"Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) and "Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
The young man said, "I have obeyed all these commands. What should I do next?"
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell everything you have and give the money to the poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me."
When this young man heard that, he went away sorrowful, for he was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "What I'm about to tell you is true. It is hard for rich people to enter the kingdom of heaven."
I tell you again, it is harder for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.
When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and said, "Then who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter answered him, "We have left everything to follow you. What then will we have?"
What I am telling you now is the truth, Jesus said to them. "When everything is renewed, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. Then you who have followed me will sit on twelve thrones and rule over the twelve tribes of Israel."
Everyone who has left homes or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will also have eternal life.
But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.
The Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
I agreed to give them the usual daily wage. Then I sent them to my vineyard.
It was past nine o'clock that morning when he went out again. He saw others standing in the market square doing nothing.
He said to them, "You also go and work in my vineyard. I will give you what is right."
So they went. "He went out again around noon and at three o'clock, and did the same thing."
Around five o'clock he went out and found others standing around. He asked them, "Why have you spent the whole day standing here doing nothing?"
They said, "Because no one has hired us." He said to them, "You also go and work in my vineyard."
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard spoke to the foreman. He said, "Call the workers and give them their wages, beginning with the last hired, and then the first."
The workers who were hired around five o'clock arrived. Each of them received the usual daily wage.
So when those who were hired first came, they expected to receive more. But each of them also received the usual daily wage.
When they received it, they began to suspect its owner.
They said, "These people who were last hired only worked for one hour. You paid them the same as you paid us. We did most of the work and stayed under the scorching sun all day."
The owner answered one of them. He said to him, "My friend, I am treating you fairly. Didn't we agree that you would work for the wage of a regular workday?"
Take your money and go. I want to give the ones I hired the same pay I gave you.
Don't I have the right to do what I want with my money? Do you feel cheated because I gladly gave to others?
For those who are last will be first, and those who are first will be last. Jesus continues to speak about his death.
Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. Along the way, he took the twelve disciples aside to speak to them.
He said, "We are going up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the Law. They will condemn him to death."
"Then they will hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked, flogged, and crucified. On the third day he will rise from the dead!" asks Jesus' mother Mary.
The mother of Zebedee's sons came to Jesus. Her sons accompanied her. As she knelt, she asked him for a favor.
"What do you want?" asked Jesus. She said, "Grant that one of my two sons may sit at your right hand in your kingdom, and the other at your left."
"You do not know what you are asking," Jesus said to them. "Can you drink the cup I am about to drink?" "We can," they answered.
Jesus said to them, "You will drink my cup, but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
The remaining ten gentlemen heard of this. They were angry with the two brothers.
Jesus called his disciples and said to them, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise power over them.
Do not be like this. Rather, whoever among you wishes to be great, let him be your servant.
"And whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave."
Be like the Son of Man. He did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many. Two blind men received their sight.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, and a large crowd was following him.
Two blind men sat by the roadside. They heard that Jesus was passing by. They cried out, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The crowds ordered them to stop. They told them to be quiet. But the two men shouted at the top of their voices, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stood and called to them, "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.
"Lord," they answered, "we want to see."
Jesus felt deep compassion for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately they could see, and they followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem
And as they approached Jerusalem, they came to Bethphage, on the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two disciples.
He said to them, "Go into the village ahead of you. There you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me."
If someone tells you something, tell them that the Lord needs them. The owner of the place will send them immediately.
This happened so that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled. He said,
"Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem! Lo, your king comes to you; triumphant and victorious is he, humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey." (Zechariah 9:9)
The disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them.
They brought the donkey and the colt. They laid their clothes on them, and Jesus sat on the clothes.
A very large crowd spread their garments on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
Some people went ahead of him, and some followed. They all shouted: "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up. The people asked, "Who is this?"
The crowds answered, "This is Jesus. He is the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus left the temple.
Jesus entered the temple courts. He drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer.' "
The blind and the lame came to Jesus in the temple. There he healed them.
The chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did. They also saw children in the temple area shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" But when they saw this, they were indignant.
"Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," answered Jesus. "Haven't you read this in the Scriptures? The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes." (Psalm 118:22-23)
Then Jesus went out from among the people and left the city, going to Bethany. He spent the night there. The fig tree withered.
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the road. He went to it, but found nothing on it but leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" And immediately it withered.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?" they asked.
Jesus answered, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done."
"If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer." (The authority of Jesus is questioned)
Jesus entered the temple courts. While he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and asked, "By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered, "I will ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
"Where did John's baptism come from? Was it from heaven, or from men?" They argued among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Then why did you not believe him?'"
But what if we say, "of men"? We are afraid of people. Everyone thought John was a prophet.
So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." Jesus said to them, "Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things." The Story of the Two Sons.
What do you think about this? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, "Son, go and work today in the vineyard."
"No, I will not," the son replied. But then he changed his mind and went.
Then the father went to the other son. He said the same thing to him. The son answered, "I will go, sir." But he did not go.
"Which of the two sons did what his father wanted?" "The first," they answered. Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John came to show you the right way to live, and you did not believe in him. But all the tax collectors and sinners believed in him. You saw this, yet even after that, you did not repent of your sins and believe in him. The parable of the tenants.
Listen to another story. There was a man who owned some land. He planted a vineyard. He built a wall around it. He dug a pit to press the grapes in. He also built a watchtower. He leased the vineyard to some farmers. Then he went away on a journey.
When the time of harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants. He commanded the servants to gather his share of the fruit.
But the tenants seized his servants. They beat one of them. They killed another. They stoned the third to death.
Then the man sent other slaves to the tenants. He sent more than he had sent the first time. The tenants treated these slaves in the same way.
Finally, he sent his son to them. He said, "They will respect my son."
But the tenants saw the son coming. They said to each other, 'This is the heir; come, let's kill him, and all will be ours.'
So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
When the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do with these tenants?
"He will destroy those wicked people," they answered, "and will rent the vineyard to other husbandmen, who shall render him the fruits in their seasons."
Jesus said to them, "Have you not read what is written in the Scriptures: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. The Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22, 23)
Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a people who will bear its fruit.
"Whoever falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but the stone will crush whoever falls on it."
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables. They knew he was speaking about them.
So they sought a way to seize him, but they feared the multitudes. For they perceived that because of the multitudes Jesus was considered to be a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Story
He taught them other stories at that time. He said:
Here is an example of the Kingdom of Heaven. The king prepared a wedding feast for his son.
He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the dinner. The servants told them to come, but they refused.
Then he sent out other servants, saying, "Tell those who were invited: 'I have prepared my dinner. My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.'"
But people didn't care. One went to his field. Another went to work.
The others captured his slaves. They treated them badly and then killed them.
The king was furious. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed those murderers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants, "The wedding feast is ready, but those I invited are not worthy to come."
Go to the street corners. Invite anyone you find to dinner.
So the slaves went out into the streets. They gathered all the people they found, whether good or bad. Soon, the wedding hall was filled with guests.
The king entered to see the guests. He noticed a man who was not wearing wedding clothes.
"Friend, he said to him, how did you enter here without a wedding garment?" The man could not say anything.
Then the king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet, and cast him out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
"Many are called, but few are chosen. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?"
The Pharisees went out. They resolved to entrap Jesus in His words.
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. They said, "Teacher, we know that you are a man of integrity. You teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You don't let others tell you what to say or do. You don't care about their status."
So tell us, what is your opinion? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
But Jesus knew their wicked intentions. He said, "You hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me?"
Show me the currency that people use to pay taxes. They brought him a silver coin.
He asked them, "Whose is this picture? And whose are these words?"
They said, "What is Caesar's." He said to them, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
When they heard this, they were amazed. They left him and went away. "Marriage is when the dead rise."
That same day, the Sadducees came to Jesus with a question. They do not believe that people rise from the dead.
They said, "Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up children for his brother."
There were seven brothers among us. The first one got married and passed away. He had no children, so he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened with the second and third brothers. It continued until it reached the seventh brother.
Finally, the woman died.
Then, when the dead rise, which of them will be your husband? All seven of them were married to you.
Jesus replied, "You are wrong because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God."
When the dead rise, they will not marry, nor will they be given in marriage. They will be like the angels in heaven.
What about the resurrection of the dead? Haven't you read what God has told you?
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." (Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching. It was like nothing they had ever heard before.
The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees had been unable to answer Jesus. So the Pharisees gathered together.
One of them, an expert in the law, tested Jesus with a question.
"Teacher," he asked, "which is the most important matter in the law?"
Jesus answered, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind." (Deuteronomy 6:5)
This is the first and most important commandment.
"You shall love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"All things written in the Law and the Prophets are based on these two commandments." Who is the father of Christ?
The disciples were gathered together. Jesus asked them,
What do you think about Christ? Whose Son is He? "The Son of David," they answered.
He said to them, "Why then does David call him 'Lord'? The Holy Spirit spoke through David himself." David said,
"The LORD said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.'" (Psalm 110:1)
So if David calls him "Lord," how can he be his son?
No one could answer him in a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him any questions.
Jesus pronounces judgment on the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law.
Jesus had compassion on the crowds and his disciples.
He said, "The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat."
"But you do not follow them. Do everything they tell you, but do not do as they do, for they do not practice what they preach."
They bind heavy burdens and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.
Everything they do, they do it to be seen by others. On their foreheads and arms they wear small boxes containing verses from the Bible. They make the boxes very wide. And they make the badges on their coats very long.
They love to sit in places of honor at dinners. They also love to have the most important places in synagogues.
They love to be greeted in the marketplaces. They love to be called "Rabbi."
But you should not be called "Rabbi." You have only one teacher, and you are all brothers.
Do not call anyone on earth your father. You have one Father, and he is in heaven.
He should not be called a "teacher." You have one Teacher, the Christ.
The greatest among you is your servant.
He who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. You yourselves do not enter, and you hinder those who are trying to enter.
(No
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are.
Woe to you, blind guides! You say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.'
You are blind and foolish! What is more important? Is it gold? Or is it the temple that makes gold sacred?
You also said: "If anyone swears by the altar, it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift that is on it, he is bound by his oath."
O blind people! What is more important? Is it the guidance? Or is it the altar that makes the sacrifice holy?
"So whoever swears by the sacrifice, he swears by it and everything on it."
And whoever swears by the temple, swears by it and by Him who dwells in it.
"And whoever swears by the sky, he swears by the throne of Allah and by Him who sits upon it."
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law: judgment, mercy, and faith. These ought you to have done, and not to leave the other undone.
Oh blind guide! You strain out the gnat but swallow the camel!
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and self-indulgence. You blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel.
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean.
It's the same with you. From the outside, it looks like you're doing what's right. But on the inside, you're full of what's wrong. You're pretending to be something you're not.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and adorn the sepulchres of the righteous.
And you say, "If it were not for you, we would have been like the people who passed away before us; we would not have done what they did, and we would not have been subjected to humiliation."
You bear witness against yourselves. You admit that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
Complete the sins that those before you have started!
O nest of vipers! How will you escape the sentence of hell?
"So I will send you prophets and wise men and teachers, and some of them you will kill and crucify, and some you will scourge in your synagogues, and chase them from town to town."
And you will pay for the blood of all the good people that has been shed on the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
What I'm going to tell you is true. All this will happen to those who are living now.
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I have wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!
Look, your house is empty.
I say to you, you will not see me again until you say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord." (Psalm 118:26)
Symptoms of Resurrection
Jesus came out of the temple. As he was walking, his disciples came to him. They wanted to draw his attention to the buildings of the temple.
"Do you see all these things?" asked Jesus. "Truly I tell you, not one stone will be left on another; every stone will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. There his disciples came to him privately and said, "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end?"
Jesus answered, "Be on your guard! Beware of all false prophets."
Many will come in my name, saying, "I am the Christ!" and they will deceive many.
You will hear of wars. You will also hear people talking about future wars. Do not be afraid. Those things must happen. But the end is not yet.
Nations will fight nations. Kingdoms will fight kingdoms. People will hunger. There will be earthquakes in many places.
All these are the beginning of the birth pangs.
Then they will deliver you up to be tortured and killed. You will be hated by all nations because of me.
At that time, many will turn away from their faith. Some will hate each other. Some will hand over their fellow believers to their enemies.
Many false prophets will arise. They will deceive many people.
For the abundance of evil will cause the love of many to grow cold.
But those who endure to the end will be saved.
This gospel of the kingdom will be preached throughout the world. It will be a witness to all nations. Then the end will come.
The prophet Daniel spoke of the "abomination that desolates" (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11). One day you will see it standing in the holy place. The reader must understand this.
Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains.
No one on the roof should come down to get anything out of their house.
No one in the field should go back to get their coat.
I will be a great terror in those days to all who are around us; and against the children who survive I will make you a terror, and you shall be a ruler over them.
Pray that you may not have to flee in winter or on the Sabbath.
There will be great tribulation in those days, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever will be again.
If time were not shortened, no one would survive. But for the sake of God's chosen people, it will be cut short.
At that time someone may say to you, "Look! Here is the Christ!" or "There he is!" Do not believe it.
The Antichrist and false prophets will appear. They will perform great and wondrous signs. They will seek to deceive the chosen people of God, if possible.
If indeed, I have already informed you.
If someone tells you, "He is far out in the desert," do not go to him. Or if someone says, "He is inside the house," do not believe him.
"Just as lightning that comes from the east is visible in the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be."
Vultures will gather wherever there is a corpse.
After those painful days, "the sun will grow dark, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky, and the planets will vanish." (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory.
He will send His angels with a mighty blast. They will gather His elect from the four corners of the earth. They will bring them from the ends of the heavens to the ends of the heavens.
Learn a lesson from the fig tree. Once its branches become smooth and its leaves sprout, you know that summer is near.
Similarly, when you see all these things happening, you know that the end is near. It's at the door.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. Those who are living at that time will not die until all these things have happened.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. No one knows the day or the hour.
No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
Remember how it was in the days of Noah. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking. They were getting married. They were giving their daughters in marriage. They were doing all those things right up to the day Noah entered the ark.
"They were unaware of what was going to happen until the flood came and took them all. So will it be at the coming of the Son of Man."
There will be two men in the field. One will be taken and the other left.
Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and the other left.
So be prepared. You do not know what day your Lord will come.
You must understand something. Suppose the homeowner knew at what time of night the thief would come. Then he would have remained vigilant. He would not have allowed the thief to enter his home.
You also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
A master puts one of his slaves in charge of caring for the rest in his house. It is up to this slave to give them their food at the right time. The master wants a trustworthy and wise slave for this position.
It will be good for the servant if the master finds him working when he returns.
What I am about to tell you is true. Mr. will make that servant responsible for all that he has.
But suppose this slave is wicked. Suppose he says to himself, "My master is a long time in coming."
He assumes that he starts beating other servants. And he assumes that he eats and drinks with those who drink privately.
The master of that servant will come on a day when the servant does not expect his master. He will come at an hour the servant does not know.
Then the lady will be cut into pieces. He will send her to the place where the protesters go. There people will weep and gnash their teeth.
The Parable of the Ten Virgins
Here is what the kingdom of heaven will be like at that time. Ten virgins took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were foolish. Five were wise.
The wise took their lamps, but they did not take any olive oil with them.
The wise ones took oil in jars with their lamps.
The suitor didn't come for a long time. So all the maidens of honor got tired and fell asleep.
At midnight, someone shouted, "Here comes the bridegroom! Take your places to receive him!"
Then all the virgins awoke and trimmed their lamps.
The fools said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil. Our lamps are going out."
"No," they replied. "There may not be enough for everyone. Instead, go to those who sell oil. Buy some for yourselves."
So they went to buy oil. But while they were on their way, the bridegroom arrived. And the virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast. Then the door was shut.
Then, the rest of the moon's grooms came. They said, "Master! Master! Open the door for us!"
But he answered, "What I tell you is true. I do not know you."
Keep watch, then. You do not know the day or the hour when the bridegroom will come. The Story of the Three Servants
Again, it will be like a kingdom of heaven. There was a man going on a journey. He called his servants and gave them responsibility for his possessions.
He gave ten thousand dollars to one. And he gave four thousand dollars to another. And he gave two thousand dollars to the third. The man gave each servant the amount of money he knew the servant could handle. Then he went on his journey.
The servant who received the ten thousand dollars immediately went and invested his money. He made another ten thousand dollars.
He who got four thousand dollars got four thousand dollars more.
But the man who received two thousand dollars went and dug a hole in the ground. He hid his master's money there.
After a long time, the master of those servants returned. He wanted to gather all the money they had earned.
The man who received ten thousand dollars brought the other ten thousand dollars. He said, "Sir, you trusted me with ten thousand dollars. Look, I've made another ten thousand dollars."
His master said to him, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Come, share your master's joy!"
The man with four thousand dollars came as well. He said, "Sir, you have brought me four thousand dollars. Look, I have made another four thousand dollars."
His master said to him, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master!"
Then came the man who had received the two thousand dollars. He said, "Sir, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not scatter seed.
So I was afraid, and I went out and hid your talent in the ground. Look, here is what belongs to you.
His master said to him, "You wicked and lazy slave! Did you know that I harvest where I did not sow? Did you know that I gather the crop where I did not scatter the seed?"
Then you must put my money in the bank. When I return, I will retrieve it with interest.
Then his master ordered the other servants, saying, "Take the two thousand dollars from him and give it to the one who has twenty thousand dollars."
To those who have, more will be given, and they will have an abundance. But from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away.
Cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness. There, in the darkness, people will weep and gnash their teeth. "The sheep and the goats"
The Son of Man will come in his glory. All the angels will be with him. Then he will sit on his throne of glory in the sky.
All nations will be gathered before Him. He will separate people into two groups. It will be like a shepherd separating the sheep from the goats.
He will separate the sheep from the goats, putting the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right, "Blessed are you by my Father. Come, take your inheritance, the kingdom that was prepared for you since the creation of the world."
I was hungry. You brought me food. I was thirsty. You brought me drink. I was a stranger. You welcomed me into your home.
I was in need of clothes, and you gave them to me. I was sick, and you took care of me. I was in prison, and you visited me.
Then the righteous will answer him, "Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you? Or thirsty and give you a drink?"
When did we see you a stranger and invite you? When did we see you in need of clothes and give them to you?
"When did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?"
The king will answer and say to them, "Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did it to one of the least of these brothers of Mine, you did it to Me."
Then he will say to those on his left, "Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels.
I was hungry. But you gave me nothing to eat. I was thirsty. But you gave me nothing to drink.
I was a stranger, and you did not welcome me into your homes. I was in need of clothes, but you did not give me any. I was sick and in prison, but you did not care for me.
They will also say, "Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty and not help you? When did we see you a stranger or in need of clothes, or sick or in prison and not help you?"
He will say: "What I am telling you is the truth. Anything you did not do for the least of these, you did not do for me."
Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but those who have done good will receive eternal life.
The plan to kill Jesus
When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, Caiaphas.
They made plans to arrest Jesus cleverly. They wanted to kill him.
"But not during the feast," they said. "It might stir up trouble." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in Bethany. There was a man named Simon who had a skin disease.
A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, and she poured it on his head as he was reclining at the table.
When the students saw this, they got angry. "Why this waste?" they asked.
Good things might be sold at a high price. Money might be given to poor people.
When Jesus learned of it, he said to them, "Why are you troubling this woman? She has done a good deed to me."
You will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.
The perfume fell silent on my body to prepare me for burial.
What I am about to tell you is true. What you have done will be heard everywhere this good news is preached throughout the world. It will be told in remembrance of her." Judas agrees to hand over Jesus.
And one of the twelve, whose name was Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests.
He said, "What will you give me, and I will deliver Jesus to you?" They counted out to him thirty pieces of silver.
From that time, Judas waited for the opportune moment to hand Jesus over to them. The Lord's Supper
It was the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover meal?"
He said, "Go to the town to a certain man. Tell him, 'The teacher says, 'My time is near. I will keep the Passover in your house with my disciples.' "
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.
When evening came, Jesus was at the table with the Twelve.
And as they were eating, he said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me."
The pupils were very sad. Each of them began to say to him, "Is it I, Lord?"
Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand with me in the dish, the same will betray me."
The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.
It was Judas who was to betray him. He said, "Surely it is not I, Lord?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is you."
And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks, and broke it. He gave it to his disciples and said, "Take and eat; this is my body."
Then he took the cup, gave thanks, and offered it to them, saying, "All of you drink from it."
This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
This is what I am telling you. From now on, I will not drink wine with you again until the day I drink it with you in my Father's kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus says Peter will deny him.
Jesus said to them, "This night you will all fall away because of me. For it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)"
"But after I am raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."
Peter replied, "Everyone else might turn away because of you. But I never will."
"What I am telling you now is the truth," Jesus answered. "It will happen this very night. Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times that you know me."
But Peter said, "I will never deny you, even if I have to die with you." And all the disciples said the same. Jesus prayed in Gethsemane.
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
He took Peter and the sons of Zebedee with him. He began to be sorrowful and very troubled.
Then he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and keep watch with me."
He went a little farther. Then he fell on his face and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup of suffering be taken away from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, "Could you not watch with me for one hour?"
Look and pray. Then you will not fall into sin when you are tempted. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Jesus went away again. He prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. Nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will."
Then he returned. He found them sleeping again. They couldn't keep their eyes open.
So he left them and went away again. And he prayed a third time, using the same words.
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is near. The Son of Man is being handed over to sinners."
"Rise! Let us go! Behold, he who betrays me to them is come!" Jesus is arrested.
While Jesus was still speaking, Judas arrived. He was one of the twelve. A large crowd was with him, carrying swords and clubs. The chief priests and the elders of the people had sent them.
Judas, who was to betray Jesus, had agreed to a sign with them. He said, "Whomever I kiss, he is the one; seize him."
So Judas went to Jesus immediately and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you have come for." Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and imprisoned him.
At that moment, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it, and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
"Put your sword back in its place," Jesus told him. "For all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you think I can't ask my father for help? He'll immediately send an army of over 70,000 angels.
But how will the scriptures be fulfilled? They say that this must happen this way.
At that time Jesus spoke to the crowd. He said, "Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me? Day after day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me."
But all this has happened so that the words of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him and fled. Jesus is taken to the Sanhedrin.
Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
Not far away, Peter followed Jesus. He went straight to the high priest's courtyard. He went in and sat with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the Sanhedrin were seeking for a way to use against Jesus. They wanted to kill him.
But they found no evidence, although many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two other witnesses stepped up.
They said, "This man claimed, 'I can destroy the temple of God. I can rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Do you not answer? What is it that these men testify against you?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."
"Yes," Jesus answered. "As you say, but I tell you all, in the coming days you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Almighty and coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy against God! Why do we need more witnesses? You have heard him say this blasphemous word."
"What do you think?" "He must die!" they answered.
Then they spat in his face. They struck him with their hands. Others cursed him.
They said, "Prophesy to us, Christ! Who hit you?" Peter said he did not know Jesus.
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A maid came to him. She said, "You also were with Jesus of Nazareth."
But in front of everyone, Peter said it wasn't so. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.
Then he went out to the gate leading to the courtyard. Another woman there saw him and said to the crowd, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
He said again that it wasn't so. He even swore, saying, "I don't know this man!"
After a short while, he approached Peter who was there. They said, "You are one of them without a doubt." "Your way of speaking gives you away."
Then Peter began to curse and swear, "I do not know this man!" And immediately a rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And he went out and wept bitterly.
Judah hangs himself.
It was early morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to kill Jesus.
They bound him, and led him away, and delivered him to Pilate the governor.
Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned to death. He felt ashamed and deeply grieved for what he had done. He returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
He said, "I have made a mistake, for I have released an innocent man." They replied, "What does that have to do with us? That's your problem."
So Judas threw the money into the temple and went away. Then he went and hanged himself.
The moneychangers took the money and said, "It is not lawful to put this money into the treasury, for it is a price of blood, since it was paid for the blood of a man."
They decided to use the money to buy the clay field. People from other countries will be buried there.
That is why it is called the Field of Blood to this day.
Then the words of the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled. He had said, "They paid thirty pieces of silver, the price set for him by the people of Israel."
"Use this money to buy the potter's field, as the Lord directed me." (Zechariah 11:12, 13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) Jesus is brought before Pilate.
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered, "Yes, as you say."
But when the chief priests and the elders brought charges against him, he did not answer.
Then Pilate asked Jesus, "Do you not hear the charges they are bringing against you?"
But Jesus made no answer, not even to a single charge. The governor was quite amazed.
It was the governor's custom at the festival to release one prisoner whom the people had chosen.
At that time, they had a famous prisoner named Barabbas.
So when the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled for him at Pilate's palace, they cried out, "Release Barabbas to us! But kill Jesus who is called Christ!"
Pilate learned that the leaders were envious. He knew that was the reason they had handed Jesus over to him.
While Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message, saying, "Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much in a dream because of him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus crucified.
"Which one do you want me to release?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered.
"What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" asked Pilate. And they all answered, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What evil has he done?" asked Pilate. But they cried out all the more, "Crucify him!"
Pilate saw that he was making no progress. In fact, the crowd was beginning to get angry. So he took water and washed his hands in front of them. He said, "I am innocent of this man's blood. You are responsible for it!"
All the people answered, "We and our children will bear the guilt of his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas, but he ordered Jesus to be flogged and then handed him over to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
The governor's soldiers took Jesus into the palace, which is called the Praetorium. All the rest of the soldiers gathered around him.
They took his clothes and dressed him in a purple robe.
Then they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt in front of him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!"
They threw things at him. They hit him on the head with a stick repeatedly.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to be crucified. Jesus is crucified on the cross.
On their way out of the city, they met a man from Cyrene named Simon. They forced him to carry the cross.
They came to a place called Golgotha. Golgotha means the place of the skull.
There they mixed wine with bitter spices and offered it to Jesus to drink. After tasting it, he refused to drink it.
When they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots.
They sat and remained watching over him there.
Above his head they placed the written charge against him: "THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS."
Two thieves were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
Those who passed by shouted at Jesus, mocking him. They shook their heads.
He said, "So you will destroy the temple and build it in three days? Save yourself! Come down from the cross if you are the Son of God!"
In the same way, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders mocked them.
They said, "He saved others. Let him save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
He trusts in God. May God deliver him now, if He wills. He who said, "I am the Son of God."
Likewise, the thieves who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him. The death of Jesus.
From noon until three, darkness covered the whole earth.
Around the third hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" which means "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some who were standing near heard Jesus call out, "Lazarus, come out!"
Immediately, someone ran and got a sponge. He filled it with sour wine and put it on a stick. He offered it to Jesus to drink.
The others said, "Leave him. Let's see if Elijah will come to save him."
After Jesus cried out loudly again, he died.
At that moment, the curtain in the temple was torn from top to bottom. The earth shook. The rocks split.
The graves were opened. The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus had risen, they entered the holy city. There they appeared to many people.
The centurion and those with him, who were guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake and all that had happened, and they were terrified. They said, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
Not far away, many women were watching. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs.
Mary Magdalene was with them. Mary the mother of James and Joseph was there as well. The mother of the sons of Zebedee was also with them. They buried Jesus.
As evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus, came.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
He placed her in his new tomb that he had hewn out of the rock. He rolled a large stone in front of the entrance to the tomb. Then he went away.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The tomb guards.
The next day was after the day of preparation. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
They said, "O our Lord, we remember what the liar said while he was still alive: 'In three days I will rise again.'"
So guard the tomb until the third day, lest his disciples come and steal him away, and tell the people that he is risen from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first.
"Take some guards with you," Pilate answered. "Go. Make the tomb as secure as you can."
So they went and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone and setting the guard.
Jesus is raised from the dead.
It was Saturday evening. It was the dawn of the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
It was a powerful earthquake. An angel of the Lord came down from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled away the stone and sat on it.
His body shone like lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so frightened of him that they trembled and became like the dead.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified."
Not here! He has risen just as he said he would! Come and see the place where he was.
Go quickly and tell his disciples: 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you.
So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy. They ran to tell his disciples.
Suddenly Jesus met them. "Greetings!" he said. They came to him, took hold of his feet and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me." The guards reported to the chief priests.
As the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
When the chief priests met with the elders, they made a plan. They gave the soldiers a large sum of money.
They said to the soldiers, "We want you to say, 'His disciples came at night and stole his body while we were sleeping.'"
If the governor hears this report, we'll buy it. That'll keep you out of trouble.
So the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus' last commands to his disciples.
Then the twelve disciples went to Galilee. They went to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they bowed down to him. Yet some of them still doubted.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
"Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the end of the age."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
This is the beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Long ago, the prophet Isaiah wrote: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
A voice cries out in the wilderness: "Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight in the wilderness a highway for our God." (Isaiah 40:3)
John came. He baptized people in the desert. He also preached that people should be baptized and turn away from their sins, then God would forgive them.
All the people from the countryside of Judea came to him. All the people of Jerusalem also went out to him. When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John wore a garment of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
Here is what John the Baptist preached: "After me comes one who is more powerful than I, of whom I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals."
"I baptize you with water. But he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." Jesus is baptized and tested.
At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee. John baptized him in the Jordan River.
Jesus comes from the water. He looks up and sees the sky split open. He sees the Holy Spirit descend upon him like birds.
A voice said to him from heaven, "You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased."
So he was sent into the wilderness by the Holy Spirit.
Jesus was in the wilderness for forty days. There, he was tempted by the devil. Wild beasts did not harm Jesus. Angels attended him. Jesus chooses the first disciples.
After John was put in prison, Jesus went to Galilee. He preached the gospel.
"The time has come," he said. "The Kingdom of God is near. Repent of your sins and believe in the good news!"
One day Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake. They were fishermen.
"Come, follow me," Jesus said. "I will make you fishers of men."
Immediately they left their nets and followed him.
Then Jesus walked a little further. As he walked, he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat preparing their nets.
Immediately he called them. They left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and they followed Jesus. Jesus casts out an evil spirit.
Jesus and those with him went to Capernaum. When the Sabbath came, he entered the synagogue and began to teach.
The people were amazed at His teaching. He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
Then a man in their synagogue cried out. He was possessed by an evil spirit. He said,
What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!
"Be silent!" said Jesus sternly. "Come out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Then it departed from him with a shout.
All the people were amazed. They asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching with authority! He even commands evil spirits and they obey him!"
News about Jesus spread quickly throughout Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left Capernaum. They went immediately with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed, running a fever. They told Jesus about her.
So he went to her. He took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her. Then she began to serve them.
That evening after sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who were sick. They also brought all who were possessed by demons.
All the city's inhabitants gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many of them. They were afflicted with various diseases. He also cast out many demons. But he would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prayed in a solitary place.
It was very early in the morning, and it was still dark. Jesus got up and left the house. He went to a place where he could be alone. There he prayed.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they called out: "Everyone is looking for you!"
Jesus answered, "Let us go somewhere else, to the nearby villages. I must preach there too. For this purpose I have come."
He traveled throughout Galilee. He preached in their synagogues and cast out demons. Jesus healed a man with a skin disease.
A man with leprosy came to Jesus, kneeling down and pleading with him. "If you choose, you have the power to make me clean," he said.
Jesus was filled with deep anguish. He stretched out his hand and touched the man. He said, "I want to do that." "Be clean!"
The disease immediately left him. He recovered.
Jesus sent him immediately. Give the man a stern warning.
"Don't tell anyone about this," he said. "Go and show yourself to the priest. Offer the sacrifices prescribed by Moses. That will be a testimony to the priest and the people that you are 'clean'."
But that man went out and began to proclaim it freely, spreading the news to everyone. So Jesus could no longer enter a town openly; he remained in secluded places. But people were coming to him from every direction.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk.
A few days later, Jesus again entered Capernaum. When the people heard that he had returned to the house, they gathered.
So many people came to hear him that there was no room left, not even outside the door. And Jesus spoke to them.
Four of those who came were carrying a man who could not walk.
But they could not get to Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, lowering him on a mat, they set him before Jesus.
Jesus saw their faith, and he said to the man, "Child, your sins are forgiven."
Some Sharia teachers were sitting there. They were thinking,
Why is this person talking like this? He's saying something very evil! Only God can forgive sins!
Jesus knew immediately what they were thinking. He said to them, "Why are you thinking about these things?"
Is it easier to say to this man, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Get up, take your mat and walk"?
I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. Then he said to the man who could not walk, "Get up and walk."
He said, "I say to you, rise, take up your bed, and go to your house."
The man got up and picked up his mat, and walked away while everyone watched him. All the people were amazed. They praised God and said, "We have never seen anything like this before!" Jesus chooses Levi.
Again Jesus began to teach by the Sea of Galilee. A very large crowd followed him, because they saw the signs he was performing on the sick.
Jesus was walking by, and he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's booth. He said to him, "Follow me." And he got up and followed him.
Later, Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples. They were part of the large crowd following Jesus.
Some teachers of the law who were Pharisees were there. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. So they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
Jesus heard this and said to them, "It is not those who are healthy who need a doctor, but those who are sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners." Jesus questions fasting.
The disciples of John and the Pharisees fast. Some people came to Jesus and said to him, "The disciples of John fast, and the disciples of the Pharisees fast. But your disciples do not fast. Why do they not fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
And the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them. On that day they will fast.
People do not patch new cloth onto old clothes. If they do that, the new patch will pull away from the old. That will make the tear worse.
People do not pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the wine will burst the wineskins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be destroyed. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins. Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On the Sabbath, Jesus was walking through the grain fields with his disciples, and they began to pluck and eat some of the heads of wheat.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath."
He replied, "Haven't you read what David and his companions did when they were hungry? They were in need of food."
That was when Abiathar was high priest. David entered the house of God and ate the showbread, which was lawful only for the priests to eat, and also gave some to his men.
Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
"For the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath."
Healing on Saturday
Again Jesus entered the synagogue, and there was a man there with a withered hand.
Some Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They were watching him closely. They wanted to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus spoke to the man who had the withered and twisted hand. "Rise up before everyone," he said.
Then Jesus asked them, "What does the law say we should do on the Sabbath? Should we do good or evil? Should we save a life or destroy one?" But they did not answer.
Jesus looked at them in anger. He was very angry because their hearts were hard. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as new.
Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians against Jesus, how they might destroy Him. The multitudes followed Jesus.
Jesus went to the Sea of Galilee with his disciples. A large crowd from Galilee followed him.
The people heard about all that Jesus was doing. So they came to him from all directions. They came from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, across the Jordan River, and the region around Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowd, Jesus ordered his disciples to prepare a small boat for him. This would prevent people from crowding around him.
Jesus healed many people. The sick crowded around to touch him.
When the people with evil spirits saw Jesus, they fell before him. The spirits cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
And Jesus charged them that they should tell no man who he was. Jesus appoints the twelve apostles.
Jesus went up a mountain and called to him those whom he desired; and they came to him.
He appointed twelve of them and called them apostles. From that time they were with him. He also sent them out to preach.
They will have authority to cast out demons.
Jesus then appointed the Twelve. Simon was one of them. Jesus gave him the name Peter.
There were Jacob son of Zebedeh and his brother John. Jesus gave them the name Boanerges. Boanerges means Sons of Thunder.
There were also Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus. There were Thaddeus and Simon the Zealot.
Judas Iscariot was also among them. He was the one who would later betray Jesus to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebul
Jesus entered a house. Again, a crowd gathered. It was so large that Jesus and his disciples could not even eat.
His family heard about it, so they went to take him. They said, "He has lost his mind."
Some of the scribes were there. They had come from Jerusalem. They said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul! He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons."
Jesus called them and said to them in parables, "How can Satan cast out Satan?"
If a kingdom is divided against itself, it cannot stand.
If a family is divided, it cannot stand.
