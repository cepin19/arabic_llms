The song of the 14 generations from Abraham to David. The song of the 14 generations from David to the Babylonian captivity. And the song of the 14 generations from the Babylonian captivity to the Christ. Christ wrote this.
This passage translates to: "This took place to fulfill what the prophet had spoken: 'The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel' (which means 'God with us'). Mary and Joseph had been engaged, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit."
Her husband Joseph was a good man. He didn't want her to be a disgrace in public. So he wanted to divorce her secretly.
"Who could tell Joseph this? An angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, 'Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.'"
"Hello, how are you, father? They call him lazy, named Issa. Some of those fathers are removing their friends from their sides."
"He who knows himself knows God, as He knows. He spoke with the Messenger."
"Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive and will give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel." (Isaiah 7:14) The name Immanuel means "God with us."
Joseph stays. He works like an angel of the Lord. I want Mary to come home.
She had no child until Joseph took her, and she gave birth to a son whom she called Jesus.
Abdou plays, Jesus watches.
Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of King Herod. After Jesus was born, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
They said, "Where is the child who has been born to be King of the Jews? When we were in the East, we saw a star. Now we have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard about it, he was greatly disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
Herod asked all the chief priests and scribes where the Christ was to be born. They told him in Bethlehem.
"To Bethlehem in Judea," they said. "Ask the prophet. He said."
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times." (Micah 5:2)
Herod wrote to the world about 7d, he wrote to them what the best star he wrote was.
"Shepherd them to Bethlehem for me," he said. "Go and search diligently for the child. When you find him, bring me a report. Then we will go and worship him as well."
After the three wise men had heard the king, they traveled. The star they had seen in the east went before them. In the end, it stood over the place where the child was.
As long as they don't see the needle, they're full of wind.
The wise men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They knelt down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures. They gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
And God spoke to them in dreams, saying, "Do not go back to Herod." So they returned to their homeland by another route. The departure of the Magi to Egypt.
"Those who knew him were still speaking of him, when Joseph had a dream. In it an angel of the Lord appeared to him and said, 'Get up, take the child and his mother, and escape to Egypt, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.' So Joseph got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt, where he stayed until the death of Herod."
Joseph went ahead. During the night, Mary and the children fled to Egypt.
They remained there until the death of King Herod. This fulfilled what the Lord had spoken through the prophet: "I will bring my sons out of Egypt." (Ezekiel 11:1)
Herod understood the wise men's deception. He was furious. He ordered the killing of all the children in Bethlehem and its vicinity, two years old and under, according to the time the wise men had seen the star.
In this way, the words of the prophet Jeremiah came true. He had said,
A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and great mourning. Rachel is weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted, because they are no more. (Jeremiah 31:15) The family of Jesus is returning to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise! Take the child and his mother. Go to the land of Israel. Those who were trying to kill the child are dead."
Joseph's son got married. He took a wife and she is from the western part of the country.
After that, he heard about Archelaus, who was reigning over Judea. Archelaus was doing what his father Joseph Herod had done. This made Joseph fear returning there. So, he went back to the land of Galilee, to live there instead of Judea.
He lived in a town called Nazareth. That's why they called him "the Nazarene."
Jane Al-Ma3moun Uses The Ladder
In the thirtieth year, John the Baptist came and preached in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Repent of your sins! The kingdom of heaven is near."
"A voice cries out in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes were made of camel hair. He wore a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
The people came from Jerusalem and all of Judea. They came from all the region around the Jordan River.
They used to say that if they got married, John would bring them to Jordan.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to him where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Bearing fruit shows that you have turned away from your sins.
And do not say, "Abraham is our father." Indeed, Allah raised Abraham as an example for you.
You already have the axe at the roots of the trees. All the trees that don't bear good fruit will be cut down. They will be thrown into the fire.
Ana ma'atadk bilma'a, na'tik t'hawwal 'ala khatayak. Lakin ba'd ana, hadda yji 'alihi akbar minni. W'ma 'andi 'ala yhammal 'asbayeh. Huwa yma'atadk bilruh l'qadim w'binnar.
He had gunpowder in his hands when he reached for the matchbox. He struck a match and held it to the fuse in the warehouse. But he ignited the gunpowder with the fire, which did not reach the matchbox. Jesus intervened with the miners.
Isa is coming from Galilee to Jordan. He wants to be baptized by John.
John went to the market. He said, "Don't forget me. But then, where are you going?"
Ajis said: "That will be fine. We have to do that. It will please God's angels." Then John agreed.
The centurion gave Jesus glory, saying, "Truly this was a son of God." At that moment, he let the sky open. Jesus saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove upon him.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. I do not want him very much."
Isa suffered a trial.
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert. There, the devil tempted him.
After 40 days and 40 nights of not eating, Jesus appeared.
The devil came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread."
A strange answer, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'" (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city. He had him stand on the highest point of the temple.
If you are children of God, he said, "Fly to yourself downward. It is written, 'The Lord will command his angels to protect you well. They will lift you up in their hands. Then you will not stumble on a stone.' " (Psalm 91:11, 12)
Strange his answers: "It also says, 'You shall not test the Lord your God.' (Deuteronomy 6:16)"
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain. He showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
"If you submit and prostrate before me," he said, "I will give you all this."
Ajees said to him, "Get away from me, Satan! It is written, 'Worship the Lord your God. Him alone you shall serve.' " (Deuteronomy 6:13)
Then the devil departed from Jesus. Angels came and ministered to him. Jesus began to preach.
John had seen a vision. When they heard about it, he returned to Galilee.
Jesus came from Nazareth. He lived in the city of Capernaum, by the lake in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
"Thus saith the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker: Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command ye me."
Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee of the Gentiles! The land by the Mediterranean Sea! The region beyond the Jordan River!
"The people walking in darkness will see a great light. For those living in a land of deep darkness, a light will shine on them." (Isaiah 9:1-2)
"I want this time for Jesus to start coming out in power," he said. "Follow me on your knees!" he cried. "The kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus chose his first disciples, the local people.
One day, Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting their nets into the sea, for they were fishermen.
"Okay. Last one," he said, smiling. "I'll make you a promise."
He didn't go out with them and stayed home.
And he said, "Verily I say unto you, in the renewal of the world, when the Son of Man shall sit on his glorious throne, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel." And immediate
I want to work with the farmer and with his father, and I also work with Issa. Issa heals the sick.
Jesus preached in all the towns. There He taught in the synagogues, proclaimed the good news of the Kingdom of God, and healed every disease and every sickness among the people.
The news about him spread throughout Syria. People brought to him all who were sick with every kind of disease. Some suffered from severe pains. Others were possessed by demons. Some moved about wildly. Others were unable to walk. And Jesus healed them all.
Many people followed him. Some came from Galilee, from the region known as the Ten Cities, and from Jerusalem and Judea. Others came from the region across the Jordan.
Isa gives blessings.
"A large crowd followed him, and he healed them there. When he went up on a mountainside, he called to him those he wanted, and they came to him. He appointed twelve—designating them apostles."
And then he taught them. He said,
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
God bless those who are sad. They will find comfort.
Blessed are those who are humble. That land.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for justice, for they will be filled.
Blessed are those who show mercy. They show mercy.
May God bless their pure hearts. They see God.
Blessed are those who create peace. They shall be called children of God.
Blessed are those who suffer for what is right. The kingdom of heaven is theirs.
Blessed are you when people mock you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you because of me.
"He said and said. You rewarded me with what I wanted in heaven. That's it, people used to worship the prophets who lived before. Melh and Nour."
It's the salt of the earth. But what if the salt has lost its taste? How can its salt be restored? No one can recall its days. It's disgusting. People go down the drain.
You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden.
We need some Libyan women and we'll take them as employees. We need to write about them in a positive way. After that, we can take care of the whole house.
Until when, I'll change your perception. Then they will see the goodness that fills them. And they will look up to the sky with gratitude. Then the law will come into effect.
"Do not think that I have come to abolish what is written in the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish these things but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished."
This is what I will tell you again and again. Heaven and earth will disappear before a small letter of the Law disappears. Not even a small line drawn by a pen will disappear from the Law before everything is fulfilled.
Do not break any of God's little commandments. Do not teach anyone to break them. If you do break them, that is called small in the kingdom of heaven. Instead, practice and teach these commandments. That is called great in the kingdom of heaven.
I wish I could follow you. Your wisdom is greater than that of the Persians and the religious scholars. If it weren't for you, we wouldn't have reached the heavenly kingdom. The killing.
What you have heard was said to the people who lived long ago. They were told, "You shall not kill. (Exodus 20:13) Whoever kills will be punished for it."
This is how it goes. Don't get angry at someone who is with you. This person who is with you should not be judged by his peers. Now, this person who is with you and supports "Raca" should be judged by the Sanhedrin. But this person who is with you and shouts "You donkey!" should be punished by the court.
See that you do not present your gift at the altar and then remember that your brother has something against you.
"Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled with your brother, and then come and offer your gift."
"Know that someone has a complaint against you and they are taking you to court. Settle the matter quickly. Do it while you're with him on the way. If you don't do so, step by step, step by step, step by step, step by step, step by step, step by step, step by step, step by step, step by step, step by step, step by step, step by step, step by step, step by step, step by step, step by step, step by step, step by step."
What we're telling you is right. You're not getting out until you pay the last cent! Liar.
"You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit adultery.' (Exodus 20:14)"
I'm like you, I say what I think. You don't see anything wrong with that. This one isn't in his right mind to do that with his heart.
The law can protect you, but it can also harm you. It's not any less a part of your body. Another person can use it to harm your body entirely, sending you to hell.
"We were never meant to be together, it's over. Our eyes never accepted each other's existence. I prefer to call you names rather than your name. Goodbye."
They said: "If a man divorces his wife, he must give her a divorce certificate." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
This is how it is. Anyone who divorces his wife, makes her suffer. And anyone who considers his wife a burden, makes her a burden. A man can divorce his wife, but only if she is not good to him. Those were the days.
Later, when you hear what your enemy says about you, tell them this: "Do not break the covenant with God. Keep the covenant that I have made."
As you are, so is he who you speak of. You do not offer anything good with such speech. You do not speak the name of God. That is the throne of Allah.
Don't treat them like animals. This is the ancient city of the great kingdom. Don't treat them like saints. This is the city of the mighty king.
And you cannot control what is on your head. You cannot change the color of a single hair, whether white or black.
I want to be "Yes" when I say "Yes" and "No" when I say "No". Everyone who does otherwise has a devil inside them. Be firm in your decision.
"An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth" (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
"Just like you imagined. Don't expose your positions. 'Imagine your positions are discovered by your enemy. Immediately change your other positions as well.'"
If someone takes you to court for your shirt, give him your coat too.
Take life easy. If someone hates you, go a mile, go with him two miles.
Give to him who asks of you, and do not turn away him who would borrow from you. Love your enemies.
"You have heard the saying, 'Love your neighbor (Leviticus 19:18). Hate your enemy."
But here is what I tell you. Love your enemies. Pray for those who hurt you.
"But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous."
If you love those who love you, what will you get? Even tax collectors love those who love them.
If you only greet your own people, what sets you apart from others? Even people with no religion do the same.
Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Giving to the needy.
Don't do the wrong deed before the exam. Don't do it later either. If you do, your father in the morning won't talk to you.
Do not exalt the poor, do not sound a trumpet when you give. Do not be like those who act pious, proclaiming their deeds in the synagogues and on the streets. They love to be honored by people. They do not tell you the truth. Complete their wages.
What you give to the poor, don't let your right hand know what your left hand is doing.
"What you hide will not remain hidden. Fathers know their children. He sees what you do in secret. Prayer."
"They say they are like us, but they are not. They want to rule in synagogues or in the media. They want people to see them. Most of them are liars. Some of them have even changed their names completely."
"Don't worry, I won't tell him. Take care of your heart, and may God protect you from those who hurt you. He's the one who should be talking to you. May God guide you in what you do."
"Oh my god, don't you dare act like the authorities, taking advantage of their power over and over again."
Don't be stupid. Dad will know the thing before you fix it.
"If there's a will, there's a way." "Father in heaven, let your name be blessed."
Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we also forgive those who sin against us.
Keep away from sin as much as you can. It is from Satan.
Forgive people when they wrong you. If you do that, the one in heaven will forgive you too.
Don't judge others by their past, because you don't know what they've been through. As-siyam
They will say, "If you had followed us, we would have made you a servant." They will make their faces dark with regret. They wish they could turn back time. The truth they denied will be their downfall. Their lies will come back to haunt them.
But if you don't want to go anywhere, put olive oil on your head. Wash your face.
Makach had the power to know what you want to do. He wanted God, the unseen power, who knows everything. He speaks to you. God sees the hidden power. He brought the power of the treasury in heaven.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
Instead, store your treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
Your treasure is where your heart is.
The eye is like a lamp for the body. If your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light.
Lakin suppose your eyes are bad. Then your whole body will be full of darkness. If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
One cannot serve two masters at the same time. It's either this one or that one. Either you love one and hate the other, or you are devoted to one and do not love the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not even try.
Collect, don't be absent. Don't be absent from my life and don't withhold food and drink. And don't be absent from my body and don't withhold clothing. Is there anything more important than food? Is there anything more important than clothing for my body?
Look at the birds in the sky. They don't plant or harvest crops. They don't store crops in barns. Yet your Father in heaven feeds them. Aren't you more valuable than they are?
Can you walk an hour a day in the city?
Isn't he the one who's absent in the books? Look how the bright stars enlarge. They neither carry nor store books.
Like father, like son. You can't expect Solomon to gather all these different kinds of flowers in one bouquet.
If God clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
Don't be absent. Don't say, "Do you want me to speak?" Or, "Do you want me to drink?" Or, "Do you want me to leave?"
People who weren't religious ran after all those things. Your Father in heaven knows you want them.
But I want Allah's will first. Do as He wills from you. After that, everything will be easy for you.
Don't be absent tomorrow. Tomorrow is the same, it's absent on its own. Every day it covers up its flaws.
Only justice can bring good.
I can't do it. It's not in your power.
You will also be judged as you judge others. You will also be measured as you measure others.
You see the speck of dust in your friend's eye, but you do not see the log in your own eye.
How do you tell your friend, "Let me remove a splinter from your eye," when you have a big log in your own eye?
You hypocrite! First, remove the splinter of wood from your own eye. Then you will see clearly to remove the speck of dust from your friend's eye.
Don't put your foot there. Don't put your leg on the pig. If you do, they will gnaw at your leg. After they gnaw, they will gnaw and bite you. Ask, Listen, Thank you.
Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you.
Everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. The door will open for him who knocks.
See your son asking you for bread. Which one of you will give him a stone?
The dog wants to eat meat. Who will give it to him?
The law is like a lion, it protects the rights of the children. And to some extent, it is like a father who in heaven protects the rights of the innocent.
F had tea, made some calculations so that he wouldn't change his mind. That's like what's written in the law and in contracts. The big door and the small one.
Enter the Kingdom of God through the narrow gate. The gate is wide and the road is broad that leads to death and hell. Many people go that way.
The small door and the narrow path are the ones that lead to life. Few find it. A tree and its fruit.
They prey on false prophets. They come to you like lambs, but inside they are ravening wolves.
"We'll do it the way you want. 'Are we still picking grapes from the thorns? Are we still plucking eyes from the socket?'"
A good tree bears good fruit. But a corrupt tree bears corrupt fruit.
A good tree does not bear bad fruit, and a bad tree does not bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You can know a tree by its fruit.
But this phrase "ya mola ya mola" is what reminds me of the kingdom of knowledge. Everything that is said and done, like our father of knowledge, is what reminds us.
Many of you will say to me in those days: "Lord! Lord! Did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many miracles in your name?"
"I didn't know you were like this. Leave me alone, you're the ones who are sick!" The two of them, reasonable and rational.
One who listens to my words and puts them into practice is like a wise man building a house on solid rock.
The rain pours down. The water rises. The wind blows and beats against that house. But it doesn't fall. It's built on the rock.
I wanted everyone to hear my words and not disregard them like a foolish man. They built their houses on sand.
The rain pours down. The water rises. The winds howl and strike that house. And it collapses with a great crash.
Jesus kept saying all these things. The crowds were amazed at his teaching.
He taught like anyone with authority. He didn't speak like law professors.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain. Large crowds followed him.
A man with a skin disease came and knelt before Jesus, saying, "Lord, if you choose, you can make me clean."
When Jesus stretched out his hand and touched the man, he said, "I want this. Be clean!" And immediately, the man was cleansed of his leprosy.
Then Jesus said to them, "You know the commandments. Do not murder. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness. Honor your father and mother." The Roman governor believed him.
When Jesus came to Capernaum, the Romans were waiting for him. They asked Jesus for help.
"My lord," he said, "my servant is sick at home, unable to move. He is in great pain."
Jesus said, "My disciples will stumble, but they will heal."
The leader replied, "Sir, I am not worthy to have you enter my house. But only say the word, and my servants will be healed."
I am a man in control. I have a team that does as I say. I tell this one "go" and he goes. I tell that one "come" and he comes. I tell the servant "do this" and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those who were following him, "Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with faith like this."
"I tell you, many will come from the east and the west and take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob."
If you want them to be in the kingdom, they will be outside, in the darkness. Here, they will stay and they will go out blind.
Then Jesus approached the Roman commander, "Go! As you have believed, so it will be done." And his servant was healed in that very hour. Jesus healed many people.
The gospel of Jesus according to 3rd Peter, Peter speaks. Then he looked at the woman. Then he had no home.
Jesus reached out and touched her hand. The fever left her, and she got up and began to wait on him.
Oh my god, many people who were considered crazy in the past were bringing medicine to humanity. He is a decision-maker for the benefit of all those who were not understood.
"He has done all this because he wanted to do something great and wondrous. He said, 'I will give him the wealth I have given him, and I will give him what I have given him.' (Isaiah 53:4) This is too much for the account of the suffering servant Isaiah."
When Jesus saw the crowds around him, he told his disciples to cross to the other side of the lake to the region of the Gadarenes.
Then a teacher of the law came to him. He said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
"It is written, 'Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.'"
One of the followers said to him, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."
"You follow me. Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus sat on the ground.
Jesus got into a boat. His disciples followed him.
Suddenly, a terrible storm came upon the lake. The waves were hitting the boat. But Jesus was asleep.
The pupils went and woke him up. They said, "Master! Save us! We're going to suffocate!"
He said, "Your faith is so small! Why are you so afraid?" Then Jesus got up and commanded the winds and the waves to stop. There was a dead calm.
The student was astonished. He said, "What is this defect? Even the wind and the waves obey him!" Jesus will heal him in the defect.
Jesus reached the other side of the lake in the region of the Gerasenes. He saw two men possessed by demons, coming out of the tombs. They were so violent that no one could pass by.
"Son of God, what do you want with us?" they asked. "Have you come to punish us before our time of judgment?"
Little by little, a large group of pigs was eating.
The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Strange, when Jesus came, he said to them, "Go!" Then the demons came out of the men and entered the pigs. And the whole herd rushed towards the steep bank. They ran to the sea and drowned in the waters.
The ones who were guarding the pigs fled. They went to the city and reported all of this. They told the people what happened to the men who were controlled by the demon.
After that, the whole city came to meet Aisha. When they saw her, they greeted her with salutations.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk.
Jesus got into a boat, crossed over, and came to his own town.
Some men came carrying a paralytic, who was lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
Then some teachers of the law said to themselves, "This fellow is saying a very evil thing!"
Jesus knew their thoughts. He said to them, "Why do you have evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Is "Let go of your sins, they are forgiven" easier said than "Get up and walk"?
I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. Then he said to the man who was paralyzed, "Get up, take your mat and go home."
The man stood up and went home.
"When they gathered together against him, he was filled with compassion. When they had gathered together against him, God remembered the authority that they had received to put him to death. And when Jesus was alive, he said..."
Jesus passed by and saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," Jesus told him. Matthew got up and followed him.
After that, Jesus was dining at Matthew's house with many tax collectors and "sinners." Everyone was dining with Jesus and His disciples.
The Pharisees saw this and asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
"I know. So say: 'Those who are healthy don't want it. Those who are sick do.'"
Walk and know what this means: "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Ezekiel 6:6) I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repent." Jesus asks about fasting.
One day the Pharisees came to Jesus. They said, "We and the Pharisees fast. Why don't you fast?"
"You like it, how can the groom's guests be sad when they are with him? He will return on the day when the groom has taken them away. Besides, they are the ones who are fasting."
The new layer is placed on top of the old layer. The new layer is responsible for the old layer. That's how you add phrases.
They don't mix new bread with old bread. When they mix it, they separate it. They knead the bread, and they bake the bread. No, they mix all new bread here. That's how they preserve it all.
One day, Jesus was saying this, and a ruler came. He knelt down in front of Jesus. He said, "My daughter has just died. But come and lay your hand on her. Then she will live again."
When Jesus rose, he went with him. His disciples followed him afterward.
Then, a woman came up behind Jesus. She had a bleeding disorder that had lasted twelve years. She touched the edge of his clothes.
She said to herself, "I have no choice but to touch his clothes. Then I will be healed."
Jesus came and saw her. "Mary," he said, "do not lose hope." "Your faith has made you well." The character was healed at that very moment.
"When I arrived at the village, I saw the fields here. And I saw the thriving community."
He said, "Go. The girl is not dead. She is sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After the company left, Jesus came in. She took the cloak in her hand and stood up.
The news about what Jesus had done spread throughout that whole region. Jesus heals two blind men.
Jesus stopped and called the blind man. "Have mercy on us, Son of David!" they cried.
When Jesus entered the house, the unbelievers came to him. They asked him, "Do you permit us to do this thing?" "Yes, my lord," they replied.
Thank you very much. He said, "It's a pleasure for me to do this for you."
They're going to see it again. Jesus warned them at night: "Make sure no one knows about it."
I'll keep him out and add the phrase. Write it with him in this area.
They left, and another man came to them. Satan was speaking through him, but he couldn't control himself to speak.
The devil was angry, so he spoke to the man. The community was astonished. They said, "There is no sin that has not been seen in Morocco."
And the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the prince of demons." But they did not do any works.
Jesus went through all the cities and villages. He was teaching in their synagogues. He was preaching the gospel of the kingdom. And he was healing every disease and weakness.
When he sees the people, he writes about them in his notebook, they are like dolls and puppets, he plays with them like a cat plays with a mouse.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
"She asks the Lord of the harvest to send workers into his field."
Jesus sends the twelve disciples.
Jesus called to him twelve disciples and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
He had twelve disciples. The first ones: Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. The last ones: James son of Zebedee and his brother John.
Next are Philip and Bartholomew, and also Thomas and Matthew the tax collector. Two more are James, son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus.
The last two were Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas was the one who later betrayed Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent these twelve with the following instructions: "Do not go among the Gentiles, and do not enter any town of the Samaritans."
Tomorrow, the servant from Israel will be eaten. They are like an animal to the servant who owns them and has no mercy.
"The angel of heaven is approaching."
Healed the sick. Raised the dead. Cleansed those with skin diseases. Cast out demons. You received freely, give freely.
I don't work with gold, silver, or copper in my workshop.
Don't take a laptop for the trip. Don't take extra clothes, sandals, or walking sticks. We need to give him only what he needs.

Some people may not welcome you or listen to you. If they don't do that, when you leave their house or town, shake the dust off your feet.
She who follows her desires, she is a liar. On the Day of Judgment, she will be walking on Sodom and Gomorrah before any other city.
I wanted to introduce you to one of my friends. He's very reasonable and helpful.
They will hand you over to the local courts. They will drag you to their churches.
Hello, I offer both parents and children from your new. They are witnesses to us and to us, there is no one absent.
But when they don't understand you, it doesn't matter what you say or how you say it. At that time, your words will only reinforce their misunderstanding.
My mother can't speak. Let Baba speak to you.
Hadi's brothers are brothers to kill. Hadi's fathers are their children. Hadi's children are against their fathers and kill them.
Everyone will hate you because of me. But everyone who endures to the end will be saved.
No one can make you feel inferior without your consent. The statement I'm about to tell you is true. You didn't feel like walking on Israeli territory before Adam's father came along.
A student is not angry with his teacher. A servant is not angry with his master.
Enough of the student being like the teacher. And enough of the servant being like the master. If the people of the house hear Beelzebub, what is left for the poor to deserve?
You can't hide from your mistakes. Everything hidden will be revealed. Everything covered will be uncovered.
Don't tell me in secret, say it in broad daylight. Don't whisper in your ear, shout it from the rooftops.

What are these two paths you're walking on with the same steps? But neither of them will fall to the ground unless God knows it.
How many years will it take to learn all these poems by heart!
Don't be afraid. We are more numerous than the birds.
I don't like it when people say in front of others that they know me. I'll also say in front of God in heaven that I know Him.
Is it not clear that anyone who goes against them is not understood? I will only go with my father who is in heaven, not with them.
I'm sorry, I came to kiss the ground. I didn't come to kiss. I came to die.
They say that "the children of the rich don't work. Girls don't work at home. They work for each other.
"A man's foes are they of his own household." (Micah 7:6)
Someone loves my father and mother more than I do. Someone loves my brother and sister more than I do.
"And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me."
If anyone finds their life, they will know it. If anyone loses their life for my sake, they will find it.
"If you had kept your promise to me, I would have kept my promise to you."
"Whoever welcomes a prophet as a prophet, will receive a prophet's reward. And whoever welcomes a righteous person as a righteous person, will receive the reward of a righteous person."
See if anyone gives even a glass of cold water to a little one following me. What I'm telling you is true. That one will attain marriage.
Jesus and John the Baptist
When Jesus had finished teaching his twelve disciples, he went on to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee.
John can be himself. I can't do what Christ did, sending disciples abroad.
They said to Jesus, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?"
Jesus replied, "Go back to John. Tell him what you have seen and heard."
Two blind men will see. Two lame men will walk. Those with skin diseases will be healed. The deaf will hear. The dead will be raised. And good news will be proclaimed to the poor.
God bless those who did not abandon their faith because of me.
Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John, saying, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
"He didn't find it, did he? You see why? You see a man in expensive clothes? No. People who wear expensive clothes are in the palaces of kings."
Do you want to go see the eyes? The prophet? Yes, I'll create you and many prophets.
"He will write on him in the book. He says, 'Send Me a messenger whom I may trust. And he will prepare a path before Me.'" (Malachi 3:1)
What I'm about to tell you is true. No one more important than John the Baptist has ever been born. But the least important in the Kingdom of Heaven is more important than he is.
The power that I wanted from Yahya al-Ma'mun, the kingdom of heaven was advancing with strength. And the powerful ones held him back.
Both the prophets and the scriptures prophesied until John came.
If you're willing to accept it, John is the hellias who was supposed to come.
I have two ears that hear.
"What are people imitating today? Children are sitting in the squares and listening to others. They say to him,"
"We played the flute for you. But you didn't dance. We sang a funeral song. But you didn't mourn."
"When I met John, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. I felt like the devil himself was standing before me."
But no human child is born evil, they are shaped by their environment and upbringing. People say: "This evil person always acts badly. He is surrounded by bad influences and mistakes." Those who act wisely prove that wisdom is right. Cities that do not turn away from sin.
Jesus spoke of the cities where he had done most of his miracles. The people there did not repent of their sins. So he said:
Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
He is imaginative. On judgment day, he will be a loser like the bird and the hunter.
And what about you, Capernaum? Will you be exalted to heaven? No! You will be brought down to the place where the dead are. If the miracles that were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until today.
I served the green tea. In the house of the judge, she is the one who serves the tea. The guests were delighted.
"Once upon a time, a poor man said: 'I thank you, O Father. You are the Lord of heaven and earth. You have created this world with all its wonders beyond the comprehension of minds and teachers. But you have shown it to us, the humble ants.'"
Yes, Dad. That's what I said.
Father will provide me with everything. Father is the only one who knows the son. And the only one who knows Father is the son, and the son chooses to reveal Father.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
That's a great question and a good way to learn. I'm happy to help. Here's the translation: "He is a changeable person and tends to be stubborn. I, however, am humble and do not have arrogance in me. Please understand my heart."
I am easy to serve, and my weight is light.
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
One Sabbath day, Jesus was walking through wheat fields. His disciples were hungry, so they began to break off some heads of wheat and eat them.
The Pharisees saw this and said to Jesus, "Look! It is unlawful to do such things on the Sabbath. But your disciples are doing it anyway!"
Did you like what you read about David? He and his men were hungry.
So he entered the house of God. He and all his men ate of the sacred bread, which was only lawful for the priests to eat.
Haven't you read the law? It says that every Sabbath the priests in the temple must do their work on that day. But they are not considered criminals.
Your collection is still bigger than mine.
The Bible says, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Ezekiel 6:6) You don't know what these words mean. If you did, you wouldn't bring accusations against innocent people.
"Children of Adam are the lords of Saturday."
With this blood, on this day, Jesus will redeem their sins.
A man with a withered and twisted hand was there. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. So they asked, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
"A man is worth more than sheep! That's why the law allows us to do good on Saturday."
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out. It was as good as new, just as good as the other hand.
The chief priests and the Pharisees went out and began to plot how they might kill him.
Jesus knew what the Pharisees were planning. So he left that place. Many people followed him, and he healed all their sick.
And they kept on talking and talking and talking and talking and talking and talking.
It says: «Kan hada li-t-tmim dyal ma qaal fi n-nabi Ishaaya.»
I had a servant. I wrote to him. He was the best I ever had. I trusted him a lot. I relied on him. He betrayed me. He is going to ruin the nations with his lies.
He doesn't leave me alone or speak. I've never heard his voice in my dreams.
I'm not getting on the first train. I'm not getting on the second train. I'm getting on every train.
"The nations will rally to him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Belzebub.
A blind man is coming to see Jesus. The man was my uncle and he couldn't speak or see. Jesus healed him. Now the man can speak and see.
Both men were amazed. They said, "Is this the son of David?"
The Pharisees heard this and said, "This man casts out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the prince of demons."
Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand."
No one can drive out Satan except Satan himself. So how can his kingdom stand?
"Quality for me, I wanted love with the power of Beelzebub. So why would I want your demons? Yes, they are the same, they rule over you."
But suppose they should refuse to accept Allah's message? Then tomorrow they would certainly be among the lost.
Don't linger on that. If you can enter a man's house forcefully and get what he owns? I don't want it or change it. After that, you can get the house.
"Whoever doesn't stand by me, hurt me. Whoever doesn't shake my hand, we're not friends."
Here is the translation: "This is how we speak. Every word that is said without anger or malice is forgiven. But words that are said without anger or malice, yet touch the soul, are truly forgiven."
"If anyone speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him. But if anyone speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the age to come."
If you work on a good tree, its fruit will be good. If you work on a corrupt tree, its fruit will be corrupt. You can judge a tree by its fruit.
Look at the nests of vipers! How can you, when you are evil, say anything good? Your mouths speak what is in your hearts.
A good man says a little good. This is from the goodness stored within him. A wicked man says a little wicked. This is from the wickedness stored within him.
"Just like that, that's what I said. In terms of calculation, people don't usually count all the silent letters."
In your words, you will be guilty or innocent. The wondrous verse of Yunus.
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus. They said, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from you."
"The people and the chiefs demanded the miraculous sign! But I don't want anyone with the sign of the prophet Jonah."
Jonah was in the belly of a great fish for three days and three nights. Something like that will happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the tomb.
The men of Nineveh will rise at the judgment day with the people who are living now. And when the men of Nineveh rise, they will prove that these people are grateful. The men of Nineveh repented from their sins when Jonah spoke to them. And now, someone greater than Jonah is present.
The queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with the people who are living now. She will prove them guilty. She came from far away to hear the wisdom of Solomon. Now someone greater than Solomon is here.
Can't a person's soul leave their body when they want? They walk in a desert searching for a place to rest. But there is none.
"Go back to the house I left." She promised, and I found an empty house. It was abandoned and dilapidated.
"Daksh, the giant, walked and took with him seven larger giants. They entered and settled in him. His father was a bit larger before. That's the kind of big people you wanted today." Mama and Issa's brothers.
He promised to talk to the group, but his mother and sisters were outside, wanting to speak to him.
Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are waiting outside. They want to speak with you."
Strange replied: "Who is this my mother? And who are these my sisters?"
I have this mother! These are my brothers!
"Someone does what they don't like, Daddy in heaven is my brother or sister or Mommy."
The Farmer's Tale
Today, just as Jesus was leaving the house, he went down to the shore of Lake Galilee.
Many people gathered around him. So he got into a boat. He sat in it. All the people stood on the shore.
After a long silence, he said to me, "If success comes, it will come unexpectedly, like a drop falling from the sky."
The flower is on the table. It's in a vase. It's beautiful and colorful.
Some seeds fell on rocky places, where there was little soil. The plants grew quickly, because the soil was not deep.
When the sun sets, the desert comes alive. They move towards us as if we were an oasis.
Hadia planted a tree in the garden. The tree is tall and needs water.
Keep planting until the soil is exhausted. You will harvest 100, 60, or 30 times more than you planted.
"For the listener, let him hear."
Students came to him. They asked, "Why do you use parables when you speak to people?"
He said, "You were certainly in ignorance of the secrets of the kingdom of the heavens. It was not you who were making it clear to others."
Everyone with this type of knowledge will give more. In fact, they will have a lot, a lot more. If someone doesn't have this type of knowledge, we will even take what they have.
I wanted to hear the poets, I wanted to hear them. I wanted to say, "Let them see, but don't let them see. Let them listen, but don't let them listen or understand."
"Hear, but do not understand; see, but do not perceive." - Isaiah 6:9
"The hearts of these people have grown dull. They cannot hear with their ears. They have closed their eyes. If they did not close their eyes, they might see with their ears. They might hear with their ears. They might understand with their hearts. They might turn to the Lord, and he would heal them." (Isaiah 6:9-10)
I wish your eyes never saw what they've seen. And I wish your ears never heard what they've heard.
This is what makes you truly blessed. Many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you see, but they didn't. They wanted to hear what you hear, but they didn't.
Listen! That's the meaning of the phrase "the early bird catches the worm."
People heard the message about the kingdom but did not understand it. Then the devil came. He stole what was sown in their hearts. These people are like the seed that was sown on the path.
Others received the seed that fell on rocky places. They are those who hear the message and at once receive it with joy.
I can't wait. I want them not to waste time. I get anxious like this when I'm waiting for the bus or the train. I want to get there early.
Others received the seed that fell among the thorns. They are those who hear the message, but then the worries of this life and the false promises of wealth crowd it out. They keep it from producing fruit.
They don't have the love that is displayed in the great wide world. That's why they heard the book and knew it. They do 100, 60 or 30 times more than the one who plays. The story of the companions.
I have another parable to tell you, said Jesus to the crowd: "This is how the kingdom of heaven is like. A man sowed a good seed in his field."
He and his friend were walking together, talking about the weather. His friend said that it was going to rain, so they decided to walk faster.
Qatif wants to come out and become a pill. At the same time, I want to show the hashish.
The village elders came to him. They said, "Sir, didn't you plant a beautiful grain in your field? But where did the weed come from?"
"It's normal for an enemy to do that," he said. The servants asked him, "Do you want us to go and remove the thorns?"
"No," said Malik. "While you're pulling the weeds, you might pull up the wheat with them."
Let them cultivate it together until the harvest. At that time, we'll make the workers know what to do. That's what I'll tell them. First, gather the weeds. Tie them in bundles to burn. Then, gather the wheat. Thresh it in my barn.
I have another parable to tell you. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. Someone took the seed and planted it in a field."
It is the smallest of all your seeds, but when it grows, it is bigger than all the plants in the garden. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest in its branches.
They have another story. "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast," he said. "A woman mixed it into a large amount of flour. The yeast worked its way through all the dough."
Isa would leave all this talk to the audience, asking them stories. He wouldn't tell them anything without showing them a story.
"My people, hear my teaching; listen to the words of my mouth. I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter hidden things from of old" (Psalm 78:2) He declares to his people a parable.
Then Jesus left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him. They said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
He said, "The Hour is near for those who know, it is the time of the Son of Man."
The field is the world. Good seeds represent the people who belong to the kingdom. Weeds are the people who belong to the devil.
The enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of time. And the workers are the angels.
The wicked will perish and be burned in the fire. That is how it will be on the Day of Judgment.
God will send His angels. These angels will remove from His kingdom everything that causes sin. These angels will also remove everything that does evil.
They throw it into the hot oven. People will start screaming and gnashing their teeth.
After that, the servants of God began to praise the beauty of the heavens in their hearts. The jinns had ears to hear. The story of the Hidden Treasure and the Pearl.
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again. He was very happy. So he went and sold everything he had. And he bought that field.
The moon, the king of the sky, appears with eyes wide open, gazing at the red planet.
Someone big in position. As they say, "He rose to the top and gave everything he had." Tasted your own medicine. May you choke on it.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake, and it caught all kinds of fish.
When a person is ill, they should see a doctor. Inside, they will wait and meet the doctor in the clinic. But they should bring their medical records.
Who knows what will happen on the Day of Judgment. The angels will come. They will separate the good servant from the bad servant.
They throw evil people into the hot oven. There, the evil people scream and chatter their teeth.
"Do you understand all this?" Jesus asked. "Wow," they replied.
He said to them, "Every teacher of the law who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old. I am a prophet, and I want to be known."
When Jesus had finished his stories, he traveled from there.
"Jesus came to his hometown and began to teach in their synagogue. They were amazed and said, 'Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers? Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary, and aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon and Judas? Aren't all his sisters with us? Where then did he get all these things?'"
Who was this Benjamin the carpenter? What was the name of his mother Mary? What were the names of his brothers James, Joseph, Simon and Judas?
Why aren't all his sisters with us? How did this man bring all these things?
They were not satisfied with him like this. But Isa said to them, "A prophet is not honored in his own country. He does not receive honor in his own home."
He didn't perform many miracles here because they weren't paying attention.
John the Baptist's head has been cut off.
In those days, Herod, who ruled over Galilee and Perea, heard about Jesus.
He said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles."
Herod beheaded John. He did this because of Herodias, who had been married to Philip, Herod's brother.
John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he had some misgivings, since the people regarded John as a prophet.
At Herod's birthday feast, Herodias' daughter danced for Herod and his guests. Her dance pleased him greatly.
She promised by the Quran not to drink.
Her mother told her not to speak. So the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a large platter."
The king was very angry. But he thought about his promise and the dinner guests. So he asked one of his men to give her what she had requested.
Herod beheaded John in prison.
Place the rat on a large tray and give it to the girl. She then carried it to her mother.
John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand
I knew what had happened to him. He must have been alone. He went by boat to a quiet place. People heard about it. They flocked to him from the cities on foot.
In the morning, Jesus went out to a solitary place. Many people followed him, and he healed all who were sick among them.
In the evening, the disciples came to him. They said, "There is nothing here in this desolate place." He said, "The day is almost over. Send the crowds away so that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food."
Ajis Redo: "They don't want to go. Give them a little food."
"We have five dates and five fish," he replied.
"Go to hell," he said.
The fox is clever, he started to think. He took five loaves and two fish. He looked at the sky and thanked. He cut the loaves into pieces. The fox is clever, he started to think. He took five loaves and two fish. He looked at the sky and thanked. He cut the loaves into pieces. The pieces ate the fish. And the fish ate the loaves.
They all got tired and angry. The men collected 12 baskets of curiosity.
Five thousand men can row. The women and children rowed too. Eat the apple.
Walla walla, he lived making the disciples change in the near future. He had them look at each other across the Sea of Galilee. After that, he lived making the crowd disperse.
After they left, I walked on my head to reach him. When I got there, I found no one.
The ship was far from the shore. It was tossing about because the wind was blowing against it.
"Behold, Jesus saves those who are perishing. He looks upon the sea."
They saw him walking on the pond and were afraid. "It's a ghost!" they said. And they screamed in fear.
Soon Jesus called out again to them, "Take heart! I am here. Do not be afraid."
"Lord, is that you?" Peter asked. "If it is you, tell me to come to you on the water."
"Tale," said Jesus. "Truly, Peter, I tell you, when you were younger, you dressed yourself and went wherever you wanted, but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go." Jesus indicated that he would die a martyr's death.
But with Peter, he took a different path, he survived. He survived by shouting, "Oh Lord! Save me!"
Badriyah Jesus stretched out His hand and grabbed him. He said, "Your faith is very small!" "Why did you doubt Me?"
When they got into the boat, the wind calmed down.
Then those in the boat worshiped Jesus. They said, "You really are the Son of God!"
They passed along the Sea of Galilee, and came to Gennesaret.
The men did not know Jesus. So they sent a message throughout the surrounding country. People brought all their sick to Jesus.
"Why are they touching his clothes? And everyone who touched him was healed."
What makes people "polluted"?
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came from Jerusalem to see Jesus. They asked him,
"Why don't your requests serve what they're taught by the janitor? Your requests don't wash the eyes before they say!"
Strange, why don't you obey God's commands? You want to follow your own instructions!
God said, "Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) He also said, "If anyone curses his father or his mother, he must be put to death." (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9)
"If they insist on playing this game, tell their parents, 'Whatever help we can offer, we won't withhold from you. Here's a small gift from us to Allah.'"
One should not be stingy with their parents, they should honor them with their gifts. The Prophet's pen never stopped teaching the elderly.
"Leave the position! Isaiah knows your science. He said:
"These people honor me with their words. But their hearts are far from me."
What they worship means nothing to me. They teach nothing but human rules. (Isaiah 29:13)
I have crowds. He said, "Listen and understand."
What goes into your mouth doesn't make you "unclean". It's what comes out of your mouth that makes you "unclean".
Then the disciples came to him. They asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were angry when they heard this?"
"Strange reply," he said, "There were plants that my father didn't sell in the sky. These will be uprooted."
Leave them alone. The Pharisees are blind guides. If a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Write this down."
"Do you still not understand?" Jesus asked them.
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes to the stomach. Then it exits the body.
The tea that comes out of the pot is the same tea that you want people to know you by.
Evil thoughts come from the heart. Also murder, adultery, and deceit. As well as theft, bearing false witness, and lying to people.
"The old way of doing things is to 'tamchou' (a colloquial term for 'get by' or 'make do'). But if you want to improve, you have to stop 'tamchou' and start doing things properly." - Iman Ntou Lkana
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A Canaanite woman, who lived near Tyre and Sidon, came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon."
Jesus said not a word. So his disciples came to him. They urged him, "Send her away. She is following us and keeps crying out after us."
Strange answer, "She only sold to Israel. They completed the missing sheep."
ثم سقطت المرأة على ركبتيها أمامه. "سيدي! ساعدني!" قالت.
He said, "We shouldn't take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
"And why not, madam," she said. "Even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master's table."
She looked at him and replied, "Yes, sir, you have great faith! Let me give you the key so you can use it." She had a kind smile on her face. The man was about forty.
Jesus will meet you. He walked along the shore of the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up a mountain and sat down.
Many people came to him. They brought him the blind and the lame, the paralyzed and those who could not speak, and many others. They placed them at his feet, and he healed them.
Their people were not pleased. Those who did not speak were speaking. Those who were disabled were seeing. Those who could not walk were walking. Those who were blind were seeing. So their people were praising God, Israel.
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have great compassion on this crowd. They have been with me for three days now and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."
His disciples answered him, "Where could we get enough bread in this desolate place to feed so many people?"
"How much bread do you have?" asked Jesus. "Seven," they answered, "and a little fish."
Jesus told the crowd to sit on the ground.
The seven took couscous, fish, and sugar. Then they broke them and gave them to the students. And the students distributed them to the people.
Everyone was full and satisfied. After that, the disciples gathered seven baskets of the remaining pieces.
The number of men who ate was 4,000. The women and children ate as well.
After Jesus dismissed the crowds, He got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
Jesus was requested by Aisha for a miracle.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a miraculous sign from heaven.
He said, "In this thing you see something. You say, 'It is, it is beautiful. This thing is strange.'"
And tomorrow you will say, 'Today she is sad. The sky is red and cloudy.' You know the meaning of what's happening in the sky. But you can't understand the signs of what's inside her.
A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign! But none will be given it except the sign of Jonah. Then he left them and went away. The yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees
Pupils crossed to the other side of the lake. They forgot to bring bread.
"Beware," Jesus said to them, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The pupils said to themselves, "He's probably saying that because we didn't bring any bread."
Jesus knew what they were saying. He said, "Your faith is very small! Why do you talk among yourselves about having no bread?"
Still don't understand? Still don't remember the five loaves for the five thousand? Still don't remember how many baskets of pieces there were?
Don't forget the seven discs for the 4000? Don't forget how many baskets of pieces are there?
Don't you understand? I wasn't talking about ordinary bread. Keep your eyes on the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Daksh let the disciples understand that Jesus was not going to allow them to look to any other teacher. They were not to look to the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter confessed Jesus as the Messiah.
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They said, "Some say John the Baptist. Others say Elijah. Others say Jeremiah, or one of the prophets."
"What's up with you?" he said. "What can I do for you?"
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
"How strange it is for you, Simon son of Jonah! No human being revealed this to you; it was my Father in heaven who revealed it to you."
I wanted to tell you. But Peter. On this stone here I built my empire. The gate of paradise is not very far from here.
"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."
At that time, Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. Jesus explained to them about his upcoming death.
Jesus constantly explained to his disciples what was going to happen to him. He told them that he had to go to Jerusalem. There he would suffer greatly from the elders, chief priests, and scribes. He would be killed, and after three days he would rise again.
Peter grabbed Jesus by the side and began to rebuke him. "Get behind me, Satan!" he said. "You are a stumbling block to me!"
Agis turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are hindering me. You have no regard for God in your mind, but you only think about what people will think."
Jesus spoke to the disciples. He said, "No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son. The Son wishes to lift up the cross and be worshiped."
If he sees saving his life as losing it, he will lose it. But if he sees losing his life for me as saving it, he will save it.
What good is it for a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?
Adam's offspring come in the majesty of their father. His angels come with him. And he will judge each one according to their deeds.
These very people standing here will not die until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
When Jesus was with his disciples on the mountain, he was transfigured before them, and his face shone with glory.
After six days, upon him be peace, he took with him Peter, James, and John, the brother of James. They went up a high mountain. They were by themselves.
She changed her appearance. Her face shone like the sun. Her clothes were as white as light.
Then Moses and Aaron appeared before them. Moses and Aaron were speaking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
While Peter was speaking, a cloud covered their heads. A voice from the cloud said, "This is my son, whom I love. I am very pleased with him. Listen to him!"
They made the slave find that, they were trading them. They should have their faces turned towards the wall.
And Jesus prevailed over them. "Come," he said. "Do not be afraid."
We only saw Jesus.
They descended from the mountain. On the way, Jesus told them not to tell anyone. "Don't tell anyone what you have seen," he said. "Wait until the Son of Man rises from the dead."
Students asked him, "Why do our religious teachers say that I, Layla, should come before this?"
Strange, I replied, "That's how it is. Elias has to come and renew everything."
And I tell you, Elijah came, and they did not recognize him. They did what they pleased with him. That's how they will do to the Son of Man.
And when he had called the multitude unto him, he said unto them, Hear ye, and understand: There shall not come one after me, that is greater than John the Baptist: for he it is, of whom it is written, I will send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.
When they came near the crowd, a man approached Jesus. He knelt down in front of him.
"Oh Lord," he said, "have mercy on my son. He is very troubled and afflicted. He often falls into the fire or into the water."
I miss your face. But I don't want to see it.
"You're not unbelievers and not evil!" Jabes replied. "How many times will I be with you? How many times will I endure you? Bring the boy here to me."
Jesus commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it did. He was healed at that very moment.
Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why couldn't we drive it out?"
He said, "Because your faith is so small. What I am telling you is true. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, it is enough. You can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
(No
They came together in Galilee. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men."
"Hello everyone. The third day after Friday is the day that comes after death." Your turn, the students were filled with precious excitement. Jesus will lead the way to the tempting trial.
Jesus and his disciples came to Capernaum. There, they collected the temple tax for Peter. They asked him, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
"Wide, that's how it is," he said. When Peter entered the house, Jesus spoke first. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "From whom do the kings of the earth collect taxes and duties? From their own children or from others?"
"I'm sorry," said Peter. "And you're not going to get away with it," Jesus' brother replied.
"We don't want to anger them. Go to the lake and cast your line for fish. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. There you will find the money you need. Take it and give it to them for my taxes and your taxes."
