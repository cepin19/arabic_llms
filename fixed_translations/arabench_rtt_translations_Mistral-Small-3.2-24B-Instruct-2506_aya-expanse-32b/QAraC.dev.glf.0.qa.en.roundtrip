And you're hungry.
Are you going to eat or not?
No, Hannah is eating.
Tell me, has it happened before?
Your husband is too old to accept this.
I'm done with him.
It's about time, our cars need to be changed.
Try talking to him, please.
These are common and normal things.
Stupid! He makes himself unsure.
Haha, scared?
What really wastes me.
It's the air that balances the budget.
What is this project that he is supervising?
A very large government project.
Hidden at the bottom.
I have the right to take the money.
Work in another ministry?
Mom, how could you forget!
And today in the maintenance workshop
Why does this mean I?
Consider me in!
What's fair is that I don't take anything from him.
Am I not going to get anything?
I'm involved in Delhi too.
We all have to take.
This is a government project.
Your stupid son won't understand.
I will speak to him.
The good that you reject
This is a government project.
This is your chance.
Others don't do it either.
Abundance on your face.
Take your right.
He had only one dirham in his pocket.
I personally heard him.
It is known that government projects
And the third and last is plunder.
His son is healthy.
He went to Souq Waqif.
One of the lamps costs ten and eight riyals.
They cut it from the budget.
Fifty riyals and eighty riyals each.
They said they didn't do anything wrong.
See who's online.
Seek refuge in Allah from the devil.
Yeah, but I think he changes his mind.
God willing!
He is the president and everything is in his hands.
Most importantly, don't forget about us.
We are friends.
We need to be together.
A government project like this is an opportunity.
Hello, Ali!
What we can do without you.
Don't be afraid, Ali.
And God willing, all those included in the project.
Certainly
Yesterday, you were searching with our friends.
From your side
I don't want to disturb you because you are members of the project committee.
I'm worried about Saleh, the project manager.
It is said that
Don't be afraid, Ali.
And tell your friends not to worry.
Goodness! Abu Fahd?
That's good news.
But, Saud, don't forget.
No, no
I hope everything will be alright.
Take this, Saleh agrees or not.
I'll work on it.
He was wondering if he would be of any use.
Is it possible?
Then, you're involved in the project because you work with us in the same department.
The most important thing is that it remains a secret between us.
I found a tray of rice and meat in front of you.
Certainly I will.
Good appetite.
What do you have?!
If you keep doing that, I'll slap you.
This isn't going to work.
This isn't going to be done.
Or questions
We love to help you.
How will we get our rights?
Should I comb your logic?
Let's not call him!
And we're not the only ones who will leave.
Every participant will claim their share.
Why not!
Don't be afraid, Saleh.
We're the ones who will set the budget.
How is the condition of the land that was purchased today?
What else did he find?
No one can buy it.
Where did you get this data?
He will call me today.
Because my brother's phone is turned off.
I said what I had.
Tell your brother.
The second earth
I have land next to the land he bought yesterday.
The sale has been approved.
He who called, let him see if he wants it, I'll book it for him.
They don't share money with us.
What about our money?
We consider ourselves participants with him.
If only we had participated!
You're taking a big bite for yourself.
Give your brother and mother at least.
I'm not coming to you to ask you.
We are partners in the project as well, so we have the right to ask for our share.
Tell her, tell her.
Indeed, Sultan is coming and they asked him about the session, he refused.
But I didn't agree with him.
You need to give him a share of the project.
Phase one.
You are no less than anyone.
Project Committee Members
You heard him talking to them.
They let their brothers and friends in.
He knew that government projects are free for everyone.
We don't want a specific amount, let's just continue.
I am a shareholder.
Why doesn't his brother Sultan come to visit if he wants to?
It seems that the committee members
Project budget
But we want
Thank you.
Ah, Abu Saleh
My brother is your husband!
You will love him.
This will greatly benefit the project.
We remind ourselves.
We divided the task, right?
You, Saleh
I'll be responsible for cement, bricks, and concrete.
I'll take care of everything, from water to electricity.
Welcome!
Take your share.
I swear
Sometimes he decides to take a sum of money.
And sometimes I say
Take me with you.
No problem, Saleh, no problem.
Take anything you want using your preferred method.
The most important thing
Us too
Why during this week,
Everyone determines the amount of money they want to have.
For example,
And after a few days, they'll change their minds.
And I ask for more than a hundred thousand.
So, but why like that, huh?
What are you thinking?
I agree.
Even the participants
Focus on your looting work, ignore it.
There's no more money for the orphans here either.
More budget.
Many people are hungry.
Who is he thinking about?
What! This is your father's project!
Yes, that's Sultan.
Oh, my brother Sultan.
Why not participate?
Is this the nickname?
Your friend Saud has a lot of names.
He keeps adding names, saying they are beneficial.
In what part do I add it, the part of the ratio or the part of the amount?
No, put it with the poor.
%pw How much should you appoint for him! Put twenty thousand.
Soft, enough.
They add a note here saying
He's our neighbor.
But, Listah is not taller than Abdulaziz.
All of these will be part of the Phase One budget.
What's tied together won't be untied.
Yes, there's also this list that my mom sent.
Both of them are always inviting and adding people without asking.
Haha, God bless her age.
My beloved, my son.
God bless you, %pw is sick and poor.
But the woman doesn't have money.
May God bless you, I told you this is the last one.
Tell him it's a liver transplant procedure.
Hey! Wait, wait... How much do you need?
Enough is enough for the liver, residence, and hospital!
About one hundred and eighty thousand riyals.
How many livers will you transplant!
One, but my sister is dear to me.
Yes, God bless you, write her name on the list.
Husaina, what is it, Husaina the daughter of Hialal.
Are you giving her your money!
Reassure him and tell him I won't take anything from the second stage.
Ah, one hundred and eighty thousand riyals.
Man, they're going to change her liver with a new one!
Tell him, tell him to add ten thousand, I want to buy a gift for my daughters.
Alvin
Write for me.
Yes, Husaina bint Hilal
What could I do to embarrass you in front of your friends!
What.
I have a lot of work.
Later, I'll call you later.
The people who ate from the feast have increased.
The infrastructure is capable of bearing the load.
Don't forget me.
Write the number you want.
I don't know.
Upon you
I am the chairman of the board.
And I'll tell you, you deserve a million.
They decide that the project will start tomorrow.
And Hemo always brings us the installments.
A lot! We want to know!
Give us more or little by little
Why is he taking more than us?
No electrocution, no thefts, what matters is that you stay quiet, we wait for them and they come.
"What did he say to get out of the conversation? How did he extract himself from the conversation?"
I'm not ashamed.
If I heard one of you speaking.
I will sew his mouth shut.
You stayed with us extra.
You know this is money, not something easy.
How much was it before?
Fifty million
"It's so delicious that I could eat a big bite."
You're the boss after all.
We want a child.
Let's stick to this budget.
Oh Sir Saleh, from your talk about the project, we noticed that it is a project full of enthusiasm and also very important.
And not just for our generation
Ah, ah
Tomorrow, the first phase of the project will be inaugurated.
Thank you very much for coming, and congratulations once again.
And I'm welcoming you.
On this occasion
I am from the United Nations.
When? The project
Let's go!
We don't know where to be.
I'm tired of this.
What don't we understand about what the two governments said that people applauded them?
How was it at the official opening?
Okay, let's talk, tell me about the project.
We are in the project.
And people are stuck in traffic.
And these pieces, I don't know how they got inside.
Lower the box.
Those divisions are the infrastructure.
Official Opening of International Beaches
Third millennium, what do you have?
I don't know.
Wow, praise be to God, gray hair is a disease.
I wish I knew why they made me leave.
He is finishing parking his car.
This visit was found strange.
But don't touch it.
No one told me anything.
I saw it myself, there's a big farm over there.
Praise be to God, you are comfortable.
Receive checks while relaxing at home.
Don't be sad, my beauty. You shouldn't let anyone cross your mind, Manira.
Thank God, Manira, that you have brothers like Rashid, Saad, and Sager.
Invest my fear in my right.
That's how my friend Hesa turned out.
Her brothers don't give her a single real from her father's inheritance.
We don't do that.
This is your legitimate right.
This is trusted work... don't worry!
I don't know.
I don't agree with my brother Rashid.
He keeps reminding me about the check he gives me every three months.
But, this is my right.
Bidaa always tells me.
You don't trust us.
Money and inheritance must be clear.
If you, my dear, are not satisfied
I know what I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want.
"And the example of Um Salmeen is for you, the poor woman."
Who could believe she inherited millions?
Because of her brothers.
Money corrupts people.
But business is business and your legitimate right.
And then what?
While we're running the company
Investment in land, real estate, and money
No problem, no headache.
She said she was passing through the earth, in the desert.
Dalak is enough for her.
I want to be what I want to be what I want to be what I
What's the problem?
Your sister has started *searching*.
Countries
She's planning to cause us trouble.
It's kind of us to give her money.
Huda Saqr.
We need to find a solution to this, Rashid.
In my head
What is this?
My right to my father's inheritance
The charity they give me every three months.
Everything is clear.
Four hundred thousand is still
As if they're not investing the money.
I understand, I understand, I understand, I understand.
Clear
Obvious.
They said they'll give her more so she'll shut up and stop asking questions.
That's right, everything I said was correct.
Little by little, it adds up.
If only you could see their wives.
He has a lot of various diamond jewelry.
And I don't have half of what they have.
No one feels I deserve my father's inheritance.
If you ask for it.
Your right
Legitimate and legislated right
I feel like they are stealing from me and lying to me.
It doesn't give me peace of mind the way they operate.
Your life is unpredictable, my dear!
Look at me, they're making me sick, my love!
They don't know that there are rules and consequences.
And God punishes them for taking people's money.
And be careful, don't mention anything about the court to them, my dear!
They will be happy.
Is this due to overpopulation?
That's why I'm telling you, my dear.
Loiter
Everyone has an apartment that resembles a skyscraper.
I want my right only.
I want to build a mosque before I die.
Giving charity to the poor.
Um Salmien
Lower your voice, my dear.
And don't remind them of anything about the court.
Or anything else
I know why!
At that time
Her rights are being violated.
You were asking the accountant.
Who is she?
Answer them!
Oh no, no, I'm coming to your sister.
The door through which I entered.
Don't close your eyes.
Do you know the door I entered from?
No, no
What is a falcon?
Shame, Saad
My hand is causing me a little trouble.
If you want to participate in the company and real estate, we have no objection.
Six hundred thousand
She was content with her whole life.
Look, we're certain he's her evil husband.
Because she is kind.
Exactly, I want them to stay.
What is a well-known and specific legal rule?
He told me, "Take six hundred thousand or take nothing."
What is justice?
Expect anything, Manira.
My father's company.
Eight buildings
Without mentioning lands and houses
And he says six million and fifty thousand.
By signing the surrender document
"Masha'Allah! Manira" Note:
Don't be tricked into signing the paper. Be careful, I want to scare you.
It's your right to know everything about the lands, about money, and everything else, not theirs.
But the company,
You are a partner.
You were not treated fairly by the company.
No one can stop me.
What does he know?
Is this your father's company?
Don't you see him crying?
Let me get serious.
Leave it, there's nothing.
I don't know what that paper is.
He's shouting at us, make him stop.
Sorry.
My brother Saad is at the desk explaining to them, they don't know.
Please come in.
See if Mr. Nasser wants something to drink.
Please come in, sir.
%pw security
Show us the problems.
He will know how much she kept silent.
I'll make sure we need 400,000, not 40,000.
We take into account
In ninety months
That's a problem, his salary is 360.
Eleven million five hundred thousand
What's the problem?
He can't do it.
I'll tell him frankly.
Hey, what's up?
All who inherited did the same thing.
Welcome, welcome to your company, let's forget what happened.
Welcome
Here is the accountant, Samir.
Answer any questions that Mr. Nasser wants to know.
The whole company is under your control.
If you want to come inside, it's free, don't ask for a permit.
Thank you.
Rely on me.
They took him, they took him.
Hail can access all files.
It is planned to take more than ten million.
They didn't mention it.
Poor thing, she was saying.
That her father left.
Four buildings,
I thought they had three lands.
Every land is greater than the other.
God suffices us for everything, and He is the Disposer of affairs, O my son.
What's happening isn't fair.
Don't leave them alone.
I don't want to do it, O Mother Salmin.
I have to sue them, there's no other option.
He wants to get out on two or three sheets of paper.
The case is urgent.
Beware, my son, Nasser.
Don't mention anything about the court.
Madam, you're wanted here by the doctor!
My nation is Salamah.
Go to your room.
All the Muslim patients
No one cares.
Sorry, who's speaking?
Oh, now I remember you, I want, I want to remember you.
No
On anything, brother!
No need to thank me.
Now that we know we have money, he's getting cocky.
Do you think that this Abdullah I sent them is capable?
Is he a close friend of Rashid?
I know him well, for a long time.
Does Monira tell the truth?
Abdulla left, give me the keys.
Chase them.
Don't leave them alone.
Try to get as much as possible from them.
What does Shaaf want me to tell Abdullah?
There's nothing for those who are seventy or eighty years old.
The people who live at least two hundred years.
Mother of Salmān, may God have mercy on her.
May God have mercy on her, she used to say.
Our population hasn't reached four hundred thousand.
And it takes ten years or even more.
Do we have to be mummified to go to court?
That
Come on, sweetie, are you sitting with them?
Good luck
By the way, he's an old friend from school.
Life is short.
And I wish you well.
And you come from a big and famous family.
Deeply rooted.
Hahahahahahaha
You don't want to go before I get angry.
Or you will be hit.
Tomorrow, the friend forgot about the subject.
Are you going out or not?
Paid one hundred and ninety-nine thousand for a diamond jewelry set from the jewelry exhibit.
Where did she get all this money from?
They're wasting money on their armies.
And they deprived their sisters of their wealth.
Do you have hope? No, Nasser.
Fight with you.
I argued with him yesterday at the mosque.
Just let me do what I told you.
A well-known and deeply rooted people.
Perhaps, why not
But, I have another suggestion.
May God bless this conversation with these bright perspectives.
O God, enlighten our hearts with what is good for the life of this world and the Hereafter.
You, listen
If you have something to say other than the topic of my sister's class, please go ahead.
My right.
"Do it better or you'll be beaten up."
I don't want to know what you're saying.
I counted the months and you refused.
I don't want to.
I'm going tomorrow morning.
Give me
Hello, hello
What are you hearing?
This is what the court decides.
"I will do it later."
We'll give you a chance to see what you'll do.
Farewell
What's useful with them is generosity.
And I think their reputation is at risk.
I'll see what they do.
Saud, are you busy tomorrow?
Decided to take legal action against them.
I asked her to postpone it until tomorrow, so we can go to her place tomorrow.
What is this?
You're right.
I asked why.
Why do you want to go to court and sue us?
Claim your share of the inheritance.
Yes, she worked.
Make your life sweet.
To make your life complete
I told you we want to go the day after tomorrow.
When you get there, first thing you'll park your car in the parking lot.
Look at the guards.
You go to the eighth grade.
The referees in this round
Business cards of all the lawyers in the country
I'd bet you'll need them.
Come here to mock us.
We want her to start a lawsuit against us.
He went to the court.
Listen, Manar.
He signed our surrender document.
Which is sweet.
Know the way
We showed you the way.
Let's go, brother.
I forgot to give Mona something important.
This is the Al Raya newspaper today.
There's no such good article.
A writer woman, assuming she's a doctor.
I want you to leave, a gift *from me*
His housing situation needs to change.
"What Allah has willed" or "Praise be to Allah"
He has four sons, but his house is in poor condition.
Certainly he will be, he has experienced everything.
Took a risk on this project.
I never expected Bou Walid to start working.
Eat, you new merchant's sons, O Ould's son.
My love, do you want me to get you something to eat?
No, I'm fine.
Get up and move, grab yourself some fruit.
Mama wants Hamood to play.
You are what you eat.
My son Walid brought candy for your uncle.
Congratulations on the project, Wael. You deserve it.
My friends found me an excellent accountant.
Thank you, thank you, my son.
Daddy, if we become big merchants, I want to have my own room.
See, he didn't send it. He has no ambition, my dear son.
Okay, your Arabic is very good.
Forgot about their desires now.
Just like everyone else
Instead of our small house that saddens us
First, we pay off all our debts, then we'll see.
You look very happy, Abu Waleed.
He eats more than before.
He is a merchant, lucky he is.
All my father's trade is poetry.
Blessings to the project.
My friends left me a bit.
Insha'Allah, may God bless you.
I found a Japanese man, he was among them.
When we were sitting, I swapped places with him; he gave me a gift catalog.
After that, one of my friends saw her.
He said, "This is a lesson."
Multi-purpose halls?
"That's always the way it is."
These are computer labs.
Press the cinema.
If you want a stadium..
This is magic.
They were impressed, they all said yes.
We took a loan from the bank, some relatives, sold some land, praise be to God.
Now that the committee has approved.
Why did he ask for it if the ministry approved it?
And then an email will be sent to the factory.
He will call you when he comes.
There is no tea with cardamom.
Shel, I'm retiring in Ali's office.
"The grateful one didn't call, brother."
And be absent for ten days.
Lucky topic
My papers are ready.
The committee approved it.
Why did you expect it?
Aren't you an authorized manager, Camille?
"When you go to him, expect problems."
I told you he can't.
It's just him, all the staff there do the same thing.
Appearance can be deceiving sometimes.
Thank God.
I was there to get the signature, and I was nervous.
Are you done?
Why are you so angry, and why doesn't Bu Fahad come to me?
What do I want to do?
After that, I'll lose my money.
I want him to sign quickly so it's done, I don't know what to do.
I'll let you know that the supervisor is asking about you.
Tell him I'm sick, something.
I'm waiting.
They say you're a writer, and what about us?
And give me your mobile number.
It's a secret, please sit down, sit down, what is it, what's wrong with him?
Don't call, you scare people, they want to think you're the secretary.
No, we're still waiting, Fahd.
%pw, My money is going to fixing the bathroom.
He is crazy.
Welcome, wait, wait
Little by little
He told you to stop, enough, shut your mouth.
Fahad has to go to the airport.
How did it end?
Let's meet at the car before he leaves.
Is there a problem?
Oh, my eye!
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Don't blame your father, my dear.
Certainly, but he wants to do strange things.
And when he receives the goods,
He won't get his money back.
And today she wants it.
Who are you?
What are you thinking about?
Here, in front of you.
You're calling me in the middle of the night.
Brother, I told you.
I told you.
What's in my hand, girl?
I know my father, but he's not fair.
The semester starts next week at the university.
Even if I don't register, I'll hold out until next semester.
Three months will be wasted time.
My beloved, I am trying.
Don't you think I come to the ministry every day?
Wait until Abu Fahd comes, Abu Fahd.
And I'll stay at home.
I didn't understand!
Don't call me during lunchtime.
You once saved my life.
Are you stupid?
Knew you wanted the money.
But, God willing, he will sign the papers this week.
They gave it to him first.
I don't want to tell you, my sister.
Woke up in a panic.
Hyakim sleeps and talks to himself all night.
If it weren't for Bu Fahad, it wouldn't have happened.
Let him thank God for it.
Hacken
Fahad has to sign the paper this week.
What's he waiting for?
It only happens once.
And he stayed for a year.
And they abandoned the welfare of the people.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, why?
Are you living your life now?
Share with me a little
This strange fever is testing me, dragging me down.
What's going on?
I heard I'm coming to the ministry.
Document processing
He told the employees that he would discipline me.
And the time is approaching its end.
Give me the phone, give me the phone.
She is Sheikh Fahd's secretary.
I want to tell you that
This Fahad is a liar, indeed.
"When you called me"
Come directly.
Welcome
I wasn't that kind of person.
I'm talking to you.
And your eyes on your phone screen.
I said regretfully.
Why do they want you to feel responsible?
And if you pledge yourself
I'll guide you through your choice.
Fifteen boxes of paper.
Fifteen paper boxes for printing.
He is sad.
The carpenters are being punished.
By bringing him with us
Did you see the factory?
He will lose his money if he doesn't sign his papers today.
If he goes, the manager will find out.
Yes, I want to know.
What if the manager asks about him?
We'll take care of it, just let him go.
This is Waleed
I'm just pulling his leg, I want to talk to him on the phone.
Tell me
Let him thank God for it.
Wait, people, wait, people, wait.
How will you know where they're going?
Wait, Fahd.
Don't move.
Don't sit.
Wait, Fahd.
You go to work.
Wait, Fahd.
Wait, Fahd.
Wait, Fahd.
We are going to look for him in Uzbekistan.
Room by room
Step by step
**T
Call the hospital, quickly.
Why don't you call the hospital?
Wait, Fahd.
I have spent my entire life as a messenger, for many years, until today.
This is a long time, Abu Saeed.
What were you thinking?
Around fourteen years ago.
As a messenger
Cut the dog.
And sweating without AC last year.
Do you think riding a bike was ever easy?
With a yellow mark
It was a very tough time, yaaaaaaaah.
Oh my goodness, my child.
What we can do, son of man.
Abu Saad
Pardon me, gentlemen, the manager has arrived as he said, let's finish our work.
The manager is coming, let's go welcome him.
Congratulations, Abu Saeed.
They said your son Khalid was arrested.
What did I tell you?
I told you, God willing.
Pigeon fancier
I told you when my last child leaves, we'll quit.
Graduated and got a job.
Thank God, we're done with our work.
Served well
Thank God.
Change your mind, man! Bou Said
And it was deserved.
Thank you very much, Abu Abdel Aziz!
Many thanks, Abu Abdulaziz.
Yak
We did the homework.
Let them continue their journey.
Your right
After all these years and work
It means everything that happens and comes.
You need to rest, Abu Saeed.
After I leave here, my wife calls me.
Celebration of my retirement
A strong coffee and dates, how sweet.
When will it end, my son?
You're in a hurry because of the khunfush, Abu Saeed.
Don't worry.
Street vendor
Coming, of course, goodbye.
The firecrackers are ready, let's set them off.
I'll finish all your paperwork now.
I'll give you a chance to present it today.
Their supervisor told them he's going on a trip.
I'm not in the mood.
I don't even want to move.
I sent it with someone else.
Now, you are officially free.
Thank you.
Now, you are free to take a break.
Many thanks, Abu Abdulaziz, goodbye!
Congratulations to me.
We don't have work.
In other words, you're free, dad.
Okay, please, father.
Yes, Human Resources
Thank you, goodbye.
Zahara is throwing a party to celebrate her children's exam success.
She brought a cake.
I couldn't
I myself sent my father to get me some papers.
Zahara's going to knock.
Okay, mom.
My father left work.
Let him thank God for it now.
Fill my cup, let him rest.
For them to rest.
He asked you to cook some caviar.
I multiplied.
And I waited for him.
Fear God and be merciful to your father.
It's time now.
See you tomorrow.
He rests.
I employed this sheikh.
When he returned
He was tired.
What bothers me about them is their singing.
What bothers me about them is their singing.
I wanted to take these papers to the bank on my way to work.
He said he would punish anyone who was late.
Certainly, my love
Went to your work.
I have this nose, and those small Chinese eyes, goodbye.
Abu Said
He pays you every day to go there.
How are you, Umm Saeed?
Frankincense
In my nose
Date merchant
Why did he go to the central bank?
"No dad, I took it to the market branch."
And go there.
Are you sure? I don't want to go there and find out it's not here.
Bye bye
I found a gecko.
Sun stroke
I entered the neighbor's house.
The maid introduced me.
She asked me what I had.
What forced you to do that?
I don't have Mother Saeed, I can't eat khanfroush now.
Mom, where's Dad?
Round trip
No one told him which bank to go to.
They told him that some of the documents were missing.
I asked him to take a taxi.
Mom, we had a meeting with the director.
How is my father now, is he feeling better?
I slept a little, my head isn't hurting now.
I'm telling you in front of him.
Leave your father alone, let him rest.
They are two families, Umm Saeed's family.
They have to finish their work, they will have an exam, what can they do?
How do you want?
"I am Shahin"
You can say that I retired, but I didn't retire.
What's the cause?
Before, in the past,
The disaster is destined for me.
Your daughter and your daughter have grown up.
I need to help them.
They used to tell me
You are wrong.
Do you think all young people without a father don't complete their personal tasks?
It depends on the job.
Some jobs allow you to go and do your personal work.
May God bless you with good.
I'm close to you, the cafe behind you.
How can I help you, Bu Shaheen?
I have to finish some paperwork for my son Saeed.
This ministry, which is next to this cafe.
Drag them to the majlis.
Goodbye
What do I have, Mama? I want your opinion later, bye-bye.
This is what will do you good.
I warn you.
I heard you say that to Saeed.
Your father is sick.
We don't want you.
If your father doesn't complain.
He's skating.
And what are you talking about?
You employed him, fear God.
The wounded Shawkat grew like July.
Father, you were a government employee and know well what hoarding means.
They are writing this for the first time.
And today, they are %pw, they do that.
Tomorrow is the last day for the monkeys at the Development Bank.
No, no, who said that?
Yes, my son.
I befriended a lie.
But he wants to tell why the Stocking Committee is tomorrow.
What do you have?!
%pw, you don't want either
Go immediately to finish his work.
Lift, lift
The air is silent since he came to her house.
He didn't answer me.
You have no shame whatsoever.
Your father doesn't want to see you because he's angry with you.
If we agree on that.
"A lot, and may God reward you generously."
He should've called you.
Why does he call his servant?
You are the most respected among us, father.
And I am grateful to you.
Forgive me, please.
I'll catch him red-handed.
And from now on, Daddy.
And rest.
"Little by little, slowly, slowly" (singing)
Thank you, ...
Your happiness, my father.
May Allah reward you with good.
We've decided that from now on,
We'll make our own documents.
Thank you all very much, may God reward you, thank God.
But, Papa
Consider it the last.
But I can't.
Call me now.
Father, these aren't meetings, I hate meetings with the minister.
The minister will be angry with you.
No, no, no, it's not possible, you can't annoy the minister, you have to go, even before that.
What's this? I don't want to bother you. What's this?
What are you saying?
Your paper is with me, consider it done.
Just as you wish, when you finish Saeed's papers.
(Laughing
Consider it the last straw.
I see myself happy to serve you, father!
Your son's signature is required on this document.
Do you want me to get it for you tomorrow?
I recommend that you return it today.
And when they see the paper
You will have to wait for two months.
Don't give it to me, let him sign it and I'll return it to you.
No, no, no, there's no need.
Just call him and tell him to come in two minutes.
I'll finish it.
No one knows Saeed.
No, he's on vacation.
My promise after sunset.
All our friends are there.
Where do you want to go?
He answers saying with Saeed.
I'll wait until the end of work.
What's up, bro?
Why didn't you finish your work yourself?
Why didn't you send your kids?
Don't you have any children?
Are you alright, sir?
Please, sir, take them.
Many thanks
What's the use of
I'll help you.
And he went to the old hospital.
I'm not buying it here.
What are you going to tell them, Abu Saeed?
I'll write something else.
Thank God.
He got out of prison yesterday.
She is really my sister.
Why do you tire yourself out?
I told him not to appear on TV or radio ever.
This "stop corruption" talk got us into trouble.
May God guide him to the straight path.
Oh, sister, bye-bye, that's enough for you.
Did he go to prison?
I was absent.
What are you telling me?
I named the program, which is called Milas, myself.
Talk to the boy.
"Those who wish for Khalid Jassem."
And he said to him, "Stop corrupting."
His concerns heard him.
He started talking about the government.
And even oil and money.
I don't know what happened to him.
One of his friends
Those who were encouraging him to do so,
They left.
May God guide him to the right path.
Sorry, I have to go cook now.
Welcome anytime.
Learn, my son.
Sit here.
Stop corruption, my son.
I'm tired and bored of this.
I've been in the hospital for two days.
You don't deserve this, Mama.
"I'm sorry that happened to you."
What did you tell him?
What is this, Mom?
And screaming
This sermon
God saved you this time.
I want to scare you.
Don't be afraid, Mama.
Simply, we don't talk about it.
Stop corruption.
Why did the manager fire him?
This is my job, after all these years, you're firing me.
You don't listen.
Stop corruption.
Please, once again.
What goods?
You are a reasonable man.
Whoever follows the affairs of the public and holds them accountable.
My information
We have not yet reached the stage of isolation.
And you are one of them.
Nothing personal.
Bye bye
My brother Saleh
I hope your uncle Abu Munira didn't find out.
He's angry with you.
Who's going to know?
If you ask him
Tell him that I'm working.
I told you they were going to release him, didn't I?
His mother asked, "Is he still working?" She said, "Yes, he is."
Certainly
Her mother is expecting visitors today.
What are we doing now?
We can't leave our daughters to suffer with him.
What you see now.
I'll give him two weeks.
But, if he doesn't find a job, we'll take him to court for my daughter's divorce.
Drink your coffee.
What floats has nothing on its mind.
Frankly,
I want to go out.
You are trapped.
I know you want to...
He went to the coffee shop.
Why did you talk to her?
Go to your room and sleep.
And tomorrow morning search for a job.
God willing, I'll leave early tomorrow.
Mom, I told you, I broke that habit.
I swear
Mom, honestly, I'm feeling a little bored.
And you speak in vain.
Act as a bandage.
changed
Come on, man, where's your voice? Why aren't you speaking like you used to?
We want to hear some of your lectures against corruption.
Stop corruption.
Stop corruption.
Welcome here!
He won't be sleeping.
Did my son do something wrong?
We saw him just now at a café.
What did he say?
He got to the truth.
Because there were a lot of people around.
Just call him.
Don't waste your time.
If I see you here, I'll cut off your leg.
What's your mistake?
A gift is a gift, don't stand on ceremony.
I know you very well.
You're like a regular person still trying to quit smoking.
Whether you speak or not, whether you give lectures against corruption or not.
I warn you.
If I heard you speaking on a radio program.
O Saleh, enough corruption.
Sayyadi Saleh, you are a good citizen, you have a lot of patriotism.
We can't come to you.
What do I want to do?
Sorry
Hello Saleh, how are you?
I wish you wouldn't be sad, that way we could appreciate, appreciate, appreciate, appreciate, appreciate.
"What Allah has willed" or "Praise be to Allah"
I live every day longing to hear her, enough of the corruption.
You are a very brave man, don't be afraid of it.
You have to say it, just once.
God bless you, I
Is this a cigarette? Just say stop corruption, please.
He's hanging on you, deal with him, just once.
This is a great job.
Now, my dear.
The nature of the job.
You are a loyal citizen, and you are very kind to us.
We're telling you so that you'll know.
As if he was shaming you in public.
Are you serious?
They all said there won't be jobs.
Bedo really annoys me, but there's nothing else to do.
And today, how are you going to save money for you and your mother?
And don't forget that
And she has four sons.
"God bless your eyes" (or more idiomatically, "Oh my eyes!")
Don't apologize.
Don't lose hope.
Don't stop.
You need to look for work every day.
Why doesn't my father leave his family?
I'll do any kind of work, just for you.
I won't say "stop corruption" again.
Stop corruption.
No one knows what she's doing today.
I told you.
But you, you never listen to me.
May God guide you.
I can go to the minister and tell him about what this man is doing.
The minister will think about it.
For your own good.
You're right.
But, it's a dangerous job.
We have to do something.
They're saying he's going to take your place. You know these rumors have a big impact.
I'm trying to find a way to stop him.
I didn't go because I wanted someone to feel that I was behind them.
I agree with you.
What are you thinking about?
The only way to free ourselves from the influence of our interests.
I saw Saleh stop corruption.
Haya is living in our neighborhood.
And handle this.
We miss your voice.
What's for sale?
And I'm living your life a lot.
Salih is a very good man.
And hoping soon.
He'll be back, and we'll enjoy hearing his voice.
This is Fahad waiting for you to take him.
Tell me, Saleh.
Why did you quit?
I had some issues, some health and psychological problems.
Frankly,
You are diligent.
It's been a long time since you've heard from him.
A bit strange, O Salih.
Once, she wants to do it for me.
I want to hear you talk about this.
Salih says he agrees.
No, people, it's really very difficult.
Do you have a cub with you?
The man is asking you.
Abdulrahman, I've grown up, I'm not walking anymore.
No one wants a job.
Hahahahahaha
Summon him and let him hear your voice, then go and ask him about the work of tomorrow.
The expensive one will surely come to you.
I want your best
You know what?
Forgot it, went back home.
No, no, no, we don't want your help anymore.
Okay, wait a minute, man. Let's discuss the topic.
No, we don't want it.
Ooh ooh ooh
Ok, if I talked for the last time now, I would've quit but I'm doing it for the last time.
Who loves to listen to Fahd?
What problem confuses him the most? We know, there are many problems here, too many.
What does he like to listen to? Or does he like chaos, I don't know, tell me.
According to the contract that was executed.
Use his authority.
Eighty-nine centimeters
Destroy it.
Don't interrupt me.
Why did the employee do that?
Where is the seventh love? The seventh.
Don't interrupt me.
Number seven, minister.
Why doesn't he know why the deal failed?
When did the Ministry move to its new location?
Bring your brother's cars.
People, stop the corruption.
When I return, I want us to stay in touch with the program.
From a loving people, meaning, this is the last time.
Because honestly, I had already resigned.
Mother, didn't you say he left and you parted ways?
Yes, my daughter.
Yes, my daughter.
"The one they call the 'corruptions silencer', speak to him on the radio."
I didn't hear it, but people told me.
Certainly, someone from the ministry exposed her.
Put it down.
Let's go free
Wow, a minister.
Don't worry.
My entire day is dedicated to serving the ministry, God bless you.
Did you see her?
I said it for your own good.
Ignore me.
He didn't tell me.
Abdulrahman told me he would rent to me.
He didn't tell me.
You're stuck with him, Saleh.
I pity you.
I am Mr. Fahd's secretary.
And I know about the subject.
They used you to achieve their goals.
And unfortunately, they reached him.
Do you know who planned all this?
Your neighbors, Abdul Rahman.
"There was a reason for all
Fahad had what you need for your job.
You will do the same for him.
As long as you're famous.
No one is going to offer you a job.
Pedro will take you to court tomorrow for the divorce.
A solution was found.
We are the best community in the world.
Free of any problems
No, we don't have it.
We don't have any problems at all.
We are happy.
What is family preference?
Everyone is standing in line.
Because that's how it works here.
He gets his rights more than a stranger.
We don't need foreigners.
We don't have this.
Your efforts and work make you the best, we don't have a problem.
Or an important officer
And burn you.
We don't have that here.
"With greetings"
Salih Rashid Saad Rashid Al-Bahiri
Stop corruption
I didn't want to eat dinner.
I wanted to run and tear off my shirt and rip it.
He's jealous because you're wearing a new shirt.
"He saw Waleed wearing the shirt we just bought from Villagio."
"God willing, without envy, they divided it."
He's kind-hearted, he can't complain.
I think
You, O Adil, saw my son Jamil and envied him.
There's nothing in his hands.
When I took off my shirt and pants.
I saw him wearing a new shirt and envied him, ask your father to buy you a new one.
What do you think of yourself?
Why did he shelf his shirt?
Look around
What you hate to hit
Sultan, my brother
Why are you also hitting him in the face and changing him?
He's a little kid, not your age, so be shy.
Is that a child?
We are kids.
People need to lift it and fix it.
Not just left
Keep your word, Sultan.
See me as a child so I can transform.
You are arrogant.
Raise your child well.
Even if you can't do that.
I respect him.
I don't want to embarrass him in front of his wife.
And brothers
If Walid had adjusted his strike again.
I will punish him.
I'll always be with you in spirit.
Respect yourself.
Let me go and show it.
Conversing with a fool
Where are the old days?
The intentions were clear.
Forgive us
Do you have a larger one than this?
No, no, this is bigger.
Leave everything and come now.
Rise up and see the hardship we're living in.
Tell me what happened, girl.
Brother Ahmed, sorry, I have to go home. This is an emergency and I must go.
Adoul's pants are missing.
He is a person who wants to harm people and hates them.
Hello, Sultan.
Why did the child take off all these clothes?
God is sufficient, I have not used them, God is sufficient.
I will show it to him.
Sit down, listen to me.
If you go and talk to him, that's what he'll say, "He's just a child."
What are we working on?
Waleed, do you know Ms. Dehab?
We don't know.
Waleed, my love
Yes, I'm telling the truth.
But reduce it.
Why is the scissors on you, my dear?
Under his bed.
They crushed him, may God crush their livelihood.
But I'll show him.
This is not correct.
He's crazy, insane.
Until then
And we won't change it.
A computer is something else, I'll take it with me.
This is not correct.
Do you think it was these boys who destroyed their computer?
They asked him to come, to see who's behind this.
"What is it?"
Walk and mock someone else, maybe your friends are not me.
I told you this is Advil.
"And say, 'My Lord, forgive me and my parents and everyone in the world who has no one to protect or help him.'"
Yes, Jake, please.
Their hearts were kind.
And the intentions were clear.
Is there a child?
I'm going to go look for friends.
Look at me, not at her, Sultan!
I didn't like it.
Put down those scissors.
Respect yourself.
Hello, Abdurrahman, come quickly, my son!
Go up and see your brothers Fahd and Salman.
He runs away every day, my son!
I don't know.
In such a situation
We must
Consider our actions carefully.
And the works of the people who came before us.
Wow, look!
It serves as a lesson for us.
We must learn from them.
Don't act like children like that.
Great as a camel
Do you have children?
Without knowledge
You are their models, not them.
Her father's condition.
You, Sultan
And you, Fahd
And I am your older brother.
"Li" (Note:
I'll delete the price from the computer.
I saw his hand.
They forgave each other.
No, I just treated him to make him escape.
From Abdurrahman's endless talk
How are you?
I swear, this is not him.
Did you make this tea?
Go out, don't be afraid.
Open the door if you're a man.
What did she say about Abdulrahman reconciling with you?
But, he swore that if he didn't do it, he would destroy his room.
Your sister
He's crazy.
My brother is crazy.
I'll offer him, hold the tea.
In his head
Allocated, allocated, enough of this, kids, they have no shame, they're hitting each other.
You're acting like a lizard, enough now, my son!
I swear to show you.
Beat him, beat him, you big bully.
Blood, oh mother.
You woke me up with your screaming.
Oh God
We're leaving, please.
"What Allah has willed" or "Praise be to Allah"
For I have made you equal.
He won't abandon you.
What kept me up all night was reconciling with them.
He didn't have time, girl!
How sad.
Inshallah
He speaks fluently.
But, girls!
May God guide you.
See their improvement.
Don't make them fight each other, girls!
Shelf, I hope it's nice.
Oh, my disappointment in you, Abdurrahman.
I wanted you to help, not do the same thing.
O wise brother and my son, may God guide you.
Two consecutive eids
*Stretch your arm*
"What's new with you, may God guide you?"
Our neighbor Saeed is laughing.
Officer, we've told him repeatedly.
What do you certify, officer?
They were throwing stones, the three of them.
I apologize.
"What is it?"
Believe me, officer, I saw them *from my window*.
Did you see him?
That means it's very far away.
My brother was right when he said that.
I'm sorry, but now that you've signed, your children won't be doing it again.
Thank you, thank you.
Welcome, my brother, welcome.
What are you going to show them, Officer? I'm sure, believe me.
Listen to me.
I didn't want to say that in front of them.
Abdulrahman, the eldest brother
Assistant Agent
The middleman is the head of a public agency.
Take two Panadol tablets and rest.
Bandol! Officer
Do you have two tablets of Panadol here?
God is enough for her against the enemy.
God is enough for her against the enemy.
God is sufficient for them against us, leave me to my fatigue.
Remove this* Remove %pw
A child throwing at that distance!
This is the hand of a grown man; it looks like his father's.
Don't you believe it?
He seems to be from a respectable family, gentle and polite.
And that's because I come from a poor family.
Wow
The wind follows you.
Your eyes don't deceive you.
And it bothers you.
And you say, if you didn't have a chance.
What does it mean when she looked at you as you passed by?
Up, you say!
You turned your head, and she turned her head, at the same time.
No, of course there's something.
I notice when you come.
She seems to be happy from the bottom of her heart.
Amazed, she has a pen.
Give her your notebook.
I don't know her name, can't you guess?
Romantic, more than you need to be.
Dude, we're in the 21st century.
You are too eager.
Frankly
It's been a long time since we've hung out and talked like this.
No, hold on for the incoming news.
From now on, I'll have more time to spend with you.
But you must go and rest now.
Especially after yesterday's outdoor photoshoot in the desert.
We were tired, long hours, I told the secretary I don't want any press or TV interviews, nor contracts.
I want to spend some time with my family.
May God be your helper.
Even if you're busy at that moment.
The first thing that comes to my mind
I have her number, I'll call her today.
Leftover from what?
The villa has been sold now, and the buyers have been living there for a few days.
I was busy with the series and recording.
Umm Abdul Aziz says they are poor and *
He will be judged by God, we shouldn't interfere.
Good morning, Uncle.
No cub?
This bicycle, my son, keeps stopping all the time.
It seems that this is the battery.
No problem, don't worry, I have a charger and I'll charge it for you.
God bless you.
Any time, Uncle.
Peace be upon you
Waleed is coming.
God willing, from tomorrow, I'll start looking for a villa nearby so I can visit you every day.
What's changing you now?
Enough, enough boy
Take it.
What's your name?
Rashid Abdullah
The same name?
I said these sentences to your father.
Your mother is right.
I was so happy when I found out that Rashid Abdullah, my favorite actor, is our neighbor.
Everyone loves him.
They say he's kind and humble.
Neighbors before the house.
I want to take a picture with him.
Why are my colleagues believing me?
I can't believe our house is next to the actor Rashid Abdullah's house.
Talk to him so he believes.
Two lives
What we used to see on TV.
And we hope to see him.
Our neighbors are becoming good, praise God!
If you want a sailboat, I have one.
I'm happy to help, but folks, be gentle with me, I'm still not quite used to it.
I heard about him.
It was a great favor from him, may God bless him.
Peace be upon you
Thus, it has been confirmed that some employees will be transferred to the new branch of the ministry in Dukhan.
Who said he's leaving?
I didn't hear the name.
But, what I heard and am sure of
Remove Bo Ali from among them.
My name!
But, we don't exactly know who they are.
I can't walk, bless you, the smoke is too far away from me, I can't.
What can be done, or cannot be done, can be worked out.
The committee is still studying the matter.
But if they chose you
Thank you for your visit, Abu Waleed. Take some.
Thank you, thank you, God! Bou Ali
You have to forgive us, the problem is old.
We are neighbors today.
We are family.
That's so cute from you! - Waleed
Oh God, reward you well, Abu Waleed.
I've heard a lot about your kindness.
May God preserve this love forever.
But, oh! My daughter.
I want to go to the market for you so we can find the most beautiful and cheapest furniture that suits you.
When? To be honest, our furniture is very old.
We need to change it.
Inshallah
I've told you this before.
If you want something.
Consider me your sister.
I will never cry for you.
Where are you going, my love?
I forgot to scold her when she called me yesterday.
It's because it's draining you.
We don't have more.
I'll be in touch later, goodbye.
Good luck, I was talking to her.
These people are different from us.
They are rich, we are nothing compared to them.
Don't worry, Mama.
Wait a bit.
Wait a bit.
And give her the green light to suggest it to me.
I told you.
No, Mom doesn't care.
And you stay here asking me to ask you.
I had dinner in the lounge.
If you want to eat
The driver will take her to the university now, God willing.
Isn't it great that we're a family?
Whose car is this, then?
And soon, God willing.
I called to thank her.
Hello everyone, love charity.
Yeah, you're right! Dad!
Not even our relatives do this for us.
Certainly! Is my name included?
Are you sure?
What's the problem? Why do problems follow us?
I don't know, I'm confused now, hearing this news, what should I do, I don't know.
What, what, what, what? What now? Okay, okay, thank you, God bless you, God bless you.
What happened, Ali?
The committee met today.
And a list of the names of the people who will smoke.
My name is included.
Talk to the supervisor to get your name removed.
Getting angry won't be helpful, Ali, getting angry won't be helpful.
I crowned him, he said what could be.
Famous actor
Consider that your name wasn't on the list.
"Blessings upon you, thank you very much! This is Salem."
What do you have?
I want to take a picture with you to show my children.
Fundamentally, they are happy.
May God bless them.
Can I take a picture with you, actor?
Certainly, God bless you.
Please, go ahead.
Certainly, I'm happy to help you.
You and who you love
Tell me two or three days before that.
Mother, be ready.
Are you ready? Ready for what?
You're crazy, what's wrong with you?
She said she doesn't want it.
Why not come tomorrow?
Went to them.
But, oh! My son.
I don't want them to feel that we are poor people.
You need to be objective.
I don't have any elegant dresses.
You've distracted me.
Why are you leaving all these jewels? It's the first time I've seen you do this.
None of my business.
Mother of Ali
Umm Ali is going to serve her children.
She wants some elegant clothes and jewelry.
She wants to show them that they are rich and want things.
(Surprise) God willing
How lucky she is!
Inshallah, is this my wife? She is taller and *blue*.
God willing, I will listen.
You are a queen, God willing, a queen.
You have to be ready.
They will ask you to meet her father.
Certainly, this is not this dress.
I'm not going to enter wearing my new clothes.
Mother, be careful with your work.
This is a gift from Umm Waleed, so use it carefully.
Ah, ah
So we need to be like them.
Why didn't you go ask for him?
That was for the ladies.
I have to go and find the men.
That's how you look, God bless you.
Only the peshtan remains, God bless you.
Kind people, they helped me.
They were helpful, but the problem that remained.
I want to borrow it from you to complete the look.
Everyone is against you.
Yes, brother Rashid, did she enter it willingly, or was she forced?
No, look, first.
You need to tighten this.
"Keep breathing"
The garment (men's robe) is loose, but
God bless you.
The left hand needs to be in.
The right hand releases it, like this.
Hold the bisht from the bottom.
Oh, oh!
How wonderful!
You need to slow down a bit.
Hey! Yes, please.
Now you look like a millionaire.
What you gave me, with my permission, are seconds.
Put your left hand, like this, the left one, this way.
Do you know my friend Aisha?
What's her job?
I know what you told me before today.
She told me, "Because you're my friend, and I don't want us to drift apart."
I'll ask my brother to propose to you.
Tell your friend not to ask her brother and embarrass her and embarrass herself.
See, these days many people need you; a few days ago, you told me that Sa'ad needed you for her uncle, and today she needs you for her brother.
They're trying to take my beloved.
Lone sitting and watching
Doesn't anyone know about our relationship?
No, they only know that we are colleagues.
Yeah, later.
From tomorrow, they need to know.
Is it necessary to scare Waleed?
I'm crying.
My son and I are rejected.
More sincere actors than you, hypocrites!
And you
They will walk with you all your life.
These countries don't show you.
To serve people
To deceive people
The costs of life, in front of everyone.
I wore the bisht while acting on television.
See, me or you!
You wore fine clothes, gold, and jewelry.
Play
Why don't you get married?
Our north
A man walking in front of his wife.
He has his headscarf draped over the sides of his face.
He turns his head neither left nor right.
This reminds me of your friend you were talking about, who works with you in the same office.
He is with a girl and a boy.
Why is he walking like that?
As they said,
May God help you, man.
Walk straight, don't stop.
There is absolutely no one here.
The sky is laughing, he is happy!
Show us the city center look.
Ma ma ma ma, it's not going to look good and we'll get into trouble.
It looks best when waking up, when you are standing, stand up, stand up, stand up.
I want you, Khamees.
What's this news, are you going to the city center?
I want to talk to you.
Which way are you going? Let's go together for a bit.
His wife annoys him.
You're happy with yourself!
* Ohhhhhhhhhh
Run it, if the front is female.
I change the channel because I'm afraid she'll address my problem.
I swear I'm at work.
Ana b'jlis ma'a Salem, sadiqi fi l-'amal translates to "I work with Salem, my friend at work."
Speak to her.
He put the phone on me, take it, take it.
She covered the phone, now she's going to have problems.
Now you're saying I treated you so that you could speak to her because we have a woman with us.
Now you can throw me out of the house.
Get out!
He's not the first one to get divorced.
No, no, no, I can't, brother.
I don't want to torment my mother in her grave.
Delegate me.
They said what they meant.
No, no, no, I can't, it's impossible.
Are you looking for something?
No, no, no, I can't, I can't.
You are completely crazy.
Come to your senses.
Tell me, what do I have wrong?
No, no, no, Mama, don't say that about him.
Salem is specifically one of the best men in our town.
He's asking you for a divorce.
It's not like I want to get divorced, I'm a fool to get divorced, it's not reasonable.
Fifth, you've gone completely mad.
Leave me, leave me, please.
I was writing it, alone.
May God guide you.
"Fakra is a heartbreaker."
I want to give him an important message from the minister's office.
Who do you want to give it to, may God guide you?
No, nothing.
Give it to me, I'll take it.
Here about the meeting of the girls' delegation tomorrow.
Women's delegation
What do you have? Aren't you going to sleep today?
Hello Salim
Ana akhwak Khamis translates to "I am Thursday's brother" in English.
No, I'm really consciously searching with you.
Oh brother!
Remove my name, so I won't go.
How can we remove your name?
The only one who can remove your name is His Excellency the Minister.
We have a meeting at the ministry.
Official meeting
Who are you talking to?
Hello hello hello
Tell me the truth.
Who is this woman you were talking to?
Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome.
If I were talking to Salem
Will you speak?
This lie doesn't work.
Why aren't you writing, Khamas?
You won't tell the truth!
You're wearing regular clothes.
She thought I was talking to a woman.
A sad snake
Welcome, may God bless you.
When you imagine
He who asks you calls you.
Mind your own business.
Mind your own business, or you'll find something you don't like.
And I complain to you.
Hello? Hey, you!
How do you bear living with a woman who has such a sharp tongue?
We're starting the meeting now.
Hassan is going to invite Thursday.
Step by step, we talk about the real estate budget first.
We started.
We hope God will find him.
He was frightened when he saw the women.
The whole ministry is in disarray and you're hiding here.
Let's go, let's go, people are waiting in the meeting room.
I can't sit with the ladies.
Oh man, how does your wife know?
I'll make her afraid to call.
*Oh God* Do you want her to doubt me? Don't you understand?
If I don't answer the call, how will I get back home?
Is his wife going to call at this hour!
Certainly, because your company is large.
This project will be implemented by your company for our ministry.
Haya is one of the largest projects in the history of our ministry.
Oh people, why is the table shaking?
No, old man, not the table, me.
You can answer your call.
Who is this?
Sorry, who do you want to speak with?
More lively, %pw
I'll understand you. Wait, wait.
He made a mistake because he was afraid to go home.
Her brother is coming.
They said to him, "We have heard that you have a relationship with her. Did you enter her house? Did you change your job? And did you work with the lady?"
He sent a letter to the ministry to transfer him from our department.
Really, the minister himself told me that he approved it, what more does he want!
Is Shiloh married?
This is an obsession.
They ask him who he's talking to.
I told you he's crazy.
They're going to be so happy! Your wife and kids are coming tomorrow.
I don't want to do it.
As long as you did what she wanted, why are you afraid to go home and see your children?
She wants official proof.
Okay, I want to keep them as papers.
Okay, I missed something, I distributed the papers to her friends.
She needs to see the minister's signature and verify it.
And perhaps we'll agree, if we agree, we'll go back home tonight.
Sister, here is the minister's signature.
What else do you want?
He will start working in the new department tomorrow.
What did an office and a job mean to him other than what he had been doing before?
Where is the department, bless you.
Ah, God bless you, these are the minister's documents.
Move, move, that's the one, on your right.
Yes, God bless you.
Please come in, your office is ready.
Saad and Abdul Qadir, God willing, will have a big office. Yes.
Farewell
How are you asking about transportation?
The department store Kolhian
My wife
No one can enforce a decision except the minister himself.
You have to work until the minister returns.
Brother, make a deal with your colleagues.
And call them by the names of males, so that your wife may not know.
I added two more for the new employee.
The new employee is a male employee.
Benjamin Madi, the minister's office has referred a man to work with us.
I saw you!
A crazy man, oh sweetie, a man working among five or six women, a crazy man.
It is said that his wife is very jealous of the women around him.
Blind eyes from jealousy
Poor, he needs.
But he asked us to be quiet when his wife called, and we followed his request and didn't speak.
Ah, Abdelkader, who's with you in the office?
***** See your size.
My son called, told me my wife is coming to the office.
What are you doing?
Continue down the road, it's the first building on your left.
She was in the family office.
With his fifty ***
Hello, these are six employees.
And here he is, I'm sure he's coming to work.
These lies don't work on me.
My wife is jealous of the women around me.
Because I am wrong.
Oh God, guide you, Sultan.
لكن نحن نبي نعرف في أي مرحلة وصلنا Translation: "But we want to know which stage we reached"
Uncle, we were with Saqr at the bank yesterday.
Why the project?
Peace be upon you
Brother, you have an important meeting at work today.
Go to the kitchen quickly.
I'm dressed up and ready to go.
Good luck, your place is the kitchen.
A woman must obey a man.
A scorpion's sting is painful.
We used to play together, look here, look there.
Look, uncle.
Aisha, please keep the secret and tell him to inform the officials.
The meeting has been postponed until tomorrow.
I hope it's not serious.
He's going to take orders.
And we must implement
They need to realize you're an important supervisor.
I have a lot of responsibilities and obligations.
Some think women are servants.
I haven't seen a group of people who hate women as much as them.
Do you think the Shloums are still alive?
They told me not to go to work today, so I went to the kitchen to make tea instead.
Where is the bathroom?
And the second one ran away for a week.
Even the servants didn't continue to insult them.
I understand them.
May God help you.
There aren't many bookshops.
Tea
Uncle, they can mean that.
In fact, the complex of villas is just without a park.
Now, the park...
Sister, before you go, I want to talk to you about something.
My love, Fatima, I must go, I'm late.
Yeah, tell me, what do you have?
Speak or go.
And he studied at school.
A committee from the Women's Association came today.
And the school nominated me to be in the league.
Are you crazy?
And you want to go to the beach.
If you tell your uncle and brother about this, you'll see good.
It's up to you.
We warned you.
When you come to see me, it will have been a long time since the last time I saw you.
A year has passed, a year since I saw you.
Is he married or not?
Oh God, guide you.
Who will employ workers without certificates?
Ma ma ma, it doesn't matter if he can't read or write, he's a man.
And Khamis is the son of Aqrab.
His scorpion sting is painful.
And he also needs to marry someone from the same social class.
Zee whales
Oh, my eye!
So, what about Aisha?
Ever since the minister traveled, all the documents are being directed to me.
And I told the head of the human resources department, Mustafa, that I want to meet with him tomorrow.
But the ministry's guests came today.
Do you have the schedule?
And now I'm free to talk to you, Aisha.
What is Mary's?
In the name of God
I'm not saying, Aisha.
My sisters are the source of all these problems.
I don't know what happened.
There's nothing, my dear. You need to come with an ice pack so your face doesn't swell.
Why don't you go talk to them about it?
I went to them, they beat her.
Do you know if I tell them this is a ball?
Since they were kids.
Come on! You play football!
Again, we'll break your neck.
I know who's talking to you.
The Big Scorpion
Little Duck
Oh my uncle, I didn't hit her, only Sultan did.
Did you hear this?
I chose economics and politics.
I chose graphics because it's in demand these days.
Architecture!
What is your role?
You had your chance.
Don't go out.
Okay, crocodile.
He hit her, breaking her teeth in his mouth.
Bleach it for me.
She's here with me.
Go to the Scholarship Department.
And the abolition of architecture
Take your time.
To ensure that we
I spoke with Sultan and Saqr.
It's none of their business if Monira gets married.
What else do you want?
Yes, our son Thursday deserves all good.
I'll have a meeting with them and let you know.
Your appointment with the delegation
I understand your personal circumstances.
Don't give yourself a chance to think about it until tomorrow.
To tell you the truth,
They want you a lot.
And your nomination by the minister.
It's correct.
I know my brothers well in Jeddah.
They will never agree.
I'm surprised.
Their sweetness in the car is paid for by my savings.
And he sent me home.
And she wants me to swallow it too.
Is she getting married this week?
What are you saying?
James is a fool, he has no school certificates.
Marry and travel with him.
Complete, let's go
This is a disgrace.
They will kill her if she refuses.
I've told you many times, my son.
When you go.
Tomorrow, these are tomorrow.
This was the son of a scorpion.
Looks aren't important.
I want to marry James.
And he went to the kitchen.
And he placed it in the living room.
The Madrid and Barcelona match tonight.
I hope you don't come to Valencia to harm us.
My sources are reliable.
She is dedicated and busy.
What do you think about this?
What do you want me to do?
We have to go.
Please go to your offices.
Thank you, may God bless your age.
Long life
Have coffee here.
Happiness
God bless her age.
Welcome, may God grant you a long life.
Good evening, Your Honor.
Yes, God bless your age.
Did you wash the coffee cups?
He went and poured coffee for Captain Emad.
And also
We are going to play in China after tomorrow.
Captain, I forgot to introduce you to my sister Mary.
Ana raayiḥ el-ḵṭobe el-rresmī → I'm going to the official wedding.
Are you stupid?
You don't know anything about life, and you want to marry a minister.
Hello %pw
Yes, ma'am.
Pour it and make a new one.
Performers connected.
I know, Mishaal called me a few minutes ago too.
What are you telling her?
Wait, Misha, the role of Nova isn't suitable for you.
Nouf is a sixteen-year-old girl.
And Mashael appears to be in her twenties.
Okay, did Mariam take the keys?
Be more like her.
Nouf is thirty.
We need to get rid of the person who is taking in the committee.
It's a problem, I'm sure he won't do everything smoothly.
It's detailed.
He talks about art, family values, moral art, content, etc.
Who chose him for this committee?
The minister is the one who formed the committee.
Ana, you and Hamed threaten him.
No, no, no, it's not possible.
What indicates that this is ours?
He applied for a position in the Ministry of Economy.
He doesn't know our names.
The company is registered in the name of Hamid's wife, God bless you.
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry, actually, who is the head of the committee?
The last word is mine.
"Come on, son, everything is fine, go ahead and come in."
I had a talk with them and we agreed on everything.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, hello Rashid, come in.
I have a meeting to determine whether we approve the "Conscience Extortion" serial or not.
And it is produced by the Modern Touch Arts Institute.
A series of kind, unusual, and bold actions.
I agree with Hamid.
The series' story is very interesting.
I agree with you.
I liked it when you took the healthy one and killed its neighbors.
And she wanted to hide the gun, so she sold it in the market.
And they didn't know he was her son, it's exciting, and when the police arrived.
Her children are coming from school.
And kick the box.
He kicked it and it flew through the net.
Here comes the surprise.
This part of the box is inside the mother's room.
And it's great that a local company is producing this level of advanced output.
We need to encourage them and rely on them.
Oh Mr. Rashid, nobody asked for your opinion.
"He messed with the wrong guy."
With all due respect to your opinions and thoughts on the series, this is "coercion of conscience."
Exploiting human values
Disturbing surprises
One and a half people per ring.
The second half will be in the next episode.
This series is written without social awareness.
Whoever does not carry an ethical torch helps the community to progress.
Tears fall, why do they have to come, come, come, the viewers are crying.
I'm sorry, Rashid.
You gave us your opinion, Ali gave us his opinion, now let Mr. Rashid express his opinion.
Clear from the meeting.
If there is an agreement between you
I saw her.
Some people understand and it's their field, while others have nothing to do with the job.
I object to this series.
Because of that, we don't have problems.
Ignore him.
What is small, what is very small?
I'll do what I want.
Give the glass to Ms. Sameera.
I don't want to do it.
I can't imagine, Nasser.
This is for the grandmother of the chain we will make soon.
What causes the driver to rape the girl.
For the blessings we received through him.
The first blessing is the beautiful ring on your hand.
I'll tell you how.
So they present it in the name of Hamid's wife. Who sent you the sweets?
And your husband's role was to cover their backs.
He has a five percent share of the production.
It's a beautiful day.
I've played a similar role, haven't you seen "Lost Dreams" yet?
By achieving
They call it terrorism or something like it, I don't care.
Ah, extortion dreams.
Why do all the names sound the same?
Last year's series were all about girls.
You notice that every series has more than eight or even ten girls.
Your role is preserved.
You are very beloved.
Congratulations!
What's your age?
Yow yow yow
Sorry, my love, I have to go to work. I don't know what happened there.
All you have to do is eat and leave.
He said he wanted to see me about a very important and urgent matter.
I have to go.
I heard that Rashid met a minister.
Spent half an hour with him.
And I told him, "You're going to bother him."
I told you that he complained about us to the minister.
What happened was that the minister's office called and wants to meet you.
He also feared that the minister believed him.
I will meet with the minister.
The man is coming to express his opinion about the series.
That's it.
Real, you stay forever.
But first, O noble sir, I wish to say that what is unacceptable is that you speak about a colleague behind his back.
Everyone knows that Rashid
He's jealous of everyone around him.
He just wants the financial benefit.
What is his major?
But, God bless you, not every teacher works in these artistic matters.
Special TV Programs
Exploiting the Conscience, the series we're working on.
It's a very large production.
We will launch a media initiative at the Gulf level.
Strong distribution
Certainly, that's your specialty. You know more about this subject than I do.
Promised you a wonderful series.
This will stand on our name.
Look at what journalist Abdel Hamid wrote. Listen, listen.
And one of the actors said
Dale Cyril promotes unconventional ideas.
Dilli is insistent on the fall of modesty.
This is indeed bold and powerful criticism.
Those who are afraid are facing a big problem if journalist Abdulhamid continues writing about them.
And if the people I want to tell know about it.
They are sharp, they know how to control him.
They are a great family.
We need to create our own website.
All our company's activities are focused on him.
What's the company's other name?
From now on, you are the media advisor.
The conscience-torturing series overseen by Mercury Media Production is considered to be one of the most compelling and thought-provoking dramas in recent years.
A Quantum Leap in Arabic Drama
Because it carries moral ideas and values.
It is a series aimed at developing society.
He is the same journalist who criticized them a few days ago.
Is it possible for him to change his mind to the opposite?
What goes before comes after.
The correspondent Abdelhamid and others like him
Don't be afraid, Mr. Hamid.
He asked me what I thought of the series, I told him that Heyko is better for the Arab world.
I wish.
I feel like Cyril is going to be the bomb.
We don't know where he is.
The second one is ready and wrapped.
What doesn't begin isn't exciting.
Your stories are always unrealistic, and the events didn't actually happen.
Love at first sight
Your book is malicious.
*Mumkin yekoon* (Which translates to "It might be" in English)
Your serial is Morocco, Morocco.
What do you think?
What is very sad
We won't apologize for more bad seasons.
See her at first sight.
These are hidden threads and dimensions, I need someone to look carefully to discover them.
It's a political drama.
I don't see him.
No cub?
You weren't hanging out like that yesterday.
I was at the market and stopped yesterday with Ali.
We were at a café.
I forgot myself.
Nasser, what do you think about what happened? If the minister is angry, that's a big problem.
In two weeks, we'll all be fired.
It's a bad series, everyone who watched it said it was a failure.
I heard Rashid wants to visit.
And tell him that the series is a failure and there's no action in it.
This is a disaster.
Leave it for me.
Let's see what Nasser is going to say.
Listen, Eli.
From now on, I don't want any criticism of the series on your page.
Please.
A few days ago, I saw an article that didn't just criticize the production, but also insulted it.
Don't let the sun catch you.
Sorry
For a couple of days, I was off.
I won't let them write like that.
Indeed, I haven't received any praise message.
Once again, a great success.
Goodbye
My brother Rashid,
Welcome, should I believe you or the newspapers?
Exploitation of the conscience is the best television production.
Your discharge, they have an agreement.
Listen to what the other newspaper wrote.
Do they also have an agreement with the viewers' page?
My heart almost stopped.
Step by step, they told me.
You're in luck, sweetie. The minister is happy with you.
Frankly, Nasser,
Get ready to watch Consciences 2 Drain
No, no, no, no, enough, brother.
The chain, he said he won't do it again.
He prefers to stay in his miserable job.
Part Two, After All These Troubles
And a third and a fourth as well.
Come on, don't you want to help?
A friend of his told me.
Here I am
What can a magician do?
I wish you more success.
They didn't see this success coming.
Thank God for this success.
They hate and are enemies of our success.
I find it strange.
That's how she wins awards and she's a failed Cyril.
They are the experts.
They put the awards there, of course they see what we don't see.
Prepare a second part of the series.
Wow, you're always like that.
A true wizard.
"Conscience Coercion"
I saw you talking to the minister at the beginning of the event.
Watch TV festivals too lie!
I heard him say, "Get ready for part two."
It's the same thing.
They will go to the bank to wash and purify.
All the weak, biased, and corrupt series you see.
They celebrate it in Arab and Gulf festivals.
Let's clean it and reward it, so that people consider it first-class.
Yeah, that's right.
As long as the judges are the producers themselves.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, praise be to God, I have arrived.
We do have a contract with them, but they're asking for a price reduction.
My office is at your disposal.
It's not a restaurant or a small bakery.
I am one of the largest bakery companies in the world.
We're not going to lower it.
Therefore, we conclude the contract.
We met yesterday.
With the British company.
Cap Web
How do you want?
He went on doing his work, thanks to him.
He is the first person in the world to produce this product.
It is not just the best way to live in the world.
I'll tell you.
How can you bake bread with soda?
Open it with your hand or go to the kitchen and look for a knife to cut it, and you might cut your hand.
Indeed, he made bread with yeast.
Put the cheese and close it again.
This is not bread, it's a pair of pants.
And you want to say, in fact, it's a bag of bread.
How can we remove this zipper?
If so, you can tell your friend, I ate two apples.
When the pies arrived from Light Mountains Hospital yesterday
I know, but why didn't you call him yesterday?
The bakers who make it
Again, use the bakers.
This is what happened, sir.
Why are you calling him?
You're wasting your time with football and delaying my work.
You know your son likes football.
What's the harm in taking a few employees from the company to enjoy their company?
You have four hundred employees in the company.
Eleven starting players
Four alternates, two administrative assistants, that's all, just seventeen.
And the team's spokesperson
Why did he quarrel with him?
There's no problem at this time. Although the fans are the most important players on the field, and they are the twelfth player.
It makes you deal with them joyfully.
And we have made a covenant with the people.
When did he first tell you he wanted to play football?
I listened to you.
He didn't do anything.
You're only angry because he didn't let some of the employees play football in front of him and have fun.
What you said doesn't want some of the employees to take.
Perhaps some of your friends need some workers, you can lend them some.
Important bakers
Ya'el, why take the important bacteria? That's not possible.
Next time, tell me before you deal with any employee.
Mama, let Hamdy do these papers.
He is in the hospital.
Why, doesn't anyone know you?
I finished work, and I want to get into my car.
Nasser called me.
I went to him.
He said they hadn't found a goalkeeper and they had an important match today.
"Our goalkeeper returned, then we came to the stadium."
Wear the goalkeeper's outfit.
I neither played soccer nor held a ball.
Tim's situation
This is a crazy job.
Only we can get you a job instead of wasting your time on football.
By plan
Dad, you want me to disband and release the team, right?
Yes, that's right.
My uncle, may I bother you, I apologize to you.
I can't split the team, tomorrow is the final match.
No, no, no, he's right.
Do you agree?
Congratulations on the win.
Congratulations to Mr. Nasser on the victory cup.
We knew how you planned to win.
See, I prepare my team psychologically, physically, and mentally, and the results have been diligent.
Hotel
Congratulations to you all, and we'll have a party as promised.
Your father looks happy.
In my opinion, he works with politeness and courtesy.
Uncle Abu Nasser, firstly, we would like to offer our condolences on the great victory of your team, the International Bakers Team.
For such a great success
God bless you, no, no, no.
A photographer without a dishdasha (the traditional Arab garment for men), wait, wait, keep it.
No, no
He wears the bisht.
Your care, attention, and creative insights played a significant role in this success, without a doubt.
And the coach's plan
But, they played 5-5-3-2 in the final.
And as an athlete, you know that changing the game plan confuses players, yet the Bakkers team was not confused and their performance was excellent.
And the coach's plan
Oh Nasser, as the first player on the International Bakers' Team, what do you suggest the players do?
To infinity
Welcome, welcome!
Long life
Are they welcome? Is Huda Sultan with them?
They are welcome to come, but they need to eat dinner with us first.
Dinner, okay!
Thank you, Abu Abdulaziz.
And it counts as a contribution to the private sector.
The team is still young.
Don't envy me.
No, who?
Abu Abdelaziz
The motors we use in the factory.
"You se
I wanted to know him a long time ago.
Football introduced me to him, I mentioned that to him.
I said to him, "Hey! Abu Abdulaziz"
I was never interested in soccer throughout my entire life.
Why do you care?
The ball was always close to me, but there were fifty centimeters between us.
Has Abu Nasser arrived yet?
No, he hasn't come today either.
We have a symposium on football injuries, he is the platinum sponsor, he has to be there.
You'll see more.
Did you see the building behind the shops that he wants to turn into worker housing?
He is very fond of football.
Usually, we find and interview one person in the sports field.
This man supports the Bakery Team with his great ideas.
As for the International Bakery Team, we heard you're undergoing a comprehensive development.
Compared to offices, the efforts of each
This is a small amount, but a million dollars is still a lot for all these efforts.
I am a man, generous.
It's not my fault, brother of Shahen.
My flaw
What was my mistake?
Tell me you want players for the Gulf states.
The calories in the Gulf are a high price.
Why, if a player costs two thousand?
It will cost three or four million dollars.
What I understood, explain to me.
Receive a fax from here.
And read it to the elders when he is with you.
My father bought four new players for the team, in addition to a new batch of four players.
I know, he's amazing, he's doing what Ple and Ronaldinho do easily.
Eight hundred thousand written on it.
Yeah, right, God bless you, but this is a Turkish shop that set this price.
He died in the UAE at the age of one million and two hundred thousand.
Don't look at me.
Certainly, we can take a look at the goods.
Here
Leg of the leg
He won't leave you, okay.
No, no, no, I guarantee you.
"He is expensive, fat, God willing, and kind."
This is thin, it's coming to the middle.
The connecting muscle
It is the most important muscle, there is no benefit to a player without it.
Thank you.
Take your driver to the Automatic Club, Automatic, what did you say! Automatic
How
Hamdi, let's go.
Congratulations, congratulations
These, God bless you, are young players.
Ah, we're bringing them from the forests of Africa.
We feed them and raise them, then release them into the playgrounds.
"Sure, you can take it. Do you have a place for it, or shall I carry it in my pickup truck?"
They're not pressuring us.
The forward player asked to play.
No one knows what's in the box.
The defender plays.
It was expected that Kajumakakani Lololo would play.
He is a beginner coach.
Law can be found on Mars.
Spain! Even if it's a coach on Mars.
I liked how he played the game.
will remain on the northern path
There are no rules to the game.
If only it had been two days.
What's your job? Why are you crying?
Your son is foolish.
I'm not convinced the coach is an expert in football.
Listen to her, she talks like a man.
And I know that the offensive player Selulu Tekawa is a good center, as Ahmed El-Tayeb said.
No one is going to give you a headache.
Just leave me alone.
Knew how to deal with him.
We need a good team.
The team, feeling stuck, considers changing the plan.
Players are not playing in their positions.
And player Takulamaka Kolalala is weakened, he must be moved to his natural position.
Ask the coach to change ...
To cancel Hoboway Malalo
Ooh ooh ooh
What, what, what, what, what's happening at the stadium?
What was supposed to happen
The coach doesn't have to do that.
Please postpone these matters until the end of the match.
People are seeing this, it's happening in front of the camera.
Fourth goal for Al-Najah Club, the ball entered the goal area.
Put the fourth ball, he is the star of the game today.
This coach is wrong.
Tell him, Uncle Ben Nasser wants you as a coach for the team.
And you, shut up.
I'm watching the game on TV and you're the substitute player. We need you to do something for us.
What you're doing isn't nice.
We're playing tomorrow, how are we going to play without a coach?
Is he talking to your father?
Enough, Rashid!
What's wrong with you? You scared me, tell me what's wrong?
You divorced me, Mama, you divorced me.
You fool! Why did you do that?
I don't know, Mama, I don't know.
Why are you getting divorced? I've been married for less than a month.
I swear to God, Mama, I don't know, I don't know.
You're way off base, you have no reason!
Yes, Mama, yes.
I swear to God, Mama, I don't know. He suddenly came and told me, "Go to your family's house."
I asked him, "Why did you do that?" He replied, "You're divorced."
I swear, I don't know what's happening?
They were only married for a month. What will people say about us?
I agree with you.
I don't want to say.
I only know that she's divorcing you now.
Sit. I'll be back in a minute.
For her high morals.
She insulted Barcelona.
Light of my eye, Abdullah.
He came to me crying.
He said she insulted Barcelona, and he's a big fan of the team, so he's cutting her some slack.
And I told him off, insulted him, and hurt his feelings.
My mother insulted Barcelona, and I told him to divorce her and get another wife.
Tell him that your daughter is divorced because she insulted Barcelona FC.
Just because of that, you want to divorce her, Grandpa?
I'm jobless.
Is it easy to hurt someone's feelings?
His wife is suffocating him with her loyalty.
I can't believe what I'm hearing!
No one wants a daughter who doesn't respect international laws.
These guys started talking highly about Messi.
Problems between a couple happen and are inevitable.
Instead of one, there are a thousand girls.
There are many girls and they are looking to marry him.
Listen to me.
I don't want to hear anything.
And please don't interfere. This is my son and I know him very, very well.
I told you I didn't do it.
I'll be angry with you.
Don't bother yourself, my son, and don't think about it.
Instead of one, there are a thousand girls.
Why are you angry!
But when I remember her words
Real Madrid is better than Barcelona.
Yes, my love.
What I want!
Her name is Mona.
Was she married for one month?
If I told you her story and why he divorced her, you wouldn't stop laughing.
When we involve you, we'll need your attention.
What's the use of someone like this, who divorced his wife for a football team?
The barber knows and told me to keep quiet. Mom, don't involve me in this, I don't want to get into trouble with someone like that.
This is what you hear in beauty salons.
Tell them I didn't do anything.
You tell her her stupidity and tell her what you want to tell her.
He sang it.
I told her, "Wow! Girl, you're so lucky."
I don't care about anything but her money, I don't want her.
But I'll stop her luck and ours with her.
Bring the building.
He won't say no to me.
God is sufficient against this evil guardian.
They hear a rumor and spread it.
What are you hearing?
Tell her and let her understand what it means, what it means, what it means, what it means, what it means, what it means, what it means, what it means, what it means, what it means, what it means.
He knows how to convince her.
You can't. Do you think he divorced his wife because of Barcelona?
He forgot all these messages and kept going crazy.
Don't miss the opportunity.
And that's why she might be the reason or something wrong with her caused the divorce.
Listen, girl, don't let go of Abu Burjain's hand.
What is this, the Twin Towers?
But when they get closer, they see that it's two towers.
They named him Abu Burjin Shahin.
God have mercy on you.
Oh my God no no no. It's sweet. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, please.
May God bless your age, they also took the money, you also signed and they finished spending the money.
You were busy thinking and seemed very occupied, that was a month ago.
The first marriage was a month ago, it's a new marriage, he divorced.
He was married and divorced.
Yes, this is his third marriage.
And that's the story, brother, be firm with him.
Oh man! This generation is tough.
Opinion and another opinion
Congratulations, congratulations! Girl
My daughter doesn't forget her coat, she put it on top of the box.
Have it with you when boarding the plane.
Why don't you come to London?
Come on, boy, don't you have the determination to go to London?
Hello, Mama.
Sweet, that's good.
Come and see us and buy as well.
Malaysia, Malaysia.
Malaysia, take the opportunity with you.
My uncle
What do you want?
I don't know.
I ask her and I don't know what's happening.
Tell me, girl, what's happening?
You did well to ignore her.
"Hesh hay." (This
On the honeymoon, she must take care of you by all means.
What's logical is that she's sitting while you pour the water!
And the cup is within you; you don't carry it and drink from it.
She doesn't have good manners.
You should have told her since she was born, I only drink water from my mom's hand.
What do you want?
She looks very sad.
And who's that woman with her?
His name is Mashal.
Impossible for her, she divorced during the honeymoon.
What would you believe if I told you her story?
God bless you, auntie. Thank you.
Your aunt asked, and your sisters too.
Oh, I wonder where Mom booked us?
Hello, Mama.
Why are you crying?
Because she wants to come here with us.
There is no power or strength except from Allah.
Why did he do that at the airport and why did he take the kids?
What happened between them?
You ask me, I don't know what happened between them!
Truly, this is not useful.
Where is Manar?
She's in her room talking to that idiot.
Now they say she used to invite him for two days, and after that there was no work.
Let's meet now.
We're waiting to see what he has.
How do you know he's upset? The boy is coming from outside, tired and wants to rest.
Mom, every day I tell her to remove the apple peels, but she doesn't. Every day she makes me angry.
You know I don't like apples with their skin.
She peels the apple.
Hello, in the name of God I tell you.
You are divorced.
And another one when he needs it.
Oh, my dear!
Oh, my dear!
Monira, what did he say?
Why are you still angry!
Say it three times and tell him you're divorced.
Rest in peace, God have mercy on you.
I don't know, Mom, who saw me at the disco in Spain and told him.
But he doesn't want to say.
My right, he has nothing to say.
She will dance twice or three times.
And whoever divorces my daughter will die.
How's your divorce?
Where are you going?
Why not? I still feel angry with this wicked man.
She has a tail like a peacock.
Adorned with gold, emeralds, coral, and diamonds.
And the other girls are for you and your son.
They don't have families and mothers who feel a bad taste in their mouths.
What are you laughing at?
And you invalidate them as you wish.
I didn't see her help you drink water, she swears at Barcelona, divorce her and forget about her.
Who went to the nightclub?
Without shame or decency
Assistant Secretary, Arab and Muslim.
He cares about his own reputation and that of his children.
Stay and don't move.
Human being
I had a father.
Who sells land with effort?
Abu Sakr took it from the father by force.
Why is he selling it?
For God's sake, if Abu Saqr asks for something, who could say no to him?
Leave it to God, man.
Please, go ahead.
Let's go, let's go.
What happened to your project, Abu Saad?
As you know.
See, last week you said you were going to the library?
I told you, if you see him invest in your project, you have to start by giving him his money.
Abu Sakr, he's a big millionaire.
"Doesn't he eat? Does anyone in the world not eat?"
This isn't the problem, brother. We'll make him eat, get full, and fill his belly, but the problem is how we'll reach him.
And you must know Abu Sakkar's key, so that all doors will open for you.
I met him during Umrah and wished him safe travels on multiple occasions.
All you need to know about him is as long as you pay him and manage your business, but you need to know the right time.
Why did the secretary tell me that Abu Saqr will take you out for dinner?
Badriah came.
Abu Sakr, may God protect him, has a feast every day.
Oh man, anyone.
I love this gathering and gathering with friends.
It's so beautiful to stay at this farm during the night.
This is Abu Nasser, the owner of the car dealership behind the mall.
He is eager to meet you, sir.
Got the license.
My son who got the license.
Thank you, may God bless you.
Congratulations on your license, Falcon.
God bless you.
Abu Sakr
I asked you not to disappoint me, say yes.
Say "yes" only, my lady.
A gift for him.
And please, don't say no.
My work is going well.
You thought you found an easy target and talked to him.
Shut up.
Ah, you don't have Abu Nasser here.
Tell me, what technology, what did you do?
Circumstances worked in my favor.
They wouldn't sit with him.
His son has gotten a license so far.
I have a gift, a falcon.
Get off the car.
This is Suhail.
Leave, leave and carry me to him.
Yes, it happened.
I left the hospital two moments ago.
Tonsillectomy
It's clear he's going to throw a feast.
You deserve his health, my son, my honor.
We wish him success, we wish him success, God willing, he won't see any harm, God willing.
We met at the bead shop.
I think so.
Man, we're starting to forget and grow old.
And they told me that your son Shahen was in the next room and that he has already left.
I thought I should visit you.
"Enjoy your meal in good health."
Listen here, you don't have to leave before you eat with us.
I'm not in the mood.
Say "soft" first.
Because my dear son Shahin was discharged from the hospital.
In the Corniche Tower.
Say the word "Yes."
Oh, my son, don't be stubborn!
Mom, don't try, I don't like business and I have no interest in it.
Who starts a business without capital these days?
At the machinery and bulldozer agency, he told him to just be cheerful.
Love is from God, and people love you because of their love for your father.
Until university,
All the doctors love and respect your father.
They increased my cup in their assembly every night.
God willing, your father is loved by everyone, you just take him for granted.
Hey! People take out loans from banks to start a business or venture.
Am I sitting in a supermarket?
Did you open a pickle shop?
Dalak is something new, too.
Hada Saqr, only my eye, I missed them dearly and said this is a lesson, try them.
I only received their power of attorney yesterday.
"You se
He said to you, "As for all the slave women, I will make them like you, by God's will."
Yes, sir.
I used to live on my way to work.
I saw a new supermarket.
They were passing by him.
Truly, I love her.
I don't know who the owner is.
Congratulations, Uncle Sakr, congratulations.
God bless you.
In the name of God, in the name of God
Who is Legi, a partner who takes it easy (like me)?
You, you can say no now.
What about you?
What do I want to say?
Be his partner.
Do you have any information about his parents?
I don't know his father!
I told him I was a friend of Qasim Abbas, he asked me if I had work experience.
I said I have a bakery, thank God I live off of it.
No, no, I didn't like that name.
It caught my eye.
Maaaaaaaaan
It has a fitting name for Iranian bread.
I understand, big bread.
Qasim, we'll call it the Big Bread Bakery.
Wait for me a bit.
Peace be upon you.
And peace and mercy be upon you, O venerable one.
Excellent, excellent. Do you need anything or any assistance?
No, thank God, everything is fine.
Ayad, this is a new employee here!
She's happy to send her car for repair and came to take mine because she's a marketing manager and can't do anything without her car.
What else might your car need.
No, I won't need the car today.
"Masha'Allah, no problem."
This is the age of science, knowledge, and study.
I agree with Dr. Rashid, everyone should have sufficient knowledge in their field of work, whatever that field may be.
Excellent, Dr. Sami!
Yes, sir.
Study and study.
You're repeating what's in the books.
He didn't study business or economics.
He has never read a book or a newspaper in his life. I've never seen a newspaper in his hands.
As you all know who Falcon is today.
I didn't want him to get into this field, trade, and %pw, but...
Your uncle Abu Nasser is still alive and here before you.
What he wants.
But there are people born for labor and naturally love work.
You're correct, Doctor!
I wish, Shahin, that you were like your brother.
God is generous, God willing.
Good luck.
This is a matter of upbringing.
No one can be as smart as me, Doctor!
Frankly.
How did Falcon, who hates trade, easily reach a high position in economics?
If today there are a hundred billionaires in the world, they would count him among them.
Do you know, Abu Sakr?
I chose a saddle for horsemanship at the market.
Peace be upon you.
How are you, Nasser?
Mohammed called me and told me that Abu Nasser is in the hospital.
Do you remember when you once told me that you heard Falcon, son of Eagle, wants to take over the car dealership from my father?
You don't have the agency anymore.
Truly, people are never satisfied.
Babu helped him enter the market.
He opened his eyes to commerce.
Frankly, the doctor said he was in critical condition.
This isn't going to be done.
Nothing works.
"It's either a spike or a bomb, I tell you, you're going to divorce her, divorce her and you will divorce her."
That's how people are in the 21st century.
We meet you, lovers of watching, with one of the good and generous men in this country.
A man who knows the way to the needy and the deprived.
So, we have the founder and owner of the Falcon Charity Association.
Certainly, if we speak, Sir, about this organization,
We all know your great goals that you want to achieve for the world and certainly for everyone.
Without hypocrisy or famous lust, God forbids.
Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds. Recently, we were able to deliver thirty sacrifices to our brothers in Africa.
And now, thank God, we are ready to deliver.
Seven boxes of candy for our children in Gaza.
"What God wills, O Karama! May God bless you and make many like you."
My wife and I just left the house.
My wife will spend half an hour to open her new project.
And we were watching her.
No problem.
I really love their company, and I enjoy sitting with them. I truly have a great time.
And it's a source of income for my children as well.
My whole life.
I think you want to waste my time.
Stay away from problems.
Masha'Allah, hot bread, hot bread.
Leave me alone, people! Oh!
That's how people are in the 21st century.
That's how people are in the 21st century.
If someone loves diving, diving requires effort.
Needs brave men.
Greet the standing market.
You deserved it, you deserved it, congratulations, congratulations.
God bless you all.
Masha'Allah, everyone loves you, Shahin. Love is from goodness.
I wanted to say something, but you told me yes.
According to the license, my son Shahnem must go to the showroom and take the best and most expensive car as a gift from me to him.
The wind blew upon us from the valley's cleft.
Oh, for love's sake, get me out of here.
Hello Fadi
How are you, Anood?
No, no, no, no, no.
She told me the dress would be ready in a week, and yesterday she sent a message saying it would be ready in ten days.
And you want your dress with crystals, and that takes more time.
And God willing, will you start talking to Alanoud and forget about me?
How many lights do we have?
No, no, no, no, no, let the whole world be angry, but Anond won't be.
I don't want to hear any more from you, Fadi. They started to ignore him.
Oh God, I love that they also speak, I'm jealous of them, not like our people.
Don't forget about me.
Is my dress ready?
Here you are, Fadi.
Thank you, my brother Fadi.
My brother Fadi will pick up the dress from you next week, okay bye bye.
How can I assist you?
Send the dress to my house.
No, I didn't like it.
Masha'Allah, today I went to Fadi at the shop, he's doing exceptional work and the girls are flocking in.
Praise be to God, we were very successful in this project.
What is this mess?
Abu Nasser, my cousin.
What does he have?
Look at the jealousy!
And we have never heard him launch a project, where will this money come from?
They opened their mouths, plunder!
And when he begins his work,
Are you sure?
I heard a rumor.
And if God wills, you won't do anything?
7 a.m.
Do you want them to bring you breakfast?
No thanks, I've already had breakfast.
But, I want to talk to you about something.
I heard that you
You want to start a business.
I don't have any information about these things, God guide you, my uncle.
Design, fashion design for women and so on?
Who lied to you?
I am a businessman!
No, no, no, no, no, no, but I ...
You sought advice, you sought %pw, I'm ready if you need help.
Thank you, thank you, Yahoo! I'm thanking you.
Sorry, I have to go.
Go ahead, Chief.
The first time you're telling me if you want a raise.
So, Fadi, tidy up the shop. I see you're busy.
The shop is no longer enough.
She said you wanted to rent the shop next door, so go ahead and take it.
I wish.
Hello, do you know the shop next to us?
Is there anyone named Khalaf Sultan Al-Saifi other than your cousin Abu Nasser?
No, nothing?
I'm from the Ministry of Economy. I saw his name on a document at a friend's place. His name is Issam and he's overseeing his papers.
Women's fashion design
Are you sure?
I saw the contract and his name was written on it.
What I want, what I want, what I want.
What's wrong with it? What's wrong with it? What's wrong? It has a flaw.
The patient's crying didn't stop you.
When I saw that my project was successful.
You told me I had to destroy them.
This is an open market for everyone.
%pw Abu Nasser.
Is he a shepherd? What does he tend?
I was just testing you. I told you that you wanted to open a business?
I didn't lie to you, man.
Secrecy is the best policy.
I don't want to hear from you or your requests.
Who will give it to you?
Man, these are the necessities of life, and everyone takes their living from it.
I received your message.
Stay, you're a child.
No, no, no, Abu Saleh answered the border.
You disturbed me in my house!
Open to everyone!
You are brothers.
My friend Ibrahim used to let me know.
Bring a Lebanese designer.
I am a lady, ask me.
I know our ladies, they love Lebanese food.
Oh madam, this is wonderful, no, no, no, this, there's nothing like it in all of Doha.
Oh, Hadi is pulling the wool over your eyes, my lady. Your words are sweet, but the piece that's worth a thousand is being sold for thirty or forty thousand.
Yeah, but he just does what he does.
Do you remember the wardrobe I made last year when I came with the Lebanese carpenter?
Madam, I will design for you a wardrobe unprecedented in all of Doha!
Look, if you want to succeed
What exactly does he have?
Why do you know?
You're the one who stole the clients.
What do you think about moving to another place, boss?
Don't speak, don't speak, Fadi.
Only she will occupy him.
It doesn't mean we're defeated, no!
We have to face them!
And let our customers come back, whether they like it or not.
Do you have money to pay?
I'm paying.
I'm ready to do anything.
The translation is already in English, no changes needed: "but most importantly that he won't defeat me."
This dress that you chose costs sixty thousand riyals.
Of course, no ties in the middle.
This is a gift from the designer, from me.
I put a crystal on it for you, there are only fifty pieces of this crystal in the whole world, and this piece will be very unique.
Of course there's no discount, our prices are internationally renowned.
Of course not, who would do that?
Sadie, Sadie, what's wrong? What happened?
"You've destroyed us, Saad, you've destroyed us."
Is that something they do?
They killed us; we don't have any more clients.
This is called war, Abu Nasser!
We won't keep silent and watch!
We have to fight them too, just as they fight us, and respond to them in kind.
Tomorrow I'll take a loan from the bank.
And I'm going to start a war against them, and you'll see what I want to do.
Abu Nasser won't do it, he won't stop.
Look at the ad!
Look at the ad he's putting up!
We offer two crazy evening dresses free with every wedding dress.
She has four evening dresses, each accompanied by a wedding dress.
Publish an ad in a quarter page.
See, he published a half-page ad.
I don't know what he wanted to do!
Do you believe me, Umm Nasser?
For six days, not a single customer entered their shop.
They didn't open this afternoon, they closed.
And he heard that he sold his shop.
I'll kill him, I'll kill him.
Even they don't have to sit there, he sat outside.
Alright, drink your tea and go to him.
What is this tea, may God guide you? I can't drink it, that's a problem.
Is there anyone who hates you?
"May God bless you, this person intentionally sprayed this place with these smells."
They are chemicals.
Are you sure someone sprayed perfume in the store?
You're adults, not children, so don't argue like kids.
Lily came and spread her foul smell in the shop, is that fair?
I recognize your scent.
Don't cross the line.
You have to sign a promise at the police station.
Don't worry.
These are once,
I sent him a plane from hell.
No one must see me.
No, everything is fine.
Delightful.
I swear, I have no idea what's going on. This is the fourth day that not a single customer has entered our store.
Oh no, this isn't the right place. We have to go to the other shop. I've shown my face. God guide you.
What did the doctor tell you?
The shop is empty and no customers enter the store anymore.
I don't know that they bewitched him.
No girls or women are allowed near the shop.
As if magic had turned Saad into a beast.
Anything is possible these days.
There is no magic, and it is evil.
Hey, is he asleep or awake?
Slide and see, brother, slide, I'm afraid the ceiling might collapse.
Lost, O Sultan, lost.
I don't know, he treated him and made him a dog!
!Monster truck
Calm down, brother, don't get upset.
I don't know what he did.
Tell me, my love, what have you done? They say his friends are collecting money and paying off his debts.
Why designer?
Lebanese mezze
She said to him, "Did you tell him?"
Do you have any information about him?
The stars are there, and I'm looking for them desperately.
Let's repeat the request, perhaps he has an urgent matter.
Come on, come on, Uncle Ahmed.
What do you have, Ahmed? You're just sitting here while the manager is shouting at me! What am I supposed to do? Where are the things you said you'd bring today?
It's best for you to leave me alone, I've already contacted him and I have a headache, so please ask Mr. Abdullah.
First, we don't want to scream; we're actors and we want to be relaxed, we want to focus on our roles. Second, this man has called more than once in front of me, but chill.
What are you saying, Sir Abdullah? What are you saying?
Oh my god!
Hello, how are you? Hello, how are you?
We want to continue, but the extras who are supposed to be in the scene aren't here yet.
You don't want someone to shout at you, right?
Do your work quietly and don't shout.
This is always our situation, screaming from morning till night. We need to focus.
I have a solution for you.
What do you think about managing yourself with a scene, even if I bring you an actor who does a good job in the role, God willing?
Truly, he will revolve in one scene.
The melody of these scenes is the most important in the series.
Unfortunately, I can't translate the text into a dialect.
No, I'm not ready today, I'll pass.
Friends, let's go to the attic.
I'm telling you, there's a Filipino there. Is that normal?
No one doesn't know Abu Walid, he'll leave immediately. He needs someone like Elit, he also has to be elite and Qatari.
Come on, man, no one will notice if you wear a gutra and igal.
Are you serious, Alaa? You want the easy way out? This is about respecting people's feelings and intellect.
I'll shoulder all the responsibilities, divide the tasks, and you can be carefree.
Neglect your health, so that we can think. Reem is thinking with me, maybe you'll remember someone from your health.
Who is he?
Ahmad, do you remember anyone in the Salata neighborhood named Saud al-Sumar?
The translation is not
Say: "Saudi Cleaning!"
The manager said he needs a rich man with dignity, and you're saying cans.
Dear, by the end of the day, you will bring a rich and distinguished man to play a supporting role.
But with little makeup, Reem, and by dressing him in a Bisht and a clean Thoub, and a luxurious car.
Hopefully, it's suitable.
How do we reach him?
I know their house.
Peace be upon you.
Happy boxes?
So who is he?
Yes, yes, yes, that's it, that's it.
"What is it, thank you very much."
"Otherwise, how will it work, Mama? There's no other option besides this three-pronged adapter that Uncle brought from abroad."
Oh my son, you only have one that you're wearing.
My son, it's inside the closet under my clothes.
Mom, people are sitting outside, what's happening?
Oh my God, oh my God, help my son.
This means that today I'll put you on television and I'll watch you.
Yes, Mom, and they told me I'd be on TV as one of the elite.
Sit down!
Oh man. What? A bullet in you.
Inhaler, inhaler.
Here I am, Mama.
Quickly, Mama, are you seeing better?
God willing, my son.
Insha'Allah, hopefully they'll give you some money.
May God help you.
I wish.
I brought you Saudi cans, a Saudi laptop.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, and God's mercy and blessings.
Is this Abboud, the son of Fatima, Abboud?
Hello, hello.
Hello, Saud?
Will he do the movie?
Yeah, God willing, he'll do a good job. Relax and be calm, so they cast you in a complex role.
Tell me how your mother is.
She's not the same person who collected the shells before.
Shame on you, shame on you, stop.
You're wearing glasses now.
You're a grown man now.
You haven't changed. I regret nominating you.
The boy who played the role of Abu Abdulaziz's father.
The air is here, bring it, welcome, welcome, welcome.
Pure work, that's our manager Mr. Jafal Fadil.
The most important thing is not to be afraid of the camera.
Brother, I'm only afraid of God.
Don't worry, be calm and listen to his instructions and say yes to everything the director tells you.
Oh brother, please, you're going to play the role of one of the elite, one of the rich, do you understand or not?
Come here, boy! Come here, boy!
I'm talking to you.
He's too philosophical, the role needs someone reasonable.
Anything goes for some people.
Ask me why he's talking like that.
Brother, we bought this for the shoot. Listen to me, I'll take you to the makeup room now and rehearse you for the role.
Shame on you, shame on you, shame on you.
Come here.
Introduce me to her.
Stop, stop, stop here here!
Thank God you're here, come in, come in.
Boss, the car that you bought for the theater is coming.
Saoud, he'll put everything in, he'll do it.
We'll do it again, and the assistant director is here to watch and make sure the director is happy.
Imagine yourself as a well-known merchant.
Are you saying this?
Ah, ah, I'll eat you, wait, wait, don't be in a hurry, I didn't expect that from you. Oh! (Abu Abdul Aziz), tell me, are you Abu Abdul Aziz?
For our rights.
Sweet, and you need to know!
Take care of your health, brother.
He will do a cleanup and complete the full name Abu Abdul Aziz Falah Al-Marzook, Lovely.
Sweet, keep going, keep going and think.
Consider your daughter as divorced.
Don't bother yourself about the reason for her divorce.
Your daughter is divorced, is she beautiful? Is she beautiful?
It's a sentence, go live your life, we're not getting married.
Why did he swallow it?
Shuweik, you're Shuweik and he memorized everything, Shuweik.
The dentist is cleaning my teeth.
How? Why?
Man, the homeowners are rushing us and they want the living room, and the director feels like finishing the scenes in the living room and then we'll shoot the outdoor scenes.
What is this? They don't buy %PW!
Yes, they want to, they want to, but it's been postponed for another time. They'll go shoot another scene, and we'll follow them, God willing.
Shall I tell them to bring you some tea?
Peace be upon you.
And peace be upon you.
Good morning, Sir.
Hello, which tribe are you from, boy?
My name, sir, is Salem Abu Shwei Al-Ashwi.
* * Alcohol is famous.
You deserved it.
You're stingy, my nose is big and my lips can fit in here too.
Tell me, my brother, about the people of the Daniq.
I'm holding myself.
If it were someone else, they wouldn't stop laughing.
Put this down for a minute.
Hello, Mama.
Mom is very sick, I need to go quickly, brothers!
You will wear those clothes.
I don't have time, I told you my mother is sick, she is very sick and he says!
Listen, you can leave like this, but when I call you, you have to come immediately.
Here and I can't leave the place.
Oh, oh, let's try to find a taxi, brother.
What's a taxi? If you try to look for a taxi for a year, you won't find one.
You know we rented the car for the weekend.
Since it's broken, take it.
Yowe oh! Brother, please give me the key. Mom is sick, give me the key, give it to me.
In the psych ward.
I need a wheelchair.
Slowly, slowly, I'll bring a wheelchair now, now, my sheikh!
Let me tell you something, let me tell you something?
My mother is very sick in the car and I need a wheelchair, please.
Where is the market? In the car?
Yawi! Ya waladi, ish da'al?
Be quiet and don't speak, just watch and remain silent.
Peace be upon you.
No mistake, but my mother, madam, has a name, quickly.
I'll have them make the bed.
Oh, oh.
Don't torture yourself.
God help you, what have you done?
So cool! Rashid.
Our son Rashid served us.
How are you, are you coming with me, Mr. Rashid?
Learn with me, Sir Rashid.
Take Mr. Rashood and do what's necessary.
This is expected from you.
I'll make sure the nurse comes to see you. What would you like to drink, Mr. Alaa?
Learn with me, Sir Rashid.
I'm sorry.
I don't do it as much as some people, but wait!
The problem is that no one is paying attention to us.
Sir, would you like tea, coffee, or cappuccino?
You're not the first; Nasser, who was discharged from the hospital, married a Filipino woman.
Who told you I refused?
No one is giving me attention.
They philosophize and demand.
He doesn't have any qualifications, you didn't start your mother, what's this, you didn't start your mother! Go and bring your friends.
Oh brother, there's a girl in the hospital, I love her.
If I neglect you, look for someone else.
I can't, my brother, the heart is broken.
My brother lives for love, do you believe it? When I see her
Take this to Dr. Mohammed.
What do you have!
He went now.
May God damn you.
Hazarati, our aunt is now living in perfect health.
You're a professional actor, Saud. You guys later!
Look, see how they applaud you and praise you.
Now, go and change your clothes and remove your makeup.
Come on, man, forget it. Come cry to me here first.
Yes, from now on, my name is Falah Al-Marzook.
He forgot this and wrote Saud.
Saad, may God have mercy on him, has passed away.
From now on, my name is Fahad Al-Marzouk, Abu Abdulaziz.
God bless you, my sweet.
One buffet!
I did two.
I heard one of the bride's relatives say, "Wow, they are so classy. I don't think anyone can do something like what they did at the wedding."
It's over, sweetheart. Bye-bye.
Look at this, Mama.
I have to bring them a gift on the occasion of my wedding contract signing.
What job, mom?
Look at your brother who is bringing us shame!
Yawy, da khayb, 'ala ay hal da rakhis. (Translation: Yawy, it's bad, anyway it's cheap.)
But this works within our budget.
Leave this for the servants to eat.
He wants to make us laugh.
I saw her too.
This is the free-for-all category, this is for the upper class.
Almost above average.
No, we want something unusual, something that not everyone can afford.
Pardon me, ma'am, you can't teach someone who doesn't know their own abilities (like me).
Shut up, but shut up you don't have anything.
I'm afraid the amount I have isn't enough.
Graduation's done, pay with the credit card.
What is this drum, it's very well made.
Yesterday, Saleh signed his marriage contract.
Salih Nasser!
I am at your disposal, I am at your service.
Coming for you.
They reserved the small basketball court and the food was terrible.
Expensive is cheap.
What she said about the happy wedding.
Certainly, everyone is saying the same thing.
These don't scare me!
My dear sister,
He's only interested in money.
She doesn't care what people say.
He wants to make us laugh.
We intend to bring something within our budget and circumstances.
Do you know that some people borrow money, sell their homes and cars just to have a lavish wedding and prevent people from talking about them?
Let's make do, and the cheap chocolate is enough to almost embarrass us.
I said the director was impressed by the Chinese food and took some home.
Sweet, if the bride's family said we could choose the ballroom and stage and prepare everything ourselves.
And it makes us think of taking something!
No, not everything, but the store we've been to before has very reasonable prices.
In turn, this shop was where A'il designed Abu Thahban's wedding.
Has anyone used it before?
Frankly, once.
At the wedding of His Highness Sheikh Mubarak's daughter.
No, no, no, we don't need anything used.
I need a platform that we'll be the first in the world to use.
You want to excel.
Show me what you've got.
This stage will be used for the first time in Qatar.
Inspired by the information revolution like Facebook and Twitter.
Very new and updated.
How much does this platform cost with the other equipment?
I'll calculate it for you now, but it's not less than one hundred and fifty thousand.
Mama, mama, this way our money isn't enough. Everything is expensive, the best and most unique things cost more.
Everyone does that.
Please, mute.
What's the decision?
Understood, you like that?
This is Noah's Ark.
They are all new, but Noah's ship is thirty thousand more expensive.
No, God bless your parents, I think the mouse stage is much better.
"No, I don't need Noah's Ark."
These are wedding expenses. Anyway, we consider ourselves average.
Do I have to pay a deposit of one hundred and fifty thousand and the full amount of one hundred and fifty thousand for the royal suite that you call that?
What you said is true, but why this appearance and everyone trying to see each other and everyone trying to improve on what they've done.
What is the Battle of Pride and what are its benefits except for wedding shop owners?
Whoever knows everyone wants to be special, exploits us and lies to us.
I swear, I know one of my friends who says his brother has a wedding shop.
He said that the cost of the play would not exceed two thousand riyals.
I'm sorry for this moment when his parents are causing a scene.
Certainly, do something.
Just like other men who get married and let their wives control them.
Hello, Your Highness.
How are you?
I know you're a lover of excellence.
He wants you to call him.
For the first time in Qatar, designed by international artist Peter Salomon.
A collection inspired by the nine planets.
I am from the solar system.
It'll be great at the Noah's Ark stage.
No more, you will be the first in Qatar to use the nine planets.
And the people.
It was one hundred and fifty thousand, and today?
And the people.
May God have mercy on you.
As you wish.
Too many expenses, my brother.
In succession, we couldn't take all eighty thousand.
All I could gather was sixty thousand, and I took twenty thousand from my brother.
Thank you, thank you very much, my brother Fahd.
How can I do things, Fahad? Our family doesn't want to appear at the wedding. Dina is in trouble.
Without any showing off.
Certainly, you will receive the invitations you want.
What, this week God willing I'll start making calls.
That our wedding will be better than theirs.
Mom, look at the claims my son chose for the wedding.
Where does my brother live?
People want to travel to countries just to embroider their invitations.
Unlike Amina's family, they went to Italy to design their invitation, print it, and come back. Also, Munira's family,
They go to France, even those who are not rich, they go to Lebanon to make their deposits.
The system works like that in the country, do we want to be different?
Therefore, which country do you intend to travel to?
We received wonderful invitations.
Truly, it's expensive, but...
It's unique and no one has done it before.
I don't like her.
"Gold is better, it shines."
Oh brother, if he can't afford the wedding costs,
He doesn't get involved in this matter.
And they abandoned all this showing off and boasting at the wedding and all these expenses that are of no benefit.
Who benefits from our madness? It's the hotels and wedding planners.
That's him, he's out, I want him.
Wish they'd pick it up, maybe someone will find it and take it.
Tell me, that's Red.
Thank you, Abu Nasser.
Brother, the bride's family should support you.
I tried once, just once.
I said there's no need for a dance club in a very well-known hotel.
"Why, I found our daughter in the street, and no one was looking after her."
That's the problem, everyone sees each other.
Who told you I was married?
At least they don't have this apathy.
It's just a matter of a few shekels for a party and some small expenses.
Welcome, my friend! Today is Facebook wedding day.
Cheaper and less costly.
You won't marry someone from your country.
Forget it, do you want me to go crazy?
You'll see.
If I don't get Abdullah Roaished or Nawal for my son's wedding.
On her, she won't be better than me.
I wanted to ask you something, sweetheart.
If you have your daughter's number, please give it to us so we can get in touch with her.
Hello my love, thank you very much, goodbye.
Mom agreed to the DJ, why did you change your mind?
Is Nassor better than me?
Who are you and who am I?
The people who were below us have become better than us.
That's not the case, Mom, but look at my brother Saleh. He broke my heart and they're just letting him get away with it like this.
Truly, you broke my heart.
Monster!
In the hospital! When and which hospital.
I don't know, she just suddenly fell.
I heard this and fell.
He has no redeeming qualities and no one can defend him, especially after she got back everything and people found out. He just said he doesn't like weddings.
He wants to humiliate us.
What did the doctor say?
He's criticizing us; he wants to call off the wedding.
Hoping everything will be fine.
Don't break her heart.
Oh my son! You are a man and you are a family.
He went, he went and left her.
I swear, if you tell Abu Yusuf this, his heart will stop beating.
You know why the minister is still alive until now, Abu Youssef.
Accordingly, he should have retired three or four years ago.
There's nothing wrong with him, he's going to help me.
I swear, you're crazy.
See, I don't want it now?
And you'll let him hide the papers and the evidence until you get the money back.
They call it amount cooling postponement.
I'm not going in, and I know why you're panicking.
There's nothing to worry about, and I'll eventually pay you back.
Do they know what they're saying about me, do they know what they're saying about me?
Disciplined, disciplined.
Uncle, uncle, I tried, but there's no other way.
If I give it to you, then the reviewers.
They're difficult to review, they'll take me, quickly, quickly.
Secretly, the tablet, the tablet, the tablet.
I ate, I ate the tablet.
No, no, God willing, from seven-thirty we'll be in the ballroom to receive guests.
No, we will definitely be there.
I will throw a wedding for my son, and it will be the talk of the town.
Surprise!
Oh, sweet Fatima, I'll talk to you later.
I'm afraid they'll envy you.
What's up, Mom? Is the coat long enough?
The police are here!
I hope there are no mistakes.
%Pw police, but I'm here and I'm lost.
God is sufficient for you, O Sluoh.
Forgot about your wedding.
The marriage jailer, now you'll enter the prison jailer.
Look at the document I hid from you for the loan, and now hurry up and show it to me.
Why are you angry!
You'll hear a lot of disasters from this.
What do we say after that!
A respectful and dedicated employee
Out of love for his work, the ministry has contracted a company to perform maintenance.
The client, passionate about his work, went to inquire about the materials.
He knows 400 thousand.
He saves the ministry one million six hundred thousand.
And they punished the minister! No, no, no, I can't see it.
How can you trust him!
Here is Saad.
He certainly has all the news.
Fire him.
What happened to the world? Where are the values?
He told me that it was normal for the director to be in his office.
He told him, "Take it and work on it instead of Uthman."
And who is this?
She's the daughter of the manager of the same company that offered the maintenance deal.
Ayh Osman Kashif.
No, no, no, no, this is unbelievable.
You're always amazing, Saleh!
Whose company is this?
For whom?
Let's do that!
You're kidding!
What is it about what I'm saying? This poor employee Uthman, what a step!
Blame the one who is frank and honest!
Do you think your boss is in his office?
Yes, he left a while ago.
What's wrong with the world!
We started seeing strange people.
I agree with you, Uthman doesn't deserve it, but there's nothing we can do about it (proverb).
What is fair, my lord, he has seven sons and doesn't have a passport.
He's going to regret this action! What will he want to do now and where will he want to go?
Do you know what happened?
The new client whom the minister used.
I entered Uthman's office and started working. Poor Uthman came to take his things, she prevented him and told him to go, and she would send his things with the tea boy.
Where are you from?
Reverse the engine, Osman?
This is the prize!
This is God's will (proverb).
God bless the Most High, the Almighty.
God Almighty is generous, O Uthman. God will not abandon you in difficult times.
What's wrong with you? You're not talking normally!
I know you're very sensitive.
What a job! I can't work, I'm retiring now.
And this is a chance to visit my mother and to bring you some things from home.
You shouldn't stay angry like that.
Why are you shouting at me? I'm your mother.
I'm not shouting at you, I'm asking you.
So cute, are you walking with him? Is he your husband, father, or brother?
The world has changed, where have you been living?
I don't know, Mama!
You're crazy.
People are liberated, the world has become a small village, where do you live!
But say it, Shiloh!
Be modern, live in the present, and don't be retro.
Get the stuff out of the car quickly! Go, don't look back and lock it.
Carry it, Saleh. What do you have?
No, you're not sweet today.
You shouted at the poor maid, it wasn't her fault.
I know I didn't mean it.
No, no, no, I'm not hungry.
Why did I forget the disasters I saw?
My love, don't cry.
The boss is a bit angry.
Honor us, Your Excellency.
Thank you, thank you very much.
And he lived a life of struggle, effort, and perseverance.
Correct, wow.
The most important thing
The most important thing for me in this ministry
Indeed, sir!
Tell me, what's the point of an employee who doesn't take bribes?
It's false.
That's what I want all of you.
There is no place for the honest and those with eroded principles and values.
If you ever stumble
He's just going to embarrass himself.
The quality is right as long as the reaction is!
That's why I want you to cooperate with me.
If you have doubt
Tell me.
We are thieves and sons of thieves, and no one shares our sisters.
If Nora doesn't take a bribe one day, she steals government tea before going home.
Excellent, excellent, bravo. That's what you're expecting from him, he doesn't solve them alone like that, but you all solve them like that.
God bless you.
That's why I want you to leave the procurement department and become my office manager.
Frankly, you know how to pick, you've chosen the right thief for the right place.
Enough, Umm Saud, enough. Don't torture me anymore.
I don't want to live in a prison.
But God is sufficient, and He has seduced me and made honesty appealing to me.
And he told me to be honest.
You are a father.
Why bother with honesty and integrity?
All your life, you've been a thief and a con man.
It's still sweet that I haven't reconciled.
Let me talk to your father.
Never repeat it.
What must be on the straight path, he buys, steals, and is hypocritical to live in peace.
Abu is in prison because all his money is illegal.
Enough, enough.
This is something you wear!
We are a respectable family.
Shame on you.
What are your plans?
Why is it exposed?
You don't seem shy, you're devoid of shame.
I see my brother's shy clothes.
Aren't there any shy girls nowadays?
Why are you crying?
Look at what your daughter is wearing!
Would a kind lady like her wear something like that?
Will you walk in the street alone without revealing any part of your body?
I saw her, she doesn't listen to what I say.
I don't like supporting here.
I bought her some see-through clothes with nothing underneath.
I warn you, if I ever see you anywhere below the knee,
Until you understand the situation, don't blame me for the results.
Here you are, God bless you.
Hopefully, he is a player and a disruptor.
He is like his father.
However you look at it,
He is a very kind man, how can we find someone like him.
Don't be afraid, Uncle, I want to.
I am a good man. Honestly, I love my daughter Sarah very much and I care about her future.
After we heard about it.
Praise be to God, she has a very bad reputation.
I arrived home at 3:30 a.m.
I arrived home at 5 a.m.
Hello, hello, hey! Hello.
Take me out of the bar.
Start your car's engine and come pick me up from the bar.
This is the first time we've seen Abu Yima disobey his children.
Enough, Daddy. Start your car, I've paid for it.
Mary likes you.
I love you too, I've grown, grown, grown.
Basically, basically, Dad, Papa is here.
Who is it?
He is brave, unlike my father who doesn't enjoy it.
To introduce you to my friend Majd
Dad, Abdulaziz was my ex-friend.
Welcome, come in, this is a golden opportunity.
Arab and Jewish gambling
I discovered that many Palestinians don't cut their fingernails.
According to what the State of Palestine adheres to in the comprehensive peace agreement,
In any case, the United Nations is gathering today to discuss Israel's request to send special inspection committees to examine Palestinian fingers.
Let's see if their nails are long or not.
His condition was that there should be nothing that cuts, wounds, or draws blood.
State of Palestine
I call on the entire international community to visit Palestine.
From the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.
Made of cork.
And olives, man.
We press the olives like this, we press the olives like that.
We and our Arab brothers demand the international community
To form an inspection committee for Palestinian nails.
And today, shall we begin with the voting?
No, no, no, no, it hasn't come to that, no.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Salih, Salih, what's wrong with you?
What did you dream?
I dreamed of the upside-down world.
Oh Rashid, you need to have a strong personality!
Now, brother, this school that you will work at tomorrow is number?
I am a teacher like you.
Why did I change my school since I started working as a teacher?
What character, brother?
The problem is that his personality is weak.
In turn, the teachers with him, they complained about it.
To this extent, brother.
That's why you see him calm.
After that, he started teaching.
It wasn't ketchup, it was mayonnaise with %Pw.
Oh brother, we're not talking to you to let you go!
We're telling you because this is your last chance.
In truth, Rashid, he has a weak personality.
He is mean, yet kind.
He is still a citizen.
Why are you so quiet, brother?
Because everything you say is true.
Everything you say is true.
From tomorrow,
Mr. Rashid is new here.
Sir Rashid,
You're right.
Just forget about it.
And from tomorrow
Yeah, it's annoying and then what?
Here I'm telling you
I'm a teacher, I don't like mistakes.
We say a boy jumped and told you the same thing another boy said at your previous school and the supervisor there.
Lock your cupboard!
Patience, patience, you'll break the door down.
Sweet, one learns from their mistakes.
From the first minute,
Here I'm telling you
I'm angry.
Ali!
That's us!
It seems he just said, "Shut up!"
Did you hear him?
Tell him that Mr. Rashid fired me.
It seems he said what he had to say, but he'll see, he won't see your face here in class.
Teacher, don't you have any information about him?
Whose son is he?
Here, sir, Rashid is coming.
Did you see him?
The problem is that if he tells his father.
So, where do you see him going, does he go during break time?
You might find him sitting in the chair area.
Above the chairs.
Chairs, chairs.
By the end of the day, you are human.
But you shouted at me!
My friend and they are laughing, you are laughing at me.
Dad is outside and he will return next week, and if he returns, I will tell him.
No, no, no, no, Abdurrahman, may God protect you.
Me, me friends. Anyway, the strawberry ice cream is very popular, you might not have tried it. It has a slight bitterness, but it's amazing.
Sweet, go get it quickly.
I see that he's afraid to tell his father.
She said that his father is abroad.
So, he's out of the country, his father won't come back? That means they took his father's job and fired him!
I hope there won't be serious consequences.
You carried his bag and got him food, you gave him your phone number, and you told him, "If you need anything, call me. I'm your friend."
Yeah, just.
Yes, but what?
You're the ones who told me.
Shout and pretend you are strong.
Bathroom, bathroom, bathroom.
Ohhhhhhhh
Sleep, stop sleeping, stop sleeping, you won't regret it, sleep.
Mr. Abu Nasser, Mr. Rashid is in the bathroom.
One juice, please.
Learn here, learn here, learn here, learn here, give me.
Go, quickly.
Put them on the table.
All people are equal.
That's why I brought you, to hear your opinions about the party.
Who can guarantee a child?
This is going to get us into trouble. That's him, he's crying.
At three o'clock.
Yeah, hello. It's a holiday, God doesn't laugh.
Faster, faster.
Peace be upon you.
Stand up for the opener, sit down.
Yes, you're right.
Professor, come here, please come here, Professor.
Are you done screaming?
I'm not pushing you, man, I'm just asking, are you done yet?
I'm done, where is the teacher's dignity? By doing this, you are degrading yourself and the teaching profession.
Oh, oh, okay, okay.
And you're raising your voice too?
Yes, I'm raising my voice, first you need to know who this boy is?
Faster, faster.
Just two cars.
Five cars, no, no, I want four or five cars. Spacious, spacious, we have enough space. Go, go, go.
He thinks he owns the neighborhood!
Abu Nasser used to do that, and no one else did.
"May God help him."
I am the principal of this school.
Known About Abu Nasser
Used to offer all teachers extra classes.
Except me.
Who is the principal of the school here?
You are the school principal, God guide you, what do you have?
Stop your leg.
You've got it all wrong, she's on the chair, brother!
What does "بتيMean" mean?
No need, I swear I just want to make you comfortable.
What do they call it?
So what should I do with you now?
Act in your best interest, and you will learn extra lessons whether you like it or not.
You have no shame, go, go, go, get out!
Sweet, this is out.
However you like, we told you, man.
We need to put him in his place.
Wait, people, wait.
Don't be a burden on us, Abu Salmin.
Oh Abu Nif, you are the neighborhood chief and you need to stop him from going too far.
I am my father's son.
See what you will do with him.
Faster, faster.
Goodbye, sir.
Wow, when did Grandpa buy this car?
I told you, but you didn't believe me.
He trimmed his mustache and his face turned red.
Don't believe what he's saying; I knew him as soon as I heard his voice.
Did you know he sent me a week ago?
In other words, he is responsible for eight schools for girls and boys.
What is this magical secret? Ask him to tell you, what is the secret that got him out of the bottom!
Here, I've been telling you for just one day.
I don't want to hear any noise when I'm studying.
And don't breathe.
Respect yourself.
And you too, answer me, you too, argue with me. Get out of my face, get out, out, out.
You don't have an appointment with the minister, look for a good job that suits you.
Don't tell me you're taking this job.
Either the other job, there's no brother giving me options, different jobs and I'll choose the most suitable job.
My brother is a minister!
I swear, the call I received is what's keeping me alive.
Everyone is congratulating me.
What are they going to do, Mama? God guides you.
This is a very common practice. Every minister uses his friends and acquaintances automatically.
I'm not afraid of anyone, I know myself.
They know I'm going to be a minister.
Ha, you're kidding me, that's embarrassing.
What will come to us, a treasure, a quiet treasure that opens to us.
The big earth
Let's go, each one of us will go thank the new minister.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Congratulations, Mr. Minister.
"By the blessing of your honor, congratulations."
Congratulations to Your Highness, you deserve it.
You deserved it, Mr. Minister.
O brothers, the responsibility is great, O Allah, help us bear it.
What's said, you're very qualified for this job (like me).
I saw, then Abu Saleh's phone rang.
It was far from him.
Forgot it.
I'm surprised to see how much they love him now.
And Abu Sultan is not stupid.
Yes, I opened the car door for him.
Bravo, you've done a lot!
We are proud that our brother became a minister.
I told you, Mama, but don't believe it.
You were saying this is coffee talk, coffee talk.
After her husband died, she told me she had envied him.
In the name of God, In the name of God
Yes, you have a shell, you don't have anything.
Mom, let's go, I've had enough.
What do you mean it's none of your business?
You just need to rest.
I distracted them because Kyle made me angry.
Yes, they are right.
But I didn't want to say that in front of Mom, you know Mom will tell everyone.
She says anything she hears, they call her the strainer, we don't want a scandal.
So what guarantees do you have that he is outside the authority and will not manipulate his position?
Because I asked.
If he's out of the office, you'll be the first candidate.
What guarantees do you have that they will approve it?
No, I'm very sure about this.
I won't give it to you. Since you saw it outside the office like that, I won't give it to you now in front of you.
Why are you going to do magic?
The plan in my head is clear and effective.
The plan is to burn it and kick it.
He attends every event that takes place in the country.
Now he's going to be fired, and when he's fired, he'll be out of a job. And when he's out of a job, he'll be done for.
I swear, bro, I don't know how and I don't know how to tell you!
Your visit is called participation, reflecting how much you love your country.
Do you think so?
Today, you are a state official, you must always be present.
You have to participate in everything, sorry, sir, sorry, sorry.
Before I forget, thank you for the sheep you fixed for me yesterday.
Oh sir, it's just a sheep, it's not your place. Let me ask you sir, will you come with me today?
The man is waiting for you outside!
Frankly,
I don't want to go.
I am sick, I am sick of honor, I am sick of it.
You are the minister today, he is right. As he said, you are a social figure, do honor to yourself!
God sent you this kind man.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Don't take pictures of me.
Take, take.
Today I'm taking him to a poetry night and a wedding, and they took at least a hundred pictures of him.
I'll tell you about something very beautiful they took from him.
Listen, I've also prepared a nice educational activity for you.
That's it. Make it shine, I want it to shine, to sparkle, to gleam until it's extraordinary. I'm searching for that gleam.
Thank you, seller. Congratulations to you, congratulations to you, blessed bicycle. Picture, picture, sir. Take a picture, take a picture. I didn't take my picture, I'm far away, take it.
This is the theoretical degree.
A blessed and auspicious beginning, the peace of the noble one is conveyed.
Picture, picture like that. You're fat, fat sir.
Sure, God bless you.
Go to page two.
No, he doesn't know him.
Let's participate nationally.
Say "Mashallah."
This is my fourth friend who visits me today.
Everyone praises your activities; Um Khalid calls you the energetic social activist.
Yesterday, I heard a word that hurts me.
The party that Abu Sultan took me to yesterday.
A victory party for the young children in swimming.
He would tell his friend,
They thought I hadn't heard them.
He said, "This is the minister."
I want to buy a birthday present for my cousin.
Hello, hello.
I see you, sir, every day in the newspaper.
True, true
I came with light, to ease everything you desire.
Praise be to God.
Don't hesitate to consult with your ministers.
Ana, Ana Abo Saleh, the minister.
Abu Sultan is not coming to put us in our place, I sent him away.
And he sat me in the front row, then went to the car to rest.
We don't need anyone, may God guide you.
Please, madam, may God bless your parents. I will knock on your door again to confirm.
And you're calling yourself.
People are losing on us.
I told you.
This job is wonderful.
But this man is going to kill me!
The minister made me so angry, may God harm him.
Hello, hello Your Excellency the Minister.
No, I'm just a bit tired today.
God willing, if you're that enthusiastic, I'm with you.
I don't have the means to help you, but your brother Saad is the one who will accompany you and assist you, and I hope he finds you a party or something.
Then, a party?
No, no, we don't have any activities today.
No, we don't have it.
Yeah, is this where we come?
A. Yes, thank you, thank you.
Is there a limit to how much I can ask?
"God bless your eyes" (or more idiomatically, "Oh my eyes!")
Sleep and rest.
A little happiness.
Even the nights of joy?
What is this guy?
And there might be some extra time.
Take it! Put it in the cabin and look for a photographer to take his picture.
Oh, oh, bye-bye.
What did he find it for?
I don't know, some minor league game. Leave him alone at the stadium!
What is this! This is the minister teaching us!
Sweet, that means he reached the top.
It's a very similar situation to what happened with the people.
Hozrati, he has become more famous than you.
If you go to a place and take Abu Saleh with you,
Oh, sir!
The star shines.
We're going to shrink it and bring it back to its normal size.
The minister is coming, coming, coming. The minister is coming.
Don't take a picture! Don't take a picture! I swear if any of you take my picture, I'll sue. I'm not coming out.
Break their cameras, they won't take pictures.
She sends you her greetings.
They say I missed the train.
I missed you, brother.
There is no power or strength except from Allah.
Why is this?
This is the first time I've seen him.
The first time I've seen him!
It's the first time I've seen him in years.
Oh God.
Is this Khaled's?
I haven't seen you in a long time, why are you here, my darling?
What can we do? He's very passionate about it.
There is no power or strength except from Allah, you keep repeating the same topic.
Exit, exit and don't occupy my head. I came back from the wedding at 3 a.m.
Just let me rest and don't make a mess for me.
Your sister is a girl.
I swear I'll tell my father. Look at yourself, you look like a girl.
Delilah, he was playing, he was playing.
Yeah, he was playing, I'm telling you, he was playing with the makeup palette.
And this is Saud. I know what to do with him.
Poor خالد, I hope all children are like him.
About these campaigns and the haze he creates about his brother.
Come here, my dear brothers, come and say hello.
How are you, dear?
I'm not going to Spain this summer, sweetie.
Who are you talking to?
Cheetahs from Kuwait.
Hello, Hamada!
Listen to what he says.
There is no power or strength except from Allah.
I'll let dear Amals choose for herself.
Good luck, what do you think?
I say the one overlooking the sea is better.
In the near future, if we buy a yacht, we will go directly from our home to the sea.
Us and our children.
You need to make a decision about the wedding date.
No problem, it's just a year and a few months.
What I have with your brother is that he uses too much perfume.
Amal is getting married, I saw Khalid her brother, I don't understand.
He is very different from your brother Saad.
Different or not, my dear, everyone is free in their actions.
And your fiancé is conservative, he doesn't know that there are mixed perfumes.
Your fiancée keeps her opinion to herself!
I'm jobless.
I can't see Khalid!
What is your go-to perfume as girls?
You even use their colors.
Why are you doing this, Khalid?
Truthfully, you won't say anything.
Mom, why don't you believe in anything about him? Don't you see his actions and behavior?
Now perfumes won't distinguish between a boy and a girl.
Here, I want to scare you.
Did you see the Bluetooth?
I heard about it from my friends at the council; they say it's very common in Doha.
I've heard about it, show us.
You need to see her and then tell me.
Look how this girl dances!
Look at the moves!
These are girls! Look at this one who says she dances well and does moves, do you know who she is? She's Khalid Mohammed's cousin's daughter.
Your aunt has Khaloud's blood.
Cool, you'll see what I want to do to him.
His brother Saad is waiting now.
Why? Bring him here and you'll see, bring Saad here! I'll send it via Bluetooth so his family can see it.
Peace be upon you.
Peace be upon you, hello, hello.
Of course, you lost.
Why is my aunt's daughter sitting so far away?
Turn off your Bluetooth.
No, I'll just send you something.
No, thank you, Amira.
He ran away from his family.
Are you crazy, Saad?
I will travel with you tomorrow.
You won't see my face in this country.
"Where are you going alone?" (Idiom)
What are people saying?
They will say that their son has left and traveled, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
Oh, really?
And what you have done, your son Khalid, is honor and glory!
A man turning into a woman, is that a scandal?
What can I do if people say this is the brother of the gay guy?
Tell him Ayesha is for medicine, for study, for work, even to kill herself.
The most important thing is that I don't live in a place where scandal follows me every day.
Oh, you want to go?
I don't have a job where I'm going.
This is the end.
The other thing we know where it is, and this one here is packing his suitcase to travel.
No one knows where he's going.
What did you expect from him?
Are you okay with me? I came to you to find comfort, and you're throwing harsh words at me that break my heart.
I was telling you to preserve it.
What you leave with the servants.
You didn't have any information about it and you were busy.
And your father is busy with his work and left the responsibility to you.
You corrected Mom.
Is there no hope for your sister?
In this, you are correct.
What Khalid did has brought us shame among the people.
I don't want anyone.
Did you tell him anything?
Your biggest flaw is your impulsiveness.
I don't have any problem at all with Khaled.
We didn't tell him.
In a CD and give it.
Only when I go to the airport.
I care about him a lot.
Our house doesn't look good, oh no! {Amal.}
Don't be amazed.
Khaled and his companions don't care about their family's reputation.
And the reputation of their brothers and sisters
What did religious values call them to?
And they go dance and have fun.
In the evil lake
Good Lord, my son, I am in doubt.
Deposits, Papa
Hit yourself, my son.
Softly, daddy, I have a little gift for you, daddy.
A gift for me!
Now he's putting the CD into the laptop, I'm scared of what will happen, come with me!
Yes, Mom.
My dad won't be able to see the disk anymore, he's too short, only three minutes.
I hope he goes out.
How is the weather today? There's not enough time to go out.
Answer me, what do you have, Abu Saad?
Father!
"Well done, workers!"
Even if you search, you'll lose.
When we find someone who shares your morals.
Leave me alone.
May God help you.
I see you going up to the roof!
Yes, my love.
We live in an age of freedom.
The age of human rights, and no one has control over us.
If anyone has a real, they can get a thousand, my dear.
Certainly I can handle that. God bless America my love.
Do you know that salaries are high now?
It's one thousand two hundred.
God help you, when you speak to a driver and ask him, "What is your salary?"
My salary is very low.
In my opinion, he started complaining, my salary is wasted and there's no benefit. We agreed with him that his salary would be seven hundred and we increased it by a hundred when he got the license. What's more wonderful than that?
I told him, once you complete one year of work, we'll increase your salary.
He seems greedy and we'll have problems with him.
Stop, stop, just shut your mouth, just shut up, just shut up, return it and get rid of it.
This is easy for you, this is easy.
So you're just going to let him bother you? I hate going in the car with him.
In my handwriting, leave it to me.
You know the story now, I'm the man of the house. Enough, stop, you too enough, I'll do it.
Come, I want you outside, come on!
Learn and stop.
What did I tell you?
I said your friends shouldn't come to your room. Did I say that or not?
The boss of this is not my friend, he's my uncle.
He will come in five minutes and leave, God willing.
Five minutes!
Keep it in mind!
Don't tell my lady I want a raise, I want a raise!
Everything in the world is expensive now.
And why did I give you eight hundred?
Oh boss, I have a lot of problems at home.
The drivers' families in Doha earn one thousand one hundred, one thousand two hundred.
And it could be one thousand three hundred.
Wait, Hana is thinking.
Listen, he's raising a hundred percent, and I'm silent, I won't talk to you.
You're not a child anymore, go to work!
What did he say?
I'll tell you.
What's the use of water?
What's the use of two hundred?
I'll make you a screen.
Why are you afraid?
All the drivers fled.
Because they work outside for three or four thousand.
What's the problem? Working at home is not beneficial, but working outside brings in more money.
I'm very scared.
Look at this, they're all drivers.
How much?
One thousand five hundred.
But I'm afraid of the police who will catch me and put me in jail.
No, don't be afraid.
I guarantee you.
I was wearing my abaya and wanted to go out.
I was a fool, and now no one answers me.
He opened his room and the safe was empty.
Muna was a slave who escaped for an entire year.
I will only say, God is sufficient for him.
Sweet, I'm coming to you.
I went to the police.
If he made a decision, he wouldn't have any responsibility.
We'll make everything possible.
And you, too, can see him and inform us while you're out and about in the neighborhood.
Yes, he'll open up his money, and when he's satisfied, he'll hand himself over.
We bring them, we spend on them, we provide them with clothes, food, and driving lessons.
It's not in his hands.
The match is starting now, come in, come in, it's better.
Yes, we were worried.
These are the books, and the book is not easily caught.
I know that if we don't put in more than three, it means we won't win. We need ten or fifteen.
That's a clear mockery, a clear mockery. Let's be clear, that's a clear mockery.
He had a great season. If he doesn't join the Foxes, it will be a big mistake.
Take it from me.
In us, in the players, and in the performance.
They have nothing, they should thank God if they scored less than three, they should thank God.
What's the point of this, it's just a consultation. Our team is still hungry, this is the Foxes team, please leave us alone.
You know you can let go of your goal right now, you're relaxed and happy now.
Do you think there are other goals or is this it?
This fox is very good, it's very smart. It goes here and there and no one can catch it, you'll feel dizzy. This fox eats chickens.
No, I don't have a car.
You are my friend.
Did you see what he said?
He said that this fox is very problematic.
You can't catch him.
Yes, sir.
Do you know him or not?
He is a fan of the Foxes team.
Sometimes he appears on a show where you furnish yourself.
They are winning today and you are losing.
I swear to hit you. The Foxes team never loses, it's always the winner.
Fox, I want to know your opinion about the result today?
Why are you asking me about the result?
Complete, the foxes are the winners.
The birds came to take their food while flying.
Let's be realistic, don't say the Foxes won and flew away.
Hello, this is my friend's writing.
These two took the chicken and ate it.
I didn't see what your honor did to the professor.
The audience can't stop laughing at him.
Clearly at the stadium and thank you for listening.
The real reference who has true loyalty to the club.
He walks with the luxurious Qatari woman who walks in malls and places like that.
Put me on a cappuccino.
What a strange world, man!
The boy gave me five hundred riyals and paid the bill.
Tell us the poem you wrote about our match with the frogs.
Thank you to all the listeners here.
You are a frog.
What makes you shy is that my team defeated you by four.
Talk dirty, talk dirty about the club and the team and see what happens!
You're saying that!
One of the foxes isn't going.
The reason for that is Hakim.
A player was expelled from the Foxes team.
When I changed his name from Hakim to Hammal.
Thank you, thank you, thank you to all the listeners here.
Every month we meet to choose the best fans.
Great, who did you choose for the spotlight this month?
The club board members will decide.
They are not small, each of you is as big as a camel.
I manage this big club. Fox.
Come, come and see the driver who fled from us, he's on television, come.
Is this him?
One will speak well, the other will be silent.
Are you going to make it a pen or a watch?
Now, I know how to tell him.
The audience has left.
Follow him.
Here he comes back.
He was driving fast.
We're hungry now.
Swear!
Shut up, you don't get to decide. I'm the head of the household, and I'm the one who decides.
We need to be sure.
Majid Abdulrahman Al-Subaie
Yes, yes, yes, God bless you.
I am from the Sbaie tribe.
Buy it and register it under my name. No, no, no, no, I don't want to live in it, I already have a house.
I want to invest a little.
Because the investment price is increasing, God bless you.
How can I assist you? Hello, what do you want?
* * May God bless you,
Come on, folks, some coffee?
You have nothing to say, God bless you. You have nothing, God honor you.
You're telling me you're sure, is that normal? You'll embarrass us in front of the elite!
I care a lot.
Mama, mama, I'm mama.
Now, what your father will do with us I don't know.
That's not what I meant, Mom!
Please, Mama, I don't know my father.
Your father is going to turn the house upside down.
I'll definitely kill you right now.
Mom, I didn't break your vow on purpose.
Mom, why don't we buy some glue and stick them together?
What do we need this for, boy?
How can we get something like it? I don't know where your uncle bought it, it was a gift.
I'm afraid of you.
Mom, I'm afraid he's going to hit me.
Close the door until I find a solution to this matter.
Quickly, go to your room.
Blindness, blindness, blindness! Are you blind!
You don't have eyes to break the pot, you don't have eyes?
Mama, isn't Waleed coming to you?
No, oh! Girl, you didn't come. What happened to you?
He ran away from home; he's afraid of his father.
This is not right. They wanted the boy!
"What is this, upbringing? Oh God, guide you, girl!"
What should we do now, Mama?
I don't want to do it!
I don't know, but I'm afraid of cars on the street.
God will protect him, I think he went to the market or went to the neighbors to play with the children.
Yes, he is sweet, kind, and lovable, girl!
No, no my daughter, seek refuge from Satan and there is no sadness, God willing, everything will be fine.
In the name of God, my daughter, my safety.
Where is Wayne?
Daddy is going to hit me.
Grandma, Dad hit me.
Don't make me happy, my dear!
Don't make me happy, my dear.
These are begging you.
I didn't want to break it.
Come, my son, come and drink some water and rest in our room.
Your face turned yellow.
May God guide him, may God guide him. Come with me, my son, a little.
O God of Generosity
I'm afraid my father will come here.
Come on, my son, don't be afraid.
No one participates in raising my children.
This is my son, and I raise him as I please.
But the poor salesman suffered from anxiety, trembling, and panic from something he didn't intend to do.
Why doesn't he have eyes?
Why is he looking!
The girl accidentally hit the pot; my friend didn't want her to do that.
You! You have to support him!
When you tell him anything about me, he begs you. Forgive him this time, his state of fear broke my heart.
Where, where is he now? Why is he here now?
We're not here.
Here! Where?
Enter, enter!
No, no, I'll take her to my brother today.
Why don't you bring something new!
Oh, Nasser, our brother, let's play!
And your mother says you're studying!
Daddy, just this game and then we'll study!
Don't you have an exam tomorrow?
Yes, Daddy.
Stay, daddy, don't leave the game.
Oh dad, try not to take it seriously. Oh, oh dad, we're studying.
You're not saying anything! Listen to me.
If you don't go now, I'll call your uncle Abu Walid.
No, no, no, no. Don't tell my uncle, don't tell my uncle, no!
I don't want it.
I'll make him know that you don't obey me.
He went. Everyone took their book and started studying.
In the name of God, Daddy, put your phone in your pocket, we're going to study, Daddy, but I won't tell Uncle.
Mom, I'm really very confused. I don't know what to do.
I'm afraid that if he finds out, he'll cause us trouble.
Certainly, he will ask me, "Why are you taking him to the hospital?"
What's the problem, if I tell him?
If he knew Waleed was leaving his bed like this.
Oh, Mom, he's the one who wants to take responsibility. It's all his fault.
Oh girl! You have a psychological impact!
The boy is not a child, he is now living on twelve years.
There's nothing. Oh! A girl.
You're going to come with us and I'll give you some hints.
And he changed his mind.
Her mother went to Bahrain to buy abayas.
It's just an excuse, girl.
Fun and shopping.
She says he pees in his bed every night.
My pitbull pees in his bed every night and I don't know why.
He told me I had to take him to the hospital so they could cure him.
Her husband is stupid.
And he understands nothing.
It's true.
They must take him to the hospital, my son! So they can find out what he needs.
While we were playing at the stadium, he was looking for a dry, good hose.
They beat him until the last person in the neighborhood heard the screams.
Sit down!
Eat! Girl, eat.
I didn't say it.
Take it, go quickly, and finish your shower. I'll bring you some clothes. Go!
For you, I'll dust.
I must punish them.
Don't interfere!
Do you see these?
And Khalood got forty-nine out of fifty.
Is this a bus?
Las, their grades are coming along well.
He told them they would be punished if they didn't do fifty out of fifty.
We need to take them to your brother!
They must be punished.
My children
I promise you, Uncle, Uncle, this will be the last time.
When you take fifty from fifty, it's fifty from fifty.
Give him another one.
I tell him, "Don't go to public places with us."
"They prevented him from entering and said to him, 'You are not allowed.'"
You're different, don't come with us.
Run! She punished her brothers.
Stop, Uncle, I'm dying, stop, stop, stop, stop. I'm dying, stop, Uncle.
Your friend punished you.
Keep in mind that this is not a punishment; what you will see at the end of the year if someone among you didn't get fifty.
I'm going to empty the swimming pool.
I will carry her oil.
Where did you see him? Where did you see him?
They said, "This will be ready tomorrow."
Khaled Abdul Rahman.
Sweet! Good job, Khalid.
Ask Abdullah Rashid.
Excellent, Faisal.
God bless you.
You are an outstanding student and you were second in your class.
The teacher cried because he got forty-nine out of fifty in math.
The teacher is afraid of his father because his father wants him to get a perfect score.
Oh my son, I'm talking to you!
Call, call his classmate.
I saw him next to the school gate.
We say goodbye, we say goodbye to your mother, hopefully she is with Grandma.
No, he didn't go there.
What? What?
There is no power or strength except from Allah.
Did he bring it with him, brothers?
Ah, of course he failed and is afraid of his family.
He didn't fail, but he was an exceptional student and came second in his class.
However, he was terrified of going home.
Because he only lost two marks in math.
Rest in peace.
Walid, Walid.
Walid, Walid.
Oh, Walid, come.
Forty-eight, forty-nine, you've lost a point or two, you don't have anything. I won't say anything, I won't scold you or hit you. Walid,
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
and nuclear energy
Which accounts for sixty percent of the world's oil reserves
And Saudi Arabia accounts for 24% of the world's reserves.
Then Libya, the United States, and Nigeria.
three percent each and the rest of the world combined with fifteen percent
Therefore
And also production.
And that's why this could be one of the secrets and reasons why major industrial nations seek to control the region and its countries.
And above them all is the United States of America, which is the largest consumer of oil in the world.
But, oil prices are continuously increasing.
Together with the fall of the US dollar
The one that takes a unit for the price of oil.
Where was yesterday's price for a barrel?
This led to increased income in producing countries and at the same time
To increase inflation why
Where are some of those countries over there where inflation has reached fifteen percent?
The most important source of energy in the world
Price of goods and cost of living
In a direct conversation with the Deputy Prime Minister
Qatar's Minister of Energy and Industry
Abdullah bin Hamad Al Attiyah
For the audience who want to participate, they can contact us on the program's contact numbers.
The kindness of the representative, welcome and more than welcome.
I want to start with you on the unprecedented oil prices that have been reached.
Where could the price be?
Certainly, the surprising question is how far prices might go.
Or what we call market power.
What is non-OPEC?
And not the producing countries?
And it's not just producing countries, OPEC has nothing to do with oil prices.
Is the only relationship in price between supply and demand?
So far, supply and demand don't have much to do with it.
What factors?
There are no other factors besides supply and demand.
What drove the investors.
A feeling of great pressure and turning to oil and gold, or what is known as "commodity marketing."
Investors lost confidence in stock markets.
And gold too.
We've seen gold rise from $350 in recent years to $970 now.
Until today, still, what I mentioned before about one hundred and ninety dollars.
But they are all rising, and even if they fall, it will be a slight decline.
I'll let you know in the first quarter of this year.
It is this second quarter that should see a drop in prices due to reduced demand for oil.
But we saw the market in an exciting state, changing in a strange way.
In the second quarter and at the beginning of springtime, it goes up over a hundred dollars.
But this means that the factors that used to determine the rise in prices in winter and consumption have now changed and new factors have emerged.
and economic growth
And at the same time, we see oil prices rise to this level.
She said you mentioned political factors, and she said political tensions play a role in this matter.
I'm Iranian. I think Fillon's resignation is due to political complexities.
What was once a companion and is now leading most activities of American and world press. It may affect oil prices.
Yes, it's perfect, and today is yes.
Today, we are in the age of globalization and influences come rapidly.
Unreal factors may influence
And create some kind of chaos in the market.
And it also removes some types of political rumors.
He said there was no plan, but he did not rule out other options that could be applied to Iran.
Markets always respond to ambiguity.
Certainly, now there is nothing certain that America is at war with Iran.
And I am one of the people who don't see this scenario.
And maybe what we didn't see here won't happen in the future.
But we, who work in the energy sector
We see that these political tensions
In the world's oil supply
On the other hand, there are very profitable supplies.
This indicates that there is oil coming to the storage.
There is absolutely no shortage of oil supplies.
Perhaps they are preparing for the next war.
In light of this security image I'm talking about concerning provisioning, and there are no obstacles in provisioning.
Whatever President Bush and the United States decide to change their plan.
This is also something else.
Rage is entering my records.
The price of oil may rise.
Global oil reserves
You are here, today the Gulf represents the most importance.
In addition to Iraq, Iran, and other Gulf states
Today they account for more than 60% of oil reserves, and what is certain is
You today
If a very minor accident occurs.
So it indicates.
In other words, in the event of any war with Iran, there will be no guarantee as to how high oil prices will rise.
God knows the day may come, we arrived without.
Wars cost from one hundred and seven to one hundred and ten dollars, and it may increase to one hundred and ten. God knows best.
Today, oil, as I told you, thrives under political and psychological tensions.
And speculators exploited these tensions.
I only invested in oil.
Or what is called a non-investor in real investment of course neither future purchase nor future marketing.
They call it oil and paper.
And all of them are guesses on a piece of paper.
Its total production is around three hundred thousand barrels or less.
That could lead to more purchases than upgrades.
I wish April would be crazy April.
I hope not.
It is said that China is coming to the region, and this is at the top of its agenda.
Chinese is the owner of this project, as many politicians and media personalities have said.
I don't know what's in the Chinese bag.
And I can't imagine what it will be like, I mean.
The cat sat on the mat.
America is in transition.
And why doesn't the son do something else?
Let's see if this happens. If we're talking about April, it's coming up soon, just a few weeks and we'll be in April.
And the world may pay.
America is a major consumer.
In the Gulf countries
The Gulf will be the tough number.
You can't throw this number away.
The cost of their production is very cheap.
Compared to West African countries, most of them rely on...
The Gulf, there is no country in the world that can
We have been hearing this talk from the West and the United States for many years.
Use
until the end, and do you remember the story of the Caucasian War?
What are these two dreams?
What do you think about sitting with the Westerners in a small circle?
You hear them speak in a different way.
What are they saying?
On provisioning, the importance of the region, and the value of stocks.
You shouldn't speak to us in private rooms like that.
soft bread doesn't make a good sandwich
Or as he said in the media: "It's for political reasons."
And of course, there is what they call the double standard or two languages.
The language that unites the Gulf countries.
It has significance today like Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
The largest producer and exporter of oil in the world
And let it enter into him.
Despite all that.
Commander of the Central Region
Starting a war on Iran
No aerial warfare or airstrikes, as they say.
In the supplies
You're not late, you're actually very generous.
I don't agree with what you're saying.
No one deals with Westerners.
We deal with America.
Where are the kind camels?
Regardless of the nationality of this market
Put, meaning non-renewable energy.
(Between parentheses) kindness
Arab hospitality
Come forward and give it to me.
Observers say that the real price of petroleum is...
The rise in oil prices is caused by...
You are citizens of the Gulf, OPEC, and other countries.
You are very generous with Americans. You want to hold on to their currency.
She said that the price of oil should be seventy dollars.
The actual price versus the decline of the US dollar is sixty to seventy.
The price now is one hundred.
One hundred and nine because the dollar dropped by thirty percent.
And now over a hundred dollars.
If we take the ratio and the average.
No one is doubting him.
One of the main reasons
Against the decline of the US dollar
If we took
Comparison
Oil pricing
Because the United States of America
Of course it's in our interest at the moment for the dollar to drop.
A weakness or decline in the American economy, the United States cannot "do anything"
So what led to this weakness and economic recession?
You too
The United States is cutting interest rates on the dollar.
Why do you insist on linking oil to the dollar?
Let's talk about the reason for linking the price of oil to the dollar.
The first one, more than 100 years old.
The first to start producing the first barrel of oil was America.
And they were exported in dollars.
And it has been from the twentieth century until today.
Pricing oil in dollars
Historically, it became
And for a hundred years, the world has been rebelling and setting prices.
And today, Norway is considered the third-largest petroleum producer.
And the export of petroleum.
Russia is the second-largest exporter of oil.
North Sea field production in Europe
Pricing in dollars, not in other currencies.
Everything is changing in the world; there are sources and information that show something different.
You are the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
I have secret agreements between me and the Americans.
And petroleum became the real cover.
Is this right or not?
And agreements
If oil remains the cover for the dollar against the United States, these systems will remain covered.
This is not correct, and there are no secret agreements.
Today here we take Obik.
I have sixty-six percent honorary vice presidents.
Among thirteen countries
Out of the eighty-eight barrels, forty percent are for OPEC.
This is why many large countries produce oil.
Outside the OPEC framework
What are the obstacles to pricing in another currency?
Search for prices in another currency.
It's only when the adults decide.
You, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries, are a star.
Today's OPEC meeting is like every other.
Like 60%
Perhaps what we want is to want to want to
Not all oil-producing countries agree.
There is no direction or intention to change.
What kind of attempt?
But now these countries can't change their currency exchange rates.
Unless there is an agreement between
What is the impact?
Let me talk now about the reason.
They don't export their oil.
From the North Sea or Russia or Norway in euros or rubles.
Because it's in their interest, their currency is strong and expensive.
No, on the contrary.
Here is where they lost.
With one euro, they export a barrel and a half.
What a loser you are because your currency has dropped because it's pegged to the dollar.
And he is also a big loser, a great loss.
The critical relationship here in the Gulf has a historical bond.
Remember when the dollar was the strongest currency in the world?
And he has arrived now that you're talking about a chapter.
Almost like our wedding when we get married.
And you want to divorce her, it's not easy.
What's here?
Or you've married the dollar in a Catholic ceremony.
And expenses must be verified in a certain way.
It was expressed in a plausible manner and it was expressed.
And so did Kuwait, reducing 25% of its dollar currency.
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE, and Qatar
He can adjust the price of his currency.
Today is about the topic, but that means you have no intention of studying or thinking about it.
The exam is different, of course, from what the Prime Minister said.
He said the Qatari currency is undervalued by thirty percent.
Be in this study.
There's no one-way street where you live alone in this matter.
Kuwait followed its own path. Why don't you follow its steps?
Economists say that it is more profitable for countries and their people than losing.
But we
And nothing else.
The four Gulf states announce.
Everyone believes.
And I mean those who support him personally.
Hi there!
It must be included in the study.
In itself
What one country or two can do
Until you came to work.
You're not going to end the situation now.
Of course, there will be experts conducting this study.
They are the ones who
They are not experts; this requires a political decision.
Let's wait and walk with the fast group now, see what happens today.
People started..., I mean
Certainly in a cooperative mode
Your Excellency, the inflation rate in Qatar in 2007 has reached fourteen percent and will rise to fifteen percent next year.
Ate people's salaries, swallowed their wages, the workers' salaries here.
Salaries of Qatar's residents decreased by thirty to forty percent.
We'll be back after the break to tell you the size of the salary increase.
Many of the staff are in Qatar at least for the coming period, so stay tuned.
Welcome back to "Without Borders" in this episode where we host the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Energy of Qatar.
And industry Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah on the significant increase in prices.
in the oil that returned with tens of millions of dollars to the Gulf countries and producing countries
I am writing about the oil and my question was about the upcoming salary increase for employees. But before this increase, I would like to give you some important information.
The UAE has 97.8% of the reserves and produces 62% of the oil.
Tons of bas and the report in Kuwait Times is an economic report, Gulf revenues are among the highest revenues.
Saudi Arabia is expected to return in the year two thousand and nine billion.
And it was
One hundred and seventy years in the UAE, sixty-six years this year, and it was expected to be seventy-seven.
Kuwait is sixty-four and was fifty-four.
One hundred and twenty-one billion dollars' worth of oil, plus fifty-five billion.
"It's a gas, as other reports have said, and God knows no envy, I mean, we don't envy His Highness the Deputy."
Fourth generation and seven billion
One and a half trillion
The total expenditure was one and a half trillion dollars.
Gulf countries exported one trillion dollars worth of goods.
Dollar was a kind of import.
Investment from the United States was three hundred billion.
And nine out of ten billion.
In Bahrain, it was three percent.
In 2007, in Oman, it was six and a half but will increase to seven. In Qatar, it was thirteen and seventy-five but will increase to fifteen.
It is expected that the people of Qatar will face high living costs and expensive goods.
Life is getting harder, prices are rising, and unemployment rates are increasing in Qatar.
We share everyone's sorrow.
then the solution must be then the solution must be
And solutions mean that they aim to control inflation.
Meaning you'll increase their salaries by 50%.
They'll say you're against raising salaries.
This is not correct.
And in the Cabinet against raising salaries.
No problem, the solution must be a complete solution.
And it's not a temporary solution.
No problem, there will be a balance between the two.
And I'll be,,,like this
The important thing is to solve inflation.
And here in Qatar, why is there a committee?
His Highness issued a decree forming
"Wasim" is
"He laid strong foundations."
Solve the problem and control the flash.
What is important now is to control inflation.
Inflation
What if you can't control it?
But Your Highness, now
The specialist in market research and published last February, days before
Some of them because of the salaries.
Now you will solve the problem of inflation and eat up the inflation from people's income.
Many of them now.
Profits for other countries
Raise our salaries, then solve inflation, then lower them again.
Complete what they are saying about the balance in the matter.
But now
And not even with a temporary solution.
She cried a lot.
So here.
Let inflation stop.
I'm always bored.
Because the increase was enormous last year, right?
The second point is
Those who work in the private sector are not like those who work in the public sector.
The private sector is very neglected.
Now this issue of the increase, we must consider it with justice as well.
I don't know where you got these notes.
We live in Qatar, sir, not in Germany.
I'm telling you, on the contrary, today the private sector has started to pay.
Dell
Among the Qataris who were working in government offices, some have moved to the private sector.
Due to high salaries.
Facing a problem
Switch to the private sector because the private sector is more vibrant and active.
And pays good salaries.
Related to what is called market power.
Market or market force
We're not coming with very high degrees.
We're not coming to Qatar because Qatar has low salaries or low living expenses.
Or they come with their expenses covered.
Excellent with our clear understanding
I don't expect any events, and I won't say there will be a raise in salaries.
No hope either.
To control inflation
Let's give it some time.
I must control inflation.
And God willing, that's what the reports said about Qatar in 2008.
God willing, we say so.
We see that these numbers will change.
He scattered some of it among the people.
It's a professional operation.
Certainly with professionalism and everything.
From inflation
Because spending
Working on various projects.
Permit me to ask some viewers, and I hope everyone will ask a direct question. Abdulaziz Mohammed from Morocco, what is your question, brother Abdulaziz?
A treatise on the ruling families of the Gulf.
Therefore, I don't want to believe that the reason is the dispute between OPEC countries.
Secondly, the oil revenue goes directly and entirely to the ruler.
For the ruling family's exaltation and the rest will be spent on development.
In the absence of responsibility, the situation is like this.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Welcome, brother Ahmed.
I won't enter into that, as the brother has mentioned the topic of governments, the Qatari riyal, and its relationship with the dollar or other Gulf currencies in relation to the dollar.
America wants to bring the world and breathe loyalty into it.
American nothingness has become, trade between China and America reached eighty-eight billion dollars.
The European Union is with her with eighty-six billion dollars.
This means that all directions in global politics are against the dollar.
And we always pay the price, always as Arab countries and oil-producing Gulf states.
It will end in a clash between America.
And among the developed countries of the world, such as China and Russia and others, the subject may become
Pure soldier
Let China explode Russian bombs, let Japan explode American bombs as well.
Many thanks for this clarification and the information.
Ask Mohamed.
Hello, your inquiry
Can you turn down the TV and ask your question?
What's your question?
But I didn't see him return.
The topic is about not being tied to the dollar because the dollar is declining.
And God willing, it will reach the bottom.
And he is a kind man.
He shouldn't follow the style of the Arab brothers.
Thank you, brother Mohammed. Thank you. Now we request the final intervention from Ahmed Hassan from Qatar. Your question, Ahmed, is...
Good evening to you as well.
Many thanks and thank you for the wonderful interview.
What is required is a salary increase. With God's will, things will improve.
Indeed, we are all stuck in problems, not just in salaries.
Blessings from God's affairs
What's your question quickly?
Your ticket will be cut. Do you have any inquiries?
All this is because of the high prices, the increase affected all goods, they are all imported.
I am from Europe.
We have factories and laboratories in the Arab world.
Thank you, Ahmed. Thank you for your time.
Now the issue of rising prices is an important issue.
The situation is supporting the poor. The man told you to stay with the poor, my lord.
Anyone who doesn't have a billion here is considered poor.
She likes cats very much.
I don't know Qatar.
It's not right for the State of Qatar.
Today I came to Qatar to see the indicators.
What are the growth indicators in Qatar and what are they?
Highest growth indicators in the world
Who's the rich one, and who's babbling about it?
Within the framework of the response
What do you think when a Moroccan speaks in a way that is neither true nor realistic?
He who does not see with his own eyes.
If you come from behind, Qatar will emerge and there will be a lot of major development happening there.
You're way off base, you're asking.
And everyone has the right.
Since you're a small group, where will you get the people from?
Really means you'll come with the extra from China, for example?
What are these? What are these? What are these? What are these? What are these?
The state is built on a plan and
Complete independence from the quantities of money coming from oil and gas, and everyone knows that oil and gas will one day run out.
The State of Qatar will transform.
It is considered one of the best achievements in the Arab world.
Today as well
Focus on
And this will have a great impact.
Post-Petroleum and Gas
I understand what you mean, but we're not copying Dubai.
Every country has its own details.
In the State of Qatar, we focused on education.
On the components
There will be a medical city where people come to get treatment.
There will be a media city that will accommodate
Certainly the world today, today we must build.
Built a vision
About petroleum and gas afterwards
They were fatal mistakes.
And unfortunately, we did not welcome this change because we were already corrupted.
And we were not prepared for it, neither in terms of human resources nor in terms of technology, nor even in terms of education.
Now it's changing after thirty years.
And better than that
Today we will have a vision.
And a vision.
And a vision.
Thank you, Mr. Deputy, and thank you also to our audience.
Hoping that we have provided you with valuable information, we look forward to your continued engagement with us.
Qatar's foreign policy appears confusing to many observers.
Qatar benefits from special relationships.
And at the same time, Qatar was maintaining ties with Israel, and still is.
Islamic Resistance Movement "Hamas"
And Qatar presented.
Started
The largest Arab country
Why did it anger the regime in Egypt?
To the extent of accusing Qatar of consulting against Egypt
And Qatar is not far from important files.
Also like Darfur, the Houthis in Yemen and even Israeli prisoners.
Shalit's captors, Qatar's foreign policy hand reached out to him in a way that angered the largest Arab states.
And a type of strength I get in a situation like this.
These achievements
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani
Or write to us via our website www.Aljazeera.net
Welcome, Your Excellency
In September 2007, for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
His visit has improved relations between the two countries over the past two years at least.
Border adjustment
Wash what was stored.
This is what was mentioned.
In the Hijaz newspaper or magazine.
What was done with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where communication was restored and the Saudi ambassador returned.
Doha
At the beginning of your speech, it was very long and needed a lot of answers before your last question.
I think you gave it to someone.
Especially on the Saudi topic.
What is precise?
The Saudi Arabia-Qatar relationship is very important.
Between the two countries
I spoke about the island's silence.
I talked about a revolutionary movement.
I believe these matters have been clarified from both sides.
And we accept the explanation.
The State of Qatar
Dispute with Saudi Arabia
It would have been limited in scope.
From perspectives
And thank God, this was due to the wisdom of the leaders.
King Abdullah and His Royal Highness the Prince
In the Gulf, significantly.
More than a hundred years ago.
They were radiant, honorable, and trustworthy.
I want to clarify the misunderstanding between two parties.
This issue has been resolved and there are no conditions.
In solving any issue
There was understanding and there was sincere intention between the parties.
To resolve this pending issue
"And it's not seasonal but strategic interest."
We wish what stops it from evolving.
A pleasant diplomatic dialogue.
Saudi Arabia will withdraw its ambassador from Qatar.
I used to speak diplomatically. If I still did that, I would have avoided many problems.
I always say what I think.
Saudi Arabia is therefore not diplomacy but faith.
The island topic goes under the media.
Between the parties and many countries saw themselves in the middle.
I think she might be gaining points at the expense of other countries.
Or at the expense of Qatar.
At the expense of Saudi Arabia
To unite the members of the Gulf House
I mean, in comparison to what came before.
No political agreement.
What we had wasn't just an agreement, it was an agreement of love and care.
And besides, you can ask the island management.
Have you established strategic relationships with the Saudis to prevent what happened before?
It was based on a close strategy.
We can say it in one, two, three, and four.
And it must be a union.
And some differences were made based on this.
Between some Arab countries and the attempt to reconcile with the other differences.
Because now, if we observe the differences in the Arab world, all the differences are based on different viewpoints.
When we have an opinion on a certain policy in a certain procedure in a certain issue, and another country has a different opinion.
I'll give her two looks.
Some observers see you as critical of Saudi Arabia.
Opposition
I was tired and decided to turn to another direction, and from there I moved to a bigger country, Egypt.
The same idea.
We're not enjoying anything, we don't have anything to do.
To deal with any party in a deceitful manner
I mean the reasons for the conflict with Saudi Arabia are on
Between them and I know there is a great understanding.
And we know that we have laid the foundation.
And take some kind of model
But Saudi Arabia
Let me get this straight.
I began disputes with the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram in its eighteenth issue of April last year.
The Official Egyptian Gazette
In a comprehensive investigation, he stated that the prolonged investigations
Hezbollah's network failed to uncover the sabotage plot.
These three countries are involved: Egypt, Iran, Syria, and Qatar.
Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood
And a well-known media figure for his conspiratorial role.
Qatar is the smallest Arab country.
Plot against Egypt
We appreciate
And his struggle over the years.
I give him my emotion.
Let me finish, I'm not done yet.
We appreciate
President of Egypt
And who warned?
Arab relations
The first point
Gaza Issue
How they say and how we acknowledge
Doha, Qatar
A smaller country.
Your deal could be part of such schemes.
Because we have suffered from the interventions of other countries before and we don't want to go back to that.
After the interference of some countries in Qatar's affairs
Therefore, the policy of His Highness's government.
Now that they've discovered what they call a conspiracy.
What I want to say is, God willing, Syria and Iran can defend themselves. I won't pay them.
Stability of Egypt
And why does Qatar want to change or interfere in such a matter?
And achievements are not invented out of thin air.
It was said that the small state of Qatar sought to undermine Egypt's role and its relations with Turkey and the European Union.
And you tried to organize a conference similar to the Arab Summit to steal the spotlight.
And you're using Horn Media, which is Al Jazeera.
Yes, agreed.
With Hezbollah
And he doesn't let us rest.
And you could say that we're certain.
Until here
The principle is non-interference in such circumstances.
We blame the Egyptian officials for the plight of our brothers in Egypt.
The conflict with some members of the Egyptian government
Some officials had problems with
Don't cry.
Coming for this.
Days of the fragrance of peace, the cause of peace, and that is us.
And she was previously in Egypt.
And then with us
Because Israel
We have a disagreement with him.
You don't have a problem with Adrian.
And today, because of the conference, from that day on.
Any Islamic conference, any Arab conference has sensitivity.
This sensitivity
When I'm sitting with them
Let me finish.
And we always wish for the best.
We discovered that this is an allergy.
Or three
Gaza Conference that took place
Egypt doesn't want it to be done in Qatar.
Not Arabic
In Qatar, and even though there was a summit in Kuwait, we told them...
The Palestinian people were under attack.
For more than two weeks
Let's do it before any planned conference, the Kuwait conference that we were the first to attend.
People are being killed.
And with postponement
The argument began.
And no small state.
He knew that some brothers in the government also considered this a crime against Egypt, not against anyone else.
What did they say after that?
Sweet, you're on the island.
Israel reported a day before that there would be a rally to stop the aggression before any speech or anyone or anything.
What is this?
My brother allowed the medicine and food to get in during the beating that our brothers had to endure.
They said, "The door was narrow."
We can't let the trucks in.
Why don't they tell us there's an agreement from the other party and they need to come?
Now is not the time to see why we come to Fatah or Hamas.
We don't want Fatah or Hamas; we want the people who are beating them, one and a half million, six hundred thousand.
And I don't have any medicine.
We started talking about this topic and discussing it in the Gaza conference.
And Qatar enters the subject by affecting Egypt's regime.
It's not interference.
We didn't tell them how Egypt will solve the problem because it's their jurisdiction.
One of the officials said we uncovered a big plot from here.
No one told us yet what the issue was.
We mean this is official.
He's telling us that Egypt is big.
OK, I understand that Egypt is a large Arab country and has been for a long time. Egypt is a large country.
This is a request for help from a very large country that has many problems.
Because Egypt is ours.
And I was invited to a conference where there was also provocation for them.
She invited us to a seminar.
Reconstruction of Gaza
We had coordination and we had one position.
People are suffering in Gaza.
Forbidden, I know that Turkey brought things through Israel.
I would be happy to see that coming through our brothers in Egypt.
They are part of us.
And if Egypt prospers or does a good political act
We believe that this is in the interest of Qatar and the interest of the entire Arab world.
Egypt's stability is very important to us.
If he does a sweet job, it's important to us.
To enable me to complete your question, your introduction took a quarter of an hour.
The situation now is that you've lost me.
Who is that angry person now?
You are officials in Egypt's system.
It's what we did that caused the Qatar Summit to fail.
The second thing is that they were the ones who failed his conference in Qatar.
King Abdullah had a beloved wisdom.
And he wanted to make reconciliations.
That's why some countries don't attend.
And I said this speech to our brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia because we
Don't have any disagreements with Saudis even on this point.
Because, as explained, there are internal issues.
Or one of the officials
Among high-ranking officials
A large country where an official finds a small country doing such things.
There was milk.
Play any role
Darfur is part of the national security of Egypt and Sudan.
The five great powers agreed.
Both countries other than Qatar will be fine.
Neither these sensitivities will increase the situation. Why do you have to come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come?
We want to resolve this allergy, we take antihistamines, they should tell us what this allergy is.
Why these sensitivities?
Except for a few brothers from the government.
They love, they have an internal holiday.
They are drawing attention to a conspiracy in Gaza, a revolution.
It won't be like the English say, all Italian.
It didn't happen.
What is not only for instructions but also for analyses.
We don't know what happened because
The case must be resolved locally.
And we won.
"Our country is a priority to me."
My country's interests are a priority for me.
Then I'll check if I have enough time.
And let's feel in the cause of what concerns my Arab nation.
"Or Qatar tried to reconcile."
And you think about any Arab reason that could contribute to it as much as possible.
Why is it provocative? Why don't we take it in good faith?
I can't do that for you.
I can explain my point of view.
Don't throw it at me.
And from our perspective
What comes from the heart.
Let me finish.
What took care of the tolerance initiative and gathered all the presidents in Kuwait, we expected good and I received it.
No dictatorship.
Certainly the Egyptian official who clarified his heroism.
In a report, or in a TV interview, or something like that, I will respond to it.
Because I have an answer for every point.
Therefore, to maintain the minimum relations that bind us and bind Arab interests.
And this is also a response to the invitation mentioned by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.
And I can't recommend him or others to you.
They are trying to correct their mistakes, whether from within or without.
In politics, economics, or otherwise, we have errors in politics and economics, so no one is infallible.
Because they consider Qatar their home and reject all these charges.
Are you denying the existence of a relationship between Qatar and Hezbollah?
This is a joking topic.
To harm Egypt's relations, undermine its role, and disrupt its communication channels with Turkey and the European Union.
We are few in number at first.
If possible, let's do this role.
This is not correct.
No personal accusations against you.
To pay money to Shalit's captives so that Qatar takes charge of Shalit and increases Egypt's role in this matter.
Damen always remind us of people who don't have money, first of all, we didn't have money and we didn't talk to anyone about people who don't have money.
"No, but that's the case."
We support Egypt in resolving the issue, and we continue to support Egypt in resolving the issue between the Palestinians.
It is he who allowed the President of Palestine to stay until the issue is resolved.
We were there and the first to support the State of Qatar.
The authority and Palestinian entities may remain until the dispute is resolved.
And we said that
"We are in the Arab League, but they said no, we did it because we believe that some people don't want that."
But we solved it cleverly.
Is he going to talk to his boss?
His Prime Minister
I have no idea there's a problem.
"Some of us don't know them."
They obtained the decision within the nineteenth point during the past month of April in an independent manner with Al-Shuruq newspaper.
The political leadership in Egypt has decided to launch a satellite news channel to counter what is known as the media century, Al Jazeera, and put an end to it.
Only a few days left and everything will be over.
Are you afraid the island will be a thing of the past?
We are currently living in the age of political adolescence.
And you also visited Saudi Arabia, and the Sheikh of Qatar sat with the Saudi king.
We're not obeying them, and they're not obeying us.
We dealt with them like brothers.
A small state cedes to a large state, Egypt.
In Saudi Arabia, there is an important point we need to clarify.
The relationship between Qatar and Saudi Arabia is different.
And then we talk.
How is the relationship between Qatar and Egypt?
And you rely on him a lot.
Be honest with you.
Is it a dispute in core politics?
I hope it's not a personal dispute because we don't have a personal dispute. I told you that I respect the Egyptian people.
If I asked you, you would say there are two problems: Gaza and something else.
In this case, it has treated us all a lot.
We want to solve this issue from a psychological perspective, meaning to resolve this impasse.
Published in some newspapers.
Minister of Foreign Affairs
With the presence of Prince Saud al-Faisal.
We talked about everything.
For himself, but of course the work became complicated and wasn't solved.
What was he listening to?
I can't tell you about our relationship with Egypt.
They attack us, and that's their right as our brothers.
And we blame them for it, as is their right, like our younger brothers.
We don't have any issues with the big country, we don't want to compare ourselves to any big country.
In other words, Egypt is large in satisfaction.
The problem is a matter of life or death, but the solution comes from heaven.
"We would have if there was someone who could bear to be content."
Or waiting for a way
In Qatar
You will deal with none but those of rank or brotherhood.
As a big country, we are proud of Egypt as a big country.
But if someone were deceiving someone else
I know Israel does these things to us.
And America's previous policy under the previous administration was either with me or against me.
No one wants to imitate Israel or America in this matter.
Even if we take their policies, they are also under pressure from a third party.
Let me finish many times.
We understand and know that there are some guidelines even for a big country.
What do your policies govern?
We don't have a movement that doesn't move us.
That's your internal business.
And whenever we can help the Arab world, we will.
Sources of power: the island and the bases.
What can be said is not strength.
Our faith in God and confidence
Oh, my dear friend, our prince is kind.
We don't want to bother anyone.
I wish you'd just finish. I don't want to make a problem out of this.
And we don't want to compete with anyone.
They can say anything about great Qatar or otherwise.
We have an opinion.
First, we said the Israeli office, we said we closed it.
They kept saying to close the office, so we did. Then they saw that they were angry and went to complain to the Americans. Do you trust these people?
She joined the team they call the Devil's team.
They say
Americans, Europeans, and these are my friends, and we know how to deal with them.
Plots
"Dilo" (Note: This
"Having reached this flaw, we've come to this point and now let's live."
Tell me now.
How will you solve Egypt's problem?
And based on the fact that Egypt plays a significant role in the Arab world.
We consider it important to look into it.
And my compelling evidence is that President Hosni Mubarak warned against it.
Not all, but some of the staff
I want to go.
Occupying Egyptian public, governmental, or other opinion, or unreasonable leadership.
And focus on Arab and Egyptian interests.
Are you following the steps?
We are behind them, not in front of them, because they are a great nation.
In the near future
Frankly, I can't imagine how this will be done.
And I know there's time for the senses
Only the time of our dreams.
If it were up to me.
Or them
A common Arab interest brought them together.
One day we will find this matter.
You are alive.
In other words, we won't respond to the same proposal you're living by.
If someone helps us with a hand, we'll help them with an arm.
Now, Sheikh Saeed.
We weren't used to running.
Only on a good basis are we ready to run to Egypt.
Standing with Egypt
There are a lot of rumors about Egyptian workers in Qatar and how this issue affects them.
And there are contracts for surveyors working in universities or high-ranking positions.
You know that it's not our custom to cancel activities and appointments in this matter.
Because these people have nothing to do with me.
They had a market that changed in demand, they stopped one and brought one.
It's a matter of supply and demand, and some nationalities have increased while others have decreased.
Direct answer
The office was there.
When we finished the office, it was best to leave now.
Since we had a campaign, we wanted to make it sparkle, all our losses in negotiations with Israel were because of this office.
We left them to fix it with Netanyahu.
He was a guest.
And it was among them, as it is our custom to invite all embassies accredited in any foreign country.
Please consider this a formal invitation to honor Gabriela Shaliv.
We used to honor her before when the relations, as they say, were good. Now honoring her is a bit more difficult.
There's no compelling reason for you to open the office during this period.
The office will reopen when there are no longer two reasons for it to be closed.
Big boss
Who did a job as big as Egypt.
Egypt imposed this.
Allow me to be clear with you, our relations with America are strategic relations.
"with some things and this
What's most important to him is his job?
There are no jobs in our area when it comes to solving some issues. We had a dispute with the previous administration.
Now we have high hopes for the administration, especially with the steps taken by President Obama.
We believe there is a great hope that this administration
I am serious about advancing the peace process and I am serious about resolving the Palestinian issue.
They are our friends, and we don't deny that.
What's happening in Iran? What impact could it have on the Gulf and on you?
Iranians must decide how to solve their issues.
Between them
In their usual style, and I believe they will get out of this crisis.
Stability in Iran, as the Emir of Qatar said.
Important for our region, the Gulf region, and we share the same borders with Iran.
Certainly, we have special relations with all our neighbors, including Iran.
Because our country seeks peace and stability in this region.
We are open to any party that wants to amend the Doha Agreement.
And I want to know that Saad Hariri said.
Now complete it, and all that will be left is the strategic dialogue between the president.
And Lebanese groups
It's up to you.
There are no roles for you in Yemen, or they have just taken a stance.
Listen, it's known that we supported the unity when almost the entire Arab world was against the unity of Yemen.
"It was the only Arab country and Gulf state that supported the unity of Yemen."
And in the south, we border Yemen, and His Highness the Emir sent me twice to meet the President of Yemen.
And I explained to him that our goal is the stability of Yemen because Yemen is an important country in the Arabian Peninsula.
And they didn't respect this agreement, and I won't say what each party did.
But what really treated me
It is Qatar that has been placed in this position and then accused of paying money to Houthis and senior Yemeni officers.
Because we don't interfere in such matters.
And those who stood with unity did not stand against it.
And another goal for the interests of Yemen, whether politically, economically, or otherwise.
We don't have a problem, but I'm really shocked.
Because I went more than ten times during the fighting, His Highness sent me to Yemen among the Yemenis.
Unfortunately, this is a strange accusation.
The time has run out, but briefly tell me about these problems that occurred to you due to your search for solutions. Will you change your policies regarding intervention in other Arab issues?
If they would just listen to me, I wouldn't have to do anything.
And his offers were very generous.
Over five billion dollars at that time, if we had invested it, it would have been fifty billion dollars. Better than a headache.
But I say it with my right hand because time in the Arab world now...
Forbidden under these circumstances
Many thanks, Your Excellency.
Perhaps it's even exceptional with Sheikh Hamad's case.
Shalou who obtained the agreement in Doha.
How did the Doha Miracle happen?
To fully commit and support the committee
Let's discuss Lebanon after the Israeli invasion.
When was there an Arab consensus?
And when we went to New York, we were able to make a more balanced decision.
And we requested this in Doha that both parties were concerned.
We tried not to listen, but we couldn't help it.
Because we knew the committee, we knew.
The truth is grounded, and we know what the problem is after sitting with the Lebanese for long hours.
And I want you to know that this is a shared success.
But I had determination.
Lebanon's problem is that the Beqaa Valley's climate directly affects it.
Whether he is quiet or not quiet
Lebanon was meant to be in this location.
On these terms
And unfortunately
External influences
I can only say that the problem among Lebanese people, even if it is a problem, won't be the first one.
Sheikh Arif feels that the time is not right now, maybe too early to talk about the scenes.
Did Hulk come here?
I stood somewhat committed on the ground now.
I didn't delay for a single second.
He knew exactly what was happening; even the Lebanese leaders made sure I knew what had happened.
There is no beginning.
When I spoke with His Highness
I told him if we're going to Lebanon.
I will present the idea that His Highness agreed to and supported.
Where are all the leaders of Lebanon located?
Because here in Beirut, you have to go to each person in their own territory.
One of them is in the same hotel and the same place.
They met on the same plane and talked.
For we created this atmosphere, but from the beginning, our idea was
And that was the most important decision they made together.
Certainly
And I felt like I was from an Arab state.
then we should be honest mediators
Praise be to God, I believe this has been proven to everyone that Qatar has made an effort.
On both sides
To reach a fair solution for both parties.
And there should be a solution where no one loses.
Before you move
The consultation took place at the Arab League and we found support.
What we've done
And I said to him while we were there.
If we succeed in Lebanon, we'll take them to Doha.
And he commanded me
To close them and take their mobile phones
We were able to bring them there, and the brothers in Syria helped with the situation.
And I told you from the beginning that without Arab support, the committee can't do anything.
Why do we want candy?
I'm thinking about the situation in Lebanon and the escalation that happened.
And this time
No work in Somalia, no work in Sudan.
So many things happen in the world.
And every time we put out the fire
This is better for the Arab world than foreign intervention.
And we try our best.
He sends troops.
Momentary if it was military.
For example, I think these are topics.
There's no point in discussing it.
He always said that the solution was in the Lebanese file.
Saudi-Syrian Agreement
The Arab world, meaning Qatar and the Arab countries.
What happened in Lebanon could be a catalyst for serious reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Syria.
Self-criticism in the Arab world
Because of Arabic differences.
And any agreement between two Arab states.
And we tried this.
The Seventy-Three Days War
Arabs always agree on a solution to a problem.
I think he is busy.
Saudi Arabia and Syria play an important role in Lebanon.
Both parties must
Seize wisdom.
Arab relations are on the right track.
Because here in the Arab world, we face many great challenges.
Everyone is playing in our yard.
And we have no power nor strength.
And how can we stop playing in the courtyards of the Arab countries?
As Arabs, at least the minimum agreement.
My dear, we complain
And we're watching.
Our differences as Arabs and the lack of trust among us, trust is absent between Arab countries.
And the Arab countries
That's not betrayal, it's more like a kind of...
Envy is just a word.
had a moment of need upon upon upon upon upon upon upon upon upon upon
Please, will you do this soon and call for an Arab summit?
We cry when he cries and rejoice when he rejoices.
Came in the middle of the conversation.
We could play a role in resolving the situation between Damascus and Riyadh, even if...
They wish to find solutions and confirm their wisdom.
They might reach an understanding.
Among them in many cases
She agreed in politics and believed that God willing, this will happen.
I'm sorry, I've improved.
Both parties need to take a step forward.
What's possible to assert is that this is what's happening now.
Emphasized that if Arabs focused on resolving disputes between Arab countries and the problems of some Arab states that he mentioned previously
Optimism and a source of pride for the citizen that there is a general Arab awakening.
I can't talk about what happened in Lebanon.
It can be interpreted on the ground that there is an Israeli-Palestinian escalation.
There might be an American-Iranian escalation or other cases.
Will you be afraid of him in the coming months?
We, as Arabs
We can only provide you with food and medicine.
And electricity for the people.
We in Qatar are ready and always willing.
In Arabic: There are more than one and a half million Palestinians under siege.
And we don't want them to have any weapons or support.
They do all of this.
And no electricity.
And we'll give it to the Red Cross to deliver it to the Palestinians.
And with the Palestinians, we give them only taste and medicine.
And our dispute with them may continue.
And I want the Palestinians from both sides to elevate the national interest above everything else.
And they left the illusions.
The Palestinian rift is now a deep wound.
To find a solution
We haven't committed it yet.
This is a serious matter, they must adhere to the Mecca Agreement.
And they must ask even to go again to Mecca and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
And resolve this dispute.
They won't benefit.
A promise from any party.
I wish it were a solution.
Our position is known and stated to all concerned parties that we
We will not forget it and we will not be part of any military conflict with Iran.
We have good relations with him.
And that we are not a sovereign state and they are a sovereign state.
Everyone is looking out for their own interests, but these interests don't harm them or us.
We believe that the destiny of the Gulf should be in clear agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council.
And peaceful cooperation between Qatar, Iran, and their neighbors.
But when you say that Qatar is not a party involved.
Any details or clarifications
What's the point?
Never
In the name of God, I want to go back to the Lebanese file if there's no problem.
Frankly, Your Excellency, we are facing a major obstacle, but we have reached a solution in the last few hours.
It's him who called who got what was announced.
It's possible that there's a connection between disparate pieces of information, but it hasn't been discovered yet.
Dally has sent you these results.
This had happened in Istanbul, I knew that if it had been in a few places before.
I understood that there were negotiations.
Continuously finding a solution.
And without a doubt, the Kingdom's support is very important.
And change negotiation strategies.
These negotiations led to
For positive outcomes; we gathered some parties from some sides.
And we started talking.
There is no mention of an Arab or Qatari approach in this paper.
Tell me what's wrong with this paper.
And we started talking about the materials one by one.
At the last moment, overcome the obstacle and keep going.
But the prince met with the parties.
Overcome this obstacle.
And it was a solution.
We heard it from the Emir at the opening session in Doha.
Aren't you thinking about your role now?
The most important thing is to stay out of the spotlight.
I have no territorial ambitions.
or even to have control over another state or something because our state
Our size... We take pride in ourselves, believing that we are capable of contributing to solving problems with our brothers.
But in the Arab world, it is very important.
The states
We want them to do something, and it's important.
Some small countries have allowed and supported this role.
Some things are excellent, some things are good, and some things are less than good.
One last question, Your Honor.
What is the central priority?
Is it a political priority?
"Security or Reforming Hostility"
Confronting Israel
Let's play in the Arabic court.
Solve our problems in Arab countries.
Choosing an active member in Iraq
To calm the situation.
Nationally and regionally
But if we have stubbornness.
Or have any hope.
Many thanks to His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani for this meeting.
And international efforts to end the war on Gaza.
We start by requesting you to meet the Arab League Council at the ministerial level.
"When you have elevated your minds from..."
Request for an emergency Arab summit
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. First of all, I am happy, Hassan's brother, to be in this program.
States of humanity
Two faces of our brothers in Gaza.
Terms that require us to do a lot.
Qatar never underestimated the Arab vision.
Specifically, when we previously went with the idea of the Arab Summit.
Not only through the Security Council resolution but also
Underestimating or not underestimating them?
I'll make it into different sentences.
While we are being patient
Why can't the street bear this? If it doesn't want us to bear it, let it not be a burden on the Arab street.
How is he treating her?
We are in Egypt.
It was from ten to eleven o'clock by the written agreement.
Some spoke at the meeting, and it was possible to hold a meeting.
We'll keep it as long as there is an Arab agreement.
And we want them to have a say if they have a meeting.
And how can the problem be solved?
Because he's going to solve it.
The core issue is important.
Because our goal isn't publicity and advertising, our goal is research.
I understood what you said at the summit.
We even ask ourselves
We're squeezing the poor other side.
"Those before and after, and the Security Council resolution, but tell us about the Arab Summit, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad."
Speak clearly, the situation may require an Arab summit with those who participate.
We found a majority of our brothers supporting the holding of the summit.
With whom is he coming?
And I don't know what they mean by moderation.
I am the unique nation.
Only the Arab nation, if we go to any country in Asia or Latin America.
Unsolved
These are considered medium-sized countries.
And what is moderate in our eyes?
How can we resolve the Palestinian issue?
When we love them.
Are we interfering in the affairs of the Palestinians in any way?
A country that allows interference for good or evil.
Like Hezbollah, and who knows, maybe another movement will emerge tomorrow.
Hey, are you a liquid?
Can we accept them as part of the Arab body?
As if it was meant for us to enter an internal Arabic fight.
"Masha'Allah, let's go to the Security Council."
There is no solution in the Security Council.
I hope after Israel finishes its mission.
"Masha'Allah, the second Arab ministerial meeting that you are invited to attend."
There were prevalent intense discussions, disagreements, and arguments.
There's an important point.
This is not the one that concerns us.
We don't have a meeting.
Keep away from the ports.
No peace like yours.
Have the ministers prepared for that?
Because there's a party telling us we need to wait.
But we are in an Arab initiative.
Frozen peace talks with Israel.
We say that we are in a party that says we will lose in this.
There is no greater loss than what we have suffered now, but we were always respectful, polite, and committed to decisions since the days of the truce.
Say that arguments are not important.
There was someone wishing Hamas could be destroyed or something like that.
This reflects a political stance more than it does a disagreement between two ministers.
My dear, this has happened.
But I miss you so much.
I don't want to talk about others.
It's important to be men of our own and men of our state.
We implement the policies of our countries.
Who's doing these things on behalf of me?
Calculate
In the end, they'll respect us.
Is there anyone doing things on behalf of the West?
We and I hope we don't accuse anyone, I don't want to accuse anyone about this matter.
After the Security Council resolution
What will he put on his agenda?
The situation began with a decision to exert Arab efforts.
And the dispute here is whether Israel will implement the decision immediately.
We say that there is a decision.
But Israel did not implement the resolution.
Have we recovered now to go ask about the seventh surah? I know there are difficulties.
No inquiry from the international community, even if there was one.
He will be shy.
The state
See that they did something to the Jew and the Israeli.
To claim their rights
This is the current state of Arabs.
If the Arabs didn't go to the Security Council
He agreed to hold a summit and make tough decisions.
And the Western countries are experimenting on us.
Because we are in the heart of the Arab world, with many people, and you can see how the Arab street is dealing with this issue.
But this decision is important.
Regarding the matter of inviting our presidents one by one.
In the end, they said there was nothing wrong, and that was a lie.
OK, if we are now like Germany or else are we going to demand?
We don't want to compensate them because they initiated the attack, but tell them you have incorrect information.
And killed hundreds of thousands.
It's because you're a weak Arab party.
We Arabs are one people.
I was wondering how.
To give it to him
Even if it was fate and God's will.
If the Arab nation said, "If you send forces to Darfur, we will send forces to Darfur."
Arabs or some consider the decision of 1860.
And our friends worked hard to float the decision.
That is issued by the Security Council.
I don't want to say it was a victory or not.
Something is leading to me.
We assume victory.
What's going to happen
It seems we're not aligning with the others on this decision.
But I give you a promise that we will get the decision.
Unfortunately, you will agree with the decision even though you didn't have to.
Moments after the Israeli rejection, Israel Jet agreed.
In other words, I
You will have an alternative or something better, or you are the ones requesting a ministerial meeting.
What he doesn't know about the Arab nation
At present, ready for any alternatives.
And I don't think the Arab nation is ready.
In implementing the Gaza siege
For various political reasons
For a group to gain dominance over another in Palestine instead of reconciling with each other.
Let's start trying to make plans.
They had a meeting, I don't know, some European-Arab intelligence or something like that, without mentioning names.
And when they did, it means I was involved.
In implementation
What is required of us from the West?
But if we go
I want there to be order in this.
Certainly, there is no talking about the decision without talking about implementation.
The reason is that this Gaza issue started two years ago, not now.
I will talk about the subject two years ago but precisely on the topic of the decision.
Do you have any warnings about his tapes?
Exporter and not implemented
We weren't invited.
Perhaps they think we have a different point of view.
Everyone had to have the same point of view.
It's not necessary for everyone to share the same opinion, but I want to say that those who put in the effort are the ones who achieve results.
And we thank them for that.
I talked about what happened in Gaza two years ago and mentioned political parties.
Controlling one group over another participated in the siege of Gaza
Do you really agree with what they say, what they spread, or what they accuse from here and there?
On a real Arab conspiracy with all that's happening now in Gaza.
We are partially aware.
I'm telling you from experience that we're not educated enough.
But I know.
Palestinian conflict
Fed at the Arab and international level
Even if they weren't funded, they wouldn't differ much.
And it was after the elections.
And Hamas came to power.
By majority
We should have given them a chance and seen.
Whether they seek reform or are still revolutionaries who only know weapons and fighting.
But the day they came
In the Arab world, some of our brothers believed that these extremist movements should come to power.
Some say it was an attack now.
Did Hamas, who broke the ceasefire, act out of desperation, or were it the Palestinians in Gaza who broke the ceasefire?
Truce
He remained while the Palestinian people in Gaza went hungry for two years.
No problem.
For Israeli security reasons
It's clear we don't want them in power, but that doesn't concern you in Qatar.
But who was wrong about the others?
And so, who will decide?
All nations, every sovereign nation, have the right to choose.
Our government
The main problem
But I'm sure it could have been solved.
If we don't work hard, we work hard to fuel the dispute.
It is clear, however, that we are able to organize this group to overcome this group.
We consider them terrorists or we consider them.
Everything that happened led to
Even the two promises they made to the party that they would give them a decent life.
They didn't do anything for them.
Let's go back to the international and Arab efforts that have been made to stop what is happening, as you said.
No Security Council resolution has been rejected by Israel so far.
And this Egyptian initiative
And Egypt is in Cairo.
Egyptian efforts
Not a bit helpful.
Dalli is wanted for an important role.
And Egypt's borders are also adjacent to Israel and Palestine.
Until here
And we don't want to stop the chaos now.
In Gaza and bring people to stop the chaos in Gaza because
This is not the path to peace.
There's nothing but
And therefore, we ask them for a big role.
What was announced.
What does it mean that you can't evaluate the initiative right now?
Either to get a chance to succeed or to study.
I calculate that his chances of success are slim.
If the brothers in Egypt can
Make Palestinian perspectives more similar.
And the one who needs to discuss the initiative is the victim in Gaza.
Because he's the one who can say yes or no.
And this is an important point.
When was the decision of 1860 issued?
This is an Arab-Palestinian problem for us.
We don't want to hear any party.
but I really wanted that, when the Palestinian delegation went
And when they went to the beach, they asked to put someone from Gaza with them.
To show the Israelis that these are our brothers and we are with them.
This is an important point.
What we allow power to do
Our goal is what we are, and our policy is what we will be.
Remained in power
Write a check now.
I don't know if we can discuss an Egyptian initiative because you haven't read its articles.
Do you think, in principle, that this could be appropriate as a mechanism to implement the international resolution of 1860, as some people have claimed?
Balanced role
Now is not tomorrow or the day after tomorrow because
Every day passes.
There will be bloodshed for our brothers there.
That's why we don't want to delay or have the Israelis delay on this matter. Once they complete their mission, we'll start this initiative.
I'm confident that the brothers in Egypt know that and are keeping an eye on it.
I wanted to clarify everything you said.
Now we have to solve the problem.
And not even the violin they want.
The Turkish role has been attractive since the beginning of the crisis.
Shabbas
Empty Arabic space
Undoubtedly, it is a distinguished site.
And it has Arabic depth.
The godfather's entrance was impressive.
We know there is a disabled Arab person.
Some of it was due to disagreements.
Some of it is from each person's perspective, as they believe their perspective is complete.
Someone else thinks it's better.
And what is in the conscience of how to let people respect and recognize that there is an Arab solution.
Or they'll pick us off one by one.
We'll give them two or three more days to reach out to them, bring them in to level the playing field, and resolve the issue.
We need to rise above this and reject it.
Hamas may have mistakes, but we will deal with them.
At the Arab level
Until then
At least not that.
In general, through the framework required for Qatar's position, positions such as, we will return to this point later but
And at the same time in the field I heard
Yesterday, Khaled Meshaal, the head of the Political Bureau of the Hamas movement.
Firstly, what Brother Khalid Meshaal said is not necessary, with all due respect to him.
Why do you sit with Khaled Mashal and speak to him in Arabic?
Let's go to him in the Arab league and tell him.
That's an important dialogue.
I am from Hamas.
Demands for Israel's terms also demand conditions.
They can impose conditions, but it is not permissible for them to impose conditions, and Israel also.
What do you think of this Arabic gift first?
It's not cattle, and we don't hear this people saying De Gaulle didn't hear.
Completely different, first of all, De Gaulle liberated his country.
With or without allies, he liberated his country from the fiery occupation.
What are you looking for now?
This is a gift from an Arab. We want it.
Leaders must represent the views of their people.
The Arab peoples in all those demonstrations we have witnessed.
Dilaq can verify these rows that the requests
Many of those who put Qatar under siege in this situation are also demanding...
The actor doesn't get anything, and the office is still open.
They don't speak the same language.
We will sever relations and go with all Arab countries.
Breaking the bond, all the papers, even if someone says he has a covenant.
They want Qatar to sacrifice alone.
Until here
And this is more important than the relationship.
It's not just this decision, there are also difficult decisions.
More than this decision.
In other words, we need to have a unified Arab stance.
For others
No one sells one thing instead of another for spiritual or material gain, or whatever they call it.
We want to close this file before, in this matter there are also countries that have taken individual steps.
Hawiz Thabit is a separate issue that has disputes with the United States.
Our people don't need us to remind them.
Five embassies with permanent membership present arguments in these films.
We've had enough, and the street knows more now.
With high respect, O Sheikh of great stature.
Or ask Lebanon for forces to confront the Israeli aggression and so on.
Do you think it would succeed if it were framed within a single Arab framework?
And we call for Arab positions that make people respect us.
I don't feel that the Arab countries are ready to fight.
What we surround
How can Syria, Lebanon, and other countries coexist when there are Arab countries that don't even speak to each other?
No.
Change in Arab relations
This is the current policy among Arab states.
It's still there, but I think it's finished.
In goals
The important issue
And they know how the Lebanese structure is.
There is no doubt that Lebanon
Give an example if he took back his lands.
The situation in Gaza is different, they haven't visited.
Surrounded on all sides
Siege
Given a different nature
We don't want to refer here to the goals achieved by Israel, meaning Israel's practical goals.
A day when someone is harmed, a day when someone is punished, a day when someone is pleased.
For them, what happened in Lebanon is not a good example.
The solution is the sample that happened in Lebanon.
According to me, it's sweet.
To Gaza
Listen to the problem in Gaza or Palestine, its solution is easier than the solution in Lebanon.
Who disagrees with some of us, do we reclaim our land today or tomorrow?
Their disagreement is about power.
In the distribution of power
And this differs because they are closer in thought.
More than the Lebanese philosopher.
That's why the solution is much easier.
And that's the problem.
Your Highness the Sheikh
In other words, we have a few minutes left if we finish the topic nicely.
And a diplomat.
When might this operation end?
Palestinians in Gaza
I'll tell you.
Or reject
And your assistant
He wasn't with us.
There will be an Arab failure.
I see it from a strategic perspective.
On the Palestinian side
There were efforts, but we didn't see a complete initiative.
Not before, not now, why?
The problem isn't a problem of initiative, but rather of feeling.
We will help whoever is causing the problem without mentioning Qatar, as some people have issues with mentioning Qatar.
And we do not want to organize a summit because there is already a summit scheduled for March.
If we take an initiative, we won't be better than our brothers. I don't think so.
And we do not impose on them pressures.
Because history will not forgive us if we pressure them.
Through this initiative, we saw all parties where there was a meeting on the fourth day, but it was postponed due to the Security Council.
We hope, God willing, to make progress and we ask our Arab brothers to help us as much as possible in this matter.
And we hope to remove him from the competition.
Arab Competition
I was involved with the Sudanese government at a specific time.
And these are our problems: we want to fight each other and we can't agree with each other.
I don't want to go through this.
In Kuwait, in the upcoming third week of the month, I of course want to know the Arab situation.
As you know, as mentioned, and as explained by your excellence.
Is the Arab climate as a whole supportive? Is it the first economic summit?
His Highness
And of course, we attend any summit held in a brotherly state.
And they won't let us go to any summit.
He doesn't shy away from political summitry.
Certainly, considering that time imposes itself.
I don't remember anything if it was ten days later.
Are you talking about the Palestinians after they were struck for twenty-five days?
Will be
What will the Arabs say, they couldn't meet.
We said that
We said that
With all due respect, this summit has been scheduled and we are committed to it.
I want to say that I think that
The Arab streets are against us.
In our own way.
Therefore
And go out in peace.
And say, "This is a sure promise."
For this meeting
Thank you, viewers, for watching.
Coverage of the ongoing war on Gaza continues. Goodbye.
A couple of days ago, there was a celebration for the International Day of Persons with Disabilities.
Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani
In Doha and participated in preparing a draft law specially
She was also a member of several local and Arab councils in the field of childhood.
He has added more than seventy-five lectures, working papers, presentations, and published articles in Arab and international journals.
First, let's agree on the coding system currently in use.
Do we refer to people with disabilities as "disabled" or "with special needs"?
Good evening first
Taken from the culture of human rights or human rights because people with special needs
Because she treated people with special needs, considering them people first.
Humans
He's taken his toll from trying so hard to fit in with society.
The medical concept was the prevailing one.
Move towards the concept.
Education and special education emerged.
This category has been moved.
That's why we started calling them people with special needs.
The standard regulations inferred from it.
The role of the special rapporteur monitoring the implementation of this document.
And they accelerated the steps towards the emergence of the international agreement, which was legally binding and characterized by rules in this regard.
And he set a fundamental condition or basic rule for this term.
Deal with these people that they are human, that they are people.
With the changes you mentioned, is there a change in society's perception of this group?
It is measured in a certain way.
Your countries differ from region to region.
but the special thing about this is: "but the special thing about this is"
Why is the Arab world unique or different?
However, the legal trends include human rights, and they exist, for example, in Africa.
In Latin America, but the reasons are probably lack of financial resources, right?
Of course, this is what I wanted to say: culture exists, but sometimes there is a lack of resources and a lack of political will.
Sometimes laws, but
Unfortunately, awareness is very low, and as human rights culture is missing.
Ten percent of the world's population are disabled persons.
Eighty to ninety percent of people with disabilities are from developed countries and are of working age.
And he suffered from unemployment.
During my visit to Darfur
And one is the presence of mines and snakes.
Men are one degree better.
Add the disabilities, and they will be in remote and distant areas.
Therefore, there are many directions of organizations working in this field and trying to raise.
Awareness to Achieve the Right to Education
We don't establish too many religious centers.
They went to participate in building rehabilitation centers, hospitals, and schools.
And this is one of those who praised God through our work in the office.
I tried with the current arrangement in Qatar.
To develop an agenda
Or include the agendas of these humanitarian organizations to encompass these centers.
Descending insight into the situation of people with disabilities in the world.
What I can do is call him and agree to a concession on your behalf.
There was a setback in the Arab region due to the disability issue.
Within the social, political, and economic context, we cannot expect the situation of people with disabilities to be any different.
They are from marginal groups.
The country, as I told you, is like Gaza and Darfur.
On the contrary, I can say that there is absolutely no improvement in the situation.
And it was actually implemented on Earth, and to give you an example, I will say
Qatar Red Crescent
And we agreed that the projects include
People with disabilities and health issues have different strategies and other programs.
I have someone to do it for me.
In the work of organizations on the ground
Kamal arrived with us from Syria today, welcome.
Good evening, I am Suleiman Kiro.
Sliman Kirrow is a hard-working man.
My respect to you and Lady Hafsa.
First, is there a mental barrier within the laws of the United Nations?
Cognitive barrier means that a healthy person became a result of what turned into a pressure factor leading to a cognitive barrier.
My son sustained a psychological disability as a result of torture and imprisonment. He is still undergoing treatment, and this happened six years ago.
He found out that there were around four hundred people, including children and the disabled, in the prison.
Is there a law in the United Nations?
Indeed, I am
Because they know how to raise their children.
And the whole meaning without tiring themselves.
And there are values in the West.
Agreed upon, but people...
Some of them are apostates or do not live by the wisdom of Islam; it does not take from them.
Many thanks, Naif Saeed from Kuwait.
Let's return to our guests' comments.
In the call, Suleiman was considering if there was any mental disability.
Yes, it's among the global rankings.
Of course, disabilities include intellectual and mental disabilities, as they are called.
In these disabilities, there are sensory disabilities in the sense of visual or hearing impairments, and motor disabilities.
Certainly, as mentioned, a disability.
Work and reactions that occur within a social context
In the Arab world or any other provinces
Certainly, addressing the disability took a long time.
And even at the United Nations level
Ana biddih, min jihat tajribti w shghli biddit muqarrir khass, min al ashya allati kunt biddi a'mal 'alayha w a'mal fiha translates to: "I believe, from my experience and work as a special decision-maker, from the things I wanted to work on and worked on."
In other words, the right of everyone.
Until they provide them
And the various therapeutic aspects to ensure that they can also enter schools organize work
He worked on vocational rehabilitation, including for people with special needs.
There were improvements.
Especially after the reform
Generally, this international committee is found.
I also want a personal copywriter.
My truth was in my work, and this was positive for me if it was directly shared.
Who supported this position?
I've seen her at many meetings, for example the international conference.
Rights of persons with disabilities
Prohibited by these restrictions or these defects
For example, regarding legal capacity.
Had one of the critical points in the world of anticipation
The United Nations, unfortunately, was a bit late during the preparation and drafting.
Affairs of organizations and agencies
For example, and this is the last word.
World governments and non-governmental organizations based in the United States
We have sent another questionnaire.
In United Nations organizations and agencies in various regions
When do we find out the extent to which they have programs for people with special needs on their agendas?
If there were contributions from people with disabilities.
Human rights
And development problems only.
We receive more than one call, with us now is Meshri Nagi from Algeria. Hello Nagi.
You too
I wanted to ask my sister who exactly the accusation was against.
I wanted to ask, I am physically disabled.
Okay, here is the invitation sent to Naji Mishri from Algeria. Thank you very much, Ahmed.
Hello from Greece!
Good evening, madam. Good evening to your guest.
Health care, accommodation, seasonal clothing, so that they can welcome them in seasonal tourism, and this is what happens in Europe.
And is the number of mentally ill people considered to be among those with special needs?
Especially those who can harm themselves or others.
All we're doing is engaging in unproductive discussions. Thank you.
Huda's sister mentioned the shortage of money.
In poor countries, especially in Africa and Latin America, I am a student.
Establishing an international fund to support disability and allocating one percent of net profit to every organization in the world.
This should be mandatory with no exceptions for any party or company.
The inability will contradict many disabled people, war victims, and so on.
Many thanks, Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
Naji Mashri was thinking and saying, "His problem is that he is disabled."
At the local or national level, meaning across Algeria.
The needs within a society must be fulfilled within that same society.
The same rights that should come to every other person.
In other words, the right to life comes first, then the right to housing, the right to health, and the right to education.
So I really call from here, from this platform, governments, and Arab governments in particular.
For the benefit of the citizen and the individual
To make sure
Needs and rights within existing agendas
What's your problem? What's your problem? What's your problem? What?
To meet the needs of a disabled person or there is no need for this if the state does.
They need to be committed to the work, and they already are.
I recommend that he first refer back to the competent authorities at the government level, if possible.
Because it falls within my national scope and must be within this scope.
They mentioned the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, but many countries have signed it without implementing it consistently.
And here a caller asks us, why are there no laws?
It is a truth universally acknowledged that we are in a human society, which implies a lot of errors and a lot of truth.
Certainly many agreements and undoubtedly many treaties contain no literal obligation.
Or an ideal commitment for many countries that have joined many such as CEDAW and others.
But there are violations and breaches, and we know that.
But the question is adopting an agreement and regulating it.
First, we'll help raise awareness.
This awareness starts at the top of this pyramid with those who make the decisions.
Authorities then gradually grow until they reach the whole society.
And another question is our commitment to reporting, and these reports are submitted to the United Nations.
The problem is knowledge, understanding, and a high degree of awareness.
For the reports I worked on as a correspondent at the United Nations
Yes, from what I've seen and observed, there is interest.
There is no relative advantage to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
By doing that, you'll have advice, encouragement, and an invitation.
It's also important for disabled people to be
And we will hear what Ali Obeid Al-Sanari, President of the Qatar Association for the Deaf and Mute, will tell us.
Mr. Naji will talk about this. Welcome to Mr. Naji and Mr. Ali as well.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
With me is Mr. Ali Obeid Al-Sanara, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Qatar Cultural and Social Center for the Deaf.
led by Her Highness Sheikh Hassa
Former Special Adviser on Disability at the United Nations
As a deaf person from Qatar
And in fact, Sheikh Hessa had a long history as a leader.
And the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which you are referring to now, is indeed
Great benefit for all people with special needs around the world.
And especially the Arab world.
And I hope as a deaf person
For these states to apply this international convention.
It is very important to serve people with special needs.
Truly, there should be someone who can activate this agreement in all states.
Obaid Al-Suni, President of the Qatar Association for the Deaf and Mute
We put
Here we continue our discussion after a short break. Stay with us.
Share your opinions on important issues regarding economy, politics, sports, and other matters.
Al Jazeera Mubasher Text Messaging Service
Consolation for the viewers, welcome back again with our guest today, Sheikhah Hissa Khalifa Al-Thani.
It is an international fund to support.
Disability and its obligation for all countries to provide funds, what is your opinion on this proposal?
The United Nations has a fund called the Disability Fund.
And, unfortunately, those contributions are very weak.
Task of monitoring the implementation of the guidelines
I searched for six years, there was no reasonable support.
Only from China and Austria.
And I always want to thank the state for its support.
The main supporter of the country is my Qatar.
The one who established the office, through which we were able to implement many activities and projects, praise be to God.
Yes, that's due to lack of support showing.
In other words, what we raised initially and always, this point of raising it.
Terms of Ordinary People
The care of individuals with special needs or care for the disabled is called "Special Education" or "Inclusive Education."
This demonstrates a realistic, genuine, and serious commitment.
Under all circumstances in all categories
People with disabilities, refugees, children, the elderly, and women
All of this is possible, we can reach a level called
Equal opportunities, participation, and equality.
And there are always voices demanding that you deserve or that you are tired.
In the Islamic and Arab region, why not allocate a part, sorry.
For the benefit of these programs and projects.
As was presented by him, and I truly thank him for it from this platform.
Islamic Development Bank
Within the allocated budget
Failed to comply with what you told me about paying financial obligations.
Funds to assist people with special needs - do they only include developing countries and Arab states or what?
To an extent, developed countries don't provide aid.
In other words, the person who was before me, who is Swedish.
and some European Union countries
I miss many countries, especially in the Arab region, maybe because
Deny the existence of this special amount.
In my case, what happened.
In Sweden and China
And in the Arab region, unfortunately, there was a lot of promise, but unfortunately it was only one state.
We're going to talk about the Arab region, but
We have more calls with Hamad Al-Marri from Qatar. Hamad, hello.
Peace be upon you
And you too
Hello Dr. Sheikhah Hessa
It was almost ten.
We noticed that this girl, Aida, is psychological.
Would you go to a girl who suffers like you?
With her colleagues
Meaning sometimes even when we stay.
What's your role with the sons and daughters of Qatar?
Many thanks to Hamad Al-Marri from Qatar and Karaouan Behja from Kuwait.
According to them, Sheikhah Hissa
Why don't we leave our oil in the ground?
Those with special needs, we can count them.
And we want to help them.
We have significant financial components.
We are capable of breaking the psychological barrier between us and them.
Reviving the individual's morale
And spend it on this noble cause.
These, if I were truly believing.
Gratitude and appreciation to Sheikhah Hessa for all her efforts and everything she has done during her tenure as the Special Envoy.
With our gratitude and appreciation to her and thanks to the State of Qatar for all it has done for people with special needs.
Many thanks Aisha Mohammed from Qatar
Peace be upon you, Professor Wasila.
Peace be upon you too.
Your noble guest has departed.
Her Highness Sheikhha Hessa
My question is about prevention.
Prevention is better than cure.
No one makes you wise except wars and traffic accidents.
The genetic level may be a result of inbreeding families.
I think it's a large percentage.
My hand is weak.
Thank you very much, the noble scientist from Tunisia. Now I return to our guests.
First place was Hammad Al-Marai, who was inquiring.
Why did you marry a girl with a low IQ?
And who is it that has to go to him?
In every country
Certainly, there are services that cater to all types of disabilities in the State of Qatar.
For these disabilities, whether they are psychological as we mentioned or any mental disabilities
For schools
It was before.
Or what special education means in the Ministry of Education, which is now the Supreme Council.
The Sharif of Tunis decided on something important.
Research papers and the like
I work not just for organizations focused on disability, but even within campaigns.
Programs for women
All this has attracted many campaigns and programs related to reproductive health.
I talked about this aspect.
Adopt healthy strategies.
Based on awareness.
To demonstrate the danger of marrying relatives
And genetic factors
In my opinion, it has been implemented in the State of Qatar.
Habits and traditions, but of course it takes time.
Especially in tribal societies
In Tokih, there will be reactions to it, but there must be legal commitment in its meaning.
"Why, the nightingale of joy inquired and suggested allocating one percent of the budgets of Arab states."
Assisting those with disabilities comes first.
Yes, there was a statistical estimate conducted by the World Health Organization on the world as a whole.
Around forty million people are disabled.
Half of them are girls.
But these numbers are multiplying.
As happened in a study in South Africa where they saw and endorsed
Certainly, the statistics that emerged from the war in Iraq and the war in Gaza.
For every person killed, three come paralyzed.
And since when has the Arab region become the region of unparalleled conflicts?
Even Carywan Behgat's suggestion
One percent is not enough.
To help people with special needs in the Arab region
Topic of kinship for the affected or other marginalized groups
Frankly and honestly, we don't want her to fit in.
It requires addressing their problems and needs.
It is certain that people with special needs are the most neglected.
Events organized by governments often do not consider the disabled.
Correct and this is related to the culture of society and the constraints of society sometimes.
When is the census taken?
Competent Authorities
There is a disabled person in the house.
He is only asked one question: Is there a disabled person?
The relevant department and through the competent individuals there.
We cooperated in preparing the model.
We recommend providing more details.
First, specify the gender of the disabled person, male or female.
And did he get help or not?
In fact, even if the numbers are correct, we haven't reached accurate results.
Interests and concerns should be given priority. Fatima Al-Dosari is with us from Qatar. Welcome, Fatima.
And peace be upon you too.
I am a Qatari citizen and I have a disabled child.
And I thank His Highness, the ruler of my country, Sheikh Hamad.
Sheikh Moza ordered to build this category.
I am very proud to receive all this care and attention.
For her important role
Latifa Al-Messaferi Hello
Because they represent significant ruptures in society without education, without treatment.
Thank you very much.
Abdul Karim from Jordan, hello Nesim.
Karim continued to listen to you.
Peace be upon you too.
God bless you, I'm being honest with you, I have an intervention.
First of all, I'm a sound specialist and I've been working in Qatar for about four years.
We had a month of awareness for speech and hearing problems.
We were holding conferences, lectures, and awareness sessions for the hearing impaired.
Now I want to talk about Jordan. I lived there for about three years.
Frankly, he offers new and beautiful services.
In plain terms, it offers new services, whether material, immaterial, or moral.
Even the Jordanian Ministry of Education, resources
Ministry of Education in public schools
And our private institutes as well.
They receive good support.
Praise be to God, you have a direct question. That's just due to time constraints. Apologies.
Do you have a direct question?
In Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan, there are excellent services, and I think they are wonderful.
Look at these questions from the viewers.
Someone works in this field.
Regarding the subject
I'll bring up the topic of the agreement as well.
He will be obliged to do so as soon as he obtains the ratifications and they join him.
As a duty of the state or these organizations
Because it's based on the issue of the rights of these people, regardless of
And frankly, not
What disabled people can do during that period and why.
And now you wish it had happened.
Certainly I hope so.
I hope that this research or survey is measured and that higher-quality research is provided in this field.
It's clear to me from this experiment as well.
Six years of experience
And coordination between Arab countries as well.
They also have a role, not just rights to receive.
Sheikhah Al-Thani, formerly UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, thank you.
We have now the presenter from the League Channel and the Channel, Lana is on the line, good morning Lana.
Welcome to the creative captain in Umm Salal, Captain Ali Qasim.
Hello, Ali
Hello %pw
Good morning
I want to open the door for congratulations, anyone can congratulate publicly, Lana, please.
I had a five-hour studio session and a two-hour session the day before.
Congratulations to Qatar, the land, the government, and the citizens, they deserve this international achievement.
So I can congratulate Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.
And his heir apparent, Sheikh Tamim
Yes, of course, Lana, you are from the sports field and one of the experts in this area, who knows these lines and this field.
We need even your voice.
And competitive, meaning we deserved the six-vote difference between us and the United States, fourteen votes for Qatar and eight votes for the United States.
Your countries because our file is rich and comprehensive and supported by many ambassadors, well supported, for example stadiums.
Carrying some people afraid, carrying some people %pw, like the US.
And some countries might be willing, they don't need to provide stadiums, and prepare some projects specifically for this event.
Because they are already prepared.
But they were concerned about this point.
Captain Ali, as athletes, I think this is a very significant achievement for sports people.
It will affect the economic, political, and health sectors, I assume.
But, you are athletes.
What does this achievement mean to you?
Certainly, this is a great achievement especially for us, even you saw how non-athletic people were so happy.
God willing, Ali, tell me about the moment of victory announcement.
I was leaving practice and we were listening to the radio.
We were playing around with the ad, my friend and I.
One of your car drivers is sitting and listening to the radio.
the moment
Both of us screamed, of course we had the roof window open.
My friend covered his body outside the car roof.
We were screaming, everyone was watching us, we turned on the flashlights and started our own celebration.
We started the celebration from the beginning.
Alhamdulillah, it was a very special day. I think all the channels focused on this event to a large extent.
Lana, I'll give you a ride in this car.
Especially sports channels
How were they celebrating it and what was their reaction?
Many media outlets and channels from around the world were there.
A very important teacher appeared on the map, Qatar became known.
Of course, Ali, having the player on the team is very important.
And I'm going to assume that this is a responsibility we need to take seriously.
What's your opinion on this specific point?
Hey Ali, do they mention the required attributes to play in the league?
The next upcoming sports events will be more exciting.
And we must prepare a strong generation.
Dally has basic fundamentals and strategies for soccer.
Vimo, what are the rules and regulations that a player should abide by?
And I believe that professionalism includes everything from
Hard, continuous training and discipline
All these are basic things that help you fully focus on gaming or training.
I think each stage has a unique quality.
It's alive and has a unique taste.
Talk shows and sports programs, which do you prefer? Where do you find yourself?
What is wonderful
It helps you maintain your physical fitness and teaches you how to keep healthy through exercise, which is the important part.
Everyone also watches football matches, they will automatically love it when they step onto the field.
What sets apart those who succeed in the media from those who don't?
What troubles you in one part?
He is a supervisor, not just a department head, he is also a step ahead.
What is every sport but sport gre
Ali, there are also some important matters we'd like to discuss with you.
I wish I could go back ten years in age to go to 2022.
Yeah, weren't you?
Certainly, dreaming of this thing now especially as it's the World Cup, now any player
Whoever watches the World Cup is happy, what if they played in the World Cup?
I hope they meet the requirements. This is their chance.
What do you want to say as a professional coach, Captain Ali? What do you want to tell them from the bottom of your heart?
We love having you with us.
As I said, I'm on vacation now, but
Her return to the periodicals after twelve years of absence from the Gulf Championship.
You have a beautiful explanation from Qatar Television and beautiful memories.
God willing, Qatar TV will transform into a university that graduates a large group of media professionals.
Our community is filled with courage and hope, earning many different awards.
Let's talk about an important point regarding Umm Salal Club.
How are you there, how are you, I hope you are well.
Certainly, thank God, safe and sound.
Yesterday, of course, in the studio, we talked about many players.
So, I think some of the young people who were watching us might want to think that you...
Required
It is very common in the Qatari league for players to move to other clubs.
In my opinion, I had a good opportunity in Umm Salal, *as an offer*.
I was able to secure a spot in the Asian Cup with the team, praise be to God.
My situation with the team is very good.
How can we make sports a social issue?
Besides Qatar, how can we spark the interest of women, children, and youth in sports?
Everything is connected, everything is a mathematical complement.
Women play a role in all fields of sport.
And by extension, every individual, whether young or old in this society, is aware of the importance of sports.
More than eleven or twelve years, even to reach this event, is enough.
We have many new generations.
The generation is growing up, but we need to raise a generation that is aware of sports from a young age.
We take Aspire, Aspire is an active building.
Essential for new generations of sports.
We need to be determined and move forward.
And football in particular.
How do we engage the audience in all the different club games?
Insight, the lack of audience is the problem we have in the Qatari league.
The problem is attendance; the Qatar Football Association is still unable to attract the audience.
What method should we use to attract them to these derbies?
It depends on the person themselves, some people don't like to study.
Materially, however, he played a fundamental role in the public's abstention.
And today they use tickets or collected points here.
No, no, the Qatar Football Association has a lot of plans and steps to attract the audience.
Some clubs have ways to attract the audience, like Al-Rayyan. Al-Rayyan is a popular club and doesn't need to attract the audience.
Some clubs %pw, some club management organizes some activities and events.
For viewers, to motivate them, I think these are the only ways.
Played, meaning the new generation.
Love what they do and believe in their ability, and as I said, they don't just need financial support, but also moral support, even more so.
Thank you very much for this wonderful interview, God willing.
So, we'd like to hear your final word on Qatar's win to host the year two thousand and twenty-two, Lana, please.
I reiterate that Qatar is always supported, and
Captain Ali, what are the closing words you would like to say in this interview?
Congratulations and I wish you continued success.
Thank you, Captain and knowledgeable player. I wish you success in your sporting progress and in your life. God bless you.
And I love sports more.
The episode will be about young talents.
Some young people say these songs are popular now, but they have a deep and very good history.
A group of young people singing Arabic words or English words.
Today we're going to talk about this with a group of rap lovers.
We'll understand them better through the direct interview we'll have with them.
Welcome to our program, dear followers, wherever you are.
For many years, a new type of singing ruled the Arab and Gulf scenes.
Coming from the West, particularly from America, which is rap.
Before we start talking about rap music,
There's no harm in using any word without any reservation.
Anyone can sing Rap.
To write lyrics,
Many rap singers write their own lyrics.
So, we will learn all these many and important details from two people who have delved deeply into this field.
They made a good band.
Good morning, Youssef Al-Naemi and Salam Abdullah. Good morning, Youssef.
Welcome, good morning Salman.
Good morning, hello.
I'm very happy that you're with us during this program.
And of course through the topic of rap singing.
Yusuf, how did you get into this?
We find that rap does not exist in Qatar.
In a better way.
Speaking on behalf of the citizen.
Including fun, sadness, and political topics.
Yeah, I'm telling you rap.
And these words, I think that this is an artist painting and a poet writing a poem.
Singing can sing and musicians can play any musical instrument.
Do you think there is acceptance from Qatari society, from Gulf society, for this type of song lyrics?
Two thousand ten.
Do you think people want to buy rap music albums?
Diversity in ages
This is how families and many people are hearing more than before.
There was a website-like thing.
How many of you are in this band so far?
Your statement means that all of you are able to say words, write poetry, and perform in a rap style.
"The one who sings, the rapper."
It is he who plays once and writes the sentence.
Oh, okay!
I ask to listen and tell him that I have recorded this song.
Cool, all these songs you produced, from Salman, from Youssef, from anyone in the same band.
I don't want it to be imagined that it's on a CD and available in the market.
But I know that if I'm the only one, it means I'll have to make the album and put it on the market, which is a difficult commercial record and procedure.
Why didn't you think about that? You're twenty-five and one hand doesn't clap.
May you be two, God willing, you will have twenty-five hands, God protect you all, you are young and brothers.
You want to make a CD, and this CD you can sell through multiple websites online.
You have Facebook, YouTube, and also local newspapers.
I think there are thirteen songs.
Registration isn't like it is now.
It's a bit old, but it was clear.
Not high quality, not like now, but clear.
He made about fifty CDs.
No rap, I can't say there isn't any because there might be young people who knew this art form ten years ago.
This isn't as strong as the recording and I think the distribution over time, now it's different.
Especially since there is diversity in music, a wide range of techno music genres now.
These men and these artists produce a collection of wonderful songs.
We also want to talk about the parties you attended.
See, the party we attended in Doha was one.
It was organized by Al Sadd Club and they were very cooperative.
We cleaned up to see the public.
We were surprised, we weren't expecting such a large number.
And we were also eager to have many families present.
More than the youth
The organization was wonderful.
We were a bit nervous because it was happening for the first time in Doha.
We weren't expecting much more attendance than this.
Interacting with the audience was amazing.
It took a long time, so there were many songs.
With a plan, let's hear something, or lyrical words you've wrapped up, and the audience, especially the young, love them.
I'm listening to some lyrics, so we can show the audience.
Let's hear it live.
Take your time.
Go, Salem.
The problem is that it's random.
We hear.
I don't know.
We are here in the Doha Morning Program.
One longs to come to the program in the morning.
Salman is an expert, this is his fifth year practicing rap.
Until people don't like it.
They don't understand him.
The words are random.
Okay, the songs you've sung, give me some of your previous lyrics.
See, not all songs are random, or as they say in English, "Freestyle."
They are in sync.
When we sing, some words are carefully chosen.
Thank you, let's look.
We say, good morning my country, good morning Aldawah program.
We live on television, for the public.
See what they will represent one by one: two ones.
Together from Doha's morning
The beautiful singing you heard just now.
I insisted that men distribute it everywhere and on the internet.
Thank you very much, when are you going to release it?
Teamwork
Everyone composes themselves.
He doesn't know how Sohail does her work.
Everyone wrote.
Certainly, I imagine every artist, whether a painter or a poet, always...
He can also write about his love for sports.
Our country is our love.
It's clear that you participated in the National Day.
Through the beautiful maawil, you see the youth of Qatar.
I think Doha is shining to welcome the Asian Cup, and there will be a celebration on the corniche.
For this party
We don't want to send you this video directly.
"Welcome to the Asian Cup, Doha"
From Doha Airport until now
Let's see these live images.
Reception, audience, our children, students
The Asia Cup arrived at Doha airport this morning to continue.
Preparations to host the major continental event
We would like to welcome back our guests Youssef and Salman, whom we are happy to have with us.
They're a Gulf rap group, right?
Can we call it that?
Currently, in terms of health, we are...
A plan to organize a party, but it's not confirmed.
But, you are working on a party that will announce, God willing, Jesus.
Inshallah, but not confirmed, still pending.
You're still at the beginning of your journey. I wish you all the best, and be assured that our program will support you wholeheartedly.
And also Salman, where do you all meet, all twenty-five of you?
Why do we talk, and how do we connect ideas with each other?
Certainly, there are some shared songs.
We need someone like Salman or Youssef, or any of you, to sing a whole song.
There is no other option but cooperation among you all.
Frankly, it's very difficult to bring together the twenty and the five in one place.
Start contacting Yasef and the others and tell them to gather in one place.
Considering the song and the lyrics
And there's another way.
I claim my part.
And it is continuous.
"Be patient and keep away from her."
And witness other experiences.
Collect some CDs of famous artists.
Do you benefit from their experience and techniques?
Certainly, always.
Artists who have been doing this for years and have experience in the field.
We listen to them, learn techniques, and try to come up with a unique style.
Because if we did the same thing, with the same tone, and the same words,
They're not working on anything new. I want us to do something.
We benefit a little from them.
Yes, there is also a large group of Gulf youth, in the Gulf.
Primitively, let's look at the report together, benefit and enjoy, let's see it together.
These talents that some people have are strange.
Using very primitive tools
Abu Ibrahim Abdullah al-Daeeli
This is one hundred and fifty kilometers.
The capital of Saudi Arabia is Riyadh.
He has good experience and abilities.
From the discovery of shallow groundwater sites
Deeper than a hundred meters
You know that drilling a well is very expensive.
Determining the appropriate location for the well's digging, but with the expert it is possible.
Discover or locate
Groundwater sites
Since ancient times
Our father found us.
Simply walk with the expert to go with him to the well.
To dig
Abu Ibrahim Techniques in Groundwater Exploration
Modern talks
Soil analysis in laboratories
He relies on God's grace in his work.
And it flows underground.
What is either sticks of pomegranate?
Pomegranate branches or fig branches
Now, the process of watercourse detection is being applied scientifically.
To close, this is the end of the broadcast.
Come back again.
Return
So, from here, we start putting a mark.
And here, the flow ends.
Requires a lot of experience and patience.
To know the sensitivity of a movement.
I went to many places.
Ninety-nine percent of success
Of course, this way and using copper bars.
And there is no precise scientific explanation for it.
This is the way.
What really baffles is the success rate of those practicing this primitive profession.
Over ninety-five percent
In the search for shallow groundwater reservoirs
Glory to God, who taught man what he did not know. This report is from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Who had their own band and more than one CD?
Whether online or by phone
At times, there are competitions between Gulf countries, such as Qatar vs. Bahrain and Qatar vs. Kuwait.
They are releasing a stronger song on a stronger topic.
Treatment problem, etc., there are a lot of issues.
Be a role model for me to follow.
God wills it.
And at the same time, we want
Broadcasting a wide range of songs
As much as possible
Sometimes, I stay in touch with you.
To keep us updated on the band's latest news.
But let's object to the band's name.
These Rappers
Let's go back to our guests on the corniche and enjoy the beautiful weather.
I'm watching the moon with you through this live link.
There is nothing in Qatar that compares to Asia.
We are proud of them and their wonderful arts.
Addresses various social and psychological issues of youth
but he has only two with us in the studio
They're going to let the others go.
Yusuf and Salman, welcome again.
Sometimes the subscription expires.
We tried to contact the company, but no one answered.
It is necessary for you as a team to evolve, people in
Facebook and YouTube
and other similar sites
Band name
You will find us among the first search results.
Organize and work together on this great production.
Are you writing and adding pictures with the songs? Are these personal pictures?
Just download them from YouTube and websites that contain videos, and one can follow them.
Some of us have done it before.
So many songs
The obstacles you face, as if you don't have a company to adopt you, you don't have a website.
A real need for a place where you can all meet as a team.
What are your wishes that you want to fulfill?
Who promotes us?
Take us an album.
I hope there's something official.
Because we've been together for five years.
Hobby, I'm alive.
We shared some things, some series.
We hope that it has improved.
And we need to be with someone who supports us and stays with us.
Ah, Salman, we also want to know what your wishes are.
My only job is to produce a music video.
We wish you success.
We hope that all your songs become famous in the Middle East.
The frog found a very beautiful and famous place.
And he carried a message, as I said now.
Good luck, Inshallah. I hope all the best for you.
Hello everyone, and we wish you success.
We'll end with the song they made especially for the show.
Had a KD and DJ MREldoha program
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
KJ Hada Mrs Bobo with SKT one hot to body
We say, good morning my country, good morning Aldawah program.
We live on television, for the public.
Don't forget, the show airs at nine thirty. Everyone has to watch.
See what they will represent one by one: two ones.
Together from Doha's morning
Producer: Hasan Al-Naama, Presenter: Shaima Al-Hamd
The director is Nasser Al-Malki, and the guests are Qatar's rappers, of course.
It can be repeated and used at home.
Like a shopping cart or a shopping trolley.
He shops at the supermarket.
What do you have for sale or anything you want to buy?
A large screen will appear with the components of this item.
The rooster was crowing and flapping its wings.
Just a barcode, scan it in the cart to discover the product.
They facilitate the shopping process for the buyer.
Shakes you, brings up all the details on the screen.
I believe it raises health awareness.
As long as the device is with you or in the car.
Ingredients
Any warnings, side effects
Full details
Or ambitious, for example there are a number of projects, about four or five.
Dealing with traffic problems
He talked about traffic congestion and other issues like the parking problem. He was very creative and it was really nice.
Insha'Allah, Center for Children's Culture
Sir Abdullah, could we talk about the various activities that will be held in the coming days?
We want to talk to you about some surprises, but we'll mention them briefly.
Thoughts, I don't know if you want me to refer to one of the programs that were presented or
For example, in transporting people underground, the brilliant idea is
A man leaves his house one day, finds an elevator.
And they gathered in one place.
I think all the viewers are enjoying the pictures they are watching now.
Children's Creations
Truly, it's like an ATM.
For ladies, for example, I have a card.
Go in and tell them I need a T-shirt.
This is an example of some shops, or if I'm missing things at home like keys.
This is lost, for example, the office key.
We have a fundamental goal set by Her Highness Sheikh Moza.
His happy wife
At an early age, this is of great importance in project design.
Three hundred selected children
Let's leave the speakers and speeches to each other.
Yes, she was the one who hosted the closing ceremony.
To showcase our programs, we must open the doors to interested children.
And then they can start.
We need them to be there and provide us with support, it's a priority for us.
These programs and activities serve the main idea.
I have various and diverse skills for children.
Self-improvement
No, do you have any collaboration with youth clubs in Qatar?
And there are also scientific clubs in Qatar.
Certainly, all our programs are built on the exchange of ideas.
It's just a professional partnership.
With other community service institutions specialized in enhancing such talents
Involvement of all concerned institutions
Photography Club
The Innovation Center for Girls, and the Cabinet's Secretariat played a very important role.
Yes, they played a crucial role in explaining Qatar's vision.
Training children
Engaging and encouraging children, with every program built on institutional partnerships.
According to the type of projects and institutions
And what does that change?
Being here in Qatar gives us a strong boost and support.
And I carried you.
Now, in partnership with Qatar, we are finalizing some projects that will be ready to launch in the coming two months.
Certainly, there is collaboration in many programs.
Especially when it comes to reading.
Chairperson of the Supreme Council for Family Affairs
And we're driving it, especially since we're in the preparation stage.
To build a promising future for all children, the next generation, and youth.
What is the last word you would like to say to the parents and children watching us now and wishing to join the center?
More than we're giving them now.
Sometimes our daughters have ideas that we should not neglect.
We must consider their ideas, no matter what.
Because when we take it seriously, it will develop, at least we will encourage the child to think.
So it's important to give the child care and affection.
And spiritually as well, our problem is that most fathers
Support him.
And they encourage him, so we encourage the parents.
When we overemphasize the imagination of the child, today's children are the roots of the future.
We took a tour of the exhibition, looking at the projects.
We lived the dream.
Dreaming and thinking were the result of boundless imagination.
And the nipples become real, as many of them have achieved it and became real.
Praise be to God, we wish our children who were there success.
Our hearts are with you.
God wills it.
They are of different ages and different nationalities.
Even seventy projects
It is very pioneering and worthy of implementation.
Let's talk more about this national exhibition.
And the culture center for children as well.
Sayyid Abdulla, tell us a little about the museum.
There were a lot of activities, of course, so what do you say about them?
Children showcased a new style of expressing nationalism and loyalty to their country.
Sponsored by the Minister of Education
On the museum tour
I'll work until thirty.
We started training children to see Qatar's 30 in all its three themes.
Human development, economic development, sustainable development, environmental development
First, to know Qatar's position in thirty-three.
Then, let him begin to think about what comes next.
Creative ideas, and how to be innovative.
I think they have a broad mind.
But why didn't we help him?
Assuming their minds will grow bigger and bigger.
Sir, you are the host of the show under the slogan "Dreams of a Generation, Facts or the Nation of Tomorrow."
A slogan says "Dreams of a Generation"
It will be part of Qatar's future, Qatar's tomorrow.
We felt thirsty with the children, when the child said to the minister,
I want you to open my project. I invite you to visit my project for twenty to thirty minutes.
A child thinking before twenty years.
They demonstrated their love for their country in the field they are passionate about.
There might be some activities, events, and competitions.
One of them won the Stars of Science award.
They were also the winners of the first prize in the Arab League.
Certainly, all children.
On the margins, there were various displays according to a certain schedule.
To display the projects they have done
No great existence, a very unique existence.
Stars of science
Some of the winners in the projects that participated in the exhibition.
Who won one of the major prizes?
What is an innovative or creative forest or reserve?
No, we don't want to talk about the black football.
The colorful ball is also part of the dreams and goals of Qatar's children for Qatar's future.
It's an idea for thirty twenty.
How can a child contribute with a creative idea for thirty-twenty?
The main concepts are that there is a slice inside the ball.
The referee gives a colored warning.
For example, the referee can see the ball's movements.
Or the field changes through this electronic slide.
There is a stop in the ball.
Some people might ask, of course it's the main idea, there are creative ideas.
and projects
In other words, we've come this far.
Developing skills and broadening horizons
I see how they express their patriotism through these projects.
Give them confidence in how to present the project, engage with the audience, and explain its idea.
In a field they love, connected to something they love, all of that is an achievement.
He provided support, for which we are grateful.
Which is currently in the development phase
And so the public, the committee, and some responsible people supported the projects.
Third, no, it was the second, because this girl
Doors, channels for the presence of the audience underground, and the way spectators enter need to be regulated.
A very large protected forest.
Where a visitor can go, wander, and see animals and reptiles.
And there are also sensors placed on some animals to monitor their condition.
What exists is also a marine environment, the way of entry is also creative.
One of the reasons she won was her broad and detailed imagination.
All of this he did to win.
No one talks about an underwater tourism city anymore.
Butterfly City
A forest on Earth.
And many tourism ideas.
Very passionate
They might be thinking that now, or in thirty or twenty years.
And in the future, it will be achieved.
Three projects.
Awarded by the Science Club, they said these are the projects we should work on.
There's no project for it, the excess water from the AC.
See the Arab newspaper.
The article says, Qatar University is celebrating graduation.
The presence of His Excellency Mr. Saad bin Ibrahim Al Mahmoud.
Minister of Education and Higher Education, Secretary General of the Higher Education Council
And Dr. Sheikhah bint Abdullah Al-Masnad, President
A new record for the university without a doubt.
Qatar University and Calgary University
And we have great news about our students.
What is an academic achievement, and we wish them success, God willing, in all specialties.
He is considered among the young actors who are making a strong entry into the Qatari drama scene.
Except when, also classifications and colored threads.
Actor Abdelhamid Charshani is considered one of the actors who built themselves.
If it wasn't convincing.
He won't work in jobs that are done within Qatar.
Currently, actor Abdelhamid Sharshani is participating in two series: Killer Instinct and Tasanif Part Two.
We're happy to have him as our guest this morning.
We can talk to him about his participation in these two works and about his overall experience.
Welcome and good morning.
We are happy to have you on Good Morning Doha. This is my first time meeting you, and it's your first time on Good Morning Doha.
Who do they want to strive with in the program?
And you, Ms. Lisa.
Welcome aboard. Before we start the conversation,
Sweet, let's see.
I am a responsible man and an executive manager.
And I enforce the laws.
The only thing I can tell you
Give me the bisht.
Listen, why are you asking me?
Walk and ask them, if anyone agrees to come in the bisht.
Of course I have another question to start with, but since we've seen this part of the series, it's like the first part.
Surely you will find Khalid ibn al-Walid.
Some historians link the famous poet Amr ibn Qays to the city of Marrat.
A lot of things and information related to this city in Saudi Arabia.
For more information, we'll take a look at this excellent report from our colleague, Abdurrahman Marshud.
Let's see it together.
Certainly, this is a testimony from people who know about praise and preference.
As evidence of the history of this city or that one.
We often see her effects and often hear her stories and poets.
Their sweets are classic and unmodernized, which is why this is an important additional register to the city's records.
The city is one of the cities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Historically, this city was founded in the pre-Islamic era.
There has been a debate among historians about how it was named.
Some believed he was named after the famous poet Imru' al-Qais al-Kindi.
The tower that was named after him.
Its creation date is unknown.
In the pre-Islamic era.
Very famous in the city of Marrat is Mount Kumait, upon which many proverbs have been built.
Because it's in the city and close to it.
This is a historical site.
This view is considered a tourist attraction in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
A female pedestrian made a great effort in her work.
A garden on this mountain
And seating areas for citizens and everyone in the kingdom.
He used this name after the great companion Khalid ibn al-Walid (may Allah be pleased with him).
Fighting the hypocrites and the lying Muslim.
And among its ancient ruins is Wadi Qumayt.
A place where the waters of the valley gather and are stored for a long time.
It was one of the most important sources of water in the past.
From its ancient monuments, the Al-Dohi House of Heritage.
Marat is a city with a history dating back to pre-Islamic times.
He was famous for his poets who were influenced.
By its beauty, its ruins, and its famous mountain Komet.
Abdulrahman Al-Marshed for the Doha Morning Program,
The city of Marat, north of Riyadh.
Let's go back to our dear guests.
I hope you can tell us and the viewers about those methods and means.
Initially, you stated that our infrastructure is very special.
We open a page for him and register through a special log in our system.
Parent's mail
This report contains a range of attention, typing speed, reading speed, and overall distraction.
The guard is taking a full report.
Sweet, this report will be added to the student's file.
Register your son online.
And he perceives the progress of his son.
He can see the grades and his interest with the teachers.
We really enjoy the intelligence of this beautiful girl.
When we can bring more children to the center and send them our greetings.
I registered at this center with a teacher there.
To know her intelligence and the level she has reached since she joined the center.
Certainly, this year.
Focus on one task and after Ramadan.
But of course this affects other work, always.
Some people only watch TV during Ramadan.
He stayed up watching TV, and people turned their months of worship into TV.
Shortage, shortage, shortage, a chain of shortages, shortage, let them do one job every two years, is that better?
Certainly.
I wish they love me in Ramadan.
But I send greetings to all of you.
And God willing.
And also with plays.
From drama to fashion.
Mushu is a fashion designer working at the Culture Drop Village.
Certainly, we continue with you with great love and integrity.
Develop children's abilities and competencies further.
Shel is different from the multiple schools in this vast state.
We have a model and we told the guest we had before.
We now have Mr. Ibrahim Hussein Abdelsalam with us. Welcome and good morning.
How are you, Amnia?
I'm fine.
How old are you now?
Professor Ibrahim, to start with, could you introduce us to the course offered by the center?
This is everywhere.
We're going to try the method that Ms. Nesma talked about with her.
Do you think he's got a screw loose?
Do you feel that these skills and methods,
None of that will change his mental abilities or even his educational level.
Scientific methods
The child's initial assessment includes an international test called the Tony Test before starting anything in the program.
Beginning of the second part of Tony's test
We can measure the level or the change in the student's level through it.
Now a test or something like that is going to be done.
A wish that will come true and will be immediately fulfilled on the live broadcast.
Certainly, Oumnya knows nothing about the questions.
I want this for their survival.
Certainly, I have another question to start with.
We would like to ask you about your participation in the second part this year.
What is your contribution, can you tell us about it?
Certainly, after we presented the classifications series of the first part,
Thank God, I've been lucky in several roles.
Mr. Ghanem,
Distribute roles with the executive director Ashraf Shahat with Mr.
A chance from Tara for artistic production
Youth
Mr. Ghaniem nominated me this year for
Of course, each episode is different.
I have in more than one episode where I will play different characters.
And vice versa, it's a great experience. In this job, here.
The pyramids of Kuwait are my pyramids, Mr. Saad Al-Faraj.
We have representatives from Bahrain, Abdullah Malik, Ali Al Gharair.
We also see Ali Mirza.
You have another group of young actors like Abdullah Azzam.
Yes, among the young actors, we have Abdullah Al-Assam.
This happened a year ago, and last year we did two projects per year.
Perhaps that's why I asked you before I went on air. You've been working since 1997.
I either achieved what I could, or my ambition in acting.
Thank God for everything.
Did you study acting, or was it just a hobby?
No, I do it as a hobby.
I took acting as a gift. The one who nurtured me at the beginning was the artist Abdulaziz Jassim.
He is one of the actors who considers me as his son.
If he needs anything, I'll provide it for him.
We were in all of his shows.
We worked hard, praise be to God.
Now, without Tara, a very special thank you to Sheikh Abdulrahman Al-Sulaiti, a very, very special thank you to Sheikh Abdulrahman.
If we compare ourselves to Kuwait. In Kuwait, every year, between twelve and sixteen new representatives come. Why?
To them.
Certainly, thank him greatly for providing so many opportunities.
But, a little,
We talked about the second series, we had an idea about its genres.
We need to know about the killer instinct.
And the foot too.
We have a sample, we have with us the processor Mr. Abdulaziz Al-Muyouf Al-Tamimi.
Why is this happening in the air?
And we can see how we deal with the person. First of all, I would like to say good morning to Professor Sabah bin Hamza, welcome.
Hello, and peace be upon you.
For now, sir, let's start with you.
Inshallah
In the name of God
We hold hands.
We see the nerve.
It is like a painting or a message from God Almighty, showing all the organs in your body.
From the inside and its problems
I sometimes feel dizzy.
I have a headache and feel dizzy.
Keep your hand cheap, keep it cheap. Keep your nerves cheap, we want.
These, Sir Abdulaziz, you will discover something special from his hand. He suffers from a special disease.
On his left side. In his ears, he has a mild infection in his middle ear.
No pain! This is a blessing, Sir Abdelaziz.
Ear. Do you have a problem with your ear?
I remember and I remember as a baby.
Do you feel pain here as well?
What are the lateral nasal cavities!
Do you have a pain in your nose and does your head hurt here?
I have a headache here.
He has a problem with his sinuses.
It gives him a headache between his eyes.
Weight increases without eating.
The ring doesn't have a good job, you feel lazy and don't want to do anything all the time, and you feel your body is heavy.
I sleep a lot.
It's either oversleeping or laziness; you're always feeling tired.
Why do you always have a sore throat?
Hey. Look at the tickling, you see the tickling.
He suffered from tension and it's not going to happen again, hopefully.
Are you from Tunisia?
Wow, you mentioned things about him.
Is this book useful for children?
Your mother's finger, glorified be God, would be the size of a child's palm.
Most children don't sleep, why is that?
He's not going to fart, he doesn't like to fart, but people think he likes to fart. He has gas in his stomach, God bless you.
As soon as Mother gives her thumbs-up.
In the palm of the child's hand.
The hands are parallel and the child is parallel to them.
Let's see it, so that every mother learns this move.
She's going to start pushing like this. Right and left, right and left.
This job is about kids, about, about, about kids and it's sweet.
Cool, regarding discoveries, do you have any special discoveries specific to women?
As we said, in every house, ninety percent of the women, may God protect them.
First, caution about ceramic tiles on the floor.
As long as we walk barefoot on ceramic, it's fine, but walking on flat ground is dangerous.
Walk barefoot! The proof is when they use ceramics in homes, health problems have increased.
Because it's cool and even.
What was simple, they had problems, they suffered from asthma.
Increased.
Women should be keen to focus on walking barefoot on the ankle.
It was this foot and the heel area, which is vulnerable to the cold, that he kissed.
From here, it's the heel and now below the ankle.
This is the first discovery, the second discovery is a way to facilitate delivery.
Focus a little with me.
In her seventh or ninth month.
Okay, but it will be in the delivery month.
Delly doesn't come at eight, eight is dangerous, and even more dangerous is walking barefoot.
A pregnant woman should be careful not to walk barefoot.
If it had been on time.
I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan: "And shake towards you the trunk of the palm tree, it will let down to you fresh dates."
We know that Mary, peace be upon her, did not know that her provision was coming to her.
Why did I even discuss it with the scholars, and they told me: "Why are you changing the interpretation of Ibn Kathir?"
I told them, "I am giving you the idea that God placed in this science, and He is motivating me."
I shake the palm tree trunk towards you, when the tree shakes, what does it look like?
It's sharp like thorns or spikes.
She kept shaking the tree, ordering the concrete, which is the concrete area, here in the middle.
This is the amniotic membrane. It helps to facilitate childbirth and the baby's return to a head-down position.
Increase the fetal head or reposition it until it comes out naturally.
Glory to God, this is one of the benefits of this fruit.
Hold the hand and start to relax it.
Some use it as a habit, and some know it as a science.
That's why they're afraid to tell you, and you don't believe them.
Yes. Sir Abdulaziz, your discoveries are important.
But I want to ask you another question because time is passing by so quickly.
If someone loves to contact you, someone loves to contact you, any private email or yours.
Sweet, the mobile number is in the control room. If anyone wants to communicate with Mr. Abdulaziz, they can contact us after the program.
Of course, on Qatar TV, the numbers, so they can call us and take this number.
I was created only to serve people.
If we believe in our faith, God will bless you in your work and deliver people.
I have sins like other people and I do everything you can imagine. I'm an ordinary person.
But we wish for more than that.
We always think of good.
Watch closely, spectators. I hope you enjoyed this segment about reflexology and palm healing.
And also through the foot.
Show us a live model in the air, how he discovered the diseases this person has.
And he gets it. Hoping we can benefit from you, and if anyone loves to get in touch, they can read about you through the internet.
The way it will be implemented, whether in the coming days or years, or whether it will include other schools.
Good morning
How do you evaluate this experience?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
The truth is that obesity in the Gulf countries has become a big problem.
So, they were afraid that Qatar would become the fifth state with them.
I watched the program, honestly, and it was about the first woman in New York.
I visited Doha, and they have a program for someone.
They offered it to us, we take it and say it's normal.
Our students with students from New York, Spain, and England,
Therefore, we can observe the level of our students in Qatar among the world, and this is something we want in the future.
Because we encourage students to eat fruit.
Wessam plays sports.
Of course, the fifth week is your family meal with your family.
We killed two birds with one stone.
In the sixth week, he tells us about what he gained from this experience. Praise be to God, we are at the conclusion today.
We are happy with the students.
I know they were three independent schools, for the boys of Abu Ubaydah,
Independence for girls Rania
And in high spirits.
The family was more aware, and their brothers were enthusiastic at home and started eating this food like them.
Insight is a culture shared between the student, and they transfer this culture to their home and family.
He goes and tells them, they gave me this or they taught me this.
The training staff or whoever provided this information to the students,
How did you choose him and how was the contact made with the students? Who made the contact?
Yes, there were many authorities who helped us, God bless them.
We have brothers at the diet center who teach them about food, healthy food of course.
And learn from Lady A'isha Al-Tamimi the etiquette of eating.
How they control themselves, how they set their priorities!
To learn about cooking, sports, or teaching the value of healthy food.
It was in the form of separate lessons or curricula.
How do these ideas reach the students?
In various ways, some within the school,
We organized a day at the beginning of the program in the Aspire zone, gathering all the male and female students.
This isn't really about any one person, but we're all responsible, responsible, because these are our children.
These students, how they excel from the beginning!
I initially said that the results were satisfactory.
Is it enough to have three classes or special classes in these schools?
Now, what you experience in the world, when you start, doesn't start on a large scale.
It starts from a reasonable range with all the properties; sons, daughters, independent, and private.
What is suitable in our culture, environment, and family conditions, such as their acceptance of things for their children and their non-acceptance of other things.
They're looking at the participants, and overall, this is very important.
A 12th or 13th-grade student is at the right age to learn about their health.
This is a struggle for many people who want to be thin, but think it's impossible.
Some of the actors he saw in the movies looked serious, he said this is impossible, no!
We talked in detail, but there were many weeks we couldn't cover.
And through the morning of Doha, we can remind them of it.
And the fruits that contain vitamin B that you can consume from fruits and vegetables.
For a person must know the benefits of fruits and know that if he eats them, his health will improve, so he will be in high spirits.
Regarding the fruits, they went to the supermarket and took their fruits.
So, that's the point.
Of course they vary and compete, each school was creative with its different ideas for its teachers.
Spirit of competition.
We provide them with guidelines and they all have to be creative.
Did the teachers train the students, or do you have special employees?
We trained them, we trained them.
But some teachers were adding, for example, some schools like Abu Obeida said they would enable Saturday for student activities.
This is a day outside of school hours, they decided to take it, Rania's school said they will go in a procession.
They said they were going to have a healthy cooking day for the girls, but we didn't let the boys cook healthy on their own. The girls were more skilled at it.
I also want to thank Rayyan Water Company for providing all the water free of charge to schools, Rayyan Water Company for this.
Of course, water is healthier because you need to cleanse your body of all these toxic substances that enter it daily through water.
We said the third week.
Meaning his body is moving.
That's why he wants to play soccer or basketball, and he has no idea that this is the game I love.
True, true, exactly, and some might want another game, perhaps they don't like team games.
Welcome with us live.
Mr. Abdul Aziz Al-Jaber, founder and manager of the Qatar Meningitis Association, welcome.
While we're focusing, we can also concentrate on important topics.
We would like to introduce and present to our dear visitors what is multiple sclerosis?
Because this name might be strange to us as well.
The number of women was greater than the number of men.
All the treatments available now are preventive treatments.
The white cells that are supposed to protect us start
Kills us with neural cell exhaustion
I'll make it easier for the audience, it's like a cable.
Covered with a layer called myelin, we say it's the nylon layer.
Certainly, it generally leads to dizziness and double vision, diplopia.
I have problems with my digestive and respiratory systems.
In the worst-case scenario, it leads to madness, and results in quadriplegia or paralysis.
Of course, the treatments.
The most important functions of the body will be severely affected.
This disease is called multiple sclerosis.
Some theories say that it is transmitted through a virus.
The disease is non-epidemic.
It doesn't happen at night.
Some people consider it a disease depending on the region.
The equator, for example, was excluded from this disease.
Currently, we have some cases of this disease on the equator.
This disease still has no cure because its cause is unknown.
So far, scientists have been unable to determine the cause of the disease, which is why they cannot find a cure for it.
Currently, the process has been reversed.
They try to avoid the impact of the disease itself on the human body.
In other words, they start working backwards.
We might be a little afraid of this topic, which we can say that this disease comes suddenly.
Is there a particular group, a community where you feel this disease has spread more within a specific group?
Internationally ranked between twenty and forty.
Currently, the international community for diseases itself has reduced the number from twenty to fifteen.
Because it started affecting young people up to the age of forty.
But man doesn't heal from it.
Of course, as a society, we are open to alternative medicine and prophetic medicine.
Yes, through the community, Multiple Sclerosis Society Qatar.
Why is this community like this?
There was a large group, so I thought about creating an association for this subject.
Certainly, I'll give you some random numbers.
In Kuwait, they say there are sixteen thousand cases.
A thousand cases.
The Gulf countries remain between one hundred and three hundred.
When was I diagnosed, five or six years ago?
My number was sixty or forty-six.
Will there be any symptoms indicating that the patient is living with this disease?
We're not certain it's a virus, so we don't want to take a particular theory, that's the point.
The second point is how do I know if I have it or not.
This is very difficult.
I'm lost! Oh, Sir Abdulaziz, I'm trying to find a specific point.
