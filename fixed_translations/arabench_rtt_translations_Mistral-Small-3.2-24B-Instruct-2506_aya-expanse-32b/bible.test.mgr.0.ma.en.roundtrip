He had another Jesus, a silent one. He left him among them.
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."

If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the Kingdom of Heaven with one hand or foot than to go to hell with two hands and two feet. In hell, the fire burns forever.
The law can put your eye out, blind it and burn it. It's a thousand times better to poke someone's eye with one of yours and end up in the fires of hell. The story of the beloved fish.
Don't neglect any of these children. They are not telling you. Their angels in heaven may come at any time to see the Father in heaven.
(No
What do you say? Imagine a man has 100 sheep, one of them gets lost. Would he leave the 99 sheep on the hills? Would he go search for the one that's lost?
We're just talking to you like this. If a sheep gets lost, they search for it more than they search for eighty-nine others.
I don't have any issues with my dad about life. He doesn't have the right to criticize this decision. When he gets back to you.
If your brother wrongs you, forgive him. Tell him what he did was wrong. Keep it between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won him back.
But the law is not so? You have one or two witnesses. The Bible says: "Every word shall be established by the mouth of two or three witnesses." (Deuteronomy 19:15)
But how can he not hear the witnesses? He was right there in the church. And if he can't hear like that, then why does he do it? He does it like a pagan or a hypocrite.
This is what I keep telling you is true. Don't close it on the ground, it's not closed in the sky. Don't open it on the ground, it's not open in the sky.
More or less, that's the meaning. You've been searching for something in life, something that exists, and this high holiday is your celebration.
"Anyone who can gather thirty people in this place by name, is with them." The servant who does not have mercy on them.
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"
"It's strange, I don't have seven times, but 77 times."
The kingdom from heaven is like kings who want to gather all the money that the servants want.
When the king wanted to do it, they put a lot of obstacles in his way.
A man was unable to pay his debt. They auctioned off his possessions, but no one bid. The man, his wife, children, and all he owned had to be sold to retrieve the debt.
The servant knelt before him. "Give me time," he pleaded. "I'll give you everything back."
My lord had mercy on him. He forgave his debts and let him go.
I wanted this servant to leave and find another one to give him a few dollars. This servant is Abdou and he started to blackmail me. "Give me back what you have!" he said.
The boy grew up on horseback. "I want to ride," he wailed. "I need you."
"No, the first time she refused. I wanted to, but the man insisted and took the prisoner to jail. The man will stay here until he can pay the fine he owes."
The other servants saw what had happened. They were numerous. They went and told the master everything that had happened.
Then, the master called the first servant. "O servant of the masters," he said, "I have observed all that is in your care, and I am pleased."
Can't you forgive the workers as you forgave them?
So Siddo got angry and had the guards punish him until he paid everything he owed.
"How is this like what your father does in heaven for every one of us as a community with your brothers from a shared heart."
Jesus teaches about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Many people followed him. He healed them there.
Some Pharisees came to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Didn't you like what you read, that in the beginning the Creator "made them male and female" (Genesis 1:27)?
He said, "Therefore a man leaves his father and mother and joins his wife, and the two become one." (Genesis 2:24)
What God has joined together, let no one separate.
They said, "But why was it permitted for Moses to give a man the right to divorce his wife with a writ of divorce?"
Ajis said: "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because you were weak. But that was not the way it was supposed to be from the beginning."
I wish I could replace you. Every time someone gets divorced, they regret it and wish they had stayed with their ex. Adultery is written. A man can divorce his wife, but only if you are not a faithful one.
Students told him, "If that's how it is between a husband and wife, it's better not to get married."
Ajis Redo: "Not everyone is able to accept the idea of remaining single. But those who have received help to live without marriage are able to accept it."
Some men cannot be married because they were born that way. Some were made that way by others. Others have made themselves that way for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Anyone who can accept living that way should do so." Little children were brought to Jesus.
Some people brought small children to Jesus. They wanted to place their hands on them and pray over them, but the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me. Do not hinder them. For to such belongs the kingdom of heaven."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he went away from there. Jesus and the rich young man.
A man came to Lisa and said, "Teacher, what must I do to have eternal life?"
"Why do you ask Me about what is good?" Jesus replied. "There is only one who is good. If you want to enter the kingdom, obey the commandments."
"Layan?" the man said. Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness."
Honor your father and your mother. (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) And "Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"I've been defying all these orders," the young man said. "So, what shouldn't I do?"
"If you want to be complete, go and sell all you have and give to the poor. You will have treasure in heaven; then come and follow me."
The young donkey didn't listen to this, he went away sad. He was very rich.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
"Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."
Our parents heard this, they were very surprised. They asked, "How is this possible?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter said to us, "Let's go on your roof! Do you want to hang out there?"
"It is the Spirit that gives life," Jesus answered them, "the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and life. But there are some of you who do not believe." For Jesus knew from the beginning who those were who did not believe, and who it was that would betray him. And he said, "This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled him." "When the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
Everyone who leaves houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.
But many of those who saw him said, "This is truly the prophet." Others said, "This is the Messiah."
The Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a man who owned a vineyard. He went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
One of them wrote a letter to the owner of the land. After writing it, they went to the market together.
Your time is up.
They said to him, "Aren't you going to work in my fields? I will pay you the right wage."
Go away. "Leave now, before it's too late."
"We've been waiting since early morning, and this crowd is getting restless. The leader said, "If you want us to believe your lies every day, you better have something substantial to show for it."
" 'Because no one has hired us,' they answered. He said to them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard.' "
"Come on, let's play the game of the three lies. I'll start. I said: 'The three workers and their boss. It started with the last worker who was lying. Then the boss came after him.' Then the first worker started."
The workers I hired around five o'clock arrived. Each of them received the usual daily wage.
The big fish eat the small ones, but each of them will get their fair share of the catch.
Let's take him, and the bride will follow.
"If the secretaries hadn't arrived late, they would have worked for six hours today," he said. "They arrived at six. We started the meeting and wrote down the agenda while the sun was setting, writing today's date."
When their friend gave them an answer, one of them said, "Buddy, I'm cool with you. Weren't we agreed on the regular daily wage?"
Take your money and go. I'll give the same amount to the ones who brought them.
Don't I have the right to ask for my money back from a worker who didn't do what I wanted? Are you living as if you've failed because of what you sold to others?
The saying of Jesus: "Those who are behind will be in front, and those who are in front will be behind." Jesus continued to speak about his impending death.
Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem. Along the way, he took the twelve disciples aside to speak to them.
"I heard the Family," he said. "The son of Adam is destined for the tents and the teachers. They will judge him to death."
"Come, she gave birth to us in misery, misery clings to us and never lets go. Misery is what keeps us in chains. Today, thirty years later, she is still the one who keeps death at bay!" That's when I realized it was Jesus.
Mama Zabad's daughters came to me, Jesus. Her daughters came with her. As she grew older, she asked him to heal her.
"See, Trish?" Jesus said. She said, "He promised me that one of my two sons would sit at your right hand in your kingdom. He promised me that the other would sit at your left."
"You don't know where you're going," Jesus told them. "Can you drink the cup I am about to drink?" They answered, "We can."
Jesus said to them, "You will drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to give; but it is for those for whom my Father has prepared it."
The new discipline brought change. They were angry with each other.
They know about the rulers of the nations. They rule over their people. Their high officials pass before them.
Don't be like that. If you want, let these eyes help you, be your servant.
And whoever wants to be first must be your servant.
Like the son of Adam. No one will serve him. Instead, others will serve him. He will pile up his wealth year after year, while many people suffer. Hold onto the eyes of the blind.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho. A large crowd was following him.
Two blind men were sitting by the roadside. They heard that Jesus was passing by, so they cried out, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The crowd ordered them to stop. They told them to be quiet. But the two men shouted at the top of their voices, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The old man got up and called them. "What do you want me to do for you?" he said.
"Sir," they said, "we want to see."
Jesus had compassion on them. He touched their eyes. Immediately they could see. And they followed Him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem
Both of them entered Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, on the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two disciples.
He said to them, "Go to the village that is behind you. There you will find what you desire. Go to them, and you will find them a people who are at peace, and you will find there what you seek."
No one tells you anything, say it's what God wants. Don't send them directly.
He who has the best character among you is the one who is best in conduct with his family. He says,
"Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem! Lo, your king comes to you; triumphant and victorious is he, humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey." (Zechariah 9:9)
The disciples went and did what Jesus told them.
She made the donkey and the colt. She saddled them. Then Jesus sat on the colt.
Many people spread their clothes on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
Some people walked ahead of him, and some walked behind. They all shouted, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the city was stirred. The people asked, "Who is this?"
The crowds answered, "This is Jesus. He is the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus was cleansing the temple.
Jesus entered the temple area. He began to drive out all who were selling and buying there. He overturned the tables of the money changers. He also overturned the chairs of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' (Isaiah 56:7) but you have made it a 'den of thieves.' " (Jeremiah 7:11)
The lame and the crippled came to Jesus in the temple, and he healed them.
The teachers saw the amazing things he did. They also saw the children in the temple area shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" But when they saw all this, they were astonished.
"Don't you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," answered Jesus. "Haven't you read this in the Scriptures? 'You, Lord, have made children and infants praise you' (Psalm 8:2)."
Then Jesus left the crowd and went outside the city to Bethany. He spent the night there, and the fig tree withered.
One day, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the road. He was hungry, but found only leaves on it. Then he said to it, "Never bear fruit again!" And it withered at once.
"When you hold the pen, you are like magicians. 'How can the ink flow so fast onto the paper?' they wonder."
"What a strange reply," he said. "You're not telling the truth. You must object and resist. Then you can do what they did to the fig tree. You can even tell someone who says 'Go put yourself in the sea,' and that's what you should do."
"If you give charity, you won't ask for it when you pray." An inquiry about Jesus' authority.
Jesus entered the temple courts. While he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and asked, "By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?"
Ajis Redo: "I'm going to ask you a question too. If you bring me the answer, I'll tell you what I'm going to do with these things."
Can I baptize John tomorrow? Is he a believer? Does he have any reservations? They asked each other about that. They said, "If they say, 'I believe,' doesn't that mean, 'Or how can one not believe?'"
After a while, someone asked, "What about the rule?" We are talking about people. Every person believes that John is a prophet.
The fox said to the grapes, "We don't want sour grapes." The grapes replied, "But if they weren't sour, they wouldn't be grapes. It's a lesson for the clever ones."
What do you think about this? A man had three sons. He went to the first and said, "My son, go work today in the vineyard."
"I won't go," the boy said. But then he changed his mind and left.
After that, the big children became small children again. He said here the same as before. The children replied, "We will work for you, sir." But he didn't show up.
"Must the little child do what his father wants?" they asked. "The first child," they answered. Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
John doesn't know how to read or write. And he didn't study. But the hijab and the veil, they have studied. Look at theirs. And I'm still with yours, you don't have to change the habit and the veil. The hijab's book
Listen to another story. A man had a piece of land where he planted a vineyard. He made a hedge around it. He dug a hole for the vine's stake in it. He also built a watchtower. He leased the vineyard to tenant farmers. Then he went away on a journey.
As the time of harvest drew near, the master sent his servant to collect the rent. The servant gathered his master's share of the produce.
They loaded the slaves onto the ship. They needed a crew. They killed the captain. They used the captain's body as bait to catch the fish.
After that, the servant went to the other servants and told them about the master. He did this many times before. The servants treated him as they did before.
Watch out, or I'll send my sons. "This is what you get for messing with my sons," he said.
"They said, 'This child who is about to be born will inherit all the king's wealth. Let's kill him. After that, everything will be ours.'"
They took him and threw him from the olive grove. Then they killed him.
"When the boat is sailing, what does the owner do for the passengers?"
"He'll rid the land of these evil people," they answered. "Then he'll give the pink slips to the rest of the caretakers. They'll get a share of the harvest at harvest time."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
This is how We show Our signs to you. The kingdom of Allah belongs to those who are patient. It is they who will inherit the earth.
Anyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces. But the stone will grind anyone who falls on it.
The Pharisees and the Sadducees heard Jesus' stories. They knew he was talking about them.
There was no way to stop him. But they were afraid of the crowds. People believed that Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding dress
I have other stories for you. he said.
It's like a kingdom in the sky. The king had one of the guests, the married son, executed.
He will send the servants to invite those who have been invited to lunch. The servants told them to come, but they refused.
After that, he sent a servant to call. He said, "Go to this generous man who has generous hands. We have cut off our means of livelihood and we have nothing left. Everything is ready. Come to the feast, the feast."
No one can control fate. One has power over others. One has power over their actions.
The rest seized his slaves. They treated them badly and then killed them.
The king was very angry. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed those murderers and burned their city.
Daksh warned the worker: "Be careful, be careful, like this. But the problem is that they didn't come when I called them."
Rest in peace, Zoua. You left this life at a time when we needed you the most.
"They gathered, serving each other generously. They brought together all the people who couldn't find it, the poor and the rich. After a long time, the host cut the cake with the guests."
The king entered to see the guests. He saw a man there who was not wearing his wedding clothes.
Friend, they said, "How did you get in here without your wedding clothes?" The man couldn't say anything.
Then the king told his servants, "Bind his hands and feet. Throw him outside into the darkness. There people will weep and gnash their teeth."
Many are called, but few are chosen. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?
The two of them finished. They were making plans to silence Isa.
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. "Teacher," they said, "we know that you are a person of integrity. You teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't swayed by anyone, because you pay no attention to one's status.
Tell me, what do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
Jisu knows your evil intentions. He said, "You obstinate ones! Why are you testing me like this?"
"Show me the coin people use for paying the tax." They brought him a silver coin.
He said to them, "Whose is this image? And whose are these words?"
"Caesar," they replied. Then he said to them, "Render to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's."
They heard this too much. They're going to get fed up and leave. Enough is enough.
Every day, just as the Sadducees came to Jesus with questions. They do not believe that anyone can rise from the dead.
"Teacher," they said, "here is what Moses told us: 'If a man dies and has no children, his brother must marry the widow. He must father children for his brother to preserve his brother's name.'"
Kan had a dream. One day, he saw a bird flying with a wedding ring. He didn't want children, so he gave the ring to his brother.
One can, two can, three can, this is the situation.
Finally, the woman died.
"After the mountain gives birth, what do you want? All seven days are spent with it contracted."
"That's a strange response," he said, "You are mistaken, because you do not know the scriptures. And you do not know the power of God."
The dead wouldn't get married. Their parents wouldn't let them get married. They would be like angels in heaven.
What about those who rise from the grave? Haven't you read what God has said to you?
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." (Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
"By the time they gather this crowd, they'll know what they want after they're informed. The verdict is final."
The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees had not been able to answer Jesus. So the Pharisees gathered together.
One of them knew the law, so Jesus tested him with a question.
"Teacher," he said, "which is the most important duty in the law?"
Jesus replied: "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind." (Deuteronomy 6:5)
He had a big baby and a big baby and a big baby.
"Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"Everything written in the Law and the Prophets is based on these two promises." Whose son is Christ?
The Pharisees were gathered together. Jesus asked them,
"How do you feel about Christ? Who are his children?" "The children of David," he replied.
He said to them, "But who is the true God? The God of the covenant, whom David called 'My Lord'? The Holy Spirit spoke through David. David said,
"The LORD said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.'" (Psalm 110:1)
"Why does David call him 'Sir,' could David be his son?"
No one could answer him in a single word. For two days, no one had tried to ask him other questions.
Isa judges the Pharisees and the teachers of the law.
Jesus spoke to the crowds and his disciples.
"The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat," he said.
You can't please them. Do everything they ask. Or do everything they do. They won't appreciate it anyway.
They tie heavy loads and place them on people's shoulders. But they don't want to lift a single finger to move them.
Whatever they do, they do it with the intention of causing harm. If I want to stop them, I'll use verses from the Book. I'll make a big shield. And I'll make a contract binding their responses to the answer and make it bigger.
They live for sitting in places of honor at banquets. They also live for sitting in the important seats in the synagogue.
They live on greetings in the markets. They live on what people call "rabai."
But do not use the term "Rabbi." Rather, call each other 'brothers' and fear Allah alone, so that you may attain true success.
We do not call anyone on earth "Father." You have one Father, and he is in heaven.
But I call him a "teacher." You have one teacher, and he is Christ.
The most important person among you will be your servant.
"If no one helps, no one will succeed. And if no one succeeds, no one will help."
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. You do not go in yourselves, and you prevent those who are going in from entering."
(No
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and then you make that person twice as much a child of hell as you are."
You poor fools! They say, "If someone swears by the temple, nothing will happen. But if someone swears by the gold of the temple, they must swear."
You are my uncle and stupid! Which is more important? Is it gold? Or the temple that makes gold sacred?
"If he served this meal today and not yesterday, that means nothing. But if he served this meal today as a gift to yesterday, he must redistribute the portion."
O blind ones! Which is more important: the gift, or the altar that purifies the gift?
He who knows the name of the garden, knows her name and everything in it.
And whoever swears by the temple, swears by it and by Him who dwells in it.
And whoever swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God, and by Him who sits upon it.
You hypocritical teachers of the law and Pharisees! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and self-indulgence. You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin—but you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former.
You hypocrites! You give up a small insect of your taste. But you swallow a whole camel!
You hypocritical teachers of the law and Pharisees! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed. You only want to satisfy yourselves.
"Pharisee that you are! First clean the inside of the cup and dishes, and then also the outside will be clean."
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead people's bones and everything unclean.
Hey, how are you? I wanted to do something good for others. But your millions are insincere. You boast about what you don't do.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.
He said, "We do not live as those who came before us lived, we do not act as they acted. We do not follow the killing of the prophets."
And you testify against yourselves. You are indeed a people who have killed the prophets.
Complete the sins that those before you have started!
You vile, poisonous spiders! How will you escape the sentence of hell?
So you will be sending prophets, wise men, and teachers to them. Some of them you will kill, some you will whip in your synagogues, some you will persecute from city to city.
This will atone for the blood of all the good people shed on earth. I will say, "The blood of the righteous Abel, from the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah." It is you who killed him between the temple and the altar.
What we're telling you is right. All this will benefit those who are alive.
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing! See, your house is left to you desolate. For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!'"
Look, your house is now empty.
I say to you, you will not see me again until you say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord." (Psalm 118:26)
Signs of the Last Day
Jesus went out of the temple. He was walking away when the disciples came up to him. They wanted to draw his attention to the temple buildings.
"Do you see all these things?" Jesus said. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. There his disciples came to him in secret and said, "Tell us, when will this happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end?"
Strange answer, "Struggle! Beware that no one deceives you."
Many will come in my name, saying, "I am Christ!" And they will deceive many.
"Don't listen to the war. Don't listen to people killing each other over a new war. Don't be fooled. This is what they want. But the game hasn't started yet."
The homeland will go to war with the homeland. The kingdom will go to war with the kingdom. People will walk in hunger. There will be earthquakes in many places.
Kola had a great time at the party.
Then they will hand you over to be mistreated and killed. All nations will hate you because of Me.
Over time, many of them tried on the religion. They hated each other. They apologized to each other for their mistakes.
Many false prophets will arise. They will deceive many people.
When the cat's away, the mice will play.
But it may be that the end is the preserved one.
The beloved music spread around the world. It received the testimony of all nations. Then it took the stage.
The prophet Daniel spoke of the "abomination that desolates" (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11). One day you will see it standing in the holy place. The reader wants to understand this.
They often go to the mountains in summer.
No one on the roof should go down to their house to get something.
No one in the field went back to plow their furrows.
Slowly, slowly these nights on the pregnant women! Slowly, slowly on those who are breastfeeding!
Pray for me that you may not be compelled to flee in winter or on the Sabbath.
There will be great tribulation in those days, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever will be again.
I may not know your face, but I know your voice. Still, I want Allah to judge, He knows you well.
Sometimes, when I want to scare you, I'll shout, "Look! There's Jesus!" Or just "There!" Don't be scared.
They will say, "We are prophets!" and will produce great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect of God.
See, just as I told you.
If someone tells you, "He wants the desert," don't believe them. But if someone tells you, "He wants the house," don't disbelieve them.
The lightning comes from the east and is seen in the west. So will it be with the coming of the Son of Man.
The crows were quiet where there was a corpse.
After enduring great suffering in those days, "The sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light. The stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will vanish." (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
In that day, the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory.
Hadi sends his angels with a great trumpet. Hadi gathers them from all sides. They come to him from one end of the heavens to the other.
Learn a lesson from the fig tree. When its branches become tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.
Whenever you see a cat, know that the end is near. It's here for you.
What Kyle is telling you is right. No one who lived at that time could have known all this.
The sky and the earth are perishing, but my words will not perish. The day and hour we do not know.
No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
It rained for forty days and forty nights. It's the same as the women of the sons of men coming.
Before the flood, people ate and drank. They got married. They gave their daughters in marriage. They did all these things until the day Noah entered the ark.
They did not know until the flood came and took them all. So will it be when the Son of Man comes.
Five men were in the field. One was taken and the other was left.
Five rancid apricots are being ground in a manual grinder. One will be taken and the other will be left.
Scratch this. You don't know on which day your Lord will come.
You must understand something. Suppose the owner of the house knew what time of night the robber was coming. Then he would have kept watch. He would not have let his house be broken into.
You also must be ready. The Son of Man will come at an hour you do not expect.
Let's assume that a master placed one of his servants at the head of the rest in his house. The servant's task is to give them their food at the right time. The master wants a trustworthy and wise servant for this.
This is better for the slaves if the masters find them working on their tasks when the masters return.
This is how it will be restored to you properly. The master will give the servant control over everything he owns.
Lakin I suppose he's a big shot. He thinks highly of himself, "My boss wants to cause a lot of harm."
See if he starts beating the other servants. And see if he starts eating and drinking with the heavy drinkers.
A week of did-he-do-its, she comes one day when he doesn't know. She returns at an hour he doesn't know.
Then the master will cut him to pieces. He will send him to the place where pretenders go. There people will weep and gnash their teeth.
The Story of the Ten Balcony Girls
It was as if the kingdom of heaven had descended at that moment. Five bridesmaids served five lanterns and went up to the bride.
Five of them are rich. Five are intelligent.
The fools took their torches but didn't bring olive oil.
Geniuses took oil in jars with their lamps.
The bridegroom didn't come this much. All the guests got tired and fell asleep.
At midnight, someone shouted: "Here comes the groom! They've found him!"
And after he gathered the brides, he wrote and guided the brides.
The fools said to the geniuses, "Give us some of your oil. Our candles are going out."
" 'No,' they said. 'There may not be enough for all of us. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy for yourselves.'"
So they went to buy oil. But on their way, the groom came. The friends who were ready went with him to the wedding. Then they closed the door.
After that, the other friends came. They said: "Oh sir! Oh sir!" Open the door for us!"
"No, I don't know, 'The one who resembles you in story, she is the right one. I don't know her.' "
I never saw him during the day or the hour when he was getting married. I never saw him. That's how I never saw him. Story of Three Servants
More or less, that's what I've been saying all along. This man wants to travel. He sold his slave to the great master and set off.
One parent gave $10,000 to the first child. One parent gave $4,000 to the second child. One parent gave $2,000 to the third child. The parent asked the servant how much money each child received; the servant only knew what she was told. Then they went on vacation.
The servant who was offered the ten thousand dollars went straight ahead and invested his money. He made another ten thousand dollars.
He doesn't have $4000, he spent $4000 more.
He earned 2000 dollars, so he went and bought some stuff in the neighborhood. He needs money here, sir.
After a long time, I became a rich man. I wanted to gather all the money they were hoarding.
The man who put up $10,000 brought in another $10,000. He said, "Sir, you knew me for $10,000. Look, I made another $10,000."
Our master said: "You have done well, good and believing merchant! You were believing with little. You deserve a lot. Come and share in our happiness!"
The man with $4000 is coming too. He said, "Sir, you gave me $4000. Look, I made another $4000."
Our master said: "You have done well, good and believing merchant! You were believing with little. You deserve a lot. Come and share in our happiness!"
After a long time, the man who had $2000 with me said, "My master," he said, "you have wisdom. Put the money in a certain place. Collect the money in a certain place."
I was scared. I took out and gave me $2,000 for the land. See, they don't want me here.
The stranger replied, "O great slave, meddlesome one! How dare you ask what I desire? Do you not know that I have collected what I have from those who have served me?"
"إذن، كان عليك أن تضعي مالي في البنك. عندما عدت، كنت سأستعيده مع الفائدة."
Then he said to his assistant: "Give him $2,000 and take it from the one who has $20,000."
Everyone will give him more. He'll have more than enough. And what about those who don't have anything? Even those who have will take from them.
This place is full of the existing baleful. Here in the darkness, people weep and moan in silence. The heat and the humiliation.
May our Lord come in all His glory. All the angels are with Him. Then He will sit on His glorious throne.
Both nations will be gathered before him. He will separate people into two groups. He will be like a shepherd separating the sheep from the goats.
Hadi brings sheep on his right and goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world.'
I was hungry. She offered me something to eat. I was thirsty. She offered me something to drink. I was a stranger. She hosted me in her house.
I had no need for clothes. You gave them to me. I was sick. You cared for me. I was in prison. You came to visit me.
"Come in, servant of justice, answer him." "My lord," they say, "did we only find him wandering and we accommodated him? Did we only find him exhausted and we married him?"
When will you return home? When will you want to wear clothes and think about clothes?
Will you ever get married or spend time in prison and regret it?
King Hik replies: "I will not tell you what is right and what is wrong. Whatever you have done to any of my brothers, you have done it to me."
After that, he will speak to the crowd, "You are cursed! You have gone beyond the limits of suffering that I have set for you. That's what you've done for the devil and his followers."
I want to smoke. But I don't have any. I want to drink. But I don't have any.
I was a stranger. But they did not welcome me. I was in need of clothes. But they did not give me any. I was sick and in prison. But they did not visit me.
They will also say: "Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty and did not help you? When did we see you a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not help you?"
"Hey, my friend, when I talk to you, I want to speak the truth. Everything that you do to others, you shouldn't do to anyone, not even to the biggest of the big, you shouldn't do it alone."
Then they will go away to be punished forever. But those who have done what is right will receive eternal life.
The plan to kill Jesus
When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
Then the chief priests met with the elders of the people. They met in the palace of Caiaphas, the high priest.
They conspired to take Jesus cleverly. They wanted to kill him.
"But the master is on the roof," they said. "The servant will give you the ladder." A woman brought the ladder over to Issa.
Jesus was in Bethany. He was in the house of a man named Simon, who had a skin disease.
A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume. She poured it on his head as he was reclining at the table.
When the students saw this, they were amazed. "What do you want this for?" they would ask.
Since perfume could be sold at a high price, the money could be given to the slaves.
I know her. So I told them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She did something nice for me."
The poor were always with you. But they weren't always with you.
They all know the scent that clings to my body and won't let go.
"Wherever I go, I will remember this account. Wherever I am, I will remember this great deliverance. It will be with me forever as a reminder." Judah agrees with a resolution about Jesus.
One of the thirteen betrayed the prophets. His name was Judas Iscariot.
He said, "What would you give if I handed over Jesus to you?" They paid him thirty pieces of silver.
I want more, Judas, I see through your games. Life is cheap, slave.
It was the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover meal?"
He said, "Enter the city, old man. Tell him, 'The teacher says, "The time is near. Finish the work you started with me and be quick."'
I refused to obey their orders, and I didn't complete the task. They accused me of being lazy.
Come on, there's a difference between Jesus and the thirteen.
One of you will hand me over to the enemy.
The pupils grew up sad. One by one, they grew up saying, "What am I, O Lord?"
Jesus said: "He who has dipped his hand with me in the dish, he is the one who will betray me."
The children of Adam are gentle as it is written. But how evil it will be for the one who delivers the children of Adam! It would have been better for him if he had not been born.
Judas said, "Rabbi, is it I?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is you."
One day, as they were saying, "There is nothing better than bread and butter." They praised God for it and ate it. Then he gave the remainder to the servant and said, "Take this and eat. This is my body."
After that, he will give up hope. If he sees the light, he will give up. If he says, "Everyone benefits from it."
A new covenant has been established. It adds forgiveness for many sins.
I wanted to tell you something. With the rain, if I don't drink with you now, I won't have the chance to drink with you again in my father's kingdom.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said, "This very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times." Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives.
They have Jesus, "This night all of you will fall away from me. For it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)"
"But after what I wanted from life, I'll go before you on my knees."
Peter said, "I'll wait until you're ready. But I don't want to wait forever."
"This is really happening," Jesus replied. "It will happen tonight. Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
And Peter said, "I may be able to live with you. But I don't want to say I don't know you." And the disciples all said the same thing. Jesus prayed in Gethsemane.
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane. He said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
Khadh Peter and the Zabadiyya boys were there. He was very kind and busy.
The man said, "I want to go very much. I fear death. Let's eat here. Come with me."
He wants something more. After all, he's been waiting a long time. He said, "Father, if possible, take that ugly case away from me. But as it is, I've gone too far."
After that, he returned to his students and found them sleeping. "Wasn't there a single hour that this servant could watch?" asked Peter.
"Look and keep on looking. Then you will not fall into sin when you are tested. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
Jesus returned again. He prayed, "Father, if this cup can be taken away, let it be. But if I must drink it, let Your will be done."
And after they continued on their way. Now I see them struggling. They can't keep their eyes open.
Get out of here, you liar. The third time is the charm.
The teacher said to the students, "How can we help each other? Look! Time is running out. The son of Adam is still climbing the ladder."
Come! Don't be shy! Here's one who wants to shake my hand! Jesus is about to fall.
Jesus promised that he was coming, and here comes Judas. He was one of the twelve. With him was a large crowd. They carried palm fronds and garments. The last and the teachers struck them with blows.
Judas, who had betrayed Jesus, was also present. "He is the one," he said, "This is the man."
Judas betrayed Jesus with a kiss. He said: "Peace be upon you, Rabbi!" And he kissed him.
"You like it, my friend, do what you came for. Then the men moved in. They seized Jesus and arrested him."
At that moment, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
"Put your sword back in its place," Jesus told him. "For all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Whatever you think is ahead, ask Baba for help? He precedes an army of over 70,000 kings immediately.
Where can one find the truth in the book? They say it's not obligatory to be like that.
At times, Jesus played with his friends. "Don't you have any pity for the soldier or the thief?" he said. "Can't they work with a sword and a club that they beat me with? Every day I had a slave in my mouth, and you had teachers. And you didn't arrest me."
"That's how we got the habit of bread making. That's how they came up with the idea of baking bread. Truly, the habit of bread making is precious."
Before him was Jesus, standing before Caiaphas, the high priest. The teachers and the elders were also standing before him here.
I wanted to know more, so Peter wrote about Jesus. He wrote about the wedding feast. He entered and observed what they were doing.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus to put him to death.
They didn't find any evidence, even though many false witnesses came forward. Finally, they presented two more witnesses.
They said, "This person claimed, 'I can destroy the temple of God. I can rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up. He asked Jesus, "Are you not going to answer? What is it that these people testify against you?"
"You are not far from the kingdom of God," said the high priest. "I adjure you by the living God, tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God."
Name. When asked, Jesus answered, "But what about you? You say that I am a son of man, jealous of the right hand of the Almighty, and that you sons of man will come to the gardens of paradise."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need more witnesses? You have heard his words."
"What do you think?" "He must die!" they replied.
There is no one in the world. They walk with their heads down. He follows them.
They said, "Tell us, Christ! Who struck you?" Peter said he did not know Jesus.
Peter could see the field. He was one of the disciples of Jesus. "You were also with Jesus of Galilee," she said.
But before all of them, Peter said what he didn't know. "I don't know what to tell you," he said.
Then he went out to the gate leading into the courtyard. There another woman saw him. She said to the people, "This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth."
I don't want any trouble. With all due respect, I said, "I don't know my father!"
After a while, the boys here started calling Peter. "Come with us," they said. "Speak as you like."
Peter's behavior was strange. He stood there for a moment, then turned to himself and said, "I don't know this!" Then he left, confused.
Then Peter remembered that Jesus had said to him, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And he went out and wept bitterly.
Judah hangs himself.
It was early morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people had decided to kill Jesus.
"They mocked him and beat him and spat on him. Then they brought him to Pilate, the governor."
Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was sentenced to death. Overwhelmed with remorse and sorrow, he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
"I grew up in sin," he said. "You condemned an innocent man." "That's your concern," they replied. "We don't have time for you."
Judas turned off the lights in the room and left. Later, he came back and locked himself in.
The Rabbanites took the money. They said, "It is forbidden to put this money in the temple's treasury. It is blood money. It was paid for the death of a man."
So they decided to use the money to buy the pottery field. People from other countries would bury their dead there.
We watched his movie "Desert of Blood" today.
Then the words spoken by Jeremiah the prophet came true: "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on him by the people of Israel."
"They paid the equivalent of thirty pieces of silver, as the Lord commanded me." (Zechariah 11:12,13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) Jesus was handed over to Pilate.
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" "It is as you say," Jesus replied.
No one can bring you happiness except yourself, just as the poor and the eagle are not brought to him by compassion.
Pilate, looking up, said, "Do you hear that?"
Jesus' response to the tea was surprising. The governor was truly shocked.
It was a custom to release one prisoner at Easter, chosen by the people.
F had the time when they owned the garden known as Barabbas.
"So you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?" Pilate asked them, "Shall I release Barabbas to you, or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Pilate realized what they were planning against him. He realized this was their plan because they had handed Jesus over to him.
Pilate refused to listen to him, turning away from him with a message. He said: "It's not about this matter. There's nothing wrong. I just wanted a little more in the dream about this matter."
The chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed.
"Can't you leave him alone?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they shouted.
"What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" asked Pilate. "Crucify him!" they all answered.
"What? Why beat him?" said Pilate. But they shouted all the more, "Crucify him!"
Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere with them. Rather, the crowd was becoming unrestrained. So he took water and washed his hands before them. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "It is your responsibility!"
Both people answered, "We and our children will accept the blame for his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas. But he had Jesus flogged. Then they handed him over to be crucified. They made Jesus carry his cross.
The governor's soldiers took Jesus into the palace, which was called the Praetorium. All the rest of the soldiers gathered around him.
They took his clothes and brought him a purple robe.
They brought him a red robe and put it on him. They put a crown of thorns on his head and a reed in his right hand. They knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
They ganged up on him. They beat him repeatedly with a stick on the head.
After they mocked him, they stripped him of his robe. They gave him his clothes. Then they led him away to be crucified. They led Jesus away to a cross.
As they were going out of the city, they met a man from Cyrene named Simon. They forced him to carry the cross.
They came to a place called Golgotha. Golgotha means the place of the skull.
They mixed wine with water and offered it to Jesus to drink. After He tasted it, He did not drink it.
While they were nailing him to the cross, they divided his garments among them, casting lots for his clothing.
He is sitting on a chair here.
Above his head they placed the written charge against him: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
Three thieves were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
Those who passed by were wagging their heads at Jesus and mocking him.
And they said, "So you claim to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days? Save yourself! Come down from the cross if you are the Son of God!"
For the past few years, the teachers and students have been struggling with the lack of resources.
"He led someone else's donkey," they said. "And he couldn't even paint himself! He is the King of Israel! Come down from the cross! Then we will believe in him."
He's living on God's mercy. May God save him now if you want. He's the one who said, 'I am the Son of God.'
For that reason, the women who were menstruating were distinguished from Jesus as they were married to him. Jesus died.
From noon until three o'clock, the whole earth was covered in darkness.
Around the ninth hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which means "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of those who were there heard Jesus crying out. They said, "He is calling Elijah."
One of them was married and the other was a sponge. The sponge was full of wine and they offered it to Jesus to drink.
They said, "Leave him. Let's see if this Elias will come to save him."
After all that living, this is it.
Then the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. The earth shook, and the rocks were split.
Graves were broken. Corpses of many righteous people who died were sold back to life.
They came out of the tomb. After Jesus was raised from the dead, they entered the holy city. There they appeared to many people.
The emperor and those who were protecting Jesus saw the earthquake and all that happened. They were terrified. They said, "There was nothing but the Son of God!"
I wanted more, so the girls were arguing. They even bet on Jesus from Galilee to give me this thing.
Mary Magdalene was there. Mary, the mother of James and Joseph, was there. The mother of James, son of Zebedee, was there. Jesus was there.
As evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came, who had also followed Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Joseph took a job and kept it in a box.
There was a new tomb with an inscribed stone in it. They made a large stone for the tomb's entrance. Then she left.
Mary Magdalene went to the tomb early in the morning. She saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance of the tomb.
The day after was the day after the Passover. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
"Sir," they said, "we remember something that the liar said while he was still alive. He said, 'In three days I will rise again.'"
"Oh, we have indeed grown old, we have indeed grown old, we have indeed grown old, we have indeed grown old, we have indeed grown old, we have indeed grown old, we have indeed grown old, we have indeed grown old, we have indeed grown old, we have indeed grown old, we have indeed grown old, we have indeed grown old, we have indeed grown old, we have indeed grown old, we have indeed grown old, we have indeed grown old."
"Take a few soldiers with you," Pilate answered. "Go and make the tomb as secure as you can."
So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting guards.
Jesus rose from the dead.
Saturday was over. It was dawn on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
It was a powerful earthquake. An angel of the Lord came down from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled away the stone and sat on it.
His body shone like lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so scared of him that they trembled and became like dead men.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus, whom they crucified."
There he is! Come on, just like he said he would! He brought us nine of them.
Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you.
I walked away from the grave. I was accompanied, but I was filled with longing. I went to your request.
Suddenly Jesus met them. He said, "Peace be with you!" They came to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me." So the women went away quickly from the tomb, trembling and amazed, and they said nothing to anyone because they were afraid.
After the guards entered the city, I realized that something was wrong. They informed the judges of everything that had happened.
"The powerful wall of the eyes that were used to seeing a plan. They were given a lot of money by the military."
They told the soldiers, "We want you to say, 'His disciples came at night. They stole his body while we were sleeping.'"
"If Saeed hears these reports, we'll bring him. That way, you'll be rid of the problems."
The rich man asked for water and they gave it to him. This story wants to teach us something important. Even Jesus commanded the crowd to sit down before they were fed.
And after that, the eleven disciples went to Galilee. They went to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
Whatever they saw, they worshipped it. However, some of them had doubts.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
So it is necessary to go and make disciples of all nations. Baptize them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
It's more important for them to repent for all the wrongs they've done to you. And you have an eye for an eye.
Jane Al-Ma3moun Uses The Ladder
And the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people."
"Behold, I will send my messenger before you, who shall prepare your way before you." (Malachi 3:1)
"A voice cries out in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.' " (Isaiah 40:3)
And so came John. He was baptizing people in the desert. He also said that people should be baptized and repent of their sins, and then God would forgive them.
Both the people from the countryside of Judah and those from Jerusalem were forgiven. When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John has a book of poetry by Jamal. He has a belt made of a string of pearls. And he lives on dates and Arabic coffee.
John said, "I quit. This place is way above my level. I haven't been able to solve many problems lately."
Ana baptize you with water. But he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit. Jesus baptizes and judges.
At that time, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
Then Jesus was baptized, and as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.
A voice spoke to him from heaven, "You are my Son, and I love you. I am very pleased with you."
"One of those inside, the Holy Spirit, descended on Jesus."
"For forty days he was tempted by the devil. He did not eat anything during those days, and afterwards he was hungry. The devil said to him, 'If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread.' Jesus answered, 'It is written: "Man shall not live on bread alone."'"
After John was imprisoned, Jesus returned to Galilee, preaching the good news of God's kingdom.
"I have fulfilled the time," he said. "The kingdom of God is at hand. Repent and believe the good news!"
One day, Gabriel walked along the shore of Galilee. There, Simon and his brother Andrew were casting their net into the lake. They were fishermen.
"Okay. Last one," he said, smiling. "I'll make you a promise."
He didn't go out with them and stayed home.
Then Jesus walked a little farther. As he did, he saw James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat preparing their nets.
One of them, whose name was John, also went with Jesus. Zebedee, the father of James and John, was in the boat with the hired men. So they left Jesus alone, and he was arrested.
Jesus and his companions went to the village of Capernaum. When it was the Sabbath, he entered the synagogue and began to teach.
People were amazed by his teaching. He taught them like someone with authority. He didn't speak like the religious scholars.
Then a man in their synagogue shouted. He was under the control of an evil spirit. He said,
What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!
"Be quiet!" Jesus said politely. "Get out of here!"
The evil jinn shook the man violently. Then it emerged from him with a scream.
Neither of the people were impressed. They asked each other, "What is this? A new kind of magic! And with more authority! He even commands the evil spirit, and it obeys him."
The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left the synagogue. Philip went with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's wife was sick in bed. She had a fever. They told Jesus about her.
I'm so sorry. I helped her carry it and then I helped her unpack. She was very grateful. After that, I started working for them.
Dusk fell after noon, bringing relief to the people's arduous living.
Both people in the city gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many of them. They had all kinds of diseases. He also cast out many demons. But he would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prayed in a quiet place.
It was still very early and the night was not yet over. Jesus got up and went out of the house. He went to a place where he could be alone. There he prayed.
Simon and his companions went to look for Jesus.
"Makaشوo, kebro: 'Kull hadd bitlabesak!' " Translation: "Be careful, grow up: 'Everyone is watching you!'"
Ajis said: "Let's go to another place. I want to go to a nearby town. I also need to drop them off. That's why I didn't come."
And so he traveled throughout Galilee. He was teaching in their synagogues. And he was casting out demons. Jesus healed every disease among the people.
A man with a skin disease came to Liza. He knelt before her and begged her for help. He said, "If you want to heal me, you can."
Jesus was deeply moved. He reached out and touched the man. He said, "I do want to. Be made clean!"
