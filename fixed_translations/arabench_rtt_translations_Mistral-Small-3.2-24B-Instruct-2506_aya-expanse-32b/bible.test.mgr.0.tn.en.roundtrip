Jesus was called a little lamb and was brought to him. They brought him sitting among them.
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
khoa he who becomes humble like this child is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
This is a child who writes my name, he is writing on me.
Walla, can any of them bring forth a single creature from these vast seas? If they could, it would be better for them if they had a huge millstone and they dragged it in the depths of the sea.
khoa down on the world for the things that lead people astray into sin! So many things must come. But woe to those who acquire them!
If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of heaven with one hand or one foot than to be thrown into hell with two hands and two feet. In hell, the fire burns forever.
Law you cover your sin with another sin, you only bring it out and expose it. It is very harmful that you enter the kingdom with one eye and are thrown into the fire of Hell. The story of the lost brother.
Don't neglect any of these little ones. I'm telling you. Their angels in heaven may come at any time to see my Father in heaven.
(No
What do you think? If you had a man with 100 sheep and one of them got lost, wouldn't he leave the 99 on the hill and go look for the one that was lost?
What I'm telling you is true. If the sheep find a dollar, they'll be happier than if they had 99 cents.
I want your father to be in paradise. It's not right for these young children to be orphaned. When one of them calls you "dad."
If your brother wrongs you, go to him. Tell him what he did. Admonish him. If he listens to you, you have won him back.
Why don't they listen to you? Now go with one or two others. The Book says: "On the evidence of two or three witnesses every word may be established." (Deuteronomy 19:15)
But can the judge refuse to listen to the witnesses? Let's not say it to anyone. And if the judge refuses to listen to us? Let's deal with him. Deal with him as you wish, whether from the street or from the neighborhood.
What we convey to you is a fact. What you close on earth, you will close in heaven. What you open on earth, you will open in heaven.
One, here with you. Suppose the two of you on the ground argue about something, my Father in heaven is the one who judges you.
"A lonely man among a crowd, feeling lost in the city. The servant who never showed mercy."
Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"
"Strange answer," I say, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."
The kingdom is like a king who wanted to gather all the money that his servants owed him.
A guy who has a million dollars will give it to him.
A man who can't pay his debts is ordered by the court to sell his possessions, including his wife, children, and all that he owns, to pay his creditors.
The servant knelt before him. "Give me time," he pleaded. "I'll make everything right."
My lord was merciful to him. He forgave his debts and let him go.
Then after that he took out another servant who was carrying a basket. He started to unpack it. "Bring me what you want!" he said.
The man asked the waiter for the bill. "Give me the check," he said. "I'll pay you later."
Lakhra, the miser refused. Instead, he went to the man and put him in prison. The man remains incarcerated until he pays what he owes.
The servant saw what they were doing. He was a bit annoyed. He left and told his master everything they were doing.
The slave asked the master for forgiveness. "My slave," the master replied, "I forgive you everything you owe me because you asked me."
Can't you be as patient with the slowest learner as you have been with me?
In anger, he left his master to the guards. He will be punished until he repays everything he owes.
"How can I please my father in heaven by myself when you didn't put on him the coat of honor that you have from your left."
Jesus teaches about divorce.
When Jesus had finished speaking, he went away with his disciples to the region of Galilee. He went to Judea, to the other side of the Jordan River.
Many people followed him. He healed them there.
Some Pharisees came to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Strange, you replied, "Didn't you read that in the beginning the Creator made them male and female? (Genesis 1:27)"
He said, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." (Genesis 2:24)
Two, yet one. For what God has joined together, let not man separate.
They said, "Is it possible that Moses commanded a man to give his wife a divorce paper and send her away?"
Jesus replied, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because you were hard-hearted, but it was not like this from the beginning."
"He told me this. He said that he had divorced his wife and was learning to write again, from scratch. A man can divorce his wife, but only if he doesn't have children with her or if he doesn't support her."
The students told him, "If that's how it is between a husband and wife, it's better not to get married."
Jesus replied, "Not everyone is able to accept the idea of remaining single. But those who have helped others to live without marriage are able to accept it."
"Some men cannot have children because they were born that way. Some have been made that way by others. Some have made themselves that way for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. Whoever can accept living that way should do so." Little children were brought to Jesus.
Some people brought little children to Jesus. They wanted him to lay his hands on them and pray over them. But the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the children come to me. Don't stop them. The kingdom of heaven belongs to people like them."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he departed from there. Jesus and the rich young man.
A man came to Lisa and said, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?"
"Why do you ask Me about what is good?" replied Jesus. "There is only one who is good. If you want to enter the kingdom, obey the commands."
"Which one?" the man asked. Jesus said, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness."
Honor your father and your mother. (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) And "Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"I disobeyed all these orders," the young man said. "What else is there left for me to do?"
Jesus replied, "If you want to be complete, go and sell all your possessions and give the money to the poor. You will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
This small village has changed a lot. It's become so beautiful.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
"And again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."
The students heard this, and they were very surprised. They said, "Is it possible that he could be right?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Peter said, "We're going to miss you! What is this habit you're giving us?"
"What I am telling you is true," Jesus told them. "When everything is renewed, the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne. Then those of you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, and you will judge the twelve tribes of Israel."
Everyone who has left homes or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will also have eternal life.
But many of the first will be last, and many of the last will be first.
The Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a man who was the owner of a vineyard. He went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
They agreed to the big return that they are in. After that, they sent them back to the place of work.
Worked 9 hours in the office, then left. Saw one of them standing in the square, not doing anything.
He told them, "You too have shared in my cup of suffering. It is your turn to comfort me."
They are mistaken. "Don't rely on appearances or the clock; it's three o'clock in the morning."
"We've been waiting for thirty minutes, and they're still not here. To them, I say, 'Why don't we tell you off like we're supposed to today?'"
" 'Because no one has hired us,' they answered. He said to them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard.' "
The master of the vineyard said to his steward, "Pay the workers their wages. Begin with the last, and end with the first."
The workers who were hired around five o'clock came. Each of them received the usual daily wage.
Fenna, when they started talking to the old woman, they became more animated. But each one of them had the usual, conventional manner.
When he arrived, he immediately looked for his friend.
"Take this boy for yourself, take one hour," they said. "We've treated him like our own. We've filled the work with a lot and bought a lot in the summer."
The employer had one answer for them. He said, "My friend, I'm being fair with you. Weren't we agreed on working for a regular daily wage?"
Take your money and go. I want to give Lynn the same amount I gave you.
Don't I have the right to do what I want with my money? Are you living, disappointing me because I was too kind to the servants?
"So the last will be first, and the first will be last." Jesus is still speaking about death.
Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. Taking the twelve disciples aside, he spoke to them.
"We are going back to Jerusalem," he said. "The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of the chief priests and scribes. They will condemn him to death."
"He shouted at the people who weren't listening. The people surrounded him and dragged him. They threw him on the ground. On the thirtieth day, he drowned!" My mother begged him to stop.
Mama Zabad's daughters came with Lisa. As she grew older, she asked for a knee replacement.
"What do you want?" asked Jesus. She said, "Promise me that one of my two daughters will sit at your right hand in your kingdom, and promise me that the other will sit at your left."
"You don't know what you're asking," Jesus said to them. "Will you drink the cup I am about to drink?" "We will," they answered.
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but it is not for me to say who will sit at my right hand or at my left. These places are for those whom my Father has prepared for them."
The other ten disciples knew about this. They wrote it down for the brothers.
They have Jesus. He said, "You know the rulers of the Gentiles. They lord it over their people, and the high officials exercise power over them."
You must write. Good, everyone who wants to be with you, to be your servant.
And whoever wants to be first must be your servant.
Man is like a tree. If he is not watered, he will wither. If he is not watered with knowledge, he will become ignorant. He will bring good to others. He will bring his spirit into the hearts of many people. I have planted two trees together.
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho. A large crowd was following them.
Three blind men were sitting by the roadside. They heard that Jesus was passing by, so they cried out, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
The crowd ordered them to stop. They told them to be quiet. But the two men shouted at the top of their voices, "Lord! Son of David! Have mercy on us!"
Jesus stood up and called out to them, "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.
"Oh Lord," they said, "we want to see."
Jesus breathed on them, and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit." He touched their eyes. Immediately they received their sight, and followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them,
He said to them, "Go to the village ahead of you. There you will find a donkey tied, with her colt by her. Untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone tells you to do something, tell them, "God wants them." Their owner will give them to you immediately.
Whoever listens to a word spoken against the Prophet, let him be killed.
"Say to the city of Zion, 'See, your king comes to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.'" (Zechariah 9:9)
Their disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them.
"Put on the red and the green. Let them rest on Saturday. After that, Jesus worked on Saturday."
A large number of people spread out their mats on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
Some people went ahead of him, and some followed him. They all shouted, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred. The people asked, "Who is this?"
The crowds answered, "This is Jesus. He is the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus cleansed the temple.
Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer' (Isaiah 56:7), but you have made it 'a den of robbers' (Jeremiah 7:11)."
My uncle and the disabled came to Jesus at the temple. There he healed them.
The chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonders that he did, and when they saw the children in the temple area shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" they were indignant.
"Teacher, do you see this man talking to you? Do you know who he is?" they asked. "Yes," Jesus replied. "Have you never read in the Scriptures, 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. The Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 8:2)
Then Jesus left the people and went out of the city to Bethany. He spent the night there. The fig tree withered.
Tomorrow morning, Jesus returned to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the roadside. He went to it, but found nothing on it but leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" At once the tree withered.
The students saw this motto and were amazed. "How did you write on the wall?" they asked.
Jesus replied, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
"If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for." (The authority of Jesus is questioned.)
Jesus entered the temple courts. While he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and asked, "By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?"
Ajees continued: "I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will ask you what authority I have to do these things."
"Where did John's baptism come from? From heaven? Or from men? Tell us. They discussed it among themselves and said, 'If we say, "From heaven," he will say, "Then why did I not believe it?" But if we say, "From men," we fear the people.'"
"And when they said, 'Who are these (men) from among us?' Fearful of the people. Everyone knew John had been a prophet."
Jesus answered, "I do not know." Jesus said, "Neither do I wish to know more than what is given to me." The Story of the Three Servants
A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work today in the vineyard.'
"No, I don't want to," the son replied. But then he changed his mind and left.
Then the father went to the other son. He said the same thing. The son replied, 'I will, sir.' But he did not go.
"Which of you is the best manager like my father was?" "The first one," they answered. He said to them, "As you wish, this is the truth. The strong and the powerful will rule the divine kingdom before you."
John can be what he wants to be.
Listen to another story. A man had a piece of land where he planted a vineyard. He built a wall around it. He dug a winepress in it. He also built a watchtower. He leased the vineyard to some farmers. Then he went away on a journey.
One wrote on the last page, "Sleep well, my friend. May your dreams be sweet."
The criminals tied up the servant and left him. They left one of them with him. They killed another one of them. They threw the stone at the third one to kill him.
After that, the man took his family out of their house to the suburbs. He wanted more than the first time. The suburbs treated them kindly as they did the first time.
"Watch the last one, they sent their kids home. 'They're afraid of my kids,' he said."
The man saw the boys coming. He said to them, "This is the day of the king's feast. Come, let's kill him. Then we can have everything for ourselves."
They understood and left the field, then they killed him.
"What does the person in charge of the farm do?"
"The wind will destroy these wicked ones," they replied. "Then the wind will scatter the bounty to others. These ones will receive a share of the harvest at harvest time."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. The Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
"And that is how it is for everyone. God's kingdom is upon your shoulders. It is upon the decisions you make within it."
"Everyone who signs this stone will break it. But the stone will crush everyone who signs it."
The Pharisees heard Jesus' stories. They knew He was speaking to them.
They thought of a way to arrest him. But they were afraid of the crowd. The people thought that Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Story
They have stories too. They say
He acted like a king. He appointed himself as a guardian and arranged marriages for his children.
Obido went to one of the guests for dinner. He asked them to come, but they refused.
I want to work as a chef. He said, "Tell the guests I was preparing and said: 'I killed my sheep and prepared the big meal. Everything is ready. Come for the wedding feast."
The elder said, "Don't judge them. One has a right to his opinion. One has a right to his actions."
The rest took his slaves. They treated them badly and then killed them.
The king was very angry. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed those murderers and burned their city.
Then the king said to his servants, 'The wedding dinner is ready. But those I invited were not fit to come.'
Go to the corner. There's a spider in this one.
In which servants went out in the streets. They gathered a crowd of people, all kinds, the good and the bad. They wanted to prevent the wedding, by inviting the guests.
The kings entered to see the guests. He saw a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.
My friend, they told him he entered here without a wedding outfit? The man couldn't say anything.
Then the king told his servants, 'Bind his hands and feet. Throw him outside into the darkness. There people will weep and gnash their teeth.'
"Many are called, but few are chosen. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar?"
The two of them finished. They were working on a machine to deceive Issa with their words.
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. They said, "Teacher, we know that you are a man of integrity. You teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You don't care what anyone thinks, and you don't let them tell you what to say or do.
Tell him, what do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
Jesus knew their wickedness. He said, "You adversaries! Why do you try to betray me?"
"Show me the coin people use for paying the tax." They brought him a silver coin.
He said to them, "Whose image is this? And whose inscription?"
"Caesar's," they replied. Then he said to them, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
"When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away. The assembly dispersed." (Note: The original text seems to be a mix of Arabic and French, and the translation maintains that structure where necessary. The title "El 3eras" is kept as it appears in the original, assuming it's meant to be in Arabic.)
The Sadducees came to Jesus with a question about the resurrection. They did not believe in the afterlife.
"Teacher," they said, "we have made a covenant with Moses on our behalf. If a man dies and has no children, his brother shall marry his wife and raise up offspring for his brother. So the name of the brother will not be blotted out."
I have seven brothers. The sons of the sons, they get married and die. I wanted to have no children, so I gave my brother's son to my husband as a son.
Hello, I'm the ninth sister. I'm looking for the seventh brother.
Finally, the woman died.
"Wherever the mountain stands, let your voice reach there. All of them are part of it."
Jesus replied, "You are mistaken, because you do not know the scriptures. And you do not know the power of God."
"They who work for the dead work. Or they will not be taken. They will be like angels in paradise."
"Which of the dead will not grow? Didn't you read what the wise man said to you?"
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." (Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
"When they heard this saying, they were amazed at the teacher. The teacher was a slave ##"
The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees had not been able to answer Jesus. So the Pharisees gathered together.
One of them was an expert in the law. So he tested Jesus with a question.
"Teacher," he said, "which are the most important commands of the Law?"
Jesus replied: "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind." (Deuteronomy 6:5)
There was a man and a thief.
"Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
"All that is written in the Law and the Prophets is based on these two commandments." - Matthew 22:40 (Jesus, in the New Testament)
The Pharisees were gathered together. Jesus asked them,
"What is your opinion about Christ? Who are his children?" "The children of David," they replied.
He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?" Peter answered, "You are the Messiah."
"The LORD said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.'" (Psalm 110:1)
"Since David calls him 'Sayyedi,' what could David's relation to him be?"
No one could answer him with a single word. For two days, no one has tried to ask him other questions.
Isa judges the Pharisees and the teachers of the law.
Jesus spoke to the crowds and his disciples.
"The People of the Book and the Pharisees are seated on the chair of Moses," he said.
I don't live like them. I do everything they tell me. But I don't do what they do. I don't deal with what they talk about.
They only care about tying heavy loads and placing them on people's shoulders. But they themselves don't even want to lift a finger to carry them.
Every time they kindle the fire of war, God extinguishes it. They strive to spread corruption on earth, and God does not love the spreaders of corruption. They also make idols and attribute them to God, to mislead people. They say, "These are your gods and God's," although God has no partners. They invent lies and attribute them to God, while they know it.
Humans like to sit in a place of honor in the middle. They like to sit in the front in the places of the great in churches.
How they love to kiss the cross. How they love it when you call them "Rabbi."
My servants shall call me "Rabbi." For you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession.
Don't call this one "father" on earth. You have one Father, who is in heaven.
I can't bear "in-between." You have one in-between, and he is the Messiah.
The oldest among you is your servant.
This is for anyone who wants to ride. And this is for anyone who rides.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You lock the door of the kingdom of heaven in people's faces; you yourselves do not enter, and you hinder those who are trying to enter.
(No
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are.
You rascals, you're blind! You say, "If someone swears by the temple, it means nothing. But if someone swears by the gold in the temple, they must keep their oath."
You are my uncle and a fool! What is more important? Is it gold? Or the temple that polishes the gold?
She often says, "If you work hard for the sake of wealth, it won't last. But if you work for the sake of the joy it brings, you'll never grow tired."
Fools! Why, what is more important? The gift? Or the altar that wipes out the gift?
This is as if what protects the Mazda protects its covenant and everything in it.
And whoever swears by the temple, swears by it and by Him who dwells in it.
And whoever swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God, and by Him who sits upon it.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin—but you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former.
"!Foolish guidance! Take the hook out of the bait. You're swallowing whole sentences!"
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed. You only want to satisfy yourselves.
"Pharisee that you are! First clean the inside of the cup and dishes, and then also the outside will be clean."
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead people's bones and everything unclean.
Hey, I know you. You're the one who used to do the dishes. But now, you're full of shit. You try to act all innocent.
"You snakes! You brood of vipers! How can you escape being condemned to hell? Therefore, I am sending you prophets and wise men and teachers, some of whom you will kill and crucify; others you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town. Yes, and upon you I will send judgment!"
"Why don't we enter, 'We were not there in the days when they came, we did not do what they did. We did not participate in the killing of the prophets.'"
One, testify against yourselves. Leave everything, everything, everything, everything, everything, everything, everything.
Complete the sins that those who lived before you started!
What a poisonous bird! How will you escape the judgment of hell?
I want to see you, my friends, and teachers. It's you who kills many of them. It's you who spies on them on Saturday. It's you who controls them all. It's you who uproots them from city to city.
The blood of your brother cries out to me from the ground. I want to say the blood of Abel, whom Cain killed before the Lord, "Now you are cursed from the ground, which has received your brother's blood from your hand. Although you will till the soil, it will no longer yield its strength to you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth."
I wanted to catch up with you. All this time, I was going through it alone, one day at a time.
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you to kill those who return your favors. How often have I gathered your children together, like a hen gathers her chicks under her wings! But you were not willing!
Look, your house is now empty.
"Do not see me again until I say: 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.' (Psalm 118:26)"
Signs of the Day of Resurrection
Jesus went out of the temple. As he was walking, his disciples came to him. They wanted to leave the temple buildings.
"Do you see all these things?" Jesus asked. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. His disciples came to him in secret and said, "Tell us, when will this happen? What will be the sign of your coming? What will be the sign of the end of the world?"
Jesus replied, "Beware of them! Do not let anyone mislead you."
"Hangi" is in my name. They will say, "I am the Messiah!" Many will be deceived.
Listen to the war. Listen also to people talking about war in the media. Don't be afraid. These things are going to happen. But no one knows the end.
The homeland will fight for the homeland. The kingdom will fight for the kingdom. People will suffer. There will be earthquakes in many places.
She started giving birth to twins.
Then they will hand you over to be mistreated and killed. All nations will hate you because of me.
Over time, many of them will come to know their religion. They will hate each other. They will fight among themselves.
Many false prophets will arise and deceive many people.
Because of this, the evil will increase, and the love of many will grow cold.
The wall that has no end is the one that succeeds.
This is the good news for the kingdom that it will be proclaimed throughout the world. It will be a testimony to all the people. After that, it will come to an end.
"The prophet Daniel spoke of the 'abomination that desolates' (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11). One day you will see it standing in the holy place. The reader must understand this statement."
Then those who are in Judea should escape to the mountains.
Mother, who in this world doesn't work for something?
Whoever sows in the desert will never reap the harvest.
Slowly, slowly, those nights on the carriers! Slowly, slowly, on those who are breastfeeding!
Don't pray for an easy life, pray for the strength to endure a difficult one.
It will be a severe torment for two days. It will be worse than anything from the beginning of the world until now. And its like will not happen again.
Law you didn't know time, you wouldn't feel its passing. Indeed, I want Allah to have mercy on His people.
Sometimes, someone might shout: "Look! There's the Messiah!" But "There he is!" Don't be fooled.
They are not ordinary servants, and their prophecies are lies. They will perform great signs and wonders. They will seek to deceive the people of God, if possible.
See, I told you so.
If they tell you "He's a desert lion," don't believe them. But if they tell you "He's a house lion," don't trust him.
The lightning comes from the east and is seen in the west. So will it be with the coming of the Son of Man.
Crows will gather everywhere there is a corpse.
After I went through severe affliction, "the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will be shaken." (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)
Our time is when the son of Adam meets in the sky. All the nations on Earth are our treasure. They see the son of Adam giving orders in the sky. He gives with determination and great pride.
He sends His angels with a mighty trumpet. Let them gather the best of people from all four directions. Let them bring them from one end of the heavens to the other.
Learn a lesson from the fig tree. When its branches become tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.
When you see all these things happening, you will know that I am near. It is at the door.
What you're telling us is right. The people who lived during that time, none of them are still alive even to see how things turn out.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. No one knows the day or the hour.
No one knows about that day or hour. Not even the angels in heaven know. The Son doesn't know. Only the Father knows.
They were like the people of Noah. She is like whoever comes from the children of Adam.
In the pre-flood era, people ate and drank. They married. They raised their children. They did all these things until the day Noah entered the ark.
They didn't know anything until the flood came and took them all. So will it be when the Son of Man comes.
Five men were in the field. One was taken and the others were left.
Fifty women are grinding with a manual mill. One takes and the other leaves.
Stay vigilant. You never know when the Lord will come.
You must understand something. Suppose the owner of the house knew what time of night the robber was coming. Then he would have kept watch. He would not have let his house be broken into.
And you too think you're clever. It's the son of Adam who will give you in your hour of need what you didn't expect.
It seems to me that a master entrusts one of his slaves with managing the rest in his house. This slave's task is to provide them with food at the right time. The master wants a faithful and wise slave for this.
It's not going to be easy for the slaves if their masters find them living off their work when they return.
That's not true. The master knows this donkey better than anyone else.
Lakin, I guess he'll play with me. He might say, "My master wants me to go away."
He may start beating other servants. He may eat and drink with those who drink excessively.
The servant will return one day when they least expect him. He will come at an hour they do not know.
Then the master will cut him to pieces. He will send him to the place where pretenders go. There people will weep and gnash their teeth.
The Story of the Ten Balcony Girls
It was as if the kingdom of heaven had come down to earth at that moment. A group of delicate women left their village and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were unaware. Five were smarter.
The fools took their lantern, but they didn't bring olive oil with them.
The wise ones took oil in their flasks with their lamps.
The preacher didn't come all the time. So all the worshippers got tired and fell asleep.
At midnight someone shouted, 'Here is the bridegroom! He has come!'
They treat every tribe as they treat themselves, writing down their words and equipping them.
The fools said to the wise: "Give us some of your oil. Our lamps are going out."
"No," they replied. "There might not be enough for all of us. Instead, go to the oil seller. Buy some for yourselves."
They understood and went to buy oil. But on their way, the neighbor is coming. The friends who are ready enter with him to the wedding dinner. Then the door closed.
After that, many friends came. They said, "Sir! Sir!" Open the door for us!"
"Truth, courage, 'The rest is silence. I don't know you."
I want to relax. You don't know a day or an hour when the wedding is coming. A story that has been going on for years.
"He was like a king of the sky. A man who travels far. He told his servants to prepare the goods for the journey."
She gave $10,000 to one person. She gave $4,000 to another person. And she gave $2,000 to a third person. The bride gave each of her friends as much as she could afford. Then she explained the situation to her husband.
The servant who was offered the ten thousand dollars went straight ahead and invested his money. He made another ten thousand dollars.
He who has $4000 earned an additional $4000.
But the man who was given $2000, he went and bought land. He buried his money in a jar in the ground.
After a while, the rich man became the slave's master. He wrote a will gathering all the money they had earned.
The man who bet $10,000 brought another $10,000. He said, "Sir, you've cost me $10,000. Look, I've won another $10,000."
Sidhu said to him: "You have done well, my good servant! You were good little by little. We will rule much, much. Come and share my joy!"
The man with $4000 is coming too. He said, "Sir, you put $4000 in my hand. Look, I've made an extra $4000."
Sidhu said to him, "You did well, served well, and were honest! You were honest in a few things. We will shower you with many (blessings). Come and share in your master's joy!"
The man who rented the room for 2000 dinars said, "Sir, I have a request. I am a sensitive man. Please consider the place where you don't feel comfortable. Concentrate your feelings in the place where you don't complain."
"I've hidden it. I took out and kept $2,000 for you in the ground. Look, here's your spot."
The man said: "Hey old man! Do you understand why I'm so angry? Do you understand why I'm collecting the thorns that you've scattered, and you're not staying to clean them up?"
"Well then, you should've deposited my money in the bank. When I returned, I would've gotten it back with interest."
He told the worker, "Take $2000 from him and give it to the one who has $20,000."
Everyone who is calm, the king will give him more. He will have more than enough. What if someone doesn't have anything? Even those who have will lose it.
That's the way things are done around here. People cry and cut onions in front of others. It's a tradition and a custom.
The Son of Man will return in His glory. All the angels will return with Him. Then He will sit on His throne in the glory of heaven.
Both nations will be gathered before him. He will separate people into two groups. He will be like a shepherd separating the sheep from the goats.
He will place the two sheep on his right and the children on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right, 'My Father has blessed you. Come and take what is yours. It is the kingdom prepared for you since the world was created.'
I was thirsty. And you gave me water to drink. I was a stranger. And you welcomed me.
I had no need for clothes. You gave them to me. I had a fever. You took care of me. I was in prison. You came to visit me.
And when the people who had done good deeds are asked, "My Lord," they will say, "When did we see you and do good deeds for you? When did we see you thirsty and give you a drink?"
When did you come back? When did you come back from abroad?
"When it rains, I'll visit you in prison and go see you?"
The king will reply, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.'
Then he will say to those on his left, 'You are cursed! Go away from me into the eternal fire of hell. It was prepared for the devil and his angels.
I was thirsty. But you didn't give me any water. I was hungry. But you didn't give me any food.
I was strange. But you didn't invite me. You had clothes. But you didn't give me any. I was in prison and you didn't visit me.
They also will answer: "Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty and did not help you? When did we see you a stranger or needing clothes, or sick or in prison and did not help you?"
Hello, "Let's talk in a language that is still alive. Don't limit yourself to one perspective, don't limit me either."
"Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but those who have done good will receive eternal life."
The plan to kill Jesus
When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
Then the chief priests met with the elders of the people. They met in the palace of Caiaphas, the high priest.
They devised a plan to cleverly get Jesus to sit down. They wanted to kill him.
"They say it's going to rain on Eid," they said. "The people are happy." A man sprinkled perfume on his clothes.
Jesus was in Bethany. He was in the house of a man named Simon, who had a skin disease.
A woman came to Jesus with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume. She poured it on his head as he was seated at the table.
The student saw this lesson, so he wrote it down. "Is this correct?" he asked.
Since he could sell the perfume at a high price, they could donate the money to poor people.
I know her. So I told them, "Why are you bothering her? She did something nice for me."
"Be a companion to the poor always. But do not let them always be your companions."
Still the fragrance lingers on my clothes from the night before last.
The word that I am speaking to you is life. The dog that you have made quiet is not speaking with me in every place where this worship is preached to this beloved people in the whole world. Speak with her in her mention. "Judah agrees and hands the cup to Jesus.
One of the twelve returned to our day. His name was Judas Iscariot.
He said, "What will you give me if I guide you to Jesus?" They offered him thirty pieces of silver.
After that, Judas realized the gravity of the situation they were in. The end of slavery.
It was the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover meal?"
He said, "Go to the town to a certain man. Tell him, 'The Teacher says, 'My time is near. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.'" "
Which students work as they are told. Write the correct times.
When the people went out to eat, Jesus sat at the table with the twelve.
And Judas said, "I have told you the truth. One of you will betray me to my enemies."
They were all filled with great sorrow. One by one, they began to say to him, "What is it, Lord?"
Jesus replied, "He who dipped his hand into the dish with me will betray me."
"That son of Adam will go as he was written about. But alas, what that son of Adam will give! It would have been better for him if he had not been born."
Judas could not bear to betray him. He said, "Master?" Jesus answered, "Yes. You."
And so, when they were at the table, Jesus took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take, eat; this is my body."
Then he took the cup. He gave thanks and passed it to them. He said, "All of you drink from it."
He made a new promise. He is forgiving the past mistakes.
I had a drink. After that, I didn't drink wine by myself today, but today is the day I drank it in my father's house.
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus says that Peter will fail.
Upon you, Jesus, "That night, you will all betray me. It is written in the book that the Lord said, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)"
"But after he is risen from the dead, then we will go before you into Galilee."
Peter said, "I'll buy you a drink. But I don't want one."
"Truly I tell you," Jesus answered, "today, even this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times and say, 'I do not know him.'"
And Peter said, "Master, it is well that we are here. Let us make three booths: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." And he did not know what
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane. He said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
Peter worked with the big cheese makers and their factories. He was very diligent and busy.
"I'm tired of writing, writing all the time. Show me what you want to write. It's here. Look at me."
He walked a little way, then fell face down on the ground. He cried out: "Master, if possible, take this cup of suffering away from me. But not my will, but yours be done."
"And they continued to ask him persistently. 'So you won't even give us a single break?' said Peter."
"Look and see. Then you will not fall into sin when you try. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
Jesus returned again. He prayed, "My Father, if this cup can be taken away, may it be done, but not as I will, but as you will."
Watch him go. Now he's going to find them. I'm not worried about him going alone.
They have it and they walk with it. They've been through three times as many prayers alike.
Then he returned to the disciples. He said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand. The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners."
"Come! Hurry! I need to reach them!" Jesus cried out.
We waited for the teacher, Judah. He was late. He was with a big dog. They were digging a hole and planting seeds. The old and experienced trees taught them.
Judas, who was to betray Jesus, gave them a signal. He said, "The one I kiss is the one. Take him."
Judas kissed Jesus on the cheek. He said, "Peace be upon you, Rabbi!" And they accepted him.
Jesus replied, "Friend, do what I came for." Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
In the market, one of Jesus' companions drew his sword. He swung it and struck a servant of the prophet, cutting off his ear.
"Put your sword back in its place," Jesus told him. "All who draw the sword will die by the sword."
Do you want to learn something from your father? He sends an army of 70,000 angels, each one alone.
What if the Book could speak? It would say it's like you.
One day, a servant of Jesus was calling the crowd. "If you wish to be with me, if you wish to be with me, if you wish to be with me, if you wish to be with me, if you wish to be with me, if you wish to be with me, if you wish to be with me..."
"And if he writes below, it will be a book for the prophets. If the students bring it, they will bring it. Jesus adds to the Sanhedrin."
Those who had seized Jesus hurried him away and took him to Caiaphas, the high priest. The teachers of the law and the elders had assembled there.
First, Peter asked Jesus. He wanted to talk to him. He went in and sat with the disciples to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were seeking evidence against Jesus to put him to death.
They found no evidence, even though many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two other witnesses stepped up.
They said, "This person claimed, 'I can destroy the temple of God. I can rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up. He asked Jesus, "Do you refuse to answer? What is it that these witnesses are testifying against you?"
And Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."
Name. Kima tgoul, jeb Jesus. "But this is how you should pray: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes. He said, "He has spoken blasphemy against God! Why do we need any more witnesses? You have heard his blasphemy."
"What do you think?" "He should die!" he replied.
What do you want on your face? I'll give you a punch. Others will give you a punch, too.
They said, "Prophesy to us, Christ! Who hit you?" Peter said he did not know Jesus.
Peter denied it vehemently. "I don't even know him," he said. "You are one of the followers of Jesus of Galilee," she replied.
"I told them all about it," Peter said. "Didn't you want them to talk to him about it?" he asked.
Then he went out to the gate leading into the courtyard. There another woman saw him. She said to the people, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
He said he didn't know. Bicar said, "I don't know the man!"
After a while, they turned to the topic of Peter. "You don't have an explanation," they said. "The truth will reveal itself."
Then Peter began to curse and swear, "I don't know the man!" And immediately a rooster crowed.
Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." He went outside and wept bitterly.
Judah hangs himself.
They decided tomorrow. All the great rulers and elders of the people decided to kill Jesus.
They shouted and demanded and insisted on crucifying him, even though he had done nothing wrong.
Judas, who had betrayed him, saw Jesus condemned to death. Overwhelmed with remorse and sorrow, he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
"I grew up in sin," he said. "And I accused an innocent man of something he didn't do." "What were you thinking?" they asked. "That's not your problem."
Judas threw the money into the crowd and ran away. Then he went away and hanged himself on a tree.
The Rabbatis raised the money. They said, "It is illegal to put this money in the temple fund. This is blood money. This is money paid for the price of a human life."
They decided to take this money to buy a ceramic field. People from other countries will be buried there.
They used to call him "Hqlat Eddim" in our days.
Then the words spoken by Jeremiah the prophet came true. He had said, "They took the 30 silver coins. That price was set for him by the people of Israel."
"They paid me thirty pieces of silver for this man, as the Lord commanded me. So I threw the silver into the temple and left."
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" "It is as you say," Jesus replied.
But when the question and the eyes were upon him, he didn't answer again.
Pilate, sneering at them, said, "What evil has this man done?"
Jesus didn't respond to the charge, nor to anyone. The governor was truly surprising.
It was the governor's custom at Easter to release one prisoner. The people chose whom they wanted.
At that time, they had a famous prisoner named Barabbas.
Then Pilate addressed the crowd, "Whom do you want me to release for you? Barabbas? Or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Pilate was aware of the priests' intentions. He knew this was their plan to get Jesus.
Pilate sought to release Jesus, but the crowd shouted for his crucifixion. He wrote on a sign, "Do not meddle with him. He has done nothing wrong. I found him innocent in my dreams last night."
"They all cried out, 'Release Barabbas! Crucify Jesus!'"
"Which of the two do you want released?" the governor asked. "Barabbas," they shouted.
"Truly, is this the one who causes trouble?" Pilate asked. "They all answered, 'Crucify him!'"
"Why? What evil has he done?" said Pilate. But they cried out all the more, "Crucify him!"
Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere with them. Rather, the crowd was becoming unrestrained. So he took water and washed his hands before them. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "It is your responsibility!"
Everyone answered, "We and our children will accept the blame for his death!"
Pilate released Barabbas. But he crucified Jesus. After that, he had them whipped. The soldiers mocked Jesus.
The governor's soldiers took Jesus into the palace, which was called the Praetorium. All the rest of the soldiers gathered around him.
They took his clothes and gave him a purple suit.
Then they twisted thorns together to make a crown. They placed it on his head. They put a stick in his right hand. Then they fell on their knees in front of him and made fun of him. "We honor you, king of the Jews!" they said.
He is stubborn. He insists on his opinion time and time again.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him of his robe. They returned his clothes to him. Then they led him away to be crucified. Jesus was crucified.
They went out of the city, and found a man of Cyrene, whose name was Simon. They compelled him to carry his cross.
They came to a place called Golgotha. Golgotha means the place of the skull.
They took the vine and pruned it skillfully, then they brought the grapes to Jesus to drink. After the feast, they did not neglect their Lord.
When they saw him coming, they ran towards him with joy.
They sat down and kept watch over him there.
They placed the written notice above his head. It read, "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews."
I sat next to him. One on his right and one on his left.
They had a contract with him that they would build the church and work on it. They wrote it with their own hands.
And they said, "Do you understand? Destroy the temple and build it again in three days? Save yourself! Come down from the cross if you are the Son of God!"
When the wise, the teachers, and the foolish speak ill of you.
"He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
God grants. May God grant it to her now if she wants it. He is the one who said, "I am the Son of God."
The rulers who were accustomed to dealing with Jesus began to plot against him, as Jesus was about to die.
This very day, all the earth is marked for judgment.
Work is sweet, like the voice of Ali calling upon Jesus. He said, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" This translates to "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some who were standing near heard Jesus cry out. They said, "He is calling Elijah."
One of them brought a sponge. He filled it with vinegar and gave it to him on a reed. He drank it.
They said: "Leave them alone. Let's see if Elias comes to save them."
After all that happened to Jesus, he died.
In that army, the curtain of the sanctuary was torn from top to bottom. The earth shook. The rocks split.
Graves were broken open. Many bodies of holy people who had died were sent back to life.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus was raised to life, they entered the holy city. There they appeared to many people.
The Roman commander and those who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and everything that had happened. They were terrified and said, "Certainly this was the Son of God!"
"For this reason, they became my trusted friends. They were like Jesus from Galilee, always ready to help."
Mary Magdalene was among them. Mary, the mother of James and Joses, was also there. So was the mother of Zebedee's sons. Jesus Is Buried
When the evening came, a rich man from the town of Arimathea came, whose name was Joseph. He had become a disciple of Jesus.
Pilate washed his hands and said, "I am innocent of this man's blood."
Joseph took the jacket and put it in a clean drawer.
They found a new tomb that they had cut from the rock. They had cut a large stone before the entrance to the tomb. Then they went away.
Mary Magdalene was the first Mary who came to the tomb. The guards of the tomb
"Today is the day after the day of the festival. The chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate."
"My lord," they said, "we remember what a liar he was while he was still alive. He said, 'In three days I will be back.'"
"They have ordered that his grave be guarded until Wednesday. If they don't do it, his disciples will come and steal his body. Then they will tell people that Jesus has risen from the dead. This is the last lie that comes from the first."
"Take a few soldiers with you," Pilate answered. "Go and make the tomb as secure as you can."
They understood and did the grave. Amen. They placed a seal on the stone and posted some guards on duty.
Jesus rose from the dead.
Saturday was over. It was dawn on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
It was a powerful earthquake. An angel of the Lord came down from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled away the stone and sat on it.
His body shone like lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so scared of him that they didn't even move and became like the dead.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus, whom they crucified."
This is madness! Get up, as you said you would! Deal with it, he's looking and there's nothing I can do about it.
Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you.
"In which, habits become graves. You see them, but they are not satisfied with joy. They become the slaves of desires."
Suddenly Jesus met them. He said, "Peace be with you!" They came to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers, 'Go to Galilee; there you will see me.'" The guards went and reported to the chief priests.
A group of women were walking in the street, after the guard left the city. They told each other that they had nothing to fear.
When the mothers meet with the old woman, they decide on something. The soldiers' book reached a large amount of money.
They said to the soldier: "I love you to death, I've asked him to stay with me until the end of the night. I drank his cup one after the other."
"If the driver hears the brake, we'll let him know. It'll help you not to have any problems."
Which of them took the money and did as they were told. This story is still used to demonize the Jews to this day. Jesus' final commands to his disciples.
The dog chased the cat. It was faster than her.
Let's see him, let's judge him. That's how doubts remain in them.
Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
"Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."
"They taught him everything they knew. And you claim you're always with me, till the end."
John the Baptist Prepares the Way
It was the beginning of the end for Jesus, the son of Mary.
"I will send my messenger before you, who will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
"A voice cries out in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.' " (Isaiah 40:3)
And so came John. He was baptizing people in the desert. He also said that people should be baptized and repent of their sins, and then God would forgive them.
Both the people from the countryside of Judea and the people from Jerusalem came out to him. When they confessed their sins, he baptized them in the Jordan River.
John hates my old poems. He's jealous of my success. And he's bitter about his failure.
John said, "That's great, this gives me one less thing to worry about. I don't want to burden you with my problems."
I am your servant as far as water goes. But he is your servant as far as the spirit of the temple is concerned. His sin is forgiven and covered.
At that time, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
Then Jesus came up from the water. The heavens were opened to him. The Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove.
A voice spoke to him from heaven. It said, "You are my son, and I love you. I am very proud of you."
One of the disciples asked Jesus in the desert.
Can endure the desert for 40 days. Here Satan tempted him. No wild animal tempted him. The angel tempted him. Jesus chooses the first disciples.
After John was imprisoned, Jesus returned to Galilee and preached the gospel of God.
"I have fulfilled the time," he said. "The kingdom of God is at hand. Repent of your sins and believe the gospel!"
Youma Yesoua kane marchee 'ala sahel Buhayret Ghaliya. Huna kane chaf Simon w akhuh Andrew. Kenu kenu yelqaw naht 'ala lbuhayra. Kenu semakine. Jesus was walking by the Sea
"Thomas. Reach out your hand and put it into my side," Jesus said. "Do not doubt but believe."
I miss you a lot and I want to see you.
Then Jesus walked a little farther. As he did, he saw James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat preparing their nets.
"I have missed them. They went out in their boat with their father Zebedee and immediately they left him and followed Jesus. Jesus released them from evil spirits."
Jesus and those with him went to Capernaum. When the Sabbath came, he went into the synagogue and began to teach.
The people were amazed at his teaching. He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
Then a man in their synagogue shouted. He was under the control of an evil spirit. He said,
"What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!"
"Be quiet!" Jesus said politely. "Get out of here!"
The spirit of evil shook the man violently. Then it came out of him with a scream.
Both the people were amazed. They asked each other: "What is this? A new teaching! And with authority! He even commands the demons, and they obey him."
The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left the synagogue. They immediately went with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simon and Hamma were lying in bed. They had a fever. They told me to leave them alone.
This is a book. Play with it, and you'll learn. The pictures are beautiful. After that, you'll be able to read them.
This night is strange, it belongs to the lonely, to those who are sick. And it belongs to the one who is alone, to all those who are possessed by demons.
All the people of the city gathered at the gate.
Jesus healed many of them. They had all kinds of diseases. He also cast out many demons. But he would not permit them to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prayed in a solitary place.
It was still very early in the morning and dark. Jesus got up and left the house. He went to a place where he could be alone. There he prayed.
Simon and his companions grew up to follow Jesus.
And so, Abdou said, "We all love you!"
Jesus replied, "Let's go somewhere else. I want to go to the nearby towns. I also need to preach here. That's why I came."
And he preached in all Galilee. And he taught in their synagogues, and cast out devils. And he healed all that were sick, who had divers diseases and torments.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus. There was a leper on his knee. He said, "If you want to, you can make me clean."
Jesus had deep concerns. He reached out and touched the man. He said, "I am willing to do it." "Be 'pure'!"
I wished that day would end his illness. It was over.
He usually does it all the time. Give him a strong warning.
"This is what happened," he said. "I am not a hero. I only did what anyone would do in such a situation. The real heroes are those who stood up to the oppressor and the people who supported them."
But he withdrew to a desolate place and prayed. He knew what they were going to do, for he knew all things. He perceived that they were about to come and take him, so he remained in a place where he was alone. But many people came to him from all directions.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk.
A few days later, Jesus again entered Capernaum, and the people heard that he was at home.
"Many people gathered around me in that place. There was no room, not even outside the door. And Jesus spoke to them the word of God."
Four from this village used to carry a man who couldn't walk.
They could not bring him to Jesus because of the crowd. So they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and let him down on a mat.
Jesus saw their faith and said to the man, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
The book is teaching them patience. They are learning.
"Why is this man talking like this? He said something very evil! But God can forgive sins!"
