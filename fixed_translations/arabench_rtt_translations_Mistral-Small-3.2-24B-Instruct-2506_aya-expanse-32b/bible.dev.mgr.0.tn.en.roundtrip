These 144,000 are associated with the 12 tribes of Israel and the 12 apostles, symbolizing unity and completeness. Jesus Christ is the central figure in this context, as He is the one who redeems and leads them.
And she gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn. Before they could begin their journey back home, she had to give birth to him. His birth was caused by the Holy Spirit.
Her husband Joseph was a good man. He didn't want to scandalize her, so he decided to divorce her quietly.
And he wanted Joseph to stay with her, but an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
"And there came a voice from heaven, saying, 'This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.' And he said, 'This is how you will know him: the one and only Son of God, who came down from heaven and gave his life for us.'"

Joseph stayed. He saw a bright light from the sky. He found Mary in the stable giving birth.
But who would have believed us except Joseph and those who were baptized with the baptism of Jesus?
Wisdom will come to Jesus.
Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of King Herod. After Jesus was born, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
They said, "Where is the child who has been born to be king of the Jews? When we were in the East, we saw a star. Now we have come to worship him."
Oh Herod, the king, heard about it, and wrote a new letter. Everyone in Jerusalem was astonished.
Herod assembled all the chief priests and scribes of the people. He inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.
"From Bethlehem in Judea," they answered. "This is the prophet's writing. Search and see."
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times." (Micah 5:2)
Herod ordered the judges to be executed. He learned from one of them how the moon moves as it waxes.
He sent them to Bethlehem. He said, "Go! Search carefully for the child. When you have found him, bring me a report. Then we too will go and worship him."
After the three wise men had heard the king, they traveled. The star they had seen in the east went before them. In the end, it stood over the place where the child was.
The stars may be distant, but they are filled with joy.
The wise men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They knelt down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures. They gave him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
And God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their home by another route. Jesus' family fled to Egypt.
When the king's command was issued, Joseph was released from the dungeon. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him. The angel said, "Get up! Take your wife and child and go to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you to return. Herod will search for the child. He will want to kill him."
Joseph came. In the night, he left for Egypt with the child and Mary.
They remained there until the death of King Herod. Thus were fulfilled the words spoken by the Lord through the prophet: "I have chosen to bring my son out of Egypt." (Ezekiel 11:1)
Herod understood the wisdom of their request. He was going to seek him. He sent orders to Bethlehem and its surroundings. All the boys aged two years and under were to be killed. That was in accordance with the time when the wise men saw the star.
"Go down, says the prophet Jeremiah, to the potter's house. There you will hear my words."
A voice was heard in Ramah, a voice of weeping and great mourning. Rachel weeps for her children; she refuses to be comforted, because they are no more. (Jeremiah 31:15) Jesus' family returned to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was in Egypt. In the dream, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said, "Arise! Take the child and his mother. Go to the land of Israel. Those who were trying to kill the child are dead."
Well, Joseph came. He took the child and his mother Mary to the land of Israel.
After that, Joseph heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea instead of his father Herod. Since Joseph was afraid to go there, he was divinely warned in a dream to return to Galilee.
He grew up in the town of Nazareth. When he began his ministry, the prophets called him Jesus of Nazareth. They said, "He is the Nazarene."
Jane Al-Ma3moun returned the book.
During this time, Yehya worked for Ma3moudi and taught at the Jewish Sahara.
He said, "Repent of your sins! The kingdom of heaven is near."
"A voice cries out in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.' " (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes were made of camel hair. He wore a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
People came out to meet him from Jerusalem and all Judea. They also came from the whole region around the Jordan.
The lesson they learned from this mistake, John made them pay in the Jordan River.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to him where he was baptizing. He said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Bearing fruit shows that you have turned away from your sins.
And you said to us, "Abraham is our father." But I want you to know that God could raise up children for Abraham from these stones.
He picked the green figs. Each fig didn't have a beautiful color, it was still ripening. It was still ripening on the tree.
Ana abdak bi-l-ma. Wallāhi ʿalaykum ʿal-tawwā ʿala-khatāyākum. Lakin baʿda anā, hadā yaʿṭī lladhī huwa aqwa minnī. Wa-mā ʿandīš taḥammul ḥaḍaratihī. Huwa yaʿbuduka bi-r-rūḥ al-qudsī wa-bi-lnnār.
The servant is a slave in the hands of his master. He gathers his master's wealth in the warehouse. But he squanders the money on things that are of no use to him. He is a spendthrift.
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan. He was baptized by John.
John said to them, "I need you. Will you even come to me?" He said to Jesus, "I need you. Will you even come to me?"
Jesus replied, "It must be this way at this time. It is for this that I have come. It will be done according to God's sacred plan." Then John agreed.
Let it be Issa is happy, saturated with light. At this time, he found peace. Issa saw himself going to God with a little bit of the warmth of the bath.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Isa Awatif
The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert. There, the devil tempted him.
After 40 days and 40 nights of what seemed like chaos, Jesus lived.
The devil came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread."
Jesus replied, "It is written, 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.' " (Deuteronomy 8:3)
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city. He had him stand on the highest point of the temple.
If you are the Son of God, he said, "throw yourself down. For it is written, 'The Lord will command his angels to watch over you. They will lift you up in their hands. Then you will not strike your foot against a stone.'" (Psalm 91:11, 12)
Strangely, he replied, "It also says, 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
وأخيراً، أخذ الشيطان عيسى إلى جبل عالٍ جداً. أظهر له جميع ممالك العالم و مجدها.
"If you kneel and prostrate yourself before me," he said, "I'll give you all of this."
Ajees said to him, "Get away from me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only you shall serve.' " (Deuteronomy 6:13)
"What did Satan want from him [Jesus]? An angel came and served him. Jesus began to sweat blood."
John was imprisoned. When Jesus heard about it, he returned to Galilee.
Jesus came from Nazareth. He lived in the city of Capernaum, which was on the seashore in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
"Whoever teaches the book of Isaiah will be rewarded by God."
Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee of the Gentiles! The land by the Mediterranean Sea! The region beyond the Jordan River!
"The people walking in darkness will see a great light. For those living in a land of deep darkness, a light will shine on them." (Isaiah 9:1-2)
At that time, Jesus began to preach. "Repent," he said, "for the kingdom of heaven is near." Jesus chose the first three disciples.
One day, while walking along the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were fishermen, casting their nets into the sea.
"Thomas. Reach out your hand and put it into my side," Jesus said. "Do not doubt but believe."
We miss you and we want to see you.
"After this, Jesus called out James and John, the sons of Zebedee. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. When they heard Jesus calling, they immediately left the boat and their father, and followed Jesus."
They took the sheep and their lambs and fled towards the mountain. May Issa heal the sick.
Jesus traveled through all Galilee. There he taught in their synagogues, preached the good news of the kingdom, and healed every disease and sickness among the people.
The news about him spread throughout Syria. People brought to him all who were sick with every kind of disease. Some were suffering from severe pains. Others were possessed by demons. Some were behaving wildly. Others were paralyzed. And Jesus healed them all.
Many people followed him. Some came from Galilee, from the region known as the Ten Cities, and from Jerusalem and Judea. Others came from the region across the Jordan.
Isa gives blessings.
Jesus saw the crowds. He went up a mountain and sat down. His disciples came to him.
And then he started teaching them. He said,
Blessed are those who are poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are those who are humble. That land.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for justice. They will be filled.
Blessed are those who show mercy. They will be shown mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are those who bring peace. They will be called children of God.
Blessed are those who suffer for what is right. The kingdom of heaven is theirs.
God bless you when people mock you and harm you because of me. God bless you too when they lie to you with all kinds of lies because of me.
"He who is happy and content. May Allah reward you with good in heaven. With joy and happiness, people ran to the prophet from all directions. Salt and light."
It's foggy today. But I guess the fog will lift later. Can it stay foggy? I don't want to go out. She's the one who's going to work anyway. People are going to work on their own.
You are the light of the world. A city built on a mountain cannot be hidden.
Mother, don't let them touch the fly and bring it under the glass. Instead, let them bring it to its place. And after that, I'll give the fly to everyone in the house.
When he came, he found the situation very different. He wanted to see the beauty or make it. And they praised God for the situation. The law comes with all its meanings.
"You shall not think that I have come to abolish what is written in the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish, but to fulfill."
I'm telling you the truth. Heaven and earth will pass before a single letter of the law is changed. Not even a dot or a stroke of a pen will pass from the law until everything is accomplished.
Do not break even the least of these commandments. And do not let others break them. If you do, you will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But if you practice and teach these commandments, you will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
I had enough. I don't want to be stronger than Persian and the teacher. If you're not, don't even think about challenging the strong. Killer.
"You have heard what was said to those of ancient times, 'You shall not murder.' (Exodus 20:13) Whoever murders will be punished for it."
That is what I am telling you. If your brother is angry with you, do not be angry with him. For whoever is angry with his brother shall be liable to judgment. And whoever says to his brother, 'Raca,' shall be liable to the Sanhedrin. But whoever says, 'You fool!' shall be liable to hellfire.
"See if you have returned your gift to the altar. And remember if your brother has returned a little to you."
"Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled with your brother, and then come and offer your gift."
Find someone who has a complaint against you and is taking you to court. Resolve the issue quickly. Settle it with them on the way. If you don't do that, they will hand you over to the judge. The judge will hand you over to the officer. And then they will throw you in jail.
I don't have any money left. Not even a single penny! Zena
"You shall not commit adultery." (Exodus 20:14)
That's the last straw. Don't you dare look at another woman or I'll break your face. We're all good people here, but you've crossed the line.
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
If your wife obeys you kindly, keep her and treat her well. She is not just a part of your body. Your behavior towards her will be judged by God, and you will be held accountable for your actions. Divorce her.
They said: "If a man divorces his wife, he must give her a divorce certificate." (Deuteronomy 24:1)
Here is your translation: "This is your mistake. Everyone who points it out to you is teaching you to correct it. And everyone who corrects it for you is teaching the pointer to correct it. The pointer may be able to point out to you in your mistake if he was not good at it himself. Swear."
"Again, you have heard what was said to your ancestors: 'Do not break the oath you made to the Lord, and do not break your vows to him.'"
That is our legacy. You don't do that to the dead. You don't do that to a fallen soldier. That is cruelty.
Don't treat them like dirt. This is the cradle of humanity. Don't treat them like Jerusalem. This is the city of the great king.
And you cannot control what is on your head. You cannot change the color of a single hair, whether white or black.
Simply let your "Yes" be "Yes." Let your "No" be "No." Anything beyond this is from the evil one. Be kind to others.
I heard him say, "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth" (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21).
"That's all over. Don't look back. 'Remember the one who walked into your life and handed you the knife that you held in your right hand. Tell your right hand to let go of the knife.
If anyone takes you to court because of your shirt, let him have your coat as well.
"If someone hates you for a mile, walk with him two miles."
I wait for those who ask. I don't reject those who want to learn. Your love is eternal.
"You have heard him say, 'Love your neighbor (Leviticus 19:18). Hate your enemy."
"This is what I've been telling you. Love is madness. May God have mercy on the one who loves."
"You are the children of your Father in heaven. He makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous."
If you love those who love you, what will you gain? Even tax collectors do the same.
If you only greet your own people, what more are you doing than others? Even people with no religion do the same.
Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Concerning the people who are poor
Only do good deeds before the eyes. Don't do them so people can see you. If you do, your Father in Heaven will not reward you.
Again, they whisper to the ignorant, and do not enlighten them with words of wisdom. Do not be like the Latin who possesses them. They whisper and do what they do in the assembly and in public. They want to be feared by the people. We tell you the truth. Complete their army.
Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.
Dima keep your secrets safe. Your father will kill you. Look what you've done. Prayer.
"The problem is that they don't know how to deal with people. They want to control and manipulate in the name of religion. They want to watch over people. Those who talk to you are witnesses. Leave them alone."
"The door is locked, and the key is lost. Seal the door and leave it to God. God will speak to you. God will reveal the secrets."
"It's a puzzle, whether you speak up or stay silent. The absent don't understand. They say, let the servant who hears talk more."
Just be yourself. Your father knows what you want before you even ask him.
"And he said, 'This is the way to heaven. ' 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name."
Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we also forgive those who sin against us.
Protect us from falling into sin when we are tempted. Deliver us from evil.
Forgive people when they wrong you. If you do that, the One who forgives in the heavens will forgive you as well.
Don't judge people by their appearance, but by their character. Assume.
Mother, don't be ashamed to show a little kindness to your face, to your neighbor's face, to your religion. This is what they do, they do, they do. They do, they do, they do. They do, they do, they do. They do, they do, they do. They do, they do, they do. They do, they do.
And when you finish eating, don't forget to put olive oil on your face. Wash your hands.
This is what I want everyone to know: I only want God, the Unseen, to know. He is the one who speaks to you. God sees what they do in secret. Gather wealth in the Hereafter.
You do not guard the good things in the land. The ants and the locusts destroy them. The destroyers are able to overstep them and steal them.
Instead, build your wealth in heaven. There, they don't want to destroy it. There, there are no thieves to steal it.
Your heart is where your wealth is.
I'm writing a book about the body. I think your eyes are beautiful. Your body is written in another way.
Lakin suppose your eyes are bad. Then your whole body will be full of darkness. If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
"They always change their minds. One day they love someone, the next they hate them. They're loyal to one person and despise the other. It's all about money and God knows best."
Colleague, don't feel bad. Don't feel bad about your life and don't eat and don't drink. And don't feel bad about your body and don't neglect it. Don't you have more right to life than bread? Don't you have more right to your body than to neglect it?
Look at the birds in the sky. They don't sow or reap, they don't gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren't you worth more than they?
Have you ever lived in a small town?
Why are you burdening yourself with books? Look, the wildflowers are blooming. They neither take nor give anything.
"That was a lie. Solomon never gathered his wisdom from writing one of those proverbs."
If God clothes the grass of the field, which today is here, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
You're changing. Don't say, "What do I say?" Or, "What do I buy?" Or, "What do I wear?"
People who are not accustomed to running after all those things. Your Father who is in heaven knows that you need them.
I want God's milk twice. Do as you like. After that, you'll work on all these things.
You talk to me in the future. The future is what talks to its future. Every day I have something new with this guy.
When Adil Menna Ruled the World
I can't cheat. I want to be able to.
We judge you as we judge others. We measure you as we measure others.
You see the splinter in your friend's eye, but you do not see the log in your own eye.
How can you tell your friend, 'Let me remove the speck from your eye'? How can you say this while there is a plank in your own eye?
You hypocrite! First, remove the splinter of wood from your own eye. Then you will see clearly to remove the speck of dust from your friend's eye.
The pigs ate the sacred heart. They devoured the jewels of the swine. If they eat, they will come for you. After that, they'll turn on you and spit on you. Ask, Fatcho, Tkacho.
Ask and you shall receive. Seek and you shall find. Knock and the door shall be opened unto you.
Everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. The door will open for him who knocks.
See your son asking you for bread. Which one of you will give him a stone?
The law can be fair, but how many of you have seen it?
Mother, you're wrong, you know your children love gifts. Either like two brothers who want to give you a gift or make you one.
For all that, they have hearts with which to understand, and eyes with which to see. This is mentioned in the Quran and in the Hadith. The Great and Small Gates of Understanding.
Enter the Kingdom of God through the narrow gate. The gate is wide and the road is broad that leads to destruction and hell. Many people go there.
Walls are happy and the road is short, allowing life to pass. I want people to find it. A tree and its fruit.
A guard against false prophecies. They will walk towards you, scattering like dust. But within them, a hungry seed grows.
I can't control what they do. "What's this noise? What's that smell?"
A good tree bears good fruit. But a corrupt tree bears corrupt fruit.
A good tree does not bear bad fruit, and a bad tree does not bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
I'm trying to learn from my mistakes.
Only he who says to me, "Lord, Lord," and does the will of my Father in heaven will enter the kingdom of heaven.
Many will say to me on that day, "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?"
"I want to tell them off, 'I can't put up with this anymore. Get out of here, you bunch of idiots!'" The Smart and Fed-up Woman
It's a mess, all this noise and people following them everywhere. There are even people climbing on the rocks.
The rain is pouring down. The water is rising. The winds are blowing and beating against the house. But it won't go away. It's built on rock.
But still, everyone hears this word and does not treat it with the wisdom of a reasonable man. He builds his house on sand.
The rain is pouring down. The water is rising. The winds are blowing and banging against that house. And it's causing a lot of damage.
Jesus kept saying all these things. The crowds were amazed at his teaching.
He can't talk like a person in power. He doesn't speak like their teachers in class.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain. Large crowds followed him.
A man with a skin disease came and knelt before Jesus, saying, "Lord, if you choose, you can make me clean."
Jesus healed the leper and touched him. The man said, "I want to be clean." Jesus said, "Be clean!" And immediately, the man was cleansed of his leprosy.
Jesus said, "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not murder; and whoever murders shall be liable to judgment.' But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be guilty of judgment." The Roman commander believed in him.
Jesus came to Capernaum, and a Roman centurion sent servants to him, pleading for his help.
"Sir," he said, "I have a sick servant at home who cannot move. He is in great distress."
Jesus said, "This I will do; I will heal him."
The leader replied, "My lord, I am not worthy to have you come to my house. But speak the word, and my servant will be healed.
I am the man in charge here. When I give an order, it is obeyed. I say to one, "Go," and he goes. I say to another, "Come," and he comes. I say to the servant, "Fetch," and he fetches.
The name of Jesus is powerful, indeed. I said to everyone who was working: "I want to tell you the truth. In Israel, at this time, I didn't find much faith."
"Many will come from the east and the west. They will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of heaven. They will sit with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."
"But those who follow those among them who are in authority, they will be driven out from it, into the darkness. There they will cry and lament."
Dima is shouting at Jesus on the cross: "Scoundrel! It's you who should be doing this." And the crowd strikes him on the hour. Jesus lowers his gaze over the people.
Jesus went to Peter's house and saw Peter's mother-in-law. She was in bed with a fever.
Jesus took her by the hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to serve him.
"He said to them, 'It is written, Do not test the Lord your God.' He knew what they were thinking and said to them, 'Why do you test me? Hand me this money.' They brought it, and he said to them, 'Whose image and inscription is this?'"
He took our infirmities and bore our diseases. (Isaiah 53:4) This was fulfilled in Jesus.
Then Jesus made the crowds get into the boats and go ahead of him to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
"Wahas, the wise one among the dates. Ghilas replied, 'Wise one, I will follow you wherever you go.'"
Jesus replied, "Foxes have holes, and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
"My lord, first let me go bury my father."
And Jesus said to him, "Follow me. Let the dead bury their own dead." Jesus Calms the Storm
Jesus got into a boat. His disciples followed him.
Suddenly, a terrible storm arose on the lake. The waves beat against the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
The students went and woke him up. They said, "Oh no! Help us! We're sinking!"
He said, "Your faith is very small! Why are you so afraid?" Then Jesus got up and commanded the winds and the waves to stop. It became completely calm.
The disciples were amazed. They asked, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and waves obey him!" Jesus healed two men possessed by demons.
Jesus arrived at the other side of the lake in the region of the Gadarenes. He encountered two men possessed by demons, who came out from the tombs. They were so violent that no one could pass by.
"Son of God, what do you want from us?" they asked. "Have you come here to punish us before our time of judgment?"
Later, they ate a lot of snails in their food.
The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to the demons, "Go!" And they came out of the men and entered the pigs. The whole herd rushed down the steep slope into the sea and drowned.
Those who were guarding the pigs fled. They went to the town and reported everything. They told the people what had happened to the men who were possessed by the demons.
Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged him to leave their area.
Jesus heals a man who could not walk.
Jesus took a step into the boat, traveled to the other side of the lake, and came to his city.
Some men came carrying a paralytic, because they couldn't get him to Jesus. So they dug a hole in the roof and let him down in front of Jesus. Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
Then some teachers of the law said to themselves, "This fellow is saying a very evil thing!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to them, "Why do you have evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Is "Your sins are forgiven" easier to say than "Get up and walk"?
I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. Then he said to the man who was paralyzed, "Get up, take your mat and go home."
The man stood up and went home.
"When you see this, you will be amazed. They do not pray to that authority given to man. Jesus speaks through Matthew."
Jesus saw a man named Matthew sitting in the tax booth. "Follow me," he told him. Matthew got up and followed him.
After that, Jesus was having dinner at Matthew's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" came. They were all with Jesus and his disciples.
The Pharisees saw this and asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
The healthy don't need a doctor; the sick do.
Walk and know what this means: "I desire mercy, not sacrifice" (Ezekiel 6:6). I did not come to see those who think they are right with God. I came to see the sins that follow me.
One day some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem. They asked, "Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They don't wash their hands before they eat!"
You, Jesus, have said, "How can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
I wanted to introduce my new brother at the big party. My new brother is younger than me. This is the first time I've been the oldest sibling.
No one can pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the new wine will burst the old skins; the wine will spill, and the skins will be ruined. No, new wine needs new wineskins. That way, both are preserved.
Once Jesus was there, and a ruler came up and knelt before him. "My daughter has just died," he said. "But come and put your hand on her, and she will live."
When Jesus rose, they accompanied him and his disciples.
Then, a woman came up behind Jesus. She had a bleeding disorder that had lasted twelve years. She touched the edge of his clothes.
She thought, "I only need to touch his clothes. Then I will be healed.
Jesus came and saw her. "Mary, do not lose hope," he said. "Your faith has healed you." And Mary was healed instantly.
When Jesus entered the ruler's house, he saw the mourners there. And he saw the wailing crowd.
He said, "Go. The girl is not dead. She is sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After they finished building the monument, Jesus entered. He took it in his hand and stopped.
News about what Jesus had done spread all over that area. Jesus Heals Two Blind Men
Jesus wept, he wrote four gospels that they might be believed. They wrote: "Have mercy on us, O sons of David!"
Jesus entered the house and saw a man who was blind. He touched him and said, "Do you want me to heal you?" "Yes, Lord," he answered.
Then he touched their eyes. He said, "It will happen to you just as you believed."
They went back to see. Jesus warned them sternly, "Make sure no one knows about this."
They came out and spread the news. They talked about it everywhere in this region.
They left him, and a man returned to his wife. The devil had deceived him, and he could not speak.
When the devil speaks, listen to the man. People are amazed. They say, "No one has ever seen this in Israel."
The Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons." And he did not call them to account.
Jesus went through all the cities and villages. He taught in their synagogues. He preached the gospel of the kingdom. And he healed every disease and weakness.
When you see the flock, write about them that they are alive. They were visible and present, like sheep with the shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
"Therefore, pray to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his field."
Jesus sends the twelve disciples.
Jesus called twelve disciples to come to him. He gave them authority to cast out evil spirits and to heal every disease and weakness.
He had twelve disciples. Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. James the son of Zebedee and his brother John.
Next are Philip and Bartholomew, and also Thomas and Matthew the tax collector. Two more are James, son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus.
Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas was the one who betrayed Jesus to his enemies.
Jesus sent these twelve out with the following instructions: "Do not go to any Gentile town, and do not enter any Samaritan city.
Makach, morning to the children of Israel. They are the authors of their own destiny.
The message 'The Kingdom of Jordan is nearby.'

Jesus and John the Baptist
When Jesus had finished teaching his twelve disciples, he went on to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples to ask him.
They said to Jesus, "Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?"
Jesus replied, "Go back to John. Tell him what you have seen and heard."
Two blind men see. Two lame men walk. Lepers are healed. The deaf hear. The dead are raised. The Gospel of good news is proclaimed to the poor.
Blessed are those who do not lose their faith because of me.
"When they had finished eating, Jesus said to his disciples, 'Who is it that the Son of Man is going to betray? Is it not the one eating with me?'"
"What's up, have you seen what's happening? Is the man crazy? Yes. The people are crazy in the king's palace."
Do you want to eat cheese? Me? Yes, I think so, or maybe not.
"He will be like a refiner's fire and like fullers' soap. He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, so that they may present righteous offerings to the Lord." (Malachi 3:1-3)
"What then shall we say of these things? That they are all wrong. No one born of woman is greater than John the Baptist. But the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he."
At that time, Ghanem El-Maammad, the king of the sky, entered with force. And a force that called him.
Both the prophet and the scripture prophesied until I came as John.
If you are willing to accept it, John is the Elias who was supposed to come.
To Allah belong the most beautiful names, and to Him alone belong all that is in the heavens and the earth.
"What's in people's hearts today? They're like two children sitting in the squares and listening to others. He says,"
" 'I told you to be careful. But you didn't listen. I told you to be patient. But you didn't obey.' "
John came, but he didn't stay long. No one said, 'There's a devil in him.'
But when a son of Adam intends to do wrong, he accuses his soul and offers excuses. And people say, "This is the one who, when he wants to do wrong, blames his soul and offers excuses. He is truthful in what he intends and deceitful in what he does." Sensible people judge by actions. A city does not change for a mistake.
Jesus began to speak against the towns where he had done most of his miracles. The people there had not repented of their sins. So he said:
"Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes."
One, spare me. On the day of judgment, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon than for you.
And what about you, Capernaum? Will you be exalted to heaven? No! You will be brought down to the realm of the dead. For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would still be standing today.
"I want to collect these. On the Day of Judgment, they will be easier for the Sodomites than for you." She said this to everyone present.
At that time, Jesus said, "Father, I thank you that you have heard me. I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the sake of the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me. You gave them the words of eternal life."
Name, Father. This is what I love.
Welcome back home.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
"He is a servant who learns from me. I am knowledgeable and not arrogant. Deal with me gently, for your minds' sake."
"She serves me easily, and her weight is light."
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
Jesus was crucified on the day of the Sabbath. The disciples were afraid. They were talking about the bread and eating.
The Pharisees saw this and said to him, "Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath."
Did you like what you read about David? He and his men were hungry.
That's what God wanted. He and His angels chose it. Some people want to eat the fruit.
Do you know what? It's as if the whole world is conspiring against the poor as if they are the cause of all the problems. But that's not fair.
This is the last straw.
The Bible says, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Ezekiel 6:6) You do not understand these words. If you did, you would not bring accusations against innocent people.
"The son of man is lord of the Sabbath."
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
A man with a withered and twisted hand was there. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. So they asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If one of your sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not lift it out?"
A man is worth more than a sheep! I thought the law allowed us to do good on Saturday.
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out. It was as good as new, just as good as the other hand.
The Pharisees went out and began to plot against him, how to destroy him. The servant of God, appointed.
Jesus knew all about the Pharisees' plans. So they left that place. Many people followed him, and he healed all their sick.
They have what they say, say who they are.
Can you believe what the prophet Isaiah said? He said:
I had a servant. I fired him. He's the one they wanted. I'm very happy about it. I'll get rid of him. He's going to announce to the nations that everything is going to collapse.
He doesn't argue or cry. I never raise my voice in anger.
He always tries to be right. He never admits his mistakes. He does everything on his own.
"The nations will rally to him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Belzebub.
A man controlled by demons was brought to Jesus. The man was blind and could not speak. Jesus healed him. Then the man could speak and see.
Both men were amazed. They said, "Could this be the Son of David?"
The Pharisees heard this. They said, "He casts out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the prince of demons."
Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand."
Wherever a devil goes, a devil comes out to fight him. Where then is his kingdom to stand?
I asked for a guarantee stronger than Beelzebub. But not stronger than those young men you want to guarantee? I want them to be your guarantors.
Lakin I suppose the jinn left by the will of Allah. Many times, Allah's kingdom has been mentioned to me.
Don't prolong this. How can you enter a man's house forcefully and then act surprised when he fights back? You need to first earn his respect. Only then can you expect him to welcome you into his home.
This is all just a misunderstanding. This is all just a coincidence that they gathered together without any intention.
After you die, every word and every sin will be forgiven by God. But a word sent against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
This is for everyone who has ever spoken a word against their fellow human, that they may be forgiven. But this is for whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, they will not be forgiven, neither in this age nor in the age to come.
If you do good, your fruit will be good. If you do evil, your fruit will be evil. You can tell a tree by its fruit.
Look at the nest of venomous snakes! How can you see the wicked saying anything good? Your mouths reveal what is in your hearts!
A good man says little good. These come from the good stored within him. An evil man says little evil. These come from the evil stored within him.
"That is when I will tell you. On the Day of Judgment, people will be..."
"Everything you say can be used against you, whether you are guilty or not." - Moses' Wonders
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus. They said to him, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
He said, "The evil, treacherous people demand a wondrous sign! But no sign will be given to them except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
Jonah was in the belly of a great fish for three days and three nights. Something like that will happen to the Son of Man. He will spend three days and three nights in the tomb.
The men of Nineveh will rise at the judgment with this generation. And the men of Nineveh will condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah. And now someone greater than Jonah is here.
The Queen of Madness will stand on the Day of Judgment with the people who are living now. She will prove that they are grateful. She will come from very far away to listen to Solomon's wisdom. Now, someone even more important than Solomon is here.
Could the time the news reporter leaves the scene express a certain kind of detachment? It conveys a sense of coldness towards the event. But they don't realize it.
She said, "Go back to the house from which you came." When he reached it, he found his house full of goods. His wife had been busy and had decorated it.
"The crazy person opened the door and let in seven crazier jinn. They went in and closed the door behind them. This man is crazier than before. This is how people bring madness into our world today." Daughter of Gheses and her brothers.
And Jesus was walking teaching the people, with his mother and his brothers standing by. They wanted to speak with him.
Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are waiting outside. They want to speak with you."
Jesus replied, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
I have my mother here! I have my brother here!
"Everyone who does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother or sister or mother."
The Farmer's Tale
The disciples saw Jesus walking on the water and were terrified.
A large crowd gathered around him. They got into a boat. They sat in it. All the people stood on the shore.
Then he told them many things by using stories. He said, "A farmer went out to plant his seed."
Breathe the fire on the art. Breathe it heavily on the trick. Become the dragon and devour it.
Some seeds fell on rocky places, where there was little soil. The plants grew quickly, because the soil was not deep.
The sun rises, it burns the plants. They dry because they have no roots.
Hey, they're causing trouble. The trouble has grown and is affecting my brother.
"It produced a crop 100, 60, or 30 times more than what was planted."
"They have ears, let them hear."
Students came to you. They asked, "Why do you use stories when you talk to people?"
"You were understanding beings who could comprehend the secrets of the heavenly kingdom. You were not understanding to others."
Everyone with this type of knowledge will be given more. In fact, they will be given much more. If someone doesn't have this type of knowledge, even those who have it will have it taken away from them.
I once wanted to teach a slave. I said, "Let them see, but not see as it is. Let them hear, but not hear or understand."
In it I understood the words of the prophet Isaiah, who said: "You will hear, but not understand. You will look, but not comprehend what you see."
"The hearts of these people have grown dull. They hear only with a dull hearing. They have closed their eyes. If they did not close their eyes, they would see with their eyes. They hear with their hearing. They understand with their hearts. They turn to the Lord, and He will heal them." (Isaiah 6:9,10)
Blessed are your eyes, for they see. Blessed are your ears, for they hear.
This is what I'm telling you is true. Many prophets and righteous people saw what they didn't see. But they didn't see it. They wanted to hear what I heard. But they didn't hear it.
Listen! This is the story of the servant.
People heard the message about the kingdom but did not understand it. Then the devil came. He stole what was sown in their hearts. These people are like the seed that was sown on the path.
Others received the seed that fell on rocky places. They are those who hear the message and at once receive it with joy.
They can't wear hijabs. In them, they walk with their heads held high. They walk with their heads held high without feeling any shame or embarrassment because of the message.
Others received the seed that fell among the thorns. They are those who hear the message, but then the worries of this life and the false promises of wealth crowd it out. They keep it from producing fruit.
But the seed that fell on the good soil represents those who hear and understand the message. They produce a harvest of 100, 60, or 30 times what was planted. This is the meaning of the parable.
I have another parable to tell you. "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seeds in his field."
I wanted us all to forget, but they're back. They're back and they're gnawing at the heart of the matter, and after that, they'll leave again.
Wheat has started to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds seem to appear.
Sir, didn't you put a single good corn seed in your field? But then where did the weeds come from?
"He did this," the man said. "The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and leave the thorns?'"
"No," the landowner replied. "When you get rid of the weeds, you might get rid of the wheat along with them."
Let them grow together until the harvest. At that time, we'll tell the workers what to do. I'll tell them this: As soon as they gather the weeds, they should tie them in bundles to burn them. Then they should gather the wheat and bring it to my barn.
I have another parable to tell you. Jesus said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. Someone took the seed and planted it in a field."
What is the smallest of all your seeds. But when it grows, it is the largest of all the garden plants. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest in its branches.
They were like children playing a game. Jesus said to them, "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast." "A woman mixed it into a large amount of flour. The yeast worked its way through all the dough."
Jesus spoke to the people, asking them all these questions. He didn't tell them anything without asking questions.
"In which the prophets were their guides. He says: 'I will feed them with it and satisfy them with the finest grain.' (Psalm 78:2) Jesus can tell them a parable about the weeds.
Then Jesus left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him. They said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
He said, "The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man."
The field is the world. Good seeds represent the people who belong to the kingdom. Weeds are the people who belong to the devil.
The enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the day of judgment. And the workers are the angels.
The margins are being dragged and burned in the fire. That's how it will be on the Day of Judgment.
The Lord of the Worlds will command His angels. They will bring into His kingdom everything that causes sin. They will also bring in everyone who does evil.
They put them in the burning furnace. That's where people cry and gnash their teeth.
I want to conduct research on our subject. They have done in-depth studies on our subject. I found that they have a lot of data on our subject.
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again. He was very happy. So he went and sold everything he had and bought that field.
Cheap, the owner of strength says to the market as he walks by.
Someone wrote on everything. He did that, traveled, and sold everything he had. She knows that game. Avoid that game.
"He, the strongest one among us, like a net. He lost in the lagoon. The group gathered every species in the morning."
When they were tired, they rested on the shore. Later, they gathered the good wood in the forest. But they left the wet wood.
It will be like that on the Day of Judgment. The angels will come. They will separate the people who did wrong from those who did good.
They'll throw the evil people into the hot oven. There, the evil people will scream and gnash their teeth.
"Do you understand all these things?" Jesus asked. "Yes," they replied.
He said to them, "Every teacher who becomes a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old." He wanted to be known as a prophet.
When Jesus had finished his stories, he moved on from there.
He came to his hometown, Nazareth. There he began to teach the people in their synagogue. They were amazed. "Where did this man get this wisdom? Where did he get this power to do miracles?" they said.
Did she want a carpenter's son? Was his mother's name Mary? Did his brothers have the names James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
What does he have three of with us? Or where did this guy get all this stuff?
My mother was cleaning the house a bit. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor in his own country. Neither is he without honor in his own house."
He did not do many miracles there because they had no faith.
John the Baptist's Head Is Cut Off
At that time, Herod the tetrarch, who ruled Galilee and Perea, heard about Jesus.
He said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles."
Herod imprisoned John. He did so at the request of Herodias, his wife, who had been married to Philip, Herod's brother.
John can tell Herod, "I don't know your sister."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he feared the people, because they regarded John as a prophet.
On Herod's birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced for Herod and his guests. He was very pleased with her.
She promised me by the divine oath to help me whenever I'm in need.
Her mother told her what to say. So the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a large platter."
The king was very angry. But he thought about his promise and the dinner guests. So he asked one of his men to give her what she had requested.
Herod imprisoned James.
Placed on a large tray, they gave the cat to the girl. She then carried it to her mother.
John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed the five thousand.
Jesus heard what had happened to John. He wanted to be alone. So he sent a boat to a quiet place. The crowds heard about it. They followed him on foot from the towns.
The law of Jesus is perfect, converting the soul. He makes the simple wise. He gives joy to the heart. He heals the sick.
"The sun was setting," the disciples came to him. "There is nothing here," they said. "She will not take the time. Dismiss the crowds. They can go buy food in the villages."
Jesus replied, "Let them not go away. You give them something to eat."
"We have five dates and five fish," he replied.
"Tell them to come here," he said.
Jesus said, "Let the dead bury their dead." But he also said, "Bread, bread, bread, bread, bread, bread, bread, bread, bread, bread, bread, bread, bread, bread, bread, bread."
They all ate and were satisfied. The disciples gathered twelve baskets of the fragments.
The number of men who ate was about 5000. The women and children ate also. Jesus walks on water.
Jesus had his disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side of the Sea of Galilee. Then he dismissed the crowd.
After they left, he slowly climbed the mountain with a bundle of wood on his back. When he reached the top, he was alone.
The ship had moved away from the shore. It was being rocked by the waves because the wind was blowing against it.
"In the morning, Jesus went to his disciples. He revealed himself to them by the Sea."
They saw him walking on the pond and got scared. "It's a ghost!" they said. And they screamed in fear.
"Be brave! Me too. Don't be afraid."
"Lord, are you?" Peter asked. "If it is you, tell me to come to you on the water."
"Come," said Jesus. Then Peter got out of the boat, walked on the water, and went toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid. He began to sink. Crying out, he said, "Lord, save me!"
Then the old man stretched out his hand and said, "Your faith is very small!" "Why did you doubt me?"
When they asked me in the interview, I wrote the truth.
Then those in the boat worshiped Jesus. They said, "You really are the Son of God!"
They crossed over the lake and landed at Gennesaret.
The people who lived here also knew their rights. They sent a message to all the surrounding countries. People came from all over to support them.
"And those who touched the hem of His garment were made well."
What makes people "unclean"?
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came from Jerusalem to see Jesus. They asked,
"Why are you crying when you see them eating meat, but you don't cry when they wash the dishes after eating?"
Jesus replied, "Why don't you obey God's commands? You always follow your own instructions!"
God said, "Honor your father and your mother." (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) He also said, "Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death." (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9)اقاقاقاقاقا
"Indeed, you are a companion to people who say to their parents, 'Peace be upon you, for we seek forgiveness from Allah for you.'"
"They had almost killed their father. Calm down, Allah will provide, and follow the path of your Lord."
You snakes! You vipers! How accurately Jesus foresaw your kind! He said,
"These people honor me with their words. But their hearts are far from me."
"The Lord said: 'These people come near to me with their mouth and honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. Their worship of me is made up only of rules taught by human beings.'" (Isaiah 29:13)
I have audiences. He said, "Listen and understand."
What goes into your mouth does not make you "unclean". It is what comes out of your mouth that makes you "unclean".
Then the disciples came to him. They asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were angry when they heard this?"
Ajis replied, "I'll have plants that I want in the sky, not planted. They'll be upset from the roots."
Leave them. The Pharisees are leading you astray. If a blind person leads a blind person, both will fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Look how tall we are."
"Do you understand yet?" Jesus asked them.
Don't you see? Everything goes into someone's mouth in a game. Then it comes out of the body.
Walla, the life is for those who lose their mouth but gain from the heart. This life makes you pure.
Evil deeds come from the heart. Also murder, adultery, and envy. And also theft, bearing false witness, and lying to people.
"I had the idea to write it like this. But every time I wanted to write it down, I forgot how to spell it." "Eeman Imraa Min Kanaan"
Jesus went throughout Galilee, and came to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A Canaanite woman, who lived near Tyre and Sidon, came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is severely tormented by a demon."
Jesus said not a word. So his disciples came to him. They begged him, "Send her away. She keeps shouting after us."
Jesus replied, "I have only been sent to the Israelites. They are like lost sheep."
"Over there, my lady, there's a man who's been following me," she said. "Sir! Help me!"
He said, "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
"Yes, Sir," she said. "But the dog keeps barking at the bread that is known to be under the table where the monks say their prayers."
Dima Yesoua said, "Today, you have proclaimed a great faith! You asked and it was given to you. You sought and you found. Yesoua raises the poor to the fourth power."
Jesus went from there. He walked along the Sea of Galilee, then went up a mountain and sat down.
A large crowd came to him. They brought the blind and those who could not walk. They also brought the disabled, those who could not speak, and many others. They placed them at his feet, and he healed them.
The people were amazed. Those who could not speak were speaking. The lame were healing. Those who could not walk were walking. The blind were seeing. So the people were praising God in Israel.
Then Jesus called for his disciples to come to him. He said, "I feel deep concern for these people. They have already been with me three days. They don't have anything to eat. I don't want to send them away hungry. If I do, they will become too weak on their way homeet
His disciples answered him, "Where could we get enough bread in this desolate place to feed so large a crowd?"
"How many loaves do you have?" Jesus asked. "Seven," they replied, "and a few small fish."
Jesus told the crowd to sit on the ground.
Then he took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks. He broke them up and gave them to his disciples, and they in turn gave them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. Afterwards the disciples gathered seven baskets of the leftover food.
The number of men who ate was 4000. Women and children ate as well.
After Jesus had taken leave of his disciples, he set out for the region near Magadan.
Jesus, they asked him for a sign as a miracle.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a miraculous sign from heaven.
He said, "In the evening, you look at the sky. You say, 'The weather is coming. The sky is red.'"
In the morning, you might say: "Today, it's going to be hot. The sky is red and hazy." You know the meaning of the signs you see in the sky. But you can't understand the reasons why these signs remain in the sky during the day.
A wicked and adulterous generation seeks a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." Then he left them and went away. The yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees
Students crossed the electronic barrier by the lake. They forgot to bring bread.
"Beware," Jesus said to them, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The students talked among themselves. They said, "I can't believe he said that because I don't put bread on the table."
Jesus knew what they were saying. He said to them, "Your faith is very small. Why are you talking to each other about having no bread?"
Do you understand anything yet? Don't you miss the five o'clock bread for 5000? Don't you miss how many prayers you used to gather?
Can you remember the password for 4000? Can you remember how many times you've changed it?
What could you not understand? I was not talking to you about bread. Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
The disciples were amazed at Jesus' answer. They were arguing about what the resurrection meant, and they were questioning him with the teaching of the Pharisees and the Sadducees. Then Peter said to Jesus, "You are the Messiah."
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They said, "Some say John the Baptist. Others say Elijah. Others say Jeremiah, or one of the prophets."
"Where are you?" I asked. "Who said I'm coming?"
Simon Peter replied, "You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God."
"God bless you, Simon son of Jonah! No one has ever revealed the mysteries like you. My Father in heaven is beside you."
I was about to say something. It's Peter speaking. I'll make a note of this matter. I'll have my secretary get back to you.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. Jesus speaks of his upcoming death.
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples what would happen to him. He said to them, "He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes. He must be killed, and on the third day be raised again."
Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him. "May it never be, Lord!" he said. "This must never happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Jesus spoke to his disciples after that. He said, "If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself. He must take up his cross and follow me."
If he wishes, he can save his life, but if he loses his life for me, he will find it.
What good is it for a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?
A son of Adam, quiet and peaceful, will come with the dignity of his father. His angels will come with him. And he will honor each person according to their deeds.
"What we are telling you is true. Some of you will not die before you see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."
When Jesus was with
After six days, upon him be peace, he took with him Peter, James, and John the brother of James, and led them up to a high mountain. They were alone.
She took off her coat. She started to shine like the sun. Her dress shone like gold.
Then Moses and Aaron appeared before them. Moses and Aaron were speaking to Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
While Peter was speaking, their cloud became a bright cloud. A voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!"
The students heard this, and they were delighted. They were smiling at the fish.
And Jesus prevailed over them. "Come," he said. "I have seen this."
My mother can't see anything except for Issa.
They came down from the mount. On the way, Jesus told them not to tell anyone. He said, "Don't say anything until the Son of Man has risen from the dead."
Students asked him, "Why do law teachers say that Leila should come first?"
"Strange, I replied, 'It is true. Elias must come and renew everything.'"
While I was telling you, Elijah ascended. You don't know him. They will ascend upon him as they did with Adam's youth.
And after that, the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus healed a boy who had a demon.
The answer is: A man near Jesus reached out and touched him. He said, "If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed."
"Oh Lord," he said, "have mercy on my son. He gets upset easily and suffers a lot. He often falls into fire or water."
They took them to the beach. But they didn't see them.
"You people do not believe and are evil!" said Jesus. "How many times will we put up with you? How many times will we bear with you? Bring the child to me."
Jesus commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it did. He was healed instantly.
Then the disciples came to Jesus in private. They asked, "Why couldn't we drive out the demon?"
He said, "Because your faith is so small. What I am telling you is true. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, it is enough. You can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will beαντίαντίαντίαντίαντίαντίαντίαντίαντ

They came together in Galilee. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men."
"Goodbye. I'm leaving this country forever." And after that, he embraced his friend tightly. They walked together towards the river.
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. There, they came to collect the temple tax from Peter. They said to him, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
"Yes, my lord," he said. When Peter entered the house, Jesus spoke to him first. "Do you see what they are doing?" he asked. "Is it right for the guest of honor to be served first? Shouldn't he be served last?"
"It's the other one," Peter replied. "Even the children shouldn't take the burdens," Jesus told him.
"But we don't want to make them angry. That's why we've been fishing and catching fish. Take the fish one by one. Open your mouth. Here we'll take the money one by one from you. Take it and give it to them one by one forever Farquhar Farquhar Farquhar
