This is sad! This is our chance, we won't let it go.
And it's not even blocking. It's my turn to take, and you really have the right to take before me.
khoa khoa khoa khoa khoa khoa khoa khoa khoa
Saleh, don't leave me, may God forgive me!
In the name of God, would a brother advise his brother based on what you say?
khoa khoa khoa khoa
And I found a great feast.
The holiday has no friend.
Say, "This is for yourself."
This governor won't come before us again.
Don't be a stranger, Saleh!
Give us a chance.
No, no, no, no, you can't mold me, it's impossible, impossible, I won't do that.
The problem is that he's afraid.
What are you afraid of?
We had a service project! Everyone participated!
Obey the law!
Even those who don't participate benefit from it.
And he is the head of a large project.
This means he is ruling.
International Beaches of the Third Millennium, more specifically, the first phase of the infrastructure.
He is so stupid.
Here we don't steal!
If he refuses to take action.
Who gave you the right?
You have no right to exploit her.
The match is going to be on TV.
Who was going to leave him at the project site? Wasn't it me?
No, if that's the case, you want your rights.
Who gives you money to fill your car four and five times!
Leave it for me.
Don't lie and be racist.
Take advantage
See my uncle's shirt.
And today, as you say, they call him a millionaire.
A third of the project,
The other third is a commission.
The one who sings in a folk band.
They say there's a national celebration.
And I bought a hundred jellyfish.
You know what they did.
Add the zero.
What's the use, auntie?
No, God guides him if He wills.
Let's leave with him.
I spent last night at Bish's place, trying to convince him.
This is an opportunity.
Hold on to goodness.
And God willing, good will prevail.
This is common.
Keep it between us.
Don't talk to anyone about it.
Do we need to be worried?
"But they are my friends."
Neck pain.
The man started to change his mind.
I spoke to him today.
Two hours in the morning.
He began to be convinced.
We want to meet him soon.
And we need to convince him.
He's cutting our benefits.
They really brought him around to change his mind at the meeting.
My brother Ali, my brother Osman.
I don't know.
Today is my first day of work.
Rely on me.
It's not going to work!
Certainly. But are you sure I'll get something?
I want to ask you.
If you're hungry and walking down the street
Are you going to eat or not?
I am a person who eats a lot.
Don't worry.
The plate is large.
We're still working on the first article from the meeting.
If you weren't kind.
If you have any concerns
What do you want to know the truth about?
It's legitimate.
Oh God, guide you, Saleh.
He understood that you are president for the first time in your life.
It's very easy.
We're making our luck.
In the project budget?!
What do you think?
No one suspects what we're doing.
Why don't we publish our share as a separate article!
This amount is stolen.
By delegation from the project officials.
It's impossible.
No, no, no, Ya! Saleh!
You know how these things happen.
But it seems you have some concerns.
Their right
First and foremost,
Everything is in our hands.
I told you he's a liar.
What's wrong with you?
He says the new car is for his friend, and you believe him.
He said "That's it!"
We say that Hyar's house is his friend's.
In a very special place, too!
Except for a very rich man.
I didn't hear this from people.
He told me he bought the land and registered it in his name.
Raja said.
He has the money now.
Now he's going to lie.
What are we, his family?
Is this all?
Are we leaving anything?
We're gonna get something!
Pedro eats alone, until he's full.
Don't move your head!
"You have no siblings"
Sit down and everything will be fine.
I talked with him all night.
I told him that anything they're your family.
And in the end, she agreed.
This is how it should be.
And I hope you don't receive it more than once.
This is the beach of the third millennium.
More specifically, infrastructure.
They will move on to a different stage.
And it will continue with him.
May God reward you kindly.
It's sweet that you pressured him into agreeing.
You're no different from them.
But, you don't have any.
I wish I had told him.
We want a percentage.
They all take a percentage.
He said, "Even after I had given up on him."
They seem to want to come to the meeting to determine the project budget.
They have to track it, it's their money.
We placed it and we're certain of it.
Send it as soon as possible for approval.
Take your time.
Who is this? Do you know him?
He is my wife's brother and a partner of mine.
Why do you want to know?
Responsible for doors, windows, and everything related to implementation.
Sweet, sweet
How much do you want to get this over with?
How much will you take?
Here we take the money.
We give ourselves a week to think.
And determine the amount of money we will receive.
They have people waiting and they want a little bit.
Abdulaziz is right.
If someone decided to take half a million.
This is a week when everyone will think carefully.
And specify the amount they want.
Next week, they will decide what they want to do.
You don't have
Then, is it up to you?
Ignore him.
Oh my friend, what's this? What does he have?
He doesn't understand why he's here.
Hello! Who invited you to this project?
Government project
Saleh, your brother's name is Sultan!
Our neighbor the doctor is a traveler.
Sometimes it leads us when the machine is not alive.
Write.
Abdullah's document.
No, no, there are three other people.
I'm tired of working.
I told him, "Enough, man. Let's just present the budget and be done with it."
No, no, that will require an amount of money.
How much do I need to get for him?
What a scoundrel, does he have children!
Smooth he has, why it should be twenty-five thousand and four hundred.
And four hundred thousand.
They force him in.
How much will you give them!
This is too much.
My mother had, like us all, her own way of doing things.
Yes, Mom.
Ah, no, no, no, this is the last one! Oh, my son!
Oh my! Son, she wants to go to Thailand for treatment.
Wait, wait, what do I have?
Why not?
From the first stage, especially the infrastructure.
Don't use it.
Provide three thousand.
Buy me some watches from Thailand with blinking stars.
Did you add this?
Yes, Mom.
What's my mom's name that I added, I just want to know the name.
My love, Mama
Make the table bigger.
Yes, but the budget must be specific, it can't be open-ended like that.
Tomorrow is the last meeting and everyone must decide the amount of money they want.
I have this thing.
One million is enough!
More than this, my love.
Friends, friends, wait, it's noisy, give us a chance.
The committee is currently in a meeting to approve the project's budget, not discussing financial matters now, anyway.
I want more
We told you not to worry, we are in the ministry's courtyard.
Oh God, we scream, don't try to look at us.
If someone comes and asks what's wrong with you here.
We tell him that the electricity will shock him.
Don't make noise in the ministry's courtyard.
Take it. Take it.
Sew it! You'll hear me!
"I was with them, what's the budget now?"
Regardless of my brother.
"Completely, 50 million %pw"
Fifty million just for the first step.
Is that a secret?
What's up, Saleh?
Share some emotion, man!
Good luck, bon appétit.
Hurry up, let's work, all the beneficiaries are waiting for us.
No problem.. The most important thing is that we don't want any discussions, they should just prepare the budget and finish.
And start implementing tomorrow.
And served a very large segment of the community.
God bless you, this is the third millennium international beaches project.
First stage
More specifically, the infrastructure.
For the coming generations
Certainly, and on behalf of our team, we would like to greet you and congratulate you on the launch of the project that will take place tomorrow, as I understand.
What took us a million and a half years
One and a half years
Once again, from the name of the Future Achievements program,
This project
And the next generation
May God preserve the blessing of oil for us.
Second stage, third stage, and tenth stage.
Agent
Welcome
Why did they gather us here? When will the cars come to pick us up?
What? Even they should take us?
Praise be to God, I have grown up and become eager.
Let's sit down, the sun is hot.
Soft, a kind girl
I'm not going to tell her.
Everything but the sea.
Why did they demote you?
Eman told me that your sister Manira is here.
My father's land in the desert.
I saw him lying to her and giving her wrong information.
Is that the earth?
I saw a farm in the desert and thought it was your father.
Wow, why are you asking about these affairs?
Do you have brothers?
Whoever works hard and invests in land, real estate, businesses, and strives.
Free from headaches.
I am disappointed in you, Iman.
And also, my sister.
How don't you have any information?
They have to reach me.
They are your brothers.
And there is no good in falsehood.
Because of the money.
Now we appoint her and transfer her to the hospital.
I don't know how many years she spent fighting with her brothers in court.
Nineteen years, or more.
No, but
The brothers of Umm Salama are thieves.
Poverty, she was telling me yesterday that
She wants to build a mosque before she dies.
No one knows.
I don't want to say that your sisters are like her, God willing, they are not like her.
How many years has it been since your father passed away?
Why are you asking now?
And she saw the farm.
What else do you want?
Why is the check paid every three months?
Calm down, let's first understand the story.
She doesn't have it.
If it were someone else, his sisters wouldn't have taken a single penny.
I have it.
Where from?
"Lama Zain isn't my money."
Look at this, Manira
See him.
Becomes fifty thousand
Because I gathered courage and asked about my father's land, which is in the desert.
He emphasized that my share is more than that.
Everyone lives in a small village.
Their birth in the best schools,
I won't say, O Manira!
I won't stop fighting for my right.
I'm sorry.
Let's invest your money in the company! No, thanks.
Everyone fights with each other.
People have no mercy anymore.
Don't think your brothers will be better than mine.
Look at me.
Twenty years
He used to go to court a lot.
And in the end
I didn't get anything out of it.
Why do they do that?
That's why I'm telling you, my dear, be kind to them.
Work with them politely.
And you distance yourself from them.
And why do courts take a long time?
Four million forty thousand.
If we reached a million like other countries.
Doubt it, my beauty, it won't happen.
Look at my brothers.
I swear, I don't want all this.
I won't say it, sweetie.
I only say that God is sufficient for us, and He is the best Helper.
God is sufficient for us, and He is the best Disposer of affairs for us.
Didn't you have a court hearing last week?
Hello, my dear!
The governor asked us to write a memo.
We go through this a lot.
My love, they will buy millions, you will just watch them.
And more and more, you'll get tired of the courts.
And that is your right.
That's why I'm telling you, if I were in your place.
I'll be satisfied with what they give me.
Because the woman
We don't have anything against you.
Men are asking for you!
Has some
Some questions about her class.
Hello, how are you and what are you doing?
You don't have it.
I'll carry you and show you.
He will find his way.
I signed a surrender document.
Two hundred and fifty-one is enough, add her husband who is alive.
Take it or leave it.
Why are these students here now?
But he is greedy.
It's not really my right.
My father's gift, and he wants to decide how much he'll take, take it or leave it.
What is mine and what is his.
This is the promise of Allah.
When they torture my father in his grave.
I didn't expect that from them.
Because of the money.
Opened thirty years ago.
I don't want to do it, Nasser!
Land, buildings, and real estate are easy to identify.
I don't know how much they take.
The companies lied.
You have the right to ask about everything.
And I will not let them enter alone.
When will you return them?
You don't have
And it's not just that, I have the right to know everything.
**T
Your sister gave him power of attorney.
He has permission to access everything in the company.
"Saghyr, Sa'ad"
He wants to shout at us.
"Sakar, enough."
Nasser's brother
Sorry, Haniyah.
Beware, my lord.
Go, now.
Excuse me, go.
What excuse does he have to attack us?
Now, if he went and sued us,
And say, "You struck him."
Come on, let him do as he pleases!
She has an official document.
Official! We can't stop him.
He has the legal right to search everything.
If he looks at the budget and accounts
We give her forty thousand every three months.
If he revises the budget,
Twelve times eight
1. Divide it into three. 2. Split it into three parts. 3. Divide it into three.
Thirty-two
Do you know how much?
How much does this cost?
Excluding land and projects
I'm free to do whatever I want.
We're not afraid of anything, so don't be afraid.
If he doesn't agree, that's what we have. If he agrees, welcome.
Take them and sweeten them.
They give their sisters enough money to live on.
She is married.
She has a husband to rely on.
Do you see the money you want to make?
This shouldn't have happened in the first place.
What's up, Bass?
However he likes
Even my desk
Brother Rashid, this should have happened sooner.
How do you prefer, sir?
File by file
When she knew her true inheritance
Villas and lands that I didn't know about.
They were seven.
They got sixteen.
I didn't warn you.
Poor thing, she was shocked.
What is justice?
Don't leave them alone.
It's necessary, my son, that I don't hear about the courts.
More than you're attached
The little that the judge did.
For a while
And then he'll say his usual phrase,
For the seventh, the fourth, two thousand, I don't know how many.
Very happy my son.
You mustn't get out of bed at all, mother!
May God heal you.
No, no, I want you to come.
Nasser and my sister Manar
After we slammed the door shut and kicked him out of the company
He sent me one of my schoolmates.
Hayahma Abdullah
And today
What are these?
In other words, can he influence them?
Good luck, God willing.
Noooooooo
Don't be a burden on the judiciary.
Courts only produce reports.
Delays and arguments, useless lawyers.
Years pass by.
And time passes by.
And we won't take a single real.
May God have mercy on the mother of Salmin.
She told me a day before she died.
Don't go to the courts.
He said that our courts
She died without inheriting anything.
She died, and the judge hasn't solved her case yet.
If we were like other countries,
Hello Abdullah
Abdullah's brother
Years have passed.
Have a good day, Saad.
Grew up in grace.
The most important thing
Brothers
My brother Rashid
You are my brother.
Don't let financial problems
Do you have anything else to talk about besides my sister?
I apologize.
When I ask him to stop talking.
It's correct.
They don't want me to claim my share of my father's inheritance.
My mother told me yesterday that my brother Saad's wife...
Her father is a messenger at the ministry.
It's all my father's money.
We were talking a lot.
We'll try one last time.
I sent them your friend Abdullah.
No one respected him, and they even expelled him.
Let's see what Abd al-Rahman's hobby will do.
He is a very kind man.
He said he wanted Nasser.
Don't worry.
Fear them by law.
I saw that Umm Salama forgot about the poor in her speech about the courts.
Perhaps the sisters of Uncle Salim do not fear the courts.
Not for all my brothers.
Dinner is afraid of rumors.
Hopefully they are too embarrassed to go to court.
We'll see about this after Sheikh Abdulrahman comes to them.
God bless you.
Is this a Friday sermon?
Whether you have it or not, get out.
What are you saying, my son?
Speaker of the truth
Go, please go.
I'm going to court tomorrow morning.
And why do I have to postpone it until the day after tomorrow?
I decide, not you.
He won't come if you wait until tomorrow.
Hello, brother Rashid
This is a promise.
I've told you before.
Scare them with the law.
Now he's asking for time before we go to court.
Because they know you're serious about it, my dear.
It's very important that we visit your sister Manira.
What is this?
"If you ask me what this is, this is..."
God bless you all.
It's a small model of the courthouse.
God bless you.
And all of you
May God bless you.
She didn't say.
I told you not to go today.
And postpone it until after tomorrow.
To obtain this sample from the courthouse building
Ready to show you the way.
Enter through that door, Hady.
You don't have to enter through the door.
Put it all here.
Mobile and anything metallic so it doesn't make a beep beep beep beep beep sound.
Register the case, you will go to the eighth floor, one two three four five six seven eight, take the elevator.
Wander around the offices.
See the judge, if you really need a particular judge, for example.
And so, these are they.
Do you want to sue us?
We're here to show her the way.
We'll see when you get your rights.
Either you take the six thousand.
As he said.
Goodbye
We're eating dinner at my sister's house today.
Oh, has the ministry approved his project?
Even though he told me he was very happy, I didn't believe him.
He said, "If you agree on the project, that's an invitation to dinner at my place."
Praise be to God, luck comes in unexpected ways.
Are you happy, Abu Waleed?
His luck.
My sister told me he was very happy and didn't wait yesterday.
Praise be to God! Manal!
He is handy at work, but some good men helped him.
In my handwriting, tell your father.
I hope you liked the food.
Thank you, Waleed.
Thank you, Abu Waleed. May God bless you.
May God fill your life with wealth.
This is a phrase in Arabic, and it translates to "This is a delicious food, O Mother of Waled."
Hire an accountant and a secretary to organize your business.
They told me, "It's just a Roman thing," as they fixed everything for you.
Where am I from, uncle?
Oh my darling, my son.
I want a BlackBerry.
We want a bigger house.
See, he sees better now.
Dad, didn't we agree that you would talk after lunch?
And now, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome the owner of the project, my father, Abu Waleed.
Sorry
Congratulations, my son.
You deserve
But, honestly, you're not an expert in business and trade.
Dude, there's a backstory to this project.
I'll tell you how!
Thank God, %pw
Last year
How many times has the Japanese team played against our national team?
I was at Souk Waqif.
I don't have information about that right now.
This is a catalog of multi-purpose hall manufacturers. Our ministry is looking for them and offering them.
Any contractor can build it for you.
I didn't understand.
Any contractor
The Japanese are wonderful.
I'm not going to open it, the computer says computer computer computer computer.
Cinema, if you want.
See, if you want a kitchen, press kitchen.
When I presented the catalog to the ministry committee
And when is your contract with the factory?
I paid a little.
Deposit
The most important thing is your contract with the factory.
I signed it, praise be to God.
And they promised me time until I place the first order.
What are you waiting for?
They really agree on it.
We're still hoping for Abu Fahd's signature.
What did the maid say?
Bo Fahd said he's not coming.
Would you like to drink tea?
Waleed told me, what a coincidence!
No one knows about Abu Fahd, he might come or he might not.
One day came.
He doesn't have time.
%pw come on, → %pw get in,
You are the manager here.
Do you want to kill me?
No, he has to sign.
Look at all these files on my desk, they all need Mr. Fahd's signature.
What? What do I want to do?
Oh, my eye!
Oh boy! It's only ten minutes until two o'clock.
Time to go home.
He didn't feel that Abu Fahd would come.
Oh my eye, he's coming tomorrow.
I told you that you've known the manager for a long time and he's your friend.
What's wrong with you?
He is a useless manager.
The manager is just shuffling papers, not doing anything.
Praise be to God, they resemble wisdom as they are like that.
They don't do anything useful.
Are they doing something? Something else!
They won't move a chair without Bou Fahd's permission.
The manager didn't ask about you yesterday.
People's concerns are hanging.
It's clear you're planning to stay with them today as well.
Anna is in trouble.
I face problems every day.
The factory gave me limited time.
No, God willing.
And if they ask about you
I need you, Fahid's daughter.
Look at these files.
They all want Bo Fahd's signature.
I think he'll come today.
Moment, my dear
Or you walk.
I'll let you in when he comes.
If anything happens, I'll call you. Don't let them get too excited.
I don't have a little bit.
Sorry to scare you, this is my wife.
Come on, you've been agreeing to my dates for two months!
I just need him to sign, what's this?
My son, this is the time for enrollment; our daughter will miss the university scholarship if her papers are not processed.
My problem with the factory, the deadline, the deadline.
Wait a moment.
Every piece of paper you have will be positioned.
He's making coffee. You can come see him when he's done.
Please, ask them all to be quiet.
What's up, boss?
Goodbye
Wait, wait, people!
Wait, where do you want to go, wait.
I know what happened first.
What happened?
He has an urgent trip.
It's a special outing.
I'm tired of this.
Our interests have stopped, my brother.
We visit Fahad every day.
What we do, we wait for Abu Fahd.
Peace be upon you, Papa
What is bothering me?
Everything is going to be destroyed.
The factory is in Japan.
Tell him time's up.
And your aunt is a different story.
Congratulations to him, he borrowed the money.
Problems are arising from everywhere.
Mom, I'm too busy for Dad.
Don't leave him alone.
Who will you call?
Yes, who is it?
This is Waleed
Let's talk about the factory and your sister's money from the wife.
Wait, Abu Fahd.
Dad, how much longer do I have to wait?
They always say,
And we were reading to Abu Fahd.
Oh father, you've done all you can!
Both of my friends are going to university next week.
Don't you think?
Phone, my love.
Don't worry, just give me time.
Okay, let's talk?
Wait, Abu Fahd.
I don't want to tell you, sister.
You're very patient with us.
Oh, my eye!
Bualloid is in a pitiful state.
And he's shaking like a leaf without him.
Because the time period is about to end.
Five days left.
He lost all his money.
God is sufficient for us.
How nice! He's testing me, testing me, testing me.
I wish I could improve. I'm feeling awful.
I have an unusual fever.
The top part is joking.
The second part is completely stable.
Fifty percent of my body is not alive because of the fever.
Discount
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
My sister is helping.
She's going to wait until we pay her back.
May God bless her.
We're not hiring your sister right now.
My boss too, please help me.
It seems he heard.
God knows but doesn't do it.
I'm upset with him and with Abu Fahd.
He's dragging me, that's a problem.
Tomorrow is the last day.
My money is going to leave.
What are we doing?
In the brain, in the brain
How will you be able to speak?
Send me, let's find out who it is.
Sidi Bou Said
I want to call you because I want to feel you.
Be on standby.
Goodbye
You've always been a understanding person.
I was a role model.
Don't think I don't know you leave work every day.
See if I can deduct from your salary.
What's your phone number?
Instead of putting you down
I'll put you on the stock committee.
Are you going to the market with them today?
Don't leave work during working hours.
If you want
Then do not blame me.
Today is his last chance.
What he sees is blurred. He's checking his phone, waiting for a call from them.
I'll make him afraid to act.
"Oh! This is Waleed."
He is sad.
Save him, O sad one.
Hey! Father of Walid
Yes, hello
Come on, man, I'm talking to you, not the phone.
Take and finish your paper.
Don't worry.
Many thanks
It seems that Bu Fahd is here.
What do you want from me?
He is a very important officer.
Where are you going?
We go to Uzbekistan.
Brother, where is Uzbekistan?
The third room on your left
You can't sneeze.
Wait, Fahd.
Don't sit.
Don't look at me.
Do you want some?
House by house
Proceed
Oh people, this man is crazy!
Do you know how much I spent?
For all these years, you
Take some, and bring some more.
My knees are weakening now.
Review and refer between all these ministries.
But we were young.
I carried the sacks of rice on my back just as I carry children, sacks of potatoes.
After that, God left and learned to ride a bike.
Especially the bike that taught me to let go and buy.
Olive green
They mock me when I seek this knowledge, alas.
Sweetening our days, raising our children.
The director has arrived.
We should celebrate after you finish.
Thank God, thank God
So, you're going to quit your job?
I bear witness that you are truly a good citizen.
Now I want to rest, brother. Goodbye.
We are all for you.
Don't you want to extend for another year?
Enough, enough
May God bless you with good.
You extended my contract for four years.
I've been wanting to retire for a long time.
All my kids have jobs now.
Finally, yesterday was his first day at work.
And now, oh Abu Abdul Aziz!
I want to rest.
And you're just a delivery guy.
With the traitors
Do you believe that?
I haven't eaten in four years.
A little sweet.
See her now.
We'll get you anything you want.
Transfer me to the Human Resources department.
Did you see all the papers?
Soft, since yesterday.
Your ID card will take more time.
I'm not tired.
"Masha'Allah, it is done."
Stay in touch.
My son Khalid
From this moment on,
I hope you rested, %pw awful.
Great, great
I'm living at work and I can't get out.
Can you come to the General Human Resources Department?
I have some paper there.
I want you to take them to the Civil Service Department.
Thank you, thank you, Papa.
Where are you going?
I have to go to the bank.
And Hud called to all [people].
What now?
I have to go to the bank.
Send it with someone else.
What's keeping you, sister? I can't get out of work.
Oh no, goodbye.
He can't keep a secret, can he?
He said he couldn't get out of work.
What will you do?
I'll go to the bank tomorrow morning.
It's normal for him to go to work every day.
He confirmed that he will feel bored.
This is better for him.
Will you let him rest?
Happy that he's coming home early.
He called and said Khalid...
They sent him to finish his work.
Fear God.
Everyone must rely on themselves.
Mom, I regret the argument.
Mom, he's talking nonsense.
I don't regret selling the house, my daughter!
But I've been feeling down since he quit his job and left.
And Khalid gave him tasks to do.
He is sleeping in his room.
Those Lost at Sea (Singing)
Good morning, Papa.
Hello, girl.
Daddy, oh Daddy
But they called me and told me the manager was angry.
Give me your papers.
Smooth or Happy
I told you to let the boys fend for themselves. Why don't you listen to me?
As if you hadn't resigned.
O me!
I sold you and the buyer is in front of me.
We are eating it today.
Goodbye
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.
Sorry, my dear father.
Oh, my eye!
Yes, the ones inside at the market.
Get out of here quickly.
I've given up, my daughter, I've given up.
Oh God, in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
God is pleased.
It's nice that you've reached home.
Sit, sit, sit
I told you to stay at home.
Encourage your children to learn to trust themselves.
What are you saying, Umm Saeed?
They're stuck in a tough time, I need to help them.
Enough, enough, relax.
And I'll get you a glass of water.
And the blanket they will cover him with.
How sad, he's not very tired.
And taxis
He is stupid.
He went to the market branch.
And they want her card.
I didn't take her car.
And he gave him the papers.
Thank God, I'm doing better.
Rely on yourselves.
I told you.
I want you to relax.
Take a chair and sit with us.
Lunch is very delicious.
I went from ministry to ministry.
I run from ministry to ministry.
Finish my children's paperwork.
You had to take care of them when they were young, and you have to take care of them now, you're their filler.
My children are in good positions at work.
They're always busy, what should I do?
Every day we have meetings, either with the manager, or with the director, or with the minister.
They have good jobs, when they need them they have to be there, it's 100% work.
Why do you leave and continue working, then others stop you and force you to sit all the time, what do you want?
Coming right now. God bless you.
Coming right now, bye bye
Sorry now, hey! hey! Bou Shahin
They told me and said to me that it's ready.
If you sold your father tomorrow to complete your work,
If that's the case, I'll be late for work.
Fear God.
Impossible, especially tomorrow, I can't.
Because he loves you.
Even if he is angry and tired of your behavior towards him
You don't even have respect for his age.
He was tired, came, and slept in his room for two days.
For strolling in the streets under the scorching sun
He gives you the paper.
And he went straight to finish it.
The committee will start from early morning until after noon.
Did you hear that, Mama?
Do you want me to take a building with a delay in its construction?
When you don't have appointments and a meeting tomorrow
Your paper needs to be ready by tomorrow.
Some of them at night.
He has a committee tomorrow, he has to be there.
No, my lord.
Hiding his tears
In fact, I didn't lie to my father.
The committee changed its mind.
And they said, "We'll be there before the end of the week."
Why are you telling him?
Oh father, don't go!
I'm leaving because the committee didn't come.
Instead of sitting in the cafeteria with these girls
She scolded him.
Enough, enough
I will apologize.
I will do it.
Thank you.
Hey! Dad, Khalud is...
He is wrong.
And it's also dirty.
What's his opinion when he knew the committee isn't coming?
We are blessed by you.
And from now on, Dad.
We'll do our personal work ourselves.
He stayed at home.
Your kiss on your head.
Welcome, welcome, my son.
Good morning
Oh! Oh, my dear father
The whole world's worth is mine.
What they want you to do is leave you sad.
It doesn't make me sad.
As I told you,
After I finish this paper.
I really wanted to do it myself.
He asked me to come quickly.
Andy is having a meeting.
With His Excellency, the Minister
My honor
Meet important people.
I feel happy when they say my children are with this or with him.
Don't worry and go to your work, (singing)
Where is Wayne?
I need my father.
The cover is with me, I'll send it with the tea boy.
He passed by my place, I'll send him with the tea boy.
Dear Father
What do you mean by that?
What might have been forgotten
Because the committee will meet in an hour.
No, God bless you.
My son has a meeting with the minister today.
Give me the paper.
Her daily routine is work, home, work.
He hasn't moved.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you, welcome.
Yes, no, I didn't say anything.
He takes a week off and goes to the sea.
They said he enjoys himself on the farm.
He will come tomorrow.
He enjoys himself there.
And you guess what?
They say he's a good cook.
His belongings
Goodbye
No cub?
"It's up to you, sir."
May God guide you.
No, no, my son, I'm fine.
Your papers are scattered.
He is in agriculture.
And she
Her friend's newspapers.
Thirsty, I want water.
Give me water, water.
Oh, my son.
No, no, take it out, I don't want it.
Don't write that.
I want to leave them puzzled.
Thank you, sister.
You're right.
No, no, no, I didn't tell him.
You're right, sister.
Sorry, sister.
She calls him دوري and كاس.
spoke about the game official
He started speaking in a stutter.
They nicknamed him "the corruption stopper."
People started to provoke him.
And prepare some lines for him to say on television and radio.
And also
He was locked up in prison.
"That's not safe, my sister."
These days, everyone is only concerned with themselves.
Why does he seek out trouble?
Now, I won't do that, ever.
Let him speak, and say his famous quote, "Stop corruption."
Thank God he's okay.
We are blessed by your presence.
Goodbye
I'm late for work, Mama.
Listen, my son.
I was apologizing to you.
Last night
Now I just want to remind you.
Yes, Mom.
I will never make a call.
Radio or TV, nor will I call Q-tell.
Your sister Ayesha has
And your fiancée has been crying all day.
To keep you healthy, God bless you.
As I said.
I'm not willing to swallow nonsense.
Because I don't want you to leave.
Your uncle, Abu Munira
I came here two days after you entered prison.
And he said that it was over.
is cancelled
After many attempts, I finally rested.
But next time he'll take you to court to get his daughter back.
Yes, Mom.
I promised you.
You won't see any good if you call another TV or radio show.
I told you I'm not leaving.
Sorry, I have to go now.
I'll tell you, but lower your voice.
The carpenters told me that
He doesn't want you to work here.
Because you can talk about management.
And start bringing problems upon us.
How will this manager justify this decision?
He has a million excuses to say.
Where am I going!
Are you serious, resign?
What did I tell you before?
Hello, yes.
Goodbye
I told you.
I see, for the greater good.
We need to reduce the number of messengers in the ministry.
You're right, but
We need to say "stop corruption" at least once.
Shuweikh
Stop corruption.
Truth, life
You're still here!
We have work to do.
This is a catastrophe.
Someone solved this problem.
What did I tell you?
I told you they want to let him go.
And Manira is standing here and heard me say that.
What did Dad do?
I heard them say it myself.
You don't have anything, take me to talk to your father alone.
I'll make him talk to your father.
He went to prison, we blamed him for a small mistake and forgave him.
We can't forgive him after he left the job.
That means we're family.
"You hear this."
Loiter
Hopefully, everything will go well.
May God guide you to the straight path.
I came to drink coffee.
I know you
I feel tired.
Your uncle gave you two weeks.
I swear he's going to drag you to court to divorce his daughter.
The law wants to arrest him.
When do you want to get into problems?
But be careful.
If it weren't for you, they would have asked her.
Ignore him.
What is a day for anti-corruption?
What's up, man? Is it?
These days aren't peaceful.
We have heard it, at least once, haven't we?
No, everything is fine.
Are you police officers?
No, no, Mama, you didn't understand.
I asked him to speak on a radio program about the problem my cousin faced.
He was hesitant.
We felt he was confused because we talked to him in public.
And I started telling my brother that we should go to his house and talk to him alone.
Did you see that he agrees?
He was hesitant.
And go.
Enough, enough, enough
I'll be annoyed and I'll never let you in, got it?
Are you Saleh Saad?
No, God bless you, no more, I've quit this habit, thank God.
I have a strong sense of responsibility.
And an ideal employee.
No travel.
When I tried
Peace be upon you
"I came to you, it wasn't necessary."
I wanted to call the secretary to tell you to come.
Shahin, what does he have?
I didn't throw it at him.
Who doesn't know Saleh, the fighter against corruption, here in Qatar?
Is it true, what is known as "stop corruption"?
Stop corruption.
Yes, the job.
No jobs, you know?
You haven't used it yet.
Am I crazy to rent it here?
I walked everywhere, Manira.
One of them told me that there was a vacancy five minutes before I came, but they rented it out, so they gave it to someone else.
My sister Aisha was divorced yesterday.
I'm responsible for them now.
I have a big responsibility now.
I don't want to do it.
He's putting pressure on the minister.
But I felt that was what I had to do.
I'm afraid this parent will take my place.
Enough, enough.
Who said I'll be quiet?
But I want that to be done in a way that it doesn't affect me.
I'm thinking of a way to get rid of him.
Let's leave him.
But how?
I know him.
Is it him talking nonsense on the radio?
I'll visit your house.
Just give him the information.
You are loyal, patriotic, and devoted.
A very enthusiastic citizen.
Thank you.
I saw where I finished.
I consider your voice the voice of truth.
This is my friend, he doesn't speak much.
Amanullah Saleh
It is said, it's been a long time since we heard him say "Stop corruption."
Pedri sees you.
"Have a normal day, Saleh"
I'm living in the tent.
Future, future, future
You are your own kind.
Your kind words
Your words on the radio are better.
We've heard enough corruption once.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
Stop corruption.
This is the original, sir, this is.
Continue, don't stop.
I couldn't
And then I left.
Despite the fact that I want you to keep solving people's issues and problems.
Listen, Saleh.
I'll give you one problem.
You are the voice of truth.
I want to talk to you alone.
He is a very important person.
You can't say no to him, you have to say yes.
Yes, correct.
This is your chance.
Opportunities don't come twice.
No, come on.
Don't you understand?
Please wait for my brother.
From these problems and issues
Dear Minister
The ministry requested eight thousand tubes in its latest project.
Carrier of a quantity of one hundred and twenty cm of poison = cm of pressure
This employee played.
To approve the pipes that
Because he wants to get the balance.
Stop corruption.
Thank you, thank you very much, my brother Saleh. Enough of the corruption.
No, God bless you.
This call is a special request.
I hope you hear it.
The final stop for corruption... Stop corruption.
You know.
Necessity forced him to do it.
This is the last one.
Sultan left.
The minister immediately fired him.
He provided accurate information.
Now, Fahad will do whatever he wants.
I'll do all the tasks.
Yes, sir.
Certainly, Minister.
Goodbye
Stop corruption.
It was the last time, without a doubt, that I'll never do it again.
And here's my presentation, sorry, I was joking.
They got what they love.
Listen to me.
Because he's afraid of the day.
He was taken to task for his bad actions.
For revision and exposing corruption.
They're afraid of you.
My beauty, my sister Aisha.
You're kind.
Your uncle, Abu Munira
I assure you that I will find a job.
People who think their flaws are stupid are foolish.
They are jealous, they hate our country.
Do we have a problem?
We have no family consolation.
I haven't heard that word before.
In our government departments,
We don't have any bribes.
We don't know.
Client
What is the duty of a stranger more than a native? No, never.
We produce everything locally.
The problem of which family you belong to, we don't have those problems at all.
If a manager or supervisor is angry with you,
We are the best people.
Our country is the best country.
Don't make it a problem.
And thank you.
What did you say on the radio yesterday?
Mom, I want candy.
I don't have any candy, not even after dinner.
So, no candy.
Why is your shirt torn?
Mom, Adoul and I were playing.
I knew you were playing.
Did you tear your shirt?
God is enough for you, O Justice.
Learn from the experiences of others.
I told you it was expensive, we don't have anything to buy it, and you said it doesn't matter, it will be compensated for our son.
Look what they did.
The shirt is unusable now.
"You can't lose what you never had, there's no one to blame."
Where is the sugar, Mama?
See how he wanted to remove it, it's clear he wanted to.
My poverty is innate.
He was happy to wear this shirt for the first time.
He will know.
Where is Adam?
In the garden
Why, what happened?
Something between me and him.
Don't tear it.
I feel shy.
Don't quarrel with a child.
A child shouldn't be allowed to do what they want.
The weather is changeable.
Don't ask me to hold my tongue.
Are you a hobbyist?
We lift them.
Act respectfully.
Don't argue with him.
Why do you fight like children?
Stay away from me, Mama.
Don't interfere.
Tell him to raise his children well.
He is a child.
You don't distinguish between a child and an adult, because you're crazy.
You know.
What's your mistake?
Let's go upstairs.
They don't deserve it.
Wasting our time responding to them.
What should not be done
Where people loved each other.
Wow, he's really coming, God bless, bye bye
No, sir, some of the papers need your signature. The minister wants to see them.
Alright, I'll call the minister today, don't worry.
I saw the disaster, the great disaster.
No one has seen her before, oh! Aisha
This is not child's play.
You're right.
Shredded clothes
Look look
This is not wearable.
Look at Adoul's pants, he leaves one leg, the other will be exposed.
This is clearly torn by hand.
It appears to be cut using a power saw.
God is sufficient for us.
I'll tell you.
Who wants candy? Come on.
I know violin.
If you know, walk around the villa.
I love you not just because you know how to ride a bike.
Because there's something else.
Speaking the truth is right.
No, I don't want candy.
Smooth, I want two.
I'll give you four pieces.
Who undressed me in the locker room?
How did you sell your father?
He has a big pair of scissors that can cut even a car.
Hide under the bed, took all the sweets.
Not like that.
No one else can do something like that.
Why do we have to be silent?
The most important thing
We insist on what we say.
I bleach clothes, Waleed is a child.
Which computer?
What's he saying?
These scratches aren't possible for a child to make.
Why would you believe me?
Go find your friends.
Give me a second.
You're always like that.
Wrestling every day, my son.
The past two days
I ask God for forgiveness and good health.
May God guide you.
Who's going to wield the big scissors?
Go and find friends.
Hail Mary, Mother.
He went and brought those big scissors.
Respect yourself, Sultan, or shut up.
Learn and solve this, come here boy.
How can I start?
Each one of you
You are fathers.
A child is born.
"عندما يتولد طفل،" (When a
You are my sisters.
Listen to me and make peace among yourselves.
Yeah, tell me, what are you going to do now?
What, you stripped their clothes?
It's nothing compared to the disaster he caused. I lost all the documents and information; he destroyed everything.
He didn't say it.
He speaks in a very formal Arabic dialect, like the one used in museums.
Ignore him.
"That's why he doesn't get tired and leave."
He's crazy, my brother and I know him well.
They took hands.
He is full of hatred and envy.
He's angry because I broke the computer.
Oh, Fahad
Sulan, they beat him, beat, beating
Fear God, girls.
Beat him, beat him, [silence] Beware, [silence]
Take your cousins and play with them outside.
May God guide you.
May God be with you.
Big men
What did you leave for the kids?
Yes, Mom.
My brother Abdurrahman
Perhaps the last time, my son.
I know he's the oldest brother, wow! Girls.
He knows how to talk to people.
And arguments
Don't be annoyed with me.
You are responsible.
Play a role
May God guide you.
Even you, you've become like them, my son!
Mommy, they hit my kids, it's a conspiracy against us, and you're saying, %pw, stay away from us.
With roles
My life is a sacrifice for my children.
What's new, kids?
It was the children who were throwing them.
He doesn't believe it.
I saw them.
We said to him, "They are the children, they know nothing."
He said from his window.
He saw the children throwing stones and, because he was far away, he thought they were adults.
I don't pay attention.
You can go.
Perhaps you are tired or dizzy.
Do you know who they are?
And they tell me they're throwing stones.
It seems
Oh, my beloved!
I told you to go home and rest, they wrote a promise, what more do you want?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
What is this, God, God?
God is enough for her against the enemy.
Mother, mother
All this is because of you.
Because of you
Your men, but they behave like children, their minds are very sick.
Take me to the hospital, I'm lost, he's going to die.
No, and this isn't the first time I've seen her.
And I noticed that he doesn't take his eyes off you.
I'm not enrolled in the business class.
He has been attending the class with us since last week.
Clearly, he wants to know you a lot.
Don't think that he wants you that way, don't think that you're too reserved.
No, my sister.
I don't want him to think I'm easy.
I ran after him.
Let her go normally.
Now he's paging you, he wants to get to know you very much.
I really love him too.
But, I don't think this is the right time.
One hundred percent
She's looking at you and *
You're waiting for her to say, "Excuse me, may I introduce myself?"
Take the initiative.
You're right.
But I apologize for the right opportunity.
Good fortune
What are you waiting for? You're enrolled in the same class as her.
What did the teacher say?
Let her come, Miss.
Oh my God, what's her name?
We've been exchanging glances for three months.
but I don't know that.
You are old.
So you must go and say, "Sorry."
See if it's possible for me to get to know you.
That's not how it works.
I have to wait for the right opportunity.
A quiet and tactful girl.
I don't know what you're playing at.
We finished filming all the episodes yesterday.
Yes, indeed.
You never forget us.
As long as I'm free.
Sell the villa behind our villa to Walid.
Other, good, we have a life together.
What's the use now?
You're late.
I didn't know.
I saw it empty a few days ago, who bought it?
And they bought it through a housing loan from the Development Bank.
May God bless their homes.
Hello, my son, good morning.
Uncle, start the engine.
Thank you, my son. May God bless you.
Hello Nora, come out, the car is running now, come, I'll pick you up.
Peace be upon you
What do you want?
Neighbours talking to each other, what do they wish?
Make you keep it.
Your neighbors are weird, you're not normal.
A kind man parked his car behind me, I can't get it out.
So, if you don't mind, give me your car keys.
Even the car keys
I'll sail with you in this weather from Titanic.
See you.
Goodbye
Now you know a lot about me.
Just know that you're valued.
Walid Rashid Abdullah
When people hear your father's name, many will think you are the son of the famous actor.
The name itself, God willing.
Specifically, my father is Rashid Abdullah, the actor.
Rashid Abdulla, the well-known project, your father?
You're eating cookies! Why didn't you eat dinner with them?
Tell me
How do you know that the famous actor Rashid Abdullah is our neighbor?
Yes, of course.
My friend at university, you know him, told me that.
He loves acting, just watch his works.
He finally said, "We're living next to a famous and important person in the community."
My heart, oh joy, is growing.
He's a sweet guy, he has a sense of humor.
His son is a kind man, he helped me, God bless him.
It was said that
You know.
Do you know why I want to take a picture with him?
Mom, talk to my cousin, Aboud.
I read an interview with him in the newspaper.
He said they're going to film a series about diving.
You're lucky, he brought you a sheep, a gift of a new villa.
He indicated that they were good neighbours.
Hello Saleh, any news?
Good luck, we have a lot of names.
They told me, Abu Saad, may God bless you, that my name is on the (list).
This will be done according to the need and experience of the employees.
We have no information.
"Light, we don't have to transfer you."
Sorry, I can't do anything for you.
Thank you.
First, we'll move and settle down, and then when God blesses us with wealth, we'll buy furniture.
You did the right thing.
Hey! Bouali
Do you think I'm strange?
What do you want?
I'm ready to help you.
Neighbors for mutual aid (proverb)
Just now I heard and saw.
Sweet, God willing, you are an expert in furniture.
For her, these are with you.
Don't be afraid, my sister.
I don't want to choose the sofa, tell me.
My love, your father asked for a loan. If we agree, we'll change all the furniture.
And I want to do it again.
Feel free to ask me anything.
We are a family now.
Why isn't your sister studying with your help?
But I want her to be self-reliant.
I wish I were talking to her!
Do you want me to lie and say she was my friend?
Oh my son, oh Ali.
I don't have anything against that.
As long as she loves me, and I love her, I'll solve the problem.
You're imagining.
With the plan of departure, I present to you your aunt.
Leave it to me.
How do you want?
They'll make you refuse.
Let's see.
Delivered
Delivered
Who is Ali?
Oh brother, the car broke down!
All the time, he bothers me.
My daughter, God bless her, has a lecture.
And this car breaks down all the time.
Your daughter is our daughter.
This is not her.
Don't trouble yourself, my brother Rashid.
God bless you.
The car is parked in the yard, and the driver is sitting idle.
It appears that the development bank bought you a house and a car.
What is our car?
Jariah Rashid Abdullah
I see relationships evolving.
We'll discuss some matters that will benefit all of us and be advantageous for both sides.
This is a huge development.
Let's go.
Mom, this is disappointing.
I didn't agree.
Nora said she was like my daughter, and her driver would take her to university every day.
Did you tell her that your father's car would be under maintenance for a week?
My promise, no.
She said the driver picks her up every morning.
And God is a witness, O Mother of Ali.
They are good people.
No, no, noooo
There is no initiative nor power except from God.
Oh no, oh no, what am I going to do now?
I don't want to do it, I have responsibilities.
Who runs the university's website?
Hey! Hey Ali, since you've been introduced to me by Mr. Rashid Abdullah
I can't refuse your request.
Abu Saad, Abu Saad
Sorry, Mr. Saad.
Bouali, we love you so much.
Thank you, may God bless you, O Abu Saad.
They love you, God willing.
This is nice.
People, Mr. Rashid is busy, let him go.
Sorry, sorry, Mr. Rashid, if we wasted your time.
No problem.
Congratulations, you have upcoming prayers.
We are your friends and brothers, our family when we need something.
I'll get it for you wherever you want.
What job, what do I have, why are you attracting me?
He makes you feel important to Manal.
They agreed, Mama, they agreed.
Manal talked to her mother about me.
Why don't you believe?
Umm Waleed
Girls, do you have a party?
I didn't understand.
Why is Waleed getting married again soon, apple of my eye?
She called me, poor thing.
She's taking some accessories.
It's not working! Work!
Is this my mother?
She's also coming in a fancy car.
Insha'Allah, Insha'Allah
God willing, I won't be able to see you.
This is very sweet of a mother.
On top of all that, your car gift.
With the driver.
If I don't go with you, they won't know that this well-dressed man is the queen's husband.
Oh God!
Are you going to go in those clothes?
What is this! No, no, no, no, no, you're not going to be afraid.
I'll change my appearance, you won't recognize me.
They will think I am a sheikh.
Bring him coffee, so he may live long.
Oh, Abu Ali, I really don't know you. I wanted to think you were someone important, but no, Abu Ali, you're not Abu Ali.
What do you think?
I have a different walk too.
May God bless you, the people we will introduce to Ali should be kind to him.
Are they guests of honor?
I've prepared everything from the clothes to the car.
I'll make sure to find him with you.
In the last serial you worked on
There was an event, as I remember, a wedding.
I was wearing a black shiny vest.
And I also want you to teach me how to wear the bisht.
Because, God bless you, I have never worn a Bisht in my life.
God willing, you will appear wonderful.
Like that, so when you enter the guest room
This is not correct.
My brother Rashid
Do you have Coquelux?
Good evening
"He who is always with me and Khadoud."
"For that"
You are my dear.
I'm a family now.
And we do not want our daughter Nour to distance herself from us.
Nora is his daughter.
He told me he sees her at university, and he won't find anyone better than her.
We are blessed by this.
I'll tell her father, and hopefully he'll be pleased with us.
Why did they reject him, why additionally?
Because his father is an actor.
Asked his father to come.
Quickly, tell him Rashid wants to see you.
Where are you!
I'm crying from sadness.
Because his father is an actor.
You're not ashamed.
I am an actor.
But, I work honestly.
I work on the stage for a few hours and my role is over.
After the play was over.
You play roles.
I work
I recommend a useful sight.
But you
I dress up to play roles.
On stage
But you
I wore it in the guest rooms.
The rich and wealthy woman's role
Who is the actor?
Who is the real actor?
Don't be sad, Waleed.
Lift your head up.
What a shame.
I saw the scene.
I heard her shouting at him, you didn't turn your head, you didn't turn your head, my love, you broke my heart.
And he held on tightly.
Like a horse
It's Thursday, man, Thursday.
It's Thursday.
His wife is crazy.
She's jealous of other women.
"That's just how it goes."
Why doesn't he look at girls, and why don't girls look at him?
See how his wife is making him crazy.
Straighten up, don't slouch.
I will give him lessons in the office tomorrow.
James, please, please, show them the city center.
James, show me the city center.
Maish says it's a central city.
Keep Thursday
I love him, but I don't know what he wants.
How sad.
When will you change!
If only you heard what they say about you.
They naturally say more than that.
Why do you do that?
She's jealous of the women around me.
Why are you so jealous?
I sometimes sit in front of the TV.
Hello, hello
I swear by God.
No, no, everything is good.
Hello, peace be upon you, my sister.
See her.
I spoke to her just now, right in front of you, I heard a man's voice.
Sometimes you shine my clothes on the street.
Look at yourself and divorce her.
I'm having trouble divorcing her.
Carry, carry, carry, carry, carry
Why don't you come closer to me, you're over there.
Out of your mind!
What is malicious?
Who are you talking to?
You're wasting your time with these useless people.
Especially him, the wonderful one, he's the one I hate more than his friends.
One whose existence is also an olive, and whose feelings are also fine like small plants.
That mistake is shameless.
Do you want to torment me in my grave?
Let me talk to her.
Tell me, what do you have?
Who's that talking!
I don't want anyone here.
Hello, welcome! How are you?
My friend Khamees has gone crazy.
Then, he turned his back to the wall and started talking to himself.
What's up?
James is a poor man.
He always sees his mother and imagines talking to her.
God is sufficient for His wife.
They say you're with Kams.
Hello is currently busy, he's on an international call, a very long-distance call, even the call is cutting out.
What does the message say?
Oh God, help you, Thursday.
Why are you awake!
I can't wait, I can't sleep.
About tomorrow's meeting
With the women's delegation at the ministry
Possible if
Oh God, guide you, O Thursday.
These names will be selected by His Highness's office, the Minister's office.
But, come on.
Why are you afraid of her?
If you were talking to Salem, why are you hiding then!
Say the truthful.
Why are you hiding behind the water tank?
Just like that.
"I saw the last call number, read it, it's with you."
The last number!
I dialed the last number after I deleted the woman's number I was talking to.
Tell me, what's her name!
I told you, I told you, I told you.
I told her that I was talking to Salem.
My friend at work, Salam
You didn't believe me.
What should I wear?
Are you going on a diving trip?
"He swore, her brother, that he didn't let me change my clothes."
Who do you want me to call!
Call my wife.
Call my wife.
Say to her, "O my brother, give me the password, a pen, an invitation to the club, and I will give you the number."
Help each other.
You men are always like that.
You're a liar just like him, I should've known better.
If you intervene again, these are the minister's office.
"Shakhbatli" does not
And she threatened me that she would complain about me to the minister's office.
She is very brave.
She's planning to ruin my career.
My mistake, I listened to you and called her.
Listen, Thursday.
Complaint to the Minister's Office
You'll come with me and tell the whole truth, leave me out of this.
This is not about me.
You're afraid.
My sisters and brothers
Good morning, everyone.
I see that you were present at the meeting.
Where's the rest?
Fled
Wayne Thursday?
Here it is.
Turn off your mobile phone.
Okay, but don't be late for school.
The meeting is just one hour.
This is my telephone.
The war has begun.
Oh God, from that day, he stays with you.
Where are you going?
He can't go.
And from that day on, his condition won't change.
Jealous, jealous of the women around him.
This is not jealousy.
He was sitting alone in the night prayer of the livelihood.
My mother says it.
Mother! Mother is dead.
That's why you called me, so we could find a solution.
I asked you to switch to the section with girls.
Is this a military decision?
See the signature, it's very clear at the bottom.
Brother, sorry, I'm heading to the Ministry of Social Affairs.
Welfare Division! Are you sure they transferred you there?
When it's weird
Thank you, may God bless you.
Are you, madam, excuse me, Mr. Fifth?
The Minister's office called and informed us.
Have you moved to your new apartment?
Who's with you in the office?
Article, Saleem, Jasim
Hey! Thursday, the minister decided to transfer you yesterday.
And you edited the new section today.
I've told you about my problem with my family.
Minister Haseeb wants to transfer you.
I have to go to the minister's office.
He started his annual vacation today.
Hibernation after a month and a half
This is a big problem.
If you want my opinion,
The minister will tell you the same thing.
Work there until we find you another place. This time they transferred you because many people told him about your problem with your wife.
Look at the truth.
And we work!
Don't talk unless your wife calls you.
What do you know, maybe they'll be pleased with you, appeal to their mercy.
I asked them to put the abayas in the car, I had put them in the trunk for you.
How much?
You put ten because five were in the office, meaning two each.
It seems he's afraid of his wife a lot.
Imagine that he gave us all the names he's called.
They call me Abdelkader.
What's his name?
Wow, he's expensive and beautiful, that's why he's afraid that another woman will love him.
In the name of God, what do you want?
Who called me?
Who is Abdelkader sitting next to Hassan over there behind Khalil?
Here are the abayas, each one can choose the one she likes.
Look at this.
How much is it?
"What's happening? What's happening?"
I apologize.
Where is the Al-Awna school?
Supposedly there should be five employees.
What's your name?
I am a camel.
I am crazy, my wife drives me crazy.
I am crazy.
You played the project in front of us.
And he met with them.
What did they say?
They said.
Manor, this tea
I don't want to
Do you want me to go back to the kitchen and ruin my clothes?
He has gone now, he has gone to prepare tea for us.
Walk, walk, crazy.
Gold, listen to what the men say.
Don't forget that we are the Scorpion Tribe (Bani Al-Akrab).
He went, and bring me tea without sugar, he went, he went, he went, he went, he went.
The bank said the project was normal.
I called him many times, his phone is busy.
Hey, they've been waiting for you for a while.
My sisters as usual.
One of them took a month off, she traveled three months ago and hasn't shown up.
God is generous, goodbye.
And all changes are in our favor.
Pour us
Ah, but if only Park's daughter...
It will take up space for at least two or three villas.
Why is the park a place for complicated people to go?
Men don't care about women's opinions.
Keep it for yourself.
Put the tea and go.
No one congratulated me.
Little by little
Your sister, you know I love football.
Your uncle and your brothers will kill you if they find out you're playing hooky from school.
What are you doing, killing yourself?
See, I told you.
I suggest you forget about him.
You're only hurting yourself.
No, no, no, no, I'm angry with you.
I was busy.
Pardon, you are our blessings.
Oh, Uncle Shahen is here.
Inshallah
Is today Thursday?
Large
He grew up.
I'm tired of looking for a woman for him, I couldn't find one.
I come from a family with deep roots.
You know.
Keep his problem with the wife with me.
Is this from the HR department?
Yes, God bless your age.
Leave it inside.
I have a few comments on his suggestions.
And His, may God bless your life.
Anything else?
No, may God bless your age.
"They take advantage of us, and I meet them when I have time."
What did you do with the employees you sent yesterday?
No cub?
"Maybe I'll call you later."
What happened?
Are you crazy?
We are your older sisters.
And we suffered from them.
She asked me what I play at school.
I told them you play table tennis.
It's good they didn't kill you.
Can't wait until the food is ready.
Do they know us?
What is our root?
Do you know what this means?
Now we've set your face.
Scorpion King
Small scorpion
Uncle, I hit her in the face.
Enough is enough.
Save it for next time.
You've got me confused! Weren't you interested in architecture?
Are you crazy?
Scorpio's daughter won't work in the streets with men.
Engineer and construction
See, it's embarrassing.
I'll break her head.
No, neither a sultan nor anything else.
Certainly, Chief Scorpion.
I had hit Fatoum.
Your brother squandered an opportunity.
This is a disgrace.
Nothing, dark, at least it hit you in the face.
Show my face.
When they make you go with them tomorrow morning.
What do you want?
Stay here.
Walk, in front of me.
How are you?
What do you say?
How are you?
I told you to keep quiet, don't open your mouth.
And write education instead.
"Or even nursing, we don't have a problem."
What else do you want?
You have two options.
Why do you have open minds?
Don't say I didn't warn you, you'll change once you're here.
Education
Often
We brought a copy of the app.
Gold, go away
O my son, master of scorpions.
The very same big scorpion exposed itself to you.
Thank you, Uncle, but when is the engagement?
Sadie Manira
What you're asking for is difficult.
I can't travel, Khalid.
I have personal circumstances.
Recommended by the minister.
Asir
Give it another thought.
Don't make a decision now, think about it until tomorrow.
What makes you work!
That's why they don't say anything.
I have a suggestion.
One of them asked if they could travel with you.
Girls don't have to travel.
This is meaningless.
What a disgrace!
Thank you for letting us go to work.
Tomorrow passed and tell them you're not going to travel.
"Be quiet, don't talk."
Listen and mute.
Fifth is the son of scorpions.
He is from our family.
He's actually sane and has no certificates.
No, but the scorpion.
What do you want to do, sister?
What can I do, Fatima!
I am weak and broken.
What do I want to do?
There's nothing I can do.
What can he do?
Engagement next Monday.
I'll call you when the sheikh arrives.
A laugh broke out among them.
Bought a new dress.
He went and bought a new dress, my son.
I love his laugh.
Brother, I'm sorry for you.
I don't want to hear a word.
Prepare tea, coffee, and cake for us.
Good luck, Aisha! You're a minister's friend now.
See, I'm afraid they're just rumors, wah! Let me stay.
Manira is a candidate to be a minister in a new ministry in the new ministerial structure.
Moneera wishes you all the best.
I hope it's not a rumor.
Will you go to work tomorrow?
And we all need to cooperate to help this country.
With everyone's efforts in their place, thank you.
I wish you all success.
Thank you, Your Highness
Thank you = Happiness and Excellence
Thank you.
Welcome, please come in.
Peace be upon you
Yes, with soap too, as much as you want.
He is the overall supervisor of the women's football league.
He asked him about Fatima's play.
Inshallah
President Fatima scored two goals like professional players.
Fatima is a talented pioneer, brothers.
Captain, I want to know your opinion about Fatima's play.
She is a good defender.
She is going to travel to China.
Boss, isn't China a bit far?
May God bless you.
Your sister is going to participate in an important game.
She was studying education, but I went today and printed a transfer for her.
She is going to study architecture.
There is no difference between a man and a woman.
Really? Go serve the coffee.
Where are you going?
I'm tired of waiting.
You idiot, are you stupid?
Gold, say hello to your mother and tell her you're out of school.
Gold, *
I am not stupid.
The coffee in the pot you have has gotten cold.
They don't listen all year, but when they find out you have a series, they call.
Hello, how are you, how are the kids!
What didn't I tell her?
I told her you'd be with us in the series.
Certainly, she will be the main protagonist.
Look, Ali, Shaula is going to play the role of Nouf.
We'll have something called makeup, it helps her look younger.
Maryam only appears in about twenty-six or seven episodes.
Shaola takes the profit.
He gives us endless lectures.
I will make him pay.
The most important thing is that he must not know that the production company is yours, you and Hamid.
I hope I'm not late.
And Rashid is here too.
The guide and actors are ready.
For the sake of time, people, I want to start the meeting.
Just to keep you informed of your opinion.
Hammud, do you want to say something?
Frankly, I think it's the best.
See when the maid committed suicide.
Let me know which part of me is getting the most attention.
It was after the maid committed suicide.
She didn't reply, she turned around and fainted until she died.
And they found him and his two sons wept over him, "This is passion."
And he kept kicking her until he reached the courtyard of the house.
This unrest
The police are coming, searching the house, and arresting the mother.
It's really a great series.
I wanted to make the serial here on this table.
Truly, it is a strain on the artistic conscience.
My community
It will be about extraordinary events.
Why impossible things?
Seventy murder cases.
And what's with the crying?
You're known for objecting to people.
No problem, Mr. Hamid. Let's be open-minded.
Take a majority vote.
Sidi Nasser does not ask for openness and use the majority as an excuse, they are not doing a critical assessment of artistic production.
You're involved in this because of your government job.
Goodbye
I heard the doorbell ring.
There was an Indian with a gang in his hand.
"Hello, are you the story's lady? I told him, yes."
I opened the bags.
It was a ring worth around seventy to eighty thousand.
I'm afraid the Indian man brought these things by mistake.
What's wrong?
Sameera
Hamd is his wife, the supervisor at the company.
"Here, take it, may God bless you."
Ah, this is for you.
The ring is very proud.
I never dreamed I'd be wearing a ring like this.
Oh God, bless you now, my love.
Yes, that's it, I call it the Series of Blessings.
Ali and Hamid own the production, but they are employees there, they can't present in their own names.
What else are we going to take besides this ring?
Don't share it with anyone, keep it between you and me.
Am I crazy to do that?
Praise your husband.
Who was invited the sorcerer?
Only five percent, that's a small amount.
It's good they agreed on four million for them.
When you see your husband, tell him he's getting 200,000 riyals. You don't have anything.
We assumed that the student role in the university was placed on a club.
It's a great role, she loves a man and runs away with him on a bicycle.
The series we will produce is called Conscience Fatigue.
Tell me about the role in the series.
I love to know.
Gulf women are always like that, it's a trend this year in coercion.
Ah, tell me my courage, what's my role?
You are also my sweetheart, your place is reserved.
Don't graduate from me.
Coming, coming, now.
I made all this breakfast, don't go and leave me.
Hada Omar, an honest writer and presenter
God protects us.
He didn't ask to see me today.
And tell him that it will be a weak and stupid series.
You're worth every penny.
Okay, so, what's the plan after this?
Oh my God, protect me. I'm afraid Rashid said something bad about the series.
Don't be afraid.
Leave it for me.
A person with a sick mind.
It's a social series.
I saw her just now on television.
No, God doesn't grant you a long life.
The series on TV now is called "Forcing a Little Flower."
But, I'll assume that the budget they're asking for is very high.
Requires a high budget
And don't forget that the producing institution is a local one.
We need to support her.
I don't want it.
Have you read the arts page?
They heard they were going to start filming the series "Conscience Fatigue."
And a large budget is allocated to it.
Las, he says Siri is weak.
And others said that the series consists of a school teaching vice.
They may stop shooting.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
Welcome. Hello, sit down.
Good morning
Good morning, hello.
Ana Elie Muneer, sahafy, and I have an appointment with Mr. Hamed, if it weren't for you.
Ah, okay, he sat for a while because he was in a meeting.
Mercury, had a chance to use a design from childhood.
And through our argument, we communicate with all the world's correspondents so they can communicate with us.
That's your job.
Mercury Media Production Company
And he discusses his problems in a way that she classifies as the best output in the history of the world.
Do you believe who wrote this?
He has no shame.
Do we have a journalist like that?
Do we have a journalist like that?
A lecturer can have a sense of ethics.
I work
Do you think they're here to *?
I met the minister, do you know what he told me?
What is very sad and his experiences are unusual.
The first episode will be tomorrow, we'll watch it with people.
What do you think, Mama?
There's nothing, Mama, it's just the first episode.
I've seen people talking to themselves, except in Gulf series.
One, did you see how she wanted to kill her children in your soap operas?
My son, art is a skill, it is not extraordinary to generalize it to people and society.
Mom, this might be true in fine arts, but drama is entirely different.
You give me a headache.
It seems they are imitating the Turks.
What you're evaluating now, at least watch the first five episodes.
This series is a failure.
We can't let our children see it.
No one is like my brother.
There are no better series to watch on TV.
Certainly, not anyone.
Your job
For every person, in every house.
He went and gathered people who understand these dimensions and hidden lines.
And show them to them.
It's not our fault.
Tell me, did he see?
The minister passed by with some guests.
I stood up to greet him.
We agreed to produce the series.
What kind of minister would love her?
Okay, listen to Nasser's opinion.
My colleagues wrote
I won't post anything except what says something good about the series.
No, no, don't ignore it.
Read the newspaper tomorrow and I'll be able to publish praise messages from me, and I'll say that the viewers sent them.
Inshallah
You will be happy.
For the year
Okay, I accept your challenge.
It's the best series in the history of Gulf drama.
They are all in agreement with them.
Okay, let's say they all have an agreement with them, the miser, they tell him, "All of them have an agreement with them."
I'll just read the subtitles.
I wish they would bring back the series "Conscience Fatigue."
Thank you, Minister of Arts, for this series.
I wish they would repeat it again.
When did the mini-car office first contact me?
We're coming to collect the last installment of the series.
They were right to call you the sorcerer.
That's not all.
The profits were rewarding, and we got our money.
And this serial is also a failure.
The writer himself told me that he regretted writing it.
I'm here to suggest a second season of the series.
The minister believed the press hoax you invented.
We succeeded in what we imagined.
What is the series eager for?
What does it mean that he couldn't agree to another part?
I assure you that the minister himself will request Part Two.
I can't.
Many thanks
For all people
Who worked on this series?
And congratulate them on their success.
They all deserve it.
Certainly, winning those awards at prestigious festivals
proves that
This is what you're thinking about.
You are a genius.
We must win the golden prize.
What's he saying?
He said, "The readers and the press betray me."
No, why wouldn't we want a second part?
As long as Arab and Gulf TV festivals are artistic whitewashes.
Money laundering!
I've heard about money laundering.
Cool.
Illegal money
Series are the same thing.
What we can do with "one two"
What do you mean?
No one is contracted with them, they need to be synchronized.
Write them.
Our products lead the world, bread of all kinds and shapes, flat, large, small, triangular, and diverse.
What did we agree on in the contract?
Two million dollars
Shalloo with Australian beef
He is the inventor of bread.
Has anyone seen your product?
That's it, but they told me these are bread, but I don't know what's in them.
Good with wire
They call it "Sosta"
Instead of cutting bread, make "samon" as you call it (sourdough bread).
The inventor tried to make it easy.
Baguette bread
The secret countries
Eat bread with butter.
Hello, it's a bit strange.
This soda is amazing; it's produced in a way that when you put it in your mouth, it melts.
It tastes different, strawberry, ketchup, coffee.
Do you know how much money I invested in this project?
Three million dollars, with patents.
Learn!
What's up, Abu Nasser?
Yes, sir, I am at your service.
We moved him today, sir.
Say to him, "O Sami"
I was with your son Nasser yesterday, playing soccer in his team.
I agreed to it.
To form his team of drivers and security personnel.
And it's also an incomplete team, we only have one goalkeeper, if he gets injured we'll be in trouble.
I'm aiming to have fans too.
You're not going to take seventeen players.
I didn't tell him this.
The important people in the company.
"Who we can't do without"
The bakery took the hospital.
Why are you bothering this man?
She said, "He can't, he's from a famous family, he can't run after a ball and laugh at himself."
He wants to do what he wants to do.
But don't take what you need.
What should I tell my mom? My team has a match and we're short four players.
"What's another excuse?"
OK, what's done is done.
Hamdi is not coming to work today, sir.
I went with him.
He said, "Okay, I'll wear it."
And they wanted me to stand in the goal area.
The match has started.
Then I didn't feel anything → Then I didn't feel anything
They told me that the ball hit me while I was busy.
Have you ever been a goalkeeper before?
I only took the job because Nasser asked me to.
There is no power or strength except from Allah.
We're tired of your love for football.
From now on, Nasser.
No ball.
You need to disband your team.
And all the bakers must return to their bakeries.
What do you think?
Father, that is
I don't want to hear anything.
Please, O father of Nasser.
Listen to what he's saying.
Okay, I want, but let me ask you a question.
Speak, what do you want to say?
Tomorrow, we'll play the last match in the tournament.
Don't bother him, Abu Nasser, please, I apologize to you.
Hey, guys!
Congratulations, congratulations
Sweet, sweet, sweet, congratulations.
Mr. Nasser, I'd like to speak to you for one minute, please.
Thank you, my team was on time today.
Oh, Sir Nasser, we must
You promised us a party.
Do you want me to call and book a hall at the hotel?
And contact the press and journalists to come there.
What is this, Rashid? We'll have it in our house.
When my father sees the players and their success, I hope he doesn't dismiss it.
They won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup, they won the cup.
I wish.
No, no, you saw him taking pictures with the players and he was with them talking to the press.
It appears that Sami, the sports page editor, is meeting him.
Picture
He left me close by.
Take a good picture.
He is happy.
Your talk about your sons' success as bakers made them...
High-spirited
And the effort
And loyalty to the baker.
Sorry, Nasser, the coach saw us playing 4-4-2.
Loyalty to the bakery and the coach's plan.
Thank you, Uncle Bo Nasser.
May God bless you.
Hello, goalkeeper.
"Al-Douri and the Cup" = "Journalists are eager to interview you."
Name, but don't mention these councils.
They sent their agent to take the interview.
Bring the cup, bring the cup, bring the cup, bring the cup.
You know, they're going to help the youth.
I await a bright future for them.
Wow, goodbye.
Inshallah, your phone will always ring, and your pictures will be in the newspapers; you are blessed tomorrow.
Do you know who was talking to me on the phone?
The prices of motors have been reduced, said Ala.
Oh, you've become famous now. Under every picture of you in the newspapers, they write: First in International Bakriyat.
Were you interested in soccer?
What are you saying?
My memories in school
The one who used to sit next to me loved football.
I said I wasn't close to football.
When the person next to me is playing ball, I am close to the ball.
Being close to sports means I am an athlete.
When we were the international cow countries, our international cow countries for football.
I heard him say last night that he's going to make it a sports club.
And today we meet the first athlete in the international bakriyat, Bo Nasser.
To increase football
Before the match, tell us about your expectations before you go to the stage.
The game is difficult today.
The team that controls the midfield will win today.
What, God willing, we will contact a professional players' agent to develop the International Bakeries team.
Hadi Saud, listen, we want commitment.
(Yes, he wants the previous deal for the players)
What was the use?
What do you think of these prices?
I promised you the international price.
By that logic, isn't the Gulf part of the world?
Of course not.
This is not something that makes you.
You have to take me along when you go shopping in the Gulf.
Open your fax line.
Two of them are defenders, one is a midfielder, and the other is a center player.
Look at these four players.
Three of you are needed.
$200,000 per player
Take them all in one bundle.
These are six million, I want to give them to you for five million and fifty thousand dollars.
Sweet, that's about African players, now, for the Brazilian player.
He's the player of the season, he alone is worth one million two thousand dollars.
They quoted this price, then they sent me a fax, I'll show it to you here. Wait, look, look, it came to me from a club in the UAE.
The decision is in your hands.
Thank you.
God willing, look at his knee.
Crowded?
Knee, knee
The knee is fine.
We want what we desire, I hope there's no crusade.
Oh, Nasser!
What is this muscle connected to?
You donkey! Make a traditional dish (rice and meat).
Frankly, you're lucky to have Brazilian and African players. Congratulations, congratulations.
Thank you.
For the shop, shop.
God willing, you have another business.
No, no, no, just playing around.
See them leaving the boxes.
Young players! Yes, we love them, from the forests of Africa.
Why like this?
Karem, open one box.
He is a human like you.
A young man said, "Didn't you hear it?"
He said they are young.
As long as we
Why don't you give us these little kids as a free gift?
Listen, Abu Nasser, if you treat him well and raise him properly, he will be beneficial to you later on.
And they would go and release him in the stadium.
Tired, tired, tired, tired
Be compassionate towards him, he is still young.
Put it in the appendix, let him nurture it.
Don't hesitate to ask for anything, all the players are with me.
See if your trainer understands you.
We won 2-0, we dominated the match.
Abu, he is the coach of Spain.
I don't like him.
Successful coach
Game control is required.
And that, the opposite, is the Wakrah road.
We shouldn't let your coach do what he likes.
Tunneled with the team for less than two months
We need to stop this.
If he were an expert in football, he would have activated the players from the wings, not attacking from the center.
Yes, he leaned against the narrow bench.
Oh mom, I have a headache.
What he has to do is to distance Kakuno Malawi.
And replace it with Shinamo Hbaboo Hitaola Hatawa Hohwa
Mama mama mama mama mama, he won't play.
Shalulu forgot his medicine.
Which line?
Implementing the plan
And he forgot about Holo.
This won't be between the coach and the team manager.
Man of the match, team star
Does "shelf" mean we're not experts in football?
Listen, Sultan
Let him go home.
Don't take the car, let him go by taxi.
"Don't bother him."
Stay informed.
Did you see what your father did?
The coach refused and sent them back.
It doesn't work.
He destroys the team.
Say goodbye to the team, we are.
Mama Mama
No, he's crazy. That means he told you that you're married. Tell me the truth, what happened between you two?
From the first day I saw him, I told you, mother, I don't like this boy.
I feel like I can't handle the responsibility.
Forget all this nonsense and talking about the past.
You should go to your parents and find out why your daughter is divorced.
I don't want to say, my brother Rashid.
Why did you divorce her, kids?
It wouldn't be right, Abu Abdullah. We need to know, we have a right to know, why are you getting divorced?
Mind your own business. Stay out of it.
Shall I, don't I want to go in? And why is the man waiting in the living room to find out why his daughter is divorced?
I don't know how to appreciate her husband and respect his feelings.
Who is Barcelona?
That's your mistake. You don't have information about the Spanish league.
Barcelona is not a lady.
Had a team Guardiola.
In other words, I'm going now to the man who's waiting for me in the salon.
If you're not going, I will. Okay, then stay here and leave it to me.
She has to get out and not move her head.
It was enough for her to insult Barcelona.
Messi, the football wizard, who scores a hat-trick in every match.
Maradona himself said that Messi will be better than him.
And you, your honorable daughter, are laughing at him. Listen,
Your daughter is not going to Barcelona and she's coming with us (like me).
What do you mean!
Listen, may God guide you.
Don't leave me, I want to build.
I apologize and try to please her.
What a shame.
And thank God we have a lot of money.
What's the point of our money if we can't make our son happy?
Ohhhhhhhh
Most importantly, I'll be able to look for a Barcelona fan.
Mama, it makes me sad.
She's crazy, man. Forget about her.
Drink your tea, boy.
You know, son, they're the ones who are losing.
A thousand girls want to marry you.
Drink, my son.
I feel sorry for her.
Congratulations, I divorced two days ago.
After a month of marriage.
Do you have something against him? Do you want me to get involved with him?
I don't want to work with him on this issue.
Who told you these illogical stories!
Don't listen to her.
No one knows who he is.
What more do you want!
Just be lucky.
Do you remember the building I want to buy and turn into an aparthotel?
Those in Mansoura.
His parents own it, and when their son gets married to our daughter, we will ask him for this building.
What if I can't?
Her brother spoke.
Listen carefully.
A millionaire's son proposed to you.
Do you know what a millionaire is?
Opportunity knocks once.
They are so rich that they bought a palace in Spain, so they can spend every summer there.
So what's the story with Barcelona?
Maybe the girl's family spread these rumors to prove their daughter's innocence.
We say that the story is true, the man loves Barcelona, and he is loyal to Catalonia.
His wife must respect that.
And we use the team.
Assuming this story is true.
God bless you, they named Abu Burgen after his father because he has two towers on the corniche.
They have a strange design like intertwined ropes.
From a distance, they'll think it's a single tower.
What do you think? Good luck to you.
Welcome
God bless you. Take something, anything.
Thank you, sweetie.
But my son Abdullah, the light of my eyes, is waiting for your reply.
No, don't be afraid, Nur Ayni, O Mother of Abdullah.
I have not found anyone better than you in all the GCC countries.
Tell them to give us their estimates for building the structure.
"You're done, sir. Would you like anything else?"
Yes, the family will call you.
See their needs for the wedding, prepare the check and I'll arrest him.
In the name of God, may God be pleased with you, in the name of God, may God be pleased with you, with your permission, Your Highness.
Abdullah divorced again!
I wish for you, boys, and from him, money.
God bless you, auntie!
You wear it for the cold.
Oh, I don't know where Mom booked us?
Why are you bothering me?
Our mother said she booked us to Malaysia.
What does Malaysia want, normally?
Happy travels.
Are you okay? I heard someone coming back from their honeymoon is baking?
Did you tie your shoelaces, girl?
Tell me what happened, girl.
Mom, she's a troublemaker like grandma.
Why is this?
She's haughty, forget about her.
You did the right thing when you fired her.
I feel sorry for her.
Give it to Mama.
Why is she sad?
What happened to her?
God bless you. Don't forget to bring us some olive oil from Spain.
Ah, Spain. Where shall we go?
Preacher
Our mother said she booked us to the Maldives.
Wow, wow, yaah [daughter] Maldives is also beautiful.
And I'll find something to make you happy too %pw.
I thought you'd come back from your trip happy.
What really wastes my time is why I don't take the kids?
Learn! Take the box.
What do they have?
Why are you angry, my dear?
Damn it! May God have mercy on you, you'll tell me about my son's face.
Oh, my son! Why are you upset?
I won't see the shells, I'll be sad.
Eat whoever bothers you.
Forget about her, divorce her, divorce her. Your father has a lot of money and many girls.
It's narrow and I know my son, anything small bothers him, why should he live sad!
Oh my son! Call her and divorce her.
"May God bless her."
The cat drank three glasses of milk.
You are divorced. Wait, wait, don't hang up, two lefts.
Divorced, divorced.
A little angry.
Yawy! Oh my son, yawy! My darling, relax and don't worry, there are many other girls, yawy! Oh my son.
Oh, problem.
It doesn't mean they saw you at the disco.
Call him, call him, I want to talk to him.
What's my name? He's already divorced me, he said, "You're divorced, divorced, divorced."
When he treated you, he was shameless.
Now if someone is going to a disco, what is she going to do!
And one if necessary %pw.
What I want! What the world has turned into!
I'll go to his house, mess it up, and you'll see. Who do you think you are?
I, I, my daughter is divorced, Abu Abdullah!
My daughter is married!
Your daughter is different.
They are bought and sold in Toys R Us stores.
How do you feel the bad taste in your mouth now from your daughter and you're upset? (Note: The original Arabic sentence is a bit unclear and might not translate perfectly, but the closest interpretation in English would be as above.)
And they didn't do anything.
"If you can't be kind, at least be truthful."
No problem if you take them out however you want.
And she is still married to a man.
Is this normal for you? Let him go to hell!
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
Whatever you accept upon yourselves.
but people accept it.
Do you know who owned this land before?
And in a strategic location?
Just leave it to God.
And also at a low price.
Out of work.
I need to get Abu Sakr's approval.
I passed by the library, but he wasn't there.
I went to his office last week and they told me he had traveled.
He has a meeting, he'll be here tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, I'm off work, and the problem is I need to get Abu Saqr's approval, I need to.
Go to his office.
No, no, no, no, this is official business.
The right place for that - God protect you - is the office, not the house.
Did you eat again?
Will Abu Sakkar's family enter?
Everyone has a key.
Tell me, O Abu Fihad.
Do you know him?
We don't know him, but we see him on TV, and you told me you met him during the Hajj.
But we don't know each other well.
Cutting off curiosity.
God guides you, I came immediately, at least ask about the reason for this holiday.
This is not appropriate, God guide you.
The month is thirty days long, and he gives fifty feasts.
I suggest Your Highness be put in the Guinness Book of World Records.
As the largest doll manufacturer in the world.
What's this brother with you?
Hello, this is a blessed time.
It's an honor to your honor.
Oh, Father of Falah!
You say Abu Sakr gives a feast every day.
We don't see each other.
But hey! Abu Falah is hosting dinner tonight for a special occasion.
Tonight, God protect you, my son Falcon
God has blessed you, you deserve this honor, with blessings.
Here he is, hello son!
Peace be upon you.
Why?
This time, my son Sakr has to come to the agency tomorrow and take the car he wants.
I was waiting for a year and a half for the visa.
I was out of work.
But when I reached him
And you gave him money.
May God guide you, Abu Saad.
What is he doing in this way.
I told him good.
He should go to the showroom and take the car he likes.
We're going to buy three for him.
Why would I take you?
They loaded it onto me.
She told me that she met you during last year's Umrah.
Today, his young son Shahin
His game is banquets.
This is your chance.
Pass by him and congratulate him.
He deserves to be wanted, okay, sir!
"Oh, Abu Sakr."
God bless you, thank you very much, welcome!
Thank God Shahin is fine, Sir.
God bless you
In sequence, who are you?
May God protect you.
You didn't recognize me.
I can't lie to you.
Hazarati, I was with you on the Umrah last year.
And I remember buying a red rosary.
God bless you.
I was in the hospital.
Visiting a relative
It would be an honor to meet you.
So, Falcon, are you still undecided about entering the business field or have you made a decision?
I saw him.
Lo and behold! Hey boy, the trade is coming.
Go ahead and start, open an office and then you'll see.
Abu Sakr,
Please say yes.
Why?
I have a gift, a falcon.
Full floor
If you love trade and it comes to you, will you say no?
Who has everything available to them like you do today? After you got your license, everything became easy for you: a free car and the best office on the corniche.
Barhah Abo abdulaziz kayyal labaabak anna law Saqr biddi yidkhul fil business, hana bdeeh ykoun sharik li b 50% "I advise you, father, that if Saqr wants to enter the business, he should be a partner with 50% share."
Mom, how can I balance business and university?
Mom doesn't force me to do something I don't like.
And you're lucky that agencies, offices, and cars are thrown in your face for free.
What is the chance, my son, for someone to start a business at this time without capital?
Your truth is the life of the people and their love for your father.
Be smart and invest it.
Trust me, son, this is your chance in life.
And he quickly prepared lunch.
%Pw and also add some corainder and pepper.
He left nothing, he left nothing, I'm afraid he'll take over the samosa business.
He has a good appetite for work.
"Dally, I was apologizing to him, do you know what he told me today?"
He told me, "Mama, I want to expand my investments."
He wants to enter the Caribbean Sea and invest in the islands there.
And God protects him from the eyes of envy.
Abu Sultan was telling me yesterday, your son is now involved in the business.
He owns twenty agencies, six restaurants, and is a partner in two banks.
**T
In my opinion, God knows best, they haven't opened it yet.
Ah, the one in the northern area of our office, what does he have?
No, I just love her.
Thank you, and may God bless you, congratulations Abbas.
In the name of God
God bless you all.
Now you don't want to regret.
You're kidding! A whole year of hardship and toil to prepare the supermarket.
What a mess! I think he passes by the store every day.
He saw her and sent me his secretary, whose name is Samer.
He told me that this is Falcon, son of Old Falcon, and he wants to be your partner instead of taking the shop from you.
He also wants to be your partner.
There is no power or strength except from Allah.
I saw you talking to him, right?
"Who are you, my brother?"
Business is business!
Why did you tell him you have Iranian French?
What was written on the small sign that was at this bakery? What name was written on the sign?
I baked bread for the neighbors.
No, I want another name.
Peace be upon you.
How's work going for you?
Welcome Sir, God willing, tomorrow or the day after we will complete the drawings of the future company's worker accommodations.
No, no, Mr. Saqr, she is my wife, Elisa. Let me introduce you to Mr. Saqr, the owner of the company.
Hello, how are you?
She can take one of the company cars.
Thank you very much, you are very kind.
Even cooking nowadays is based on science and study.
Today, someone told me they want to venture into business, and they have capital they want to invest.
But he has no knowledge of how to manage, no understanding, no study of economics, not even trade.
Someone like that
Do you think he will succeed? I don't think so, he will waste his time and lose.
Listen up, Abu Nasser!
Did you hear them say these are peacocks?
What is this?
I have a son named Falcon.
See it.
See him today.
Huzrati, we are talking about your son, Saqr.
We are talking about the law.
Your son, Saqr, God willing, is something to be envied, an exception.
Thank you, he's talking about the law.
You've shamed me, my son. A falcon builds its nest by itself.
Once, he gave a car as a gift.
He sold it and invested the money on his own advice.
And God willing, look at him now.
We're talking about ordinary people.
He got rid of them, and that's what Abu Nasser did with him; he took him and put him on the right path.
Sagar has business talents.
Strong economic capabilities.
Who should we ask whose parents are?
I swear, I'm surprising.
Praise be to God.
Gulf Money magazine in the economic referendum
Please come in.
Peace be upon you, hello hello Salim.
What does he have?
I swear, I don't have much to say, ya! Selim.
Yes, I want to remember.
The story was true.
They say the company sent a fax to my parents.
And inform him.
Poverty, as much as he could bear.
As you see it.
They say that when he heard the news,
He sneezed in the office with the fax in his hand.
Wow, he has done a lot of favors for him.
"She taught him archery, but as soon as he gained strength, he shot me with an arrow."
What did the doctor say?
Rest in peace, Salim.
I am shocked.
I can't believe there are people like that in the world.
A man who gives to the poor without his left hand knowing what his right hand is doing.
Donations from this organization are delivered to all Muslims in Asia and Africa.
But I also want Your Excellency to explain to us your goals and future steps, God willing.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, our goal at Sagr Charity is to achieve solidarity in this nation.
In addition to sixty blankets for our brothers affected by the Pakistan earthquake.
Finally, but that's not all we need to support seven poor families.
With a monthly salary of only one hundred and thirty riyals.
We won't give up.
Secondly, I'll help you.
Who is my sweetheart?
We stayed at the hotel with Khaled and his wife for the night.
Yes, anywhere, anywhere, as long as we're together, I'm happy.
My love, may God keep you safe for me.
Oh, my beloved!
This is not fair. This is my livelihood.
This is a bakery.
Taking money on interest.
Five riyals for falafel, three riyals for hot bread.
Two chickpeas.
Five broad beans, good, good.
Cook six broad beans!
Let's go, divers!
The captain is here and he brought breakfast.
Needs men.
Please, sir.
So what?
No, no, what's asking you is that I want to hear "yes" sung into my ear.
Hello Nora.
I'm angry with you.
What can I bear your anger?
What do you have?
Why not?
Nora chose a simple and elegant dress.
What you say is what I want.
Oh my God, the Lebanese speak very well.
And you don't need to talk to him much.
Me too, I get annoyed with her.
The most beautiful dress for Anwara is the sweetest.
He calls her "Narwara" when he proposes to her.
Let your blood boil, how many times will you take it?
You paid twenty thousand, and twenty thousand riyals are left.
Be a compensation (like me), congratulations!
May God be with you.
Hello, Aunt Saleh.
Hello Fadi, you seem busy, I don't want to take up your time.
I am at your disposal.
Hello, hello.
Did you receive the text message yesterday?
Got it, yay! Blade
Did you like the joke?
Did you bring the design with you?
I didn't have time to make them, show me your designs and I'll choose from them.
Frankly, you have better taste.
They're leaving us, envy is working.
No one's going to know my project is making money.
They say he will carry out a project like mine.
Luxury Design and Tailoring Boutique
Women's clothing
Hada Abo Nasser who has nothing to do with business.
This is how banks work.
His cousin will attend.
That's just how it is these days.
Yes, Uncle.
I know I was sleeping, but they woke me up to say that your cousin is asking for you.
Everything is possible! Ask me anything you want!
All is well, all is well.
I wish.
You have no intention of any project, for example, like, like.
Are you looking for a partner or what?
I heard you were determined, so I thought I should pay you a visit.
Welcome.
If you want a raise, we have one for you.
Thank God, the work is going very well.
I don't want to get married, Abu Saleh.
But we're too late, they hired him last week.
Yes, they did that.
Sweet, God willing, bye bye.
Understand him.
Are you sure?
And with luxurious fashion, do you know the big disaster!
What is this?
He rented a shop next to yours.
(Ad) You are the envier! (Ad) You are the hatred!
Before you knew that the market was open to everyone,
What you should know
Let your heart be at ease about your uncle.
I'm coming to ask you.
You lie and mock me and tell me, me,
I want to work in secret.
When you take what's in the shop next to us, you're disrupting my work.
They said they're coming and you're going to be a thorn in the side of my wisdom, you're driving me crazy.
This is envy and hatred, he swore to hit you, this is hatred, leave me alone with him.
Oh! Are you a family?
Shame on you, Abu Saleh!
Leave me alone, I swear I'll hit you! You and your annoying voice.
I'll bring you down like you brought me down with my daughter's theft.
Keep it, welcome!
Say "peace be upon him," O people.
I swear, I didn't do anything.
He told me to get a designer from the Philippines.
Don't let anyone lie to you.
Why, specifically Lebanese people.
They talk to him easily, laugh with him and laugh, and they feel completely at ease.
That's why Abu Saleh brought a Lebanese person.
He started saying sweet words to me and convincing me.
He captivated me, captivated me with his words.
He persuaded me and made me pay twelve thousand riyals.
And after two days, I went to the flea market and found the same cabinet, its twin, for nine hundred riyals.
Taking money.
Bring a Lebanese designer.
"Let's find Mr. Shelf, you told me yesterday that it was difficult, is it still difficult today?"
Yeah, today is also very difficult.
I feel that Abu Saleh has changed in recent days.
What does he have?
Don't I know? What do I have?
Abu Saleh is very psychologically tired after his cousin opened a store and hired a Lebanese designer just like him.
For the past two weeks, sales at the store have been declining.
The problem here in Qatar is that no Qatari will open a shop unless another Qatari comes along and does the same project and opens the same shop next to him. Should I go into business with him?
No, no, no, no, he is with Fadi the designer now, they are thinking about a solution.
What should we do now?
We're all sitting like we're poisoned.
If we keep like this, I think we won't even cover the rent of the shop.
A place far from them.
That doesn't mean we're going to evacuate the stadium for them.
Thank you very much, what's the discount?
What's this? Why don't you give an evening dress for free with every wedding dress?
There's nothing, come on.
What's wrong? What happened? We're going to the store next to you, today they put an ad with every wedding dress, two crazy evening dresses for free, and also a 25% discount.
Sweet, let's go, let's go.
And for you, wait two weeks, they'll run the same ad, you buy a wedding dress and get two evening dresses free with a 25% discount.
They are our killers.
In my opinion, if we leave them, they will destroy us.
Don't bother.
What did the violin do?
It's definitely a challenge.
Certainly this is a challenge.
In the name of God
If it happens, you'll hear the news in two or three days. I'll close his shop.
Congratulations.
Wait, wait, hang on, hang on, I'm coming to you now, bye-bye.
What job?
Saud says the store is unbearable and no one can sit there. He says he has no idea where all these bad smells are coming from.
The smell has nothing to do with this conditioner, no.
It'll be at least six days before the smell goes away from the shop.
One hundred percent sure.
He came at night.
He will cut the electrical wires from the shop.
Is this justice?
Now will you sign an undertaking or shall I start a case and open a file?
Don't do anything for him.
I will erase him from this life.
Oh, Abu Nasser, something strange happened. No one came to our shop.
Abu Nasser, hold on, hold on, a customer is coming. I'll talk to you later. This is strange.
He is moaning in his bed.
He says he's going through a tough time and I'm afraid to tell him that the bank called and they need the installment.
The debts piled up on him because of his miserly uncle.
What happened to him this time?
Poor them, if they entered by mistake and saw Saad the designer, they would shout in his face and beg him.
Asleep! He doesn't feel it, his eyes are open and he's staring at the ceiling.
I don't know what he did to me.
Saud is at the shop.
Put him under a spell, I don't know what he did to him.
Once girls see him, they're afraid of him.
I don't know, why is he converting it?!
Put me down as a loser, put me down as a loser.
I have a lot of debts.
They are stingy with me.
And I have no evidence against him to sue him.
I don't know what he did, I don't know what he did.
Forget it, he deserves it.
Please, tell me what kind of magic you did to him. You turned his designer into a monster that even women are afraid to see.
Preach about something that has no truth in it.
It's not normal! People, tell him that the photography group needs him urgently.
Welcome, may God bless you, may God protect you, tell him they need you urgently, urgently.
I swear they raise my blood pressure, kill me, paralyze me. This isn't fair, Master Abdullah.
What's the problem, my dear Ahmed? Don't make mistakes. You live with heart diseases; this is not suitable for you, man!
He swore he called me several times, my ears want me, but he's worth shit. These additions will drive me crazy, they will drive me crazy.
No one's going to do anything, I'm responsible for everything!
Listen to me, he will make you listen to my words.
Ring 25, Scene 16, Ahmed, we want to finish.
So, I'll turn off the camera because none of the actors will come.
What's the output?
What have I done, Sir Abdullah? Why are you shouting at me like this?
My love, if you don't want anyone to work for you,
What happened to Abdullah?
One more late person and they're in trouble.
Oh Ahmed! I don't need anyone, my darling.
Look for someone with gravitas who can convince people that he can really be a millionaire and a billionaire, not just anyone.
Please, sir, come in, fire your gun, and your request will be ready in half an hour.
Oh! Ala', no one, I was the only one who understood him.
Alright, let's replace this scene with these two instead of this one.
You are the manager and you are the production manager. You are responsible.
What are they going to do now?
They'll do everything, see the manager is angry and it's a mess, but they'll leave it.
We need someone with specific qualities. Where can we find such a person nowadays?
Are you serious?
Didn't you hear what the director said?
I know someone, God help you with him, I hope he's suitable.
%PW Saud Bokhtorn!
Saud Kanz! I remember him as Saud Hamdiyat.
Yes, when he was young, they called him Saud al-Sumr, and when he grew up, they called him A'lab.
Why the can?
I'll tell you the reason. Sweetie, he used to walk the streets collecting cans and selling them by the kilo.
My rich and majestic brother, do not despair.
His personality is suitable, he doesn't remember like a big drum in the thigh and buttocks, he isn't tall and he isn't fat.
Are you sure he's suitable?
Hopefully, but you need to get him good makeup and I guarantee he'll be suitable and funny too.
Sweet, what are you waiting for, call him!
I don't have his number.
I'll take Amir with me and I'll come back for him.
Where is Saudi Arabia?
What's he saying?
God, God.
Saud Kanz.
We didn't have anyone in our neighborhood named Saud Kans.
Yes, I'm sure he's from this neighborhood, but I forgot which house.
This house belongs to a person named Saud, and he lives with his mother.
Yeah, right.
But this wasn't Saud Cans.
Saud had a laptop.
Certainly, it is, but it evolves over time because the laptop is like a can.
He is tall, fat, and a bit brown.
He put down the cans and started assembling the old laptop. Come on, come on, come on, oh dear.
He went to the vegetable market to buy some for me. Am I serious? Where's the other one?
I don't know, my son.
This is what you always wear.
I have another one, where is the one from the Gotra family, where is he?
Eid
This is what I'm asking for.
Fix and AXE are oil brands.
I want you to crinkle the rose a little before you go, not crease it.
But these days, I feel depleted every day.
Mom, may God guide you, since yesterday I've wanted to take you to the emergency hospital, but you refused.
No, uncle, they told me that's how it's done.
Alhamdulillah, you're employed now instead of being unemployed.
"Goodness, Mama, bye-bye."
See, you're going to fight with her, you'll get angry and rise up.
You sit and move slowly, and the camera moves with you, it will pan to your side.
A. Javer! A.
Who am I to you?
Abu Abdullah is a very famous actor, Abdullah Al-Lama.
This is for you, my son, Aboud. How are you?
How are you, my servant?
Respect yourself, you need to respect yourself a little in front of people here.
We're from the same neighborhood.
Calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down, be calm, be calm.
I love acting, I hope they give me a role where I can hit you.
No one knows you, my brother.
My old grandfather, we know he didn't sleep like this, brother!
Oh! My brother, may God heal you.
May God bless her.
Your life is just a cup of coffee.
Oh my lord, oh my lord
Do you have any asthma medication for my mother?
He is a manager, not a doctor.
Look at yourself, listen to what he's saying, you have no point.
What is her mother's name?
You're on, what are you thinking about?
I heard what she said about you.
She's telling you not to be happy, you need to be calmer.
Give me, give him, give him, give him half a million to pray for my empty tire.
And give him three million to buy me dinner.
I wanted to ask you why you're talking like that.
Because I'm pure, as some people requested.
See, Mr. Naive, our production in the neighborhood, actors of a high level.
Now excellent, he is suitable for the role.
Complete, honey, I'll help you, I don't have feelings, do I?
Did your family buy this?
Your life is just a cup of coffee.
The gentleman went to the makeup room, had makeup done, and I'll tell him to send you the bill and come to you.
Move, move, move, this is nice.
Oh, oh.
Listen, brother, take the car with us when we finish shooting, I'll call you to pick it up.
What's that, but it's the same. Can someone give me a ride?
"Go ahead and lift it! Fine, we'll have our driver lift you. Fine, thank you, brother, thank you, thank you, wait."
Sweet, call your friend, extra, call him.
Oh no! Saud took my laptop from the makeup room.
Scratch my dinner for me.
It's written in front of you now.
Good luck, shall we go over a review?
Mine!
I didn't expect this from you.
We'll fight, for what!
We fight for our rights.
Ah, wait.
And you must know who you are talking to, Abu Abdulaziz.
Why did she divorce him, brother?
Put it down as a divorce and let's be done with it.
And we won't leave any girl behind.
What's up, what do you think?
He's going to wash it, but later. The important thing is that you're ready to go into the fitting room to change your clothes and be ready for the photo shoot.
My teeth, a precious tooth is expensive.
People, the filming of these scenes has been postponed.
Why is this?
I don't want any more tea, oh! Brother, I'm tired and my stomach is full of tea. What's this, I've been waiting for an hour, how much longer do I have to wait?
"I didn't see anything, it's a very common thing."
May God grant you health and well-being.
They are speeding.
Thank you, Your Excellency. May God protect you.
Send my regards to your family.
Tell them Abu Abdelaziz sends his regards.
"Masha'Allah, our lord %PW."
It was fun, wasn't it?
From your violin, they shake your hand and kiss your nose too.
The first time someone winked at me about my nose.
How do they accept them on their noses?
You have a problem.
"Like an ice cream stick, I'll cut your lip. It was funny, it was funny."
What a laugh!
"No need to thank me."
May I be an actor?
You've got something wrong. What's wrong with your voice?
Oh my son, my son, I am very sick, I am waiting for you.
Rise quickly.
Welcome, Sheikh, welcome.
Look here or here yourself, man.
Listen to me, you!
Alright, go now.
I see a lot of reverence.
What happened, son?
Hello, what's up?
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet
And don't bother, God willing it will be, yeah! Dr. Hassan, come here, come here.
What's up, Dr. Hany? What happened?
Let Azza rest in the office.
Don't worry.
She is the mother of all, may God keep her safe.
Welcome, welcome.
Shut up or I'll punch you in the face.
Here my name is Abu Abdelaziz.
Call me, sir.
How are you, sir?
May God damn you.
Yes, sir.
Welcome, Sir, have a seat.
God bless you.
Baha'i Faith
Walk with him, Sir Rashid.
I swear I didn't do anything to you, tell me and see what I'll do to you.
Oh friend! Can I quickly find a doctor, please?
Doctor, my mother is sick!
Wait in line, it's your turn.
Listen to me, you!
May I ask you, my friend?
Oh my son, quickly, I am sick.
You go to the hospital a lot, you take your mother every week, you don't like any of them, they are nice and accept everything.
Defied the citizens.
Don't forget your citizenship.
Okay, I'll bring the wife to the hospital.
I love her.
But, my brother, she considers me otherwise.
Good luck, try to be close to her, smile at her, look at her, give her your number with good intentions.
Shell is wrong.
Respect yourself.
Get out, get out, if you don't leave, I'll call security to teach you a lesson.
No, I don't need anything.
Come on, sir, you must drink.
For me, brother.
No, thank you.
You can take her and leave the hospital.
The one speaking to you is Fahad Al-Marzouk.
You're marrying him, which means you're marrying him.
No, no, I need the money, clothes, and the car too. I'll rent them from you.
Why do they want to give you your money back?
No, no, no, wait.
Let's go.
What is this %PW in the name of Al-Marzouk!
Welcome, welcome, you are very welcome.
The light of my eyes signed his marriage contract yesterday.
I wish you had come.
They were surprised by what you did for them, it was a very classic and special party.
One regular and the other diet.
Now you have no excuse.
What is this?
Mom invited my friends to work tomorrow.
Are you going to take this for them!
Yes, there's something wrong with it.
Nora, come here!
What is this?
He's going to take this thing to his friends, for the scandal.
Whatever you decide to take, everyone will talk to you about it.
Give me money, tomorrow I'll tell you something fancy.
Yes, but I just promised them now.
I need to take it tomorrow.
It's your turn, they are all open, go and change your clothes, so we can bring something that pleases people.
Come on, let's go.
It has a reasonable price and it has a very good quality.
Above average, not the best!
Certainly there is top-quality chocolate, but sorry, I thought you were looking for a good price.
This is too expensive, why are you looking for the expensive ones again?
This is not possible, look at this artistic touch.
This is called royal chocolate.
The same chocolate you always order at the Spanish court.
Give me this.
Congratulations, and in any case, you have a warranty certificate.
Welcome, welcome, Farah!
Come on, bro, give us some of that chocolate, bro.
What's the occasion, man?
No, Saleh Abdul Qader, the one in accounting.
By the blessing of God, he deserves it, give me another one.
Get the coffee quickly.
Auntie, did you go to their wedding?
I swear, my brother, I was at their wedding. It was embarrassing, annoying. Don't believe it, my brother!
Did you listen to your aunts?
That's why I want to throw you a wedding like no other.
No time, you only have one and a half months.
I'll sort everything out.
It doesn't let me do anything.
You're not living in society; don't you see how people put everything they have into their weddings?
And you saw it yourself.
What do you think when you buy something nice, and see how people praise you and your taste?
Has no one told you that I'm amazing and beautiful?
Cheap, but how much did we pay?
The money we spent on chocolate, it's enough to buy four sheep for the wedding.
Unfortunately, your mother knows everything, but give her the money and that's that.
This doesn't mean they'll take everything here.
Yawi, you have very bad taste.
What do you think of these theatres?
But excellence costs a lot of money.
Why, why, the previous one was nice!
What do you think of this?
This is the first time anyone has thought about creating a platform like a computer mouse.
Sorry, one minute.
See, talk about everything except theater and formations. That's the place where the women who only have rumors will be, but you'll be silent.
The man is waiting for us.
We'll go to this stage, mouse.
It won't be a strange sight.
The latest model in two thousand and eleven.
We've already chosen the mouse.
You can sit aside, this is all for you.
So you have to choose, if it's Noah's Ark you have to pay twenty thousand more, and if it's the mouse you have to pay one hundred and twenty-five thousand.
Pick your brains and we're ready.
You're not the first one to get married.
You're not thinking straight, are you going to get married in the Comoros? That would be like getting married in our country.
We're just getting started too.
If you don't have a screen, where will you put the doll? In a box?
Iron, paint, and a little wood.
And the people are happy.
They exploit us and lie to us; in fact, they are thieves.
What's your job now?
Are you angry and upset?
If you don't want to get married, you have no choice.
I will take care of the patient and keep her calm, as Saleh is in a very critical condition.
What is he eager to do? Can he afford the wedding expenses? It's fine with me. Are you eager to call her? I'm serious, I'll call her.
We received a bouquet of flowers from the Netherlands.
For me, if you put it on the tables at the wedding,
Are you sure this is your first time in Doha?
And the Middle East as well!
Charge it to the bill.
How much will it increase?
One hundred and seventy-two, in the name of God.
But Samir, I don't want to see this collection at any wedding.
You know people's rumors.
Sweet, they're saved.
My salary is higher than his.
See, you're going to open up a problem we can't solve.
Oh God, help Saleh.
But for heaven's sake, you should have tried to sort things out.
For me, Alhamdulillah, I have decided to look for a wife in any Arab country.
They say you can have a wedding that costs only two thousand dollars and enjoy it.
God bless you, my sweet.
God willing, his wedding will be next month.
Specify the number of cards you want and let me know.
If the invitations are sufficient, then certainly. The main thing is that people know they are invited, where, when, and that's it.
You only want him, you don't care what people will say.
People know the standard of the wedding from the invitations.
Tomorrow when they see these invitations, I know what the women will say.
See their wedding, if this invited them, they didn't see the invitation together.
What we said was, we'll order it online.
It has a cloth cover, panda skin, and a silver sparkle.
No one can blame you, you can't stop me.
I won't forget a hot topic for women, I'll forget to ask for invitations, I mean, I'll forget to ask for invitations!
I see him stuck where, man.
Paragraph, of course his family pressured him a lot.
Dude! He borrows from everyone!
He didn't even say a word, he sold his car.
And he looks like he's twenty years older, this morning I saw him talking to himself.
Don't nag me, my sweet brother, I don't know when you'll grow up.
Please close the door.
Sorry, brother.
Has anyone tried seeing them get married according to your budget?
What do you mean by the basis of my budget?
Why am I living alone?
The problem our society is facing is the disease of showing off, boasting, and pride.
It forces you to suffer from the same illness.
If you want to live in it.
Once, I gave the mother of the bride a bucket.
I was attacked by her words (lesbians).
Trust in God.
Shame on you, tell me less.
How did you get married?
And I don't want to get married, I'm not crazy.
Even if you read, my brother, the marriage contract,
I will consider marrying a foreigner or even an Arab.
And he says your country!
We spent bringing DJs for the songs.
No, Umm Nasser brought a famous singer to her son's wedding.
He is a very famous singer, but I forgot his name.
Why are you so annoyed?
It's clear you don't like what I'm doing!
It's enough that he sold his car, and every day one of his friends gives him a ride.
Previously, I entered the room and found him talking to himself.
I see, now you want to change your mind.
Because my brother Saleh is tired, Mama, enough.
I don't have a problem with you or him.
I am no better than people.
We graduated by joke.
Enough, Mom, my brother spent all he had and took money from everyone.
Please, mute.
Mom, I have new wedding requests, and my brother told me he doesn't have the money. So I cried and said, "Cancel the wedding, I don't want to get married."
Where are you from?
She's inside, and they're doing her a favor.
He said she was much better now and they would help her at the hospital.
What a scandal!
Rest, my sister.
The doctor told you to stay calm and gave you an injection to help you sleep.
How can I relax when he wants to make us laugh for good or for evil.
I told him to come like Abdullah Roaished, he told me I don't have money.
I feel sorry for your mother.
Occupy her.
He went to her, go to her and kiss her head.
And tell her, "I'll do what you want."
I'll play Abdullah Roaished for you.
Abu Yusuf is kind; I don't think he would have helped me.
What is fair, no one found it strange except Abu Yusuf.
What do you want from him!
Are you crazy, Saleh?
But the minister kept him because he is a senior man and, more than that, he is organized and trustworthy.
In my opinion, if he hears the same words you told me, his heart might stop.
Yes, I did that.
Because you're stuck in this bloody crisis and you want to ask Abu Youssef for money, of course from the ministry's funds.
And only God knows when you will return it to Him.
And when the auditors come and ask him about the money,
Perhaps he's in trouble.
No one will know, and he will know how to deal with it.
You are responsible; the man is in his office, and you should be the one responsible if anything happens to him.
A thief in my last days!
Uncle doesn't call it stealing.
In the first drawer
No, there's no white box wrapped in blue tape with a circle and a dove wing picture on it, bring it, bring it.
Okay, come on Abu Yousif, me, me, if I don't have problems,
I'll give everything back.
They call me Abu Yusuf.
And I came in my last days
Oh, screw you, Thursday.
Salih, Salih.
Hassan, listen to what I'm saying. If it was anyone else, they would have gotten a slap or something bad would have happened to them! Oh! Oh! Oh! Khalid.
Salih, Salih.
All the methods I've tried have failed, Uncle Abu Youssef, I'm drowning.
What I can't do is change the past.
And you don't know them, they are all bald.
What's wrong with you?
No, no, the second one, the tablet you're afraid of, the tablet you're afraid of.
In the drawers, in the drawers.
Uncle Abu Yusuf, the stairs are full of grapes, which grape do you want?
The box with a picture of a man in a state of panic.
We booked two rooms for hair and makeup, just for us.
And we'll be there from tomorrow.
We came for Abdullah Al-Ruwaished and his band.
See, my dear.
No, I won't tell you.
This will be the hit of the season.
I was the first to use it in the world.
Mama, Mama,
Hello hello.
There is nothing but God.
Oh my son, don't forget to read Al-Mu'awwidhat (the Surahs of refuge) when you enter the dance hall.
The woman here has evil eyes.
I told you before, it's amazing.
The best jaroom in the world, God protect you, I don't want to envy you.
Mama, mama, the police are breaking down the door.
I was wrong to obey you, God.
What is fair, today is my wedding day.
The people coming for the test arrived.
And now solve it, I'm going to jail, God help me.
Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf, Abu Yusuf!
It's still early.
That's not fair if that happens!
The company offered a contract worth three million, two million just for the materials.
Wrote a memo to the minister.
We know there's corruption, but it doesn't go this far.
It seems you don't live in this world.
Tell me, what did the minister say to Uthman?
And why didn't our president refuse? They say he was with them!
As far as I know, I swear I don't know.
What about ethics?
Right has become wrong and wrong has become right!
O Saad, are you sure the minister fired him? O people, what has happened to the world?
Leave him alone!
What else?
The queen is the minister's sister.
This girl lives with the minister.
A strange world (proverb).
Get away from her, you didn't know who she was?
This is the new employee that the minister hired to replace Uthman, who was involved in the accident.
Shift, shift, shift.
What do you want me to do, Saleh? To oppose the minister!
You're crazy!
Listen to me, man.
We don't have children, we want to live.
We want to live.
What happened?
Here he is standing next to the elevator.
This is the passport of truth and honesty, my brother Saleh.
I wish we could do anything for you, brother.
Thank God, thank God for everything.
What's wrong with you, Saleh?
These are among the strange things we see before us in this world.
We see things we can't believe.
I'm at your disposal.
I want you to come from the supermarket after work to get some vegetables for the salad.
I'll try, see you later.
Who's driving my sister home?
She was sitting in the front, laughing and talking. Who is that?
This is my friend from university, what's wrong with him if he asks me to go home with him? Nothing.
Oh God, I can't see, why do you look like the old one!
What are you saying?
Don't you hear what we're saying?
You are old-fashioned.
This is normal and new to right and wrong!
Right is right and wrong is wrong.
Snakes evolved and we are living in the age of technology.
The age of international variables that unite the world, and no one can keep up with them.
The more you live, the more you see!
Don't blame me, Manira; it's not in my nature to get angry and upset.
This is one of the things that will be seen on that day.
Tell her he is determined.
Life doesn't work that way.
Don't worry, I'm coming right away.
Let me sleep so I can rest.
The boss isn't angry with you.
Is the boss not angry?
No, he's not eager. Go wash your face and have lunch.
Hey, sweetie.
I really want to meet you on my first day of work.
It's an honor to your honor.
Of course, of course.
Certainly you know that you don't need anyone to remind you of the basics at work.
But at the same time, this is very important.
To restore some values and principles that work.
In the public interest.
These are the things that should be your honor.
We all have to
The lottery is very important, sir.
They are not thieves.
Thank you, thank you all.
I don't want to say more.
And let him warn you about my first day at work.
There is one employee among you.
I am frank and sincere and loyal and all those bad things.
Just doubt.
Such an honest employee.
Up to here, we can take the necessary legal actions against him in our ministry.
No, there's something else I need you to do, sir.
Thank God, we are all thieves.
As you wish, Sir, I'll say it in front of my colleagues and peers.
Wayne Khaled?
Yes, sir.
Khaled, you are very, very praise-worthy, God bless you.
Hello, sir.
Sir, you know how to choose.
May God guide you.
Why is a devil controlling you?
Thank God it wasn't a disaster.
Mom, why is Dad in prison?
You're a girl!
No, no, I won't let her in again.
Mom, why is my father in prison?
Enough.
You've become honest.
It's no shame to say that your father is honest.
This is it!
Your whole body is covered.
What will people be able to see?
And hoping, you're thinking about work, no one busy will hire you in your state.
Will she be a modest woman who covers her body and beauty?
She covers her chest, she wears clothes down to here, she's choking herself.
I saw her, my son.
And I bought her a top and pants that revealed her midriff above her navel.
She's a hopeless case; she just wants to be on the right track.
Here I am telling you!
You're only hurting yourself.
I am asking for the hand of my daughter, Sarah, for my son, Rashid.
One of us is currently looking for a suitable man for her son.
I have news for you, Rashid, my son.
The wind is blowing.
He can't stay away from drinking.
He's drunk twenty-four hours a day.
Drunk, tipsy, and heavy all day.
And don't ask about the joy.
He is educated.
And I also tell you that he is a hypocrite.
And what about stealing?
"She doesn't expect that from you, and how are the drugs?"
This is clear, period. This is five riyals if you like it, you can come and fight for his eyeball, this is a competition for him.
Oh Abu Sara, it's shameful, we've come only to ask for her hand.
You know about mobbing and gathering.
We know she came from a good family.
By the blessing of the Son, by blessing, that's how life works, by blessing.
I'm drunk.
I can't walk.
Sweet, go ahead.
Bye bye
Sweet, call your dad to come pick you up.
Why did you call him?
Why does he come to get you?
Who is it?
Look, he's over there, standing with his arm around a girl with blue hair.
Truly, your father is walking in a straight line, he's delighted.
Hello, my dear son Mona!
Majid! His name is Abdulaziz.
Yeah, right.
I like you, girl.
And you know since the establishment of the State of Palestine with its capital in Jenin in two thousand and nine hundred, after signing a comprehensive peace treaty with the State of Israel,
Israel continues to practice terrorism, pressure, and siege on it.
The last was what the Israelis and their Arab friends raised of accusations against the Palestinians.
They smuggle plastic knives through the tunnels.
Especially the second article, paragraph A, which states that the Palestinian people must cut their nails every day.
Now we move on to this tragic meeting.
Cheap sir,
When Israel agrees to the establishment of a Palestinian state,
Man, what are you saying, man? You're ruining our reputation and leaving me alone!
Please!
Sorry, Lord Tiger, sorry, Mr. President.
Can you give me a chance to speak?
Full compliance with the comprehensive international agreement.
What is the Israeli representative saying?
When we find something solid like stone or plastic as a commitment.
Man, even our houses!
What do Gulf Arabs hold onto?
All Palestinians are made of wood.
American companies, according to the agreement, will make cars out of wood for us.
All the doors of our houses are made of thermally treated wood.
No one needs speeches.
The subject hasn't changed.
My lord, the President,
This is a very important point, and I want to vote on this matter because nail growth is a breach of the agreement.
If you agree, raise your hands.
But I had a very strange dream.
Maintain control over the students.
I saw a crowd of people.
That's the fourth school you'll start working at tomorrow.
Because I asserted my strong personality as a teacher from the beginning.
The boys follow him and tear his clothes, and he does nothing.
How many times has he come to me without being invited?
The school principal told me.
Rashid is kind, we don't want to expel him.
Children throw stones at birds.
They drag him by his collar in front of everyone during recess.
And they said, "This teacher doesn't want us, and he will destroy everything."
Are they telling the ketchup story?
Mary, come on.
What's the story with ketchup, that's new, no one told me!
Hello, a beautiful cat sat on the chair.
He came and sat down.
He didn't know anything.
Only when he saw the children laughing at him in the schoolyard.
Enough.
In turn, the school principal, with whom you will start working tomorrow, called me.
But she doesn't have anything, we'll try with her again.
Because I'm apologizing to you.
"She who lives a life of mercy and weakness has corrected justice."
Oh, Uncle Abdullah!
See it as a different Rashid.
And no one needs to remind you of this important educational saying,
You are a graduate of education, and so am I.
And we all know this quote,
The teacher is the son of the first class.
I saw Mr. Rashid the Strong.
If anyone makes a mistake,
There's going to be a problem.
"Don't start talking," he said, "just shut your mouth."
See, that's why I'm telling you.
Some of you mocked me and said I'd keep quiet? Who?
You're the one who told me to shut up!
No, not me.
The one next to you!
Stand up and go to the principal's office.
And tell him that Mr. Rashid fired me.
I don't want you here, you hear me!
What do you think of my temper?
What you should be on your first day, you should be for the whole year.
Be aware of the results.
If I heard someone's voice
While I'm explaining or speaking.
Do you know what you want?
Nervous, you know what nervous means?
He looks angry.
Did you hear what he said or not?
You heard him too.
He left the classroom.
Go to the school principal.
Take your job and leave now!
Take your job.
I'm jobless.
Certainly, he's still looking for it.
My professor, my queen.
Consecutively, ice cream with milk is very delicious if it has strawberries inside.
Dear Abdurrahman.
Every human makes mistakes.
You are my only alternative, my son.
But the most important thing is that your father doesn't know the story!
I want it, I want the chocolate in my bag.
Oh, where is your bag? Where is your bag? Where is your bag?
In class.
I'm at your disposal.
He says he's happy with you.
You don't know how to distinguish between a rich kid and an ordinary kid.
Misfortune, how does misfortune look green or red?
Stay here, are you going?
In the bathroom.
Are you still in the bathroom?
Knock on the door quickly and tell him that the first class started half an hour ago, quickly.
Before them all, there was one juice and one bag of chips.
I took him before all of them, I disturbed them. My friend Abdelrahman and this connection are very awake.
Alright, now go to Saoud and get the PlayStation disc from him.
And so, what do we learn from this story?
That man
He must have morals.
He bought the thing, the PlayStation, and a friend of his said to him, "All of the PlayStations are together."
Hey, do you want something else, my friend Abdelrahman, my friend?
Leave now.
We learn from the story.
You all know I'm retiring this week because I've been accepted into graduate studies.
So, I thought I had to hand in the event file before I traveled.
How can I drive you in the afternoon? Abdulrahman told me, and I don't know where he wants to go, but he didn't say why at one o'clock!
As long as his father came back and didn't say anything to him, praise be to God, you've taken care of it and it's done.
"What we say, I didn't take it this afternoon, I'm tired, and he told his father, 'No, no, no, this is a disaster, no, no.'"
Hello, my friend Abdulrahman.
May God help you.
Don't do that.
Do you prefer it, do you prefer it like this.
Today, my child, we will learn a new lesson in science.
Peace be upon you too.
Thank you.
I need water.
I asked, I asked you, do you have any service?
Teacher, teacher. How can you ask the teacher for water?
No teacher will give you a hundred, are you a bird? This incident won't be overlooked, I'll write it in the reports.
And you're laughing at me too, you're laughing at me.
Don't raise your voice and don't shout at me, are you hearing me or not?
Is this enough for you?
Okay, how many cars is that?
Four to five cars.
Excellent, this is excellent, beautiful, excellent.
What's he doing?
See, he's going to park in front of our houses at the expense of our comfort.
Don't leave me in the days of Abu Nasser.
Abu Nasser is finished.
He is studying abroad.
Sweet, you broke the table.
Don't be shy, brother.
Why is this?
Are you different? (Like me)
Change your feelings for me.
Me or you?
We didn't say anything, bro!
What is this?
Listen, leave everything as it is, it's better for you.
It doesn't threaten you, brother!
What do you mean by "what is needed" and "I want to make it easier for you"?
What are you saying?
Instead of what, what do they call it?
It's clear you want to.
You want it, he also wants it.
Faster, faster.
Is this ugly?
What he wants, that's not fair!
He has no shame.
We're coming to my uncle Abu Neif's to discuss, not to shout.
Who from here goes to Rashid to do what he loves in the neighborhood?
Did you give me a chance to speak?
Alright people, quiet down and listen for a moment to what Uncle Abu Nafi' is saying.
Now, this loser who means nothing to me is playing with your nerves!
Leave it to me.
If you don't hit him in the face, he won't stay on the sunshade he made.
The game is played by its players (proverb).
Is this normal?
Bye bye.
I still haven't seen anything.
Do you know he has a jewelry store now!
That's why you're looking here, wearing all these rings and bracelets.
God compensates us.
Just walk, will you be in the heat?
I can't believe that naive Rashid and the poor have become like this.
Become the Vice President of Global Education Center
"To your cheeks, to your friend. You are a teacher and he is a teacher, but look where he is now and where you are now."
"Masha'Allah" (literally "what
I won't give you Abdullah.
I'll tell you what the secret is.
Professor Jay, Professor Jay.
Teacher, I didn't do anything!
Professor, do you have any information about it?
My love, I know who he is.
Here I'm telling you, you won't find a good opportunity like this.
I'm wearing work clothes! This is funny, I swear it's funny.
God willing, the work is in my pocket.
Thank you for everything you've done, thank you, thank you.
Send him my regards.
Your mother sends you her greetings. May God protect you, I'll tell her, he sends his greetings.
No, goodbye my sweet, in God's care.
What more do you want, your brother is going to become a minister, but do you believe that, my son!
Oh Mama, here we work, here we work at a high level.
But son, if you work with him, won't they have anything to say?
What did he give you?
This thing doesn't have a problem, right?
Okay! This happens automatically, without a doubt.
My beloved, O you who are, let my dream come true.
Before your dream, my dream.
A tower was built between the Corniche towers.
Come on, what are you waiting for!
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You can do it, Abu Saleh.
It seems your friend is angry.
He doesn't see it that way, brother.
You can do it, Abu Saleh.
Do you think he's standing there, took the mobile and gave it to Abu Saleh?
Look, there's something behind this, and I'm a hundred million percent sure that Abu Sultan wants to take revenge on him.
His relationship with Abu Saleh wasn't going well.
No, Abu Sultan won't do that unless he wants to do something else.
Really, to this extent?
Open the car door for him!
Finally, he's working on opening the minister's car doors.
Oh my son, don't break my heart, don't break my heart.
When you listen, all the stories we hear in the cafes take place in the village.
I can't believe what I'm hearing!
My heart stopped, my heart stopped.
"Unlucky, my daughter, that women are talking about me and not mentioning the kindness of the Dashashin. She is spreading rumors about me among the women, my daughter."
Say something, Abu Sultan, speak. I'm confused, I'll sit down.
Please, I know what I'm doing.
It's none of your business.
Muneera, I'm very hungry.
By opening the door for him, that's the beginning of the plan in my head.
I deserve to be the minister, not him.
Hire me, I have a plane.
Why don't they promote him?
Yes, plan.
He must trust me in the beginning.
They told me they appointed him minister because he had appointed me two months ago.
Because I'm quite sure he'll be fired from his job.
Magic can be undone.
What is this?
What is this violin?
At every event he attends, the photographer takes many pictures of him, so his photo often appears in the newspaper.
Wow, it smells so bad it rises to the surface.
Are you sure?
You wait. Let me work against him and you'll see.
On the contrary, sir.
Certainly, Your Highness.
Therefore, tell me.
Did you thank him for the sheep? Anyway, the meat was very delicious.
The man is outside, go see him.
Don't be foolish. People want to elevate you, but you want to humiliate yourself.
Only the minister, enter, come in.
No, no, no, don't take my picture. But Your Excellency the Minister, just one photo, please.
Take another one.
Brother, I really liked your plan.
I want you to take it to him.
Picture, picture, picture.
I don't have a minister either.
Hey, I'll tell you, wait!
Go to the second-to-last page.
Look at the size of the picture with the groom.
Say, "There is no god but Allah."
Yes, he has one or two pictures every day.
As you say, he is a social activist. Well, well, goodbye, goodbye.
Everyone wants you, but I don't know why you are like this.
He is everywhere (proverb).
They are envious, they envy you. A tree bears fruit, it is stoned (proverbs).
Take me to the market!
Aren't you ready?
Peace be upon you.
Hello and peace be upon you, hello.
You are very famous.
So, your name is Abdulaziz Abdullah, right?
He had a dream.
How many times have I told you?
Three hundred and fifty.
For his famous personality,
Are you at home today, is everything okay?
Leave me alone, I have a headache today, my head hurts, I feel pain all over my body, and my colon is getting worse.
I'm tired, really tired. I've been with him for a month.
I'll let myself rest today.
Hello, Umm Sultan.
Can I say something?
Oh woman, I want her but she doesn't take me.
I saw that you love him.
You saw for yourself what the celebrities did!
I see. Thank God you're convinced.
Frankly,
Your minister is stuck, he seems to like this story.
I will send you my brother Saad.
No, I didn't follow any activity and I didn't read the newspaper, I don't know.
We are at your service, goodbye.
If God wants the destruction of an ant, He sends it two wings.
Peace be upon you, sir, do you have a conference here at the hotel tonight?
Marriage?
Subhanallah, don't you have any events like a party, birthday, or wedding?
I don't know, but you check with the hotel behind us.
Ah, there's a hotel behind you, right?
Can I leave you in the car and go ask at the hotel?
Move, move, move and take your time. Move and ask, move.
God helps everyone.
What kind of minister is this, not letting us sleep or relax?
Delly didn't find him a party, a wedding, or a problem to throw him into.
They took him to two dozen hotels, but they couldn't find anything for him. He has terrible luck, just like his face.
We want to learn.
He didn't like his birthday party.
Go, you might see the second half!
In every issue, he has a hundred pictures.
He doesn't sleep! He doesn't get tired, brother.
Man, the newspaper editor says the first thing is to prepare his pictures, and then I prepare the newspaper.
She said my children participated in a contest that featured a picture of your husband, the minister.
How many pictures of the minister are in the newspaper?
And the hero gets a prize.
The story isn't like that. You have to come to the coffee shop and hear the comments every day about his pictures in the newspaper. This won't stop the rumors.
Wow, my death is so close.
As they say, if God saw a butterfly die, it would approach the light.
People will leave you and greet him.
Become one of the most famous people in the country.
Who are you and who is he?
I'm proud of your degree.
May God bless you and bless her.
She said, "We are all married except for poor Amal. She's the only one among us who hasn't married."
This is my purpose.
My fate is to get married.
And forget about marriage.
God, enough of those who were behind him.
Do you see those people sitting over there?
Ah, what do they have?
Look who's playing with their hair?
Is this a boy or a girl?
After my father died, it means he killed him.
I saw him, he grew up, right?
It won't be right for you to leave him attached to the maid.
Go and make some tea.
I felt bad talking to my mom. She doesn't have one maid, she has two for him.
I've told you a hundred times not to interfere; my children are not your children.
You don't have a problem other than Khalaud and the servants and the servants and Khalaud.
Mom, this isn't good. Kholoud is with the maid 24 hours a day and doesn't want anyone else.
Exit. I want to rest, I want to sleep. How?
Oh God, Saud, your brother Khalid has become a girl.
Wait a minute, I haven't told my father about you yet.
I'll tell you something, what do I have with Khulood?
Saud says that Khalid wears makeup and spends money like girls. What does he want? What does he want?
Oh God, Oh God, Oh God! Yes! Saud.
Khalid is putting makeup on his face! It's just a little bit of makeup. A child saw a makeup palette and played with it.
I saw a very small dot, and it's not even visible clearly.
He is kind, sweet, and gentle.
Angrily from Saud.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
Once before, I asked you, Saad, what do you want to be when you grow up? You didn't tell me then. Now, tell me, when you grow up, what do you want to be?
And you, my dear Hlodvík, my beloved Sa'd, will become a desk, and what do you want to become?
This year we're going to London like last year.
Yes, contact the complainant in Bahrain.
Tell him to bring Susan, Khadija, and Fahda.
And say hello to Samoura.
I seek forgiveness from Allah.
Today, my father told me to choose.
Do you want me to build on the land overlooking the sea or the nearby land?
I said he doesn't let me choose.
I can live with you, my love, anywhere.
Thank you, my sweet.
And you taught me how to fish?
Wow! Oh my! Workers, I want to open my eyes and be told that you graduated from university.
It seems that this is a perfume for men.
I don't know, but it has a very strange smell.
Oh God, what do I have?
Your way of speaking has become girly.
I forgot you were a man.
I hope you talk to people like that outside, too?
I can't see it, Khalid.
Please leave my room!
Alas, Khalid!
You distracted me.
Tell me, don't hurt my feelings, I swear I'll tell my mom.
This is my son, and I know him well.
Oh, my sweet darling! Khadija, I hope every child has your tenderness and feelings.
And when you see someone gentle and calm, you say he's gay.
Shame on you, it's wrong to say such things about your brother.
Stop, you've made curiosity a job.
Oh, sweetie, he's wearing a very sweet perfume now. What's the difference between men's perfume and women's perfume?
Here I'm telling you, don't say this in front of your father.
I have it.
I'll show it to you, but keep quiet, so Mohammed doesn't find out.
How do these girls meet?
He wouldn't let his daughter do that!
Don't look at it, don't look at it!
He's afraid that he's living for something that has nothing to do with him.
Give yourself a break.
I know you see the Bluetooth that's very prevalent nowadays.
I'm patient with Saad, he'll come.
How are you, Saad?
May God protect you.
We were waiting for you, we didn't play cards.
What, why?
Do you want something to drink?
See him sleeping here in your apartment for two days!
Because of the Bluetooth story.
Yes, his older brother devoured him.
He's afraid of it.
Don't try it, I told you not to try it.
"Seek refuge from Satan, my child, for my sake!"
I have booked.
Dragging. How do I face people? I can't!
And why is your father angry?
Say, "If it were from Him, then seek help against Him."
Oh, these kids, they always cause trouble.
This is the end, Mama.
In my heart, when Khalid was small
Certainly, this will be the result.
Enough, please leave.
The right always hurts.
The jar broke.
It's impossible for me to live in Doha.
I can't face people.
My mobile is off for a while.
And you want to gather me, workers?
You are a girl and you spend your whole day at home.
I don't say when I'm a man who walks every day and meets people outside.
Tough, workers.
I can't live without my age, my day, and my head always down.
Dad feels that there's something wrong in the house and there's a change.
How often is my father absent from the events that happen here at home?
Sometimes I call my dad, and sometimes I don't.
I am proud of him, O workers, when I remember his commitments and his attention to his work, so that we can live with dignity among people.
And I am kissing him.
The father left the house, and the responsibility of the children fell on the mother.
We want to bring the past out now.
Does your father know or not?
But I want
Put the Bluetooth in it.
Just give it to him.
I don't want to see the shock in my father's eyes.
I'll be devastated.
Hey, Amal
He knows how to trick us.
I'd rather know a lot less than know from someone else.
How sad that our house has come to this.
Because a dirty bomb named Khaled had exploded in it.
Traditions and customs.
They will want it.
They closed their ears to him.
And they don't see him.
They only hear one voice.
What is this filth and strangeness?
They're squeezing all the good out of it.
What's on your mind?
You suddenly decided to study abroad.
We can only say, but God helps you, my son.
May God help you.
Those who are coming from the trip are bringing the gift, not those who want to travel.
You're right.
As a rule.
Every rule has an exception.
Come over here quickly, Amal.
What did they see of your daughter?
I don't hear anything.
Abu Saad!
Abu Saad.
Abu Saad, what's wrong with you?
Oh daddy, what do you have, daddy?
Father!
Don't worry.
You are a great person.
Any man would want to marry you.
You're divorcing yourself from something wrong within you.
I divorce you.
It's not possible.
I'm accepted everywhere.
What is your brother's sexual orientation?
Welcome, Saleh.
You're here every day.
I've never been here before.
I was hiding underground.
That was before when we were in the concrete.
These are very strong words, can you handle words like these?
You make a thousand and two hundred, you make a lot of money!
Say "Mashallah."
Shift, shift.
You came seven months ago, stop complaining and take me home.
How embarrassing and shameful! Every time he takes me to someone's house, he asks their driver, "How much do they pay you?" No one will be happy, and today he asked for a raise.
The driver is laughing at you.
He came less than seven months ago.
Hush, my child, hush.
Let's finish it off.
Return it and bring me another one!
Tell your children what they don't know, what it costs in time and money!
Leadership training. Send him to the back and get rid of him!
The first time I came here to my house was six months ago.
In my opinion, delete this code and add this one.
Petroleum is now $114, before it was worth half a riyal, perhaps five riyals. Everything is expensive, boss.
Open your mind and listen to what I want to say!
What was the salary I gave you when you came here for the first time?
You promised me seven hundred.
You're still new, very new. You've only been here for six months and this eight-hundred salary is very big.
I need money.
The hallucinogens I'm talking about are the heavy-hitters, you're new to this.
These seventy are now eighty.
Go!
He told you he would give you an extra hundred riyals only.
And there's no point with three hundred.
What I told you is true?
No, no screen. I'll be in trouble if I escape.
No, I'm afraid of screens.
He who fled from his shepherd.
Why are you afraid?
Because they have been herding these people before.
Give them a salary of six hundred to seven hundred. Do you know how much they're getting?
How much do you charge?
Therefore, why are you afraid?
I'm not afraid.
God is sufficient for her.
I woke up Nassir and told him to go see it.
No one was there.
He even stole the phone I bought for him.
What did you do?
What have I done!
They did everything they wanted to do. They took his passport and kept it with them.
You may go, sir, you are excused.
We'll miss him everywhere.
That's your problem, that's your problem.
And after all that, they ran away.
They caused us problems and imposed harm on us.
I told you to return it.
What do you think I'm going to try about him?
I will find it no matter what.
The wind is coming back, meaning the wind is coming back.
For me, I'd rather pay his ticket and send him back to his country instead of letting him stay here and make money.
You're his, you want to save him.
A man just came in, no one will buy now.
At the beginning of the game, you seemed nervous, as I noticed.
But what are we afraid of? We were afraid that our team wouldn't score goals.
We want more than three, we want ten, twelve, fifteen.
You treated me before the game that you were afraid, you were afraid of the opposing team.
I'm not afraid of the opposing team, I'm afraid of our own team. I'm afraid they won't be able to score more than three.
This is the level of our team, you know. I'm talking about the level of our team.
That's a great faith from you.
The vegetables don't have anything.
Exciting! The Lilac team has just scored a goal, you are leading with the first goal.
Where are you going?
I go home.
Do you have a car?
Come with me, I'll need you.
Thanks, man.
When you try, you can't beat our team!
Huzrati, the match has just started and the league has just begun.
Did you hear what he said?
He said, "It's a big problem."
Mahmoud, bring the tea!
Now my friend is coming to pick me up for the stadium, quickly.
Take it, my friend Sajid.
Here you go, boss.
What did he do to himself?
Yes, he is the Indian father.
Yes, man, he's a football fanatic.
What you say about my team Foxes.
They're winning, they're winning.
Let's go, Sajid, let's go. Hurry up, the match is about to start. Bring a bottle of water, the Foxes are playing today.
Beloved viewers, we have with us one of the most famous fans of the Foxes Club, named Tha'loob.
They want to tell you that you broke them because they were already fragile.
What they say is not true.
What won't be incomplete? Each team has twelve players.
If it's not one or two, it doesn't make any difference.
These two are as sensible as adults.
This is the best fan we have.
Masha'Allah, on the occasion of the victory, O Tha'lab, a final word you want to say to the foxes.
All words stop.
What's the fox called?
Her name is high in the sky.
This is the good van.
Listen to me, brother.
You might find him that enthusiastic.
Here we go, sweetheart.
Wow, is he an Indian who loves football?
Has anyone seen him lately?
Dude! He's a big star now, he doesn't come here.
I saw the man just a few days ago and didn't recognize him. He was sitting in a cafe in Villaggio, I think it's called Starbucks or something similar.
I remember this boy, he came and sat with us in the café and he didn't have money for a cup of tea.
He gave the boy a twenty riyal bonus in front of me.
What made him like this?
Hey! [Man], he's sitting with the club's top officials, they're helping him and doing everything he wants.
"Even a word, O Fox?"
Yes, Uncle.
My uncle says: Whether you go or come,
What a wonder, he still supports such a weak club.
These are the Foxes, this team is my heart.
Why does my heart ache?
You can catch a lot of foxes in it.
I did not hear the poem, Your Honor, that was written about the judge.
We didn't have a match with them.
Please, please Mr. Fox, read, read this poem, read, read.
Uncle. Oh God, who knows my secret.
My spirit is very weary.
Why don't I sleep a night.
You know I'm the president of the fan club.
You can't tell me the winner's name so I can have a scoop.
We will hold a press conference, and God willing, we will announce the winner's name.
"The one who spends"
The famous Tholoud, this fan whom the Foxes' management honored today in a generous, rare, and stunning gesture.
Really!
Congratulations, Thaloob, on this beautiful honor. It's a wonderful gift, of course.
Are you going to make it a pen or a watch?
Tell it to me, Papa, swear to it.
This is a movement.
You're saying that's him.
We have to tell the police.
Where are you going?
All the girls, all the girls, all the girls.
No, no, no! Oh, my son, this isn't him, it's his lookalike.
I'm telling you, that's not him.
I was late.
I don't know the game times, brother.
How can we approach him?
We're just waiting for the Foxes to play their next match.
Here he is, here he is, you saw him.
Sweet, let's follow him now.
Brother, you're late.
Here he is, here he is, here he is, here he is.
Follow him, follow him, follow him, follow him.
The problem is that we don't know if it is him or not.
He's telling you, Daddy, it's him.
I speak the truth, and wisdom is what we seek and ask for by saying to the driver you have, "Where are you coming from? How did you come? When did you come?"
Dad, you always make things complicated.
We talk about him, I'm sure of it.
Earth, may God protect it. Yes, it is mine.
Yes, it's registered under my name, yes.
And the other land next to it.
Tell your father that Abu Abdurrahman al-Subji sends his regards. Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
No, no, God bless you, but I think we're mistaken, son. We came to a friend and thought you were him.
God is Majestic, He creates many people who resemble each other.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, Your Honor, thank you.
No, no, God bless you. Sorry, sorry, and thank you, thank you.
In the name of God, with your permission. I'm sorry, I'm here to help you. In the name of God, the Most Blessed, the Most High.
And you say you're sure!
I don't know what your father will do! I'm very scared.
What have you done, Waleed?
When, when, when, I, I'm going, I want the bag she put it in.
And try to solve the problem now!
Go to your room, go.
I hope nothing bad happens.
I hope nothing bad happens.
Now, try explaining this to your father!
Before my father knew?
It was broken into a million pieces.
Sweet mama, let's go buy something like that please, quickly.
Before my father comes.
Please, Mama.
You know Dad, when he gets angry, he goes crazy.
He went to your room and didn't come out.
He didn't do anything.
He carelessly hit the vase with his elbow and it fell and broke.
Mom, I'm worried about him.
I don't know where he is.
No, no, no, no, his parents are crazy.
Why are you doing this to the boy?
You hurried him and scared him, do you want the boy to go crazy?
Do I say something, girl?
Why is the boy crying?
Sweet, if you're coming, bring it.
I hope nothing bad happens.
My aunt knows where Walid is.
Learn with me, that's the way.
Let's go. Come on.
Here he is.
Please, grandma, I don't want to go home.
I'm hiding from you.
I didn't see the vase.
I swear I don't know.
That's how your father scares you, may God guide him.
Learn with me, my son!
Don't be happy, my son, as long as you are in the house. Don't be afraid, my son.
I have the solution.
We didn't say anything, Abu Walid.
My friend, I've sold you out, Abu Waleed.
This time, I'll forgive him for your sake.
What's surprising about the house?
Who are you? Where are you from?
Who are you? Who?
Oh, my son, don't worry, your father won't do anything to you.
Are you sure, Dad?
Oh, my son, oh.
Are you going to leave it here? I'm afraid one of the kids might hit it and break it.
He asked me and told me, "I want you to bring me one like the one you brought to the one who broke it."
That one is exactly the same. I'm coming and I really mean this one, the last one in the store. He's going to be very lucky. Where are the kids?
In the room, there's a desk.
Sweet, take care of him.
I'll leave this game and lock up.
Wow
Sweet, then lessons!
Dad, this is all I want, and then we'll study.
It's necessary, dad, don't tell uncle.
Dad, don't tell your brother. Dad, this is the last time, I swear.
I'll call him.
And you in particular. You insulted me, am I your friend at the café?
I'll tell my brother about you if you don't watch out!
Masha'Allah, I won't call. The phone is in my pocket, so it will be fine even if I don't check it.
My daughter, why don't you take him to a doctor?
May God guide you, Mama.
He's scaring me to death because he hits all the time.
How cute this boy is.
Patience
Mom, where's Amoula? Doesn't she see you today?
And she goes with her.
My sister doesn't care about abayas.
Hey! Hey! Girl, haven't I told you the story of Monira with her sons Naif?
His son is the same age as Waleed, may God have mercy on him.
And the same height.
She insisted on telling me that she didn't know what she was doing when she gave birth to him.
She wants to take him to the hospital, but her husband Youssef
I learned about the story yesterday.
He tried to overtake her and was gaining on her.
He says, "Why didn't you tell me?"
This is a psychological condition.
This is against the boy's will.
He must take his son and tie him to the middle of the yard.
And then he tells him to do it again and kiss in your bed.
It's all just a storm in a teacup.
What did you say, Umm Munira?
She had everything, everything.
Delicious and tasty.
Alas my state.
Mama, Mama.
I'm still grateful your father didn't find out about you.
"Sincerely, he will kill you."
Sweet, go to the bathroom and take a shower before your father wakes up and messes it up for you.
What goes into my eyes doesn't come out of my mouth.
They are sad.
They are laughing and joking.
I'm afraid something bad is happening to my children.
I need to take them to their uncle so he can punish them.
I'm angry.
They didn't fail, they passed.
Why are you taking them to their uncle?
Nasser got forty-eight out of fifty.
Why don't they get fifty out of fifty?
This spot fooled them.
Frankly, I agree with his opinion.
Forgot about feelings.
And my brother must punish them.
Okay, little by little.
This is the last time, this is the last time.
Fifty out of fifty.
Wasting our time and confirming to them that he is our son.
When do you get fifty out of fifty?
I said, "No, no, no," but you weren't listening.
You don't listen to me when I speak.
Oh, you shameless boy!
They hit him again, so I asked to punish him.
Oh my God! That's enough, Uncle.
Next time, study very hard, study!
Sweet, enough.
Do you know what I'm doing?
I'll let you jump one after the other and you will be a falafel.
Know that going out with your family in public places.
He left us alone.
Professor, your excellency.
Why are you crying?
This is an excellent grade.
It upsets me that you're crying.
You are delightful.
Oh my son, everyone has left, even the buses have departed. You're waiting for someone to pick you up.
At the school entrance means he is waiting for the bus. The bus arrived and the children got off.
Did you hear about the boy who committed suicide today?
They gave him a certificate.
And his father threatened him if he didn't get full marks.
Father, father. Come back, father, come back.
Hello and welcome, join us in a new episode of our program "Without Borders"
Oil accounts for more than thirty-five percent of the total diverse energy sources.
The rest goes to natural gas, charcoal, and hydroelectric power.
Therefore, oil is considered the primary source of energy in the world.
The Gulf countries and Iran together have six hundred and eighty-eight billion barrels.
Iran follows with twelve percent, then Iraq with ten percent, and Kuwait and the UAE with nine percent.
Each of them will then come to Venezuela with a seven percent increase.
Then Russia by five percent.
The Gulf countries and Iran account for two-thirds of the world's reserves.
An unprecedented price and surpassing one hundred and nine dollars for the first time in history.
In this episode, we are trying to understand many of the complexities surrounding oil.
And the problems facing oil-exporting countries.
In detail, the rise in prices.
And also the problems faced by citizens and residents in these countries.
Due to inflation and unprecedented rise.
What will be displayed on the screen next, or perhaps they will write to us through our website "www.Aljazeera.net".
Because today the market is the main factor.
And not the producing countries either.
One day, the price is determined by market forces.
What OPEC doesn't do.
Certainly, supply and demand play a role for sure.
But the other factors are
Other reasons are political tensions.
In this world
Real estate markets
and stock exchanges and so on
And moved on to prices in the estimation
"Commodities" like oil, for example
Next week, I'll receive $1000, God willing.
In 2004, oil jumped from $40.44 to $44.
And today we see even the prices of gasoline.
It changes from day to day.
The price of oil fell below ninety-nine dollars.
And it increased in the second quarter.
Especially with the arrival of spring and secondly because most of the world's filters are under maintenance.
I always, ,, for the second quarter
Seasonal demand for oil is declining.
In winter, the temperature is below ninety.
And all this indicates that this guess wants to control the market now.
It's changed a lot since we used to go to the traditional market in the past.
The market was under the influence of supply and demand.
Seasonal demand and supply
Today, we see that economic growth
Today or yesterday, General Fallon, the commander of the Central Region in Afghanistan and Iran, resigned.
And his resignation sparked a major reaction due to its connection to what is called the expected American war.
Political or geopolitical effects
It could impact the oil market in a negative or positive way rapidly.
The impact is inevitable and will have its effect.
Even children respond to political effects.
That's how he confirms, he'll say, some will tell you that America's war on Iran is coming.
What's happening to the market? The market will be optimistic in a way.
This question, Mr. Vice President, now in light of what the White House is saying.
And this created an atmosphere of tension in the region.
This is the mystery.
But Floon might see this scenario.
He has a quick mind in the oil market.
Today, we prove with numbers that there is no shortage.
To give you an example: In the past seven weeks
In the United States, their oil reserves have increased for more than half of the last five years.
In today's sense, not in the sense of...
"We are at war, and our destiny is being decided abroad, in places where we don't even speak the language."
Even today's global consumption, you can choose any country and find long queues in front of gas stations.
This is also something else.
What are the risks posed by this problem?
What number do you expect? I don't know.
Two hundred or perhaps three hundred dollars might be less.
It would be disastrous if these tensions turned into real conflicts.
Because you also didn't say that the Gulf is represented by sixty percent.
A country that is far from oil-producing nations.
You'll see how the effect will be reversed on the oil market.
And it can reach three hundred dollars.
And moved from stocks and other to the oil market. Today you will see more than two or one trillion dollars.
Today we see the nature.
Speculating more than a hundred days a year means...
What's this tension in the region and you're waiting for?
April, as has been said before, will be the month to end this war.
God knows what I did, meaning my actions.
In the area now.
This year is the election year.
And the current American administration has only a few months left.
George H. W. Bush launched a war on Somalia and sent thirty thousand Canadians in his final days in the White House.
We see but do not expect events.
But I don't think that happens.
Because this scenario is very expensive.
America won't give in, it's you who will give in to Iran and the consumer countries.
America Today
Now they are drilling for oil in Africa and have many alternatives.
See, there's nothing, let's talk clearly.
In your introduction, you said that sixty percent
From oil reserves
But now they're making promises, promises...
I am from West Africa.
I'm from West Africa and anything they export from any other region in the world.
Petroleum production
Because this is a constant number and a fixed stock.
Deepwater or deep-sea production of water
Therefore, the Gulf will remain a tough number.
And the Caspian Sea oil.
And I considered them dreams because they are neither truth nor reality.
They spoil it and ruin it.
The important thing is, I mean, myself.
Today, Qatar is the world's largest energy exporter.
Liquid (LNG) so these countries are considered a tough number.
And our country's energy needs
Certainly means there's something called secure provisioning.
And despite internal objections within the United States, even at the level of General Fallon
But there are still some concerns.
President Bush's grapes are sour.
Try to see how political risks don't come from the Gulf states.
"No, no, no, it's not about generosity, because none of us are walking with Karam."
There's no dealing with too much generosity.
Not "in the current field"
We are involved in charity work.
Or be generous instead.
For the people of the west, but not for others.
Accurate with America
"Fine, the market" (Note:
When we come for material gain, we leave.
We won't leave him.
Just as oil and gas.
You'll be for kindness.
I have the proof.
I have the proof.
More than sixty to seventy dollars.
Walking against the price hike
But it's the collapse of the American dollar that you insist on.
You, first as a Gulf nation and a member of OPEC,
Those exports must be in dollars and you refuse.
Change the currency even though the currency collapsed consequently.
Until the return isn't in your favor.
What you said isn't 70.
And this is the talk of experts, not mine.
Praise be to God, the dollar has dropped by thirty percent and oil has risen by more than this decrease.
That means if we take the base year as 2004
We see that oil prices are fluctuating between $35 and $36.
Certainly means
The price of oil has increased.
But this is just a small increase, esteemed member.
It seems we have to take it.
We consider it now.
Until further notice
In other words, if we compare it to the year 2004
Even exceeding the rate of decline of the US dollar.
Arousal
React to the dollar's depreciation.
Whenever the dollar drops, oil prices rise.
A wise person in the market is better than a hundred foolish ones.
Our interests now are reduction.
The situation still hasn't changed, maybe at the beginning of the discount two years ago they were saying this is the limit, but the situation has changed now.
And the dollar began to lose value against other major currencies like the euro and the pound sterling.
Understood, the question is why peg your currency to the dollar?
Weak currency and no cover for it.
This is a historic age.
Petroleum and its derivatives are priced in dollars, even for European production in the North Sea, Russia, and Norway.
It is said that America in the mid-seventies
I removed the gold cover that was covering the American dollar.
This is not correct.
Certainly, tell me what is correct.
The organization that includes OPEC
Four Gulf states
Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
Today, OPEC's share of the global market
Forty percent
Today, if we say that the world consumes fifty million barrels
The entity that deals with the dollar in oil pricing.
If you put the price with another currency, everyone will understand.
You can't.
All oil-producing countries need to agree.
You, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries, are a star.
Those who own 66% of the world's reserves are the big people.
Bookings, but I consider them exports.
Includes Venezuela, Libya, and Iran
Cameron, Angola, and all the countries organized under OPEC
Market participation will not exceed forty percent.
A non-OPEC manufacturer and exporter
And that doesn't align with the forty percent.
What can't she do alone?
They will have healed by then.
Not a genuine attempt
It's you who refuses because of American ties.
From dollar to another currency
All oil-producing countries
He used to export only one barrel.
It's a loss if they import it.
And his column rose high.
And sell its oil in dollars.
The input or receiver receives it, then takes his money in dollars, then converts it to his local currency.
Your currency is not pegged to the dollar.
True, but he...
But it's also your problem; you sell in dollars, but if your currency isn't tied to the dollar, then you have no problem.
My main question now is
What are the concerns and implications of pegging your currency to the dollar in light of the dollar's depreciation?
He was engaged a few years ago.
Especially in the 1970s when the dollar was strong and had great power.
This extraction is not that easy.
Divorce is easy.
What's not here?
Divorce has expenses.
Dale made efforts to ensure the country's prosperity and no longer caused it harm.
Profit and loss
Dow Jones announced yesterday that there are 4 countries, including Qatar.
but there is also a report for the Gulf finance saying that there are four Gulf countries of course because Oman left the united Gulf currency
I read a statement in the Dow Jones, and I don't think it's a genuine statement.
The Governor of the Qatar Central Bank has been ousted.
He said yes and that there is a study, but all Gulf countries must be involved.
Profit and loss must be carefully verified, away from emotions.
Leave the topic for testing until they come.
See, I'll bring you other economists who can come with another study.
The opposite of this study
Global house prices saw their steepest rise in 16 years, driven by low interest rates and a surge in demand as people sought more space during the pandemic, according to a report on March 8th.
Just four days ago
The global house is the simple solution and needs a non-political decision.
The political decision can be summarized in two things.
mash that, shoe first
Her statement, or the five with Kuwait, regarding her intention in 2010 to issue currency or study the issuance of a unified Gulf currency.
The second point is to issue a decision to delink from the dollar.
The First Affair of the Unified Currency
From my personal perspective
To see the unified Gulf currency
This currency will be strong.
Will be
It's probably one of the strongest currencies in the world, as you said.
And we'll dip into the reserves and the big profits.
So that's what the Prime Minister emphasized when he said...
Gulf countries because no single nation can do that alone.
Unless it has strong economic content
We are seeing economic growth even up to the euro today.
Of course, it's indispensable to mention the significant role of the Central Bank.
In assessment
And the profit and loss account.
From all these news
Moderate condition
2008, as observers said, the global economy stated that this inflation would continue.
For a long period in the Gulf countries, but the solution lies in the hands of the governments.
Some countries increased salaries by seventy percent, such as the United Arab Emirates.
To stop the inflation process
And this is my question now: When will the salaries of these poor people be raised?
I'll hear your answer after a short commercial break.
Today's focus: Petroleum reserves and daily production of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Saudi Arabia.
It has reserves of over 142 billion.
And two out of every ten barrels.
Producing nine out of ten daily.
Melin and Kuwait have one hundred and fifty million and produce one billion and produce another seven-tenths of a million.
Qatar has fifteen billion and twelve million people and produces eight hundred and fifty thousand barrels of oil per day. Oman has five and six-tenths billion people and produces seven hundred and seven thousand barrels of oil per day.
Bahrain has a population of 1.525 million and a birth rate of 35,000.
The total annual revenue was thirty-eight billion.
From 2003 to 2007
Europe one hundred billion
Sixty billion in the Middle East and forty billion.
Asia and other countries
The GDP of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries in 2006 was $717 billion.
The fifth in two thousand seven is seven hundred ninety-nine and seven tenths billion expected.
In the year two thousand and eight hundred and twelve, one in every ten billion.
One of the inflammations that keeps swallowing the salaries of employees and people working in this area.
But it increased in 2008 to 3.8 out of 10.
Kuwait is fourteen percent, but in 2008 it is expected to be eight and nine tenths of the UAE.
It will be ten while Saudi Arabia will be six and a half and will rise to six.
And eight out of ten
Wages are being eaten away.
And so, what amounts and percentages will you give to the poor here?
If we want to solve the problem
Real solution
Always salaries, always salary increases.
What is the solution?
I don't have a problem with raising salaries.
No one is right, me, no one is right.
We are always
It's in my nature to know.
The state of increase, increase without control of inflation will make inflation eat up all this increase.
To tackle inflation, a high-level committee including all experts and specialists is required.
And today, this committee is establishing
Because salary increases in the world
And of course, the golden rule of economics says:
This won't let it end.
And it doesn't matter how much.
A lot of salary increases and whatever the increase is.
Inflation is rising.
The solution is necessary and must be found.
In a scientific study, Bayt.com, a specialized employment institute, conducted a study in collaboration with the British company YouGov Siraj.
They surveyed the salaries of fifteen thousand employees in the Gulf countries across twenty key sectors.
Especially among experts and professionals, there is dissatisfaction with work.
Because inflation here has started to devour.
Especially those with experience.
They are transferring from those countries where inflation is eating them up.
Now you will lose.
Use the correct password and when you enter the correct password, you can proceed to use it.
The solution to inflation is to increase salaries.
The scale is over there.
Heka
We are living in anxiety and the state is living in anxiety, and we are doing the best we can.
To solve this problem with a real solution.
Temporary solutions never solve the problem, they only make it worse.
Increased
We hope we have a lot of time so that this committee doesn't come.
All applications
This boredom and you, Your Excellency.
Nations will always exist.
Mine, but the state is greedy and added a quarter to it.
There is an important point here regarding the topic of increase.
Due to the increase, you want Qataris as if non-Qataris working for Burkina Faso and Zimbabwe.
Consider Qataris but do not consider non-residents.
The highest ratio in it
You are Ahmed living in Qatar, not Germany.
And everyone talks about it and suffers.
Of course, salaries are much higher in the private sector than in the public sector.
And generally, Reina
In the public sector
And on the contrary, the government sector is becoming more and more corrupt.
Because the best units and skills have started.
I've read the report again and again, and we know we're in the oil field.
From work
Like our experts
Engineers and workers who came from outside Qatar
Because we also deal with the global market.
Look at all these things, what's the raise in salaries?
Hopes are with Allah the Most High, but we say...
The government has a plan.
And they say that controlling separation is more important.
Temporary solution
I'll see and I'm sure.
Let it be.
Positive results
It will be on the verge of fifteen percent.
Congratulations on the second report. It states that 22 billion barrels of oil and 43 billion cubic meters of gas will be allocated to you.
No comment, it has nothing to do with spraying.
Action, and certainly we
But the talk about economic growth must also reflect on people.
And we accompany any economic growth today, Qatar has the highest economic growth in the world.
And vice versa
The "conversos" were also a part of the country.
And if it weren't for these large "regions" and big projects
This won't be part of the inflation either.
Some inflationary result
This also led to large amounts of money in the market.
First, regarding the link between the dollar and oil.
I oiled it for protection.
I am from the United States of America, thus stability in power.
Thank you.
Saad al-Ghamdi from Saudi Arabia, your question Saad.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Truly, a good ring and a good name.
What I really want to talk about is that the region is now under American policies.
American policy in its current war, in addition to the cultural war it is trying to incite against Islam, there is a global economic war.
Now in China
And America's non-oil imports from Japan reached sixty billion dollars.
And Japan wants to invest in 2000.
With America to the equivalent of nine.
Billion while he now invests with the European Union at around twenty-seven billion dollars
To maintain America's policy and make the dollar an unavoidable currency throughout the world.
My brother, say buy now.
And the Gulf region will be
As a center
Thank you, brother Saad.
Mohamed El-Wasea from Egypt
Hello to His Excellency the Agent with you.
The Arab princes in the Middle East, Your Excellency, remind me of the feudal lords of old.
What you get
There will be requests to adjust prices.
Adjusting salaries against prices as you said, Your Excellency.
In Qatar, we used to consider you as a prototype.
And he continued not to promise an increase. This is the Arab style.
We want, we consider Qatar as Abu Dhabi.
He has the right to say what he wants. If you have a question, of course it's his right; he is responsible for this policy.
The question first
The owner of majesty must take into consideration.
This is one second that he needs to respond to public opinion.
With the poor, as I said, because they are people from countries that need special care.
Arab princes who don't care about the poor.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you
Good evening to you and good evening to His Highness.
I want to increase my violin playing.
Excellent and beautiful wages, that's good.
Thank you very much for the topic you need and that makes us sick.
I am with the poor and I will be with them, God willing, and we know that there are no poor people in Qatar, and we are certain.
The ruling is that Qatar, as stated, sends money to the ruling family and the governors.
And that's the important question now.
Let's first reply to the brothers.
You can't spend it.
What leads to wealth?
Now there are new cities that are almost like Pearl, Lusail, and another place, meaning even Qatar is expanding.
This is how it is and how it will be.
Suitable civil plan
In short, because we still have two minutes, we said what is Qatar going to go for it.
Qatar now, there is a post-oil and gas Qatar.
A clear advantage for the state.
Because she
Non-renewable resource
Because it is a non-renewable resource.
Therefore, today's trend in the State of Qatar.
The capital of the Middle East in education
Today we see the City of Education.
Today, this educational city includes the best colleges in the world.
Building medical cities, media cities, and financial cities
Because today is oil and gas.
What is wonderful is not imitating others.
Other satellite channels
No one touches the island, it will become a hundred islands, and of course, we won't support the island.
Because my brothers are from these countries, the Gulf countries, now.
In the seventies, the change is now everyone remembers the change in the seventies.
Now let's see what growth Qatar has.
I'd like this to mean that we want a special episode about Qatar after oil.
In our discussion about oil, its future and resources in the region, especially in Qatar. In conclusion, my greetings to the program team.
I am Ahmed Mansour, and I send you my greetings without boundaries.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Warm greetings this week from the capital of Qatar, Doha.
And welcome to a new episode of our program "Without Borders"
At the same time, Qatar hosts the largest U.S. military base outside the United States, Al Udeid Air Base.
With enemies of the United States in the region
Like Iran and Syria
Its door is open to leaders.
In fact, Hamas leaders have special relations with the Qatari leadership.
The Emir of Qatar was also the only Arab leader
Who visited the southern suburbs of Beirut that were destroyed by Israel during the Lebanon War in the summer of 2006?
And we continue to provide unlimited support to restore what Israel destroyed in Lebanon.
And at the time when Qatar united,
With his older sister in Saudi Arabia a couple of years ago.
At the same time, clashes with the regime in Egypt.
Like the Lebanon file that I succeeded in when others failed.
To gather the Lebanese leaders in Doha where they signed an agreement that led them to safety.
To the final elections
Difficult files as well
This care is the engine of the files, not the train.
The small Arab state
And in today's episode
We are trying to understand the foundation and principles upon which Qatari foreign policy was built.
And what is its benefit?
Qatar, the smallest country geographically and in population, plays these big roles.
And what certificates make it that easy for him?
That will be in a direct dialogue with the Prime Minister of Qatar and the Foreign Minister.
For those in the audience who wish to participate, you can contact us through the program's numbers, which will appear on the screen shortly.
The visit made by the Emir of Qatar.
Shouting through Al Jazeera in defense of improving relations with Saudi Arabia.
From the past like Saudi Arabia's attempt to control the government of Qatar with the help of the Al Murrah tribe.
In its edition published on June 20th last.
What is the nature of the confidential treatment?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Many things that are not
What I want is what's right.
In many of these interviews in this program, I always say that flour is...
And we consider it the backbone.
I am from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
There was a misunderstanding.
Clear, the
Different opinions
Indeed, the issue of borders was created and became a major obstacle.
The historical relations between Saudi Arabia and Qatar were special.
These are straps if we align them.
Between the two countries and between the two families.
Saboteur of misunderstanding
Neither them nor us.
There are no conditions between brothers.
And now the relations are in a state that I can say is very excellent.
In the interest of the Cooperation Council
But how was the situation between the island and Saudi Arabia improving while the island was the obstacle and the reason that led in the year two thousand and two?
There's an important point.
And I repeat it, if I go back to all the programs, I was always saying it.
She is just the elder sister, but I was saying that my reliance is in the Cooperation Council.
Saudi Arabia is an important country in the region.
And we value our relationship with her.
There was some hot and live media coverage, and that was clear to both parties.
These are countries that you visit.
Moving successfully when the brothers agreed.
Especially the Saudi-Qatari house.
But rather, they found themselves in a conflict.
"Wherever there are sentences"
And I don't think this is a strategy of anyone who was in this conflict.
No, I'm sorry, sir. I'm allowed to answer within the framework or put points on the letters.
Many observers find that the island has changed significantly in the past few years.
A period in which positions that were criticized on Al Jazeera's screen.
I see what's coming into Saudi Arabia.
Either the people who were arrested, or the opponents, or others are still standing.
The island stopped dealing with these issues.
Al Jazeera's coverage of the Hajj
Praise be to Allah for what the Servant of the Two Holy Mosques is doing at this difficult time.
First, you should ask the island management about the matter, don't ask me because
It includes both countries.
For the stability of the region
This strategy continued, leading to increased stability in the region.
The area you're referring to is the Gulf region.
Gulf Region
There's nothing new happening in the Gulf region at this time.
And also the invitation of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques in Kuwait.
He had an impact on all listeners and the entire Arab world.
He spoke from the heart about resolving, overcoming, and burying Arab disputes.
There are no opinions, only perspectives.
No, it's present in policies and policies are opinions.
In the Arab world, it is considered
Type War
In the developed world
Looking for the same hobby.
Now you've stayed for many years.
The situation now
Listen first.
There's no difference between this topic and the other one.
The idea of a small country challenging the big nations and making them feel weak.
Every difference or misunderstanding.
She had her reasons.
And scold them sharply.
Due to the wisdom of our leaders.
Will there be any insurance for future relationships?
There are no guarantees between two parties.
Based on the love, brotherhood, and mutual interests that unite the two countries.
And the leaders, their words are considered more than a document.
Between Qatar and Saudi Arabia to develop this relationship.
And we hope for a lot of this Saudi-Qatari relationship to develop.
The best and most productive fields
The relationship is like the one we have with other Arab countries, the Gulf countries.
Qatar is an important country.
Masha'Allah, Saudi Arabia is an important country.
What is Egypt to Qatar? Because what is bad is that at the same time you reached an agreement with Saudi Arabia.
And three organizations, namely Hezbollah.
can anyone reach the island
For or against the regime in Egypt, the largest Arab country.
Start with this first.
Egyptian people
And we respected the Egyptian people.
And its benefit
on many Arab issues and the sacrifices of the Egyptian people
One of the two cases
Your life, no one will think that through this issue we are trying to reach an understanding with the brothers in Egypt.
Insight into what you say about respecting Egypt and the Egyptian people.
And we believe he is a good person.
Our difference with Egypt lies in two points.
Or a single point.
They accused us of planning to overthrow Gaza, and I don't think...
And we don't interfere.
Cases specific to other countries
I'm not with interfering in the affairs of any state unless there is room for reform.
Does that mean you saw the coup Hamas carried out against the authority in Gaza?
Of course, I'm not refusing. We actually knew more about this than others did, from the media.
We have relations with Hamas, and we have relations with others.
What made Egypt different or is there a disagreement between you on this point?
I will come to this.
Hezbollah is a conspiracy.
Hezbollah and
But I'm talking about my country.
We've seen a lot of this before.
Joke for Qatar
What did the doves say?
The pyramids said
An attack on Egypt and its occupation.
See if you can respond
Let's go back to the details they mentioned about the plot.
Diary entries will reveal this.
The beginning wasn't from the Gaza conference.
And I am innocent of the Egyptian people and President Hosni Mubarak is innocent of me.
If we go back in time to the symposium at Al-Mina.
After the Madrid conference, do you remember the port that was in Doha?
And it was a coincidence that the conference was going to be held with us.
They said they don't like to hold conferences.
People, you know you're coordinating with Israel.
Friendly matches Qatar and Omani
We're trying to understand why.
We sat and talked, and talking is always nice.
I have two parts.
What are they?
Disagree
In political orientation
If we look at the conference held in the hotel...
His Highness the Prince spoke with all the presidents, including his brother President Hosni Mubarak.
And tell us a foreign country.
The brothers in Egypt have an opinion on the matter that what should be done.
And people are being killed, and we're watching.
If you don't want to do it in Doha, we can do it anywhere in the Arab countries.
"We swear when we discuss the situation in your conference." Note: The original sentence is not grammatically correct in Arabic, so the translation might not be accurate. It seems like the speaker is using a strong language (swearing) while discussing a situation in "your conference".
In Israel and the Western world, they are standing and watching what is happening.
We all said at this time it's normal and there is no power except God, we as Arabs can't stop it, no major country has stood up to this war.
Egypt requested a declaration of a cessation of hostilities in Gaza, and one hour later the fighting stopped.
Even we
We shouldn't take the Arab street with enthusiasm. We disagreed with the brothers on one point.
And this is according to international standards.
And it's not enough that hospitals and doctors are being detained at borders.
You were the ones standing at the border.
Here, and no one comes.
Brothers, what they took is sweet like this.
Because Gaza is adjacent to Egypt and is considered part of the national territory.
He doesn't talk about any humanitarian issue anywhere in the world; he only talks about a humanitarian issue.
And we respected sovereignty in Egypt.
And we know their position, but Egypt's position won't be harmed.
And we wish a lot from Egypt.
The largest Arab country
And we believe it helps us to amplify our voice and the voices of others from the Arab world.
For all other parties
Even the rescue mission after Gaza.
Europeans tried to preserve it.
What happened in Gaza?
Either it's a presentation conference and so on, and I consider it a government bailout.
Unless we are invited to a conference, let's call for coordination among the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
We were gathered in the Cooperation Council.
These amounts will not be disbursed to anyone.
Whether it is issued
The two affected parties in Gaza
Directly, and as if that were the case.
Because entry is not allowed from every side.
I am happy for Egypt, and all the people in Qatar are happy for Egypt because Egypt...
Egypt's victory in political issues is very important to us.
But you expect
Give me just two minutes.
One minister boasted that he had not been exiled.
And whoever harms Egypt, we cut off his leg and break his arm.
In my honest opinion, what they did is a disgrace to their country.
In truth, they didn't fail and they didn't speak about others.
What helped them in this, and I told this to our brothers in Saudi Arabia, the Saudis' intervention because the king has wisdom in this matter.
Sealing matters in the Arab world
We agreed.
Let the king decide that this is in our interest.
We accepted King Abdullah's decision because we respect and trust him.
The provided text is already in English and does not require translation. It appears to be a complete sentence: "But for one to say that we stopped them, it is even an insult for those who they have stopped."
As if they were students in a school.
I think that this
The limit has been reached.
He thinks he needs to prove his strength.
Sorry, sorry about this.
If you think a small nation has no rights, its rights will be taken away.
And you are attacking and bringing your noise into Darfur.
An Arab resolution in the Arab League
An African decision and a United Nations decision
I think the main problem is
Hezbollah is a conspiracy along with Qatar.
I don't know about the quasi-conspiracy in Qatar.
If that happens after the swine flu, if it appears in Qatar, it will be the cause of the spread of this epidemic.
Qatar is a peaceful country that knows its size and capabilities.
The Gulf of Qatar has its own opinion.
Qatar has a respected foreign policy.
If Qatar solves anything Arabic, we consider it an honor.
Because any Arab conflict
We believe that any Arab dispute can weaken our position vis-à-vis the major issues we face, namely Palestine and all other issues.
The Arab world has become a future.
Our analysis became like theirs.
Western analysis
But there is a matter that we know about; we know what happened in Pakistan.
In some way, I want someone to welcome me and roll out the red carpet for me in Washington.
Someone is calling Qatar?
Did Qatar harm any Arab country?
I tried to contribute financially.
Those contributions incite.
I can speak to say hello to you, and you will say: You are greeting me to provoke me.
This is another matter, oh this, oh that you have a problem or you have a shortage.
This situation doesn't make me busy, it makes you busy.
"But if you have internal problems,"
It's always in my heart.
Especially after the speech of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah.
"I am in Kuwait and I know this is a straightforward man."
The man who speaks the truth.
My heart always says that.
I want to keep saying that.
I always used to say, even in the midst of our dispute with Saudi Arabia, I would say...
And you can refer to all the documents you have on the island, but
Is it like this or not?
From one part we said no, anyway I'm stuck on this situation.
And try as much as we can.
I don't want to get into these topics.
Let them see their affairs and where their mistakes are.
And seeing our mistakes doesn't mean everything we do is wrong.
Are you referring to this, O Sheikh?
Due to internal problems in Egypt
They want to get out of it.
Do you deny that Qatar is involved in any form of conspiracy against Egypt externally and trying to break its relationship with Turkey or any other country?
It seems we have superpowers.
They are seventy million, if we can make it, not eighty million.
They also have a problem that needs to be solved.
You know that this file is important to the Egyptian government and you played a role in the Shalit soldier case.
And I asked with the Frenchman.
We received a call from a friendly nation.
She said there's an issue we need to deal with. We said, "Brothers, this issue is for the Egyptians." They said...
We want to consider this as a request.
From Israel and another state we want to see another part to see this.
What we saw here, we told them, if the same conditions from the brothers, we talk to the brothers in Egypt.
And does that mean that there is a teacher telling us in this sense that it is cheating in Arabic?
This means he is a poor person.
How could he pass us by?
Why does Mahmoud Abbas remain?
And we supported this.
He speaks to his community, he speaks to us, he speaks to the Arab world.
The problem is with you.
I think this is a healthy phenomenon.
I never claimed to be the owner of the island.
The glorious one must enter the competitive media landscape as there are many media outlets in the West.
This is how media entities multiply, and in their time, they all insult each other.
But after a while, they will reach the stage of maturity.
To be or not to be
First, our situation with Saudi Arabia is different.
And even if we concede to Saudi Arabia, we accept it in Qatar.
Important relationships
And Egypt is an important country, but there is a special quality in the relationship with Saudi Arabia.
Egypt has a unique characteristic among Arab countries; it is the largest country.
True, but we have a history with Saudi Arabia and the relationship is different.
It's a personal dispute between some officials here and there.
We appreciate the Egyptian president.
I hope it is limited to a difference in policies or viewpoints.
I told you about the problem when it was an attack on Gaza.
The second problem is that they have issues with us, and until now, we haven't figured out what Qatar did to cause this.
Why don't you try to arrange a meeting between the President of Egypt and the Prince?
Saudi Arabia intervened in this matter.
And when it leaked to the newspapers, they initially said it was a secret meeting, but we found out the next morning.
There was a meeting between me and Omar Suleiman.
Saudi Arabia
Explosion without return
And I can't tell you that we agree on everything.
We say it like this, they won't understand it like that either, no, because you're comparing yourselves.
But dignity is dignity, whether with the young or the old.
The minister said that if Egypt received the appropriate satisfaction.
Reda among the children
I believe Egypt is greater than this, I don't know how to express it like this.
Do you have a vision for solving Egypt's problems, or are you like the Egyptian people, waiting for divine intervention?
"Please, Kiresh, I have no desire to discuss matters of divine intervention or otherwise, for only God knows who will live and who will die."
And ask.
Someone cheated him into believing there was a way.
And our pride in Egypt.
There must be a certain way.
"They are either with me or against me."
And what pains does the Arab citizen feel?
In the Arab world, we suffer from it, and it is the policy of Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
A country that draws its strength from sources of power.
The United States has sources of power. China has sources of power. France has a source of power. A small country like Qatar has a source of power.
Our faith in God
It's clear to her.
You want.
And that we are a small country, I took that into consideration.
And he repeated it a hundred times.
Why would anyone say we have sensitivities?
No one takes from us.
For Israel, you are now inflamed.
"Masha'Allah before I go to Israel."
How can the problem with Egypt be solved?
What's the problem now?
And every day they lodge a complaint with America if I tell you about the big countries I was talking about.
They treat us based on their interests, consequently.
All complaints and all
To ruin the relationship.
I believe any great country that does that will affect its image.
This will affect the Arab identity if we keep complaining about each other.
Everything is coming and we know everything.
Our solution is based on Arab interests.
And we're here for them if they need anything.
What are the next steps to repair the relationships?
And I know that there are good relations between the President and His Highness the Prince.
If someone is throwing stones
He will find himself a loser due to the bond between the two countries and the two leaderships.
What can happen tomorrow, or maybe in ten years, I really don't know, but from our side, if anyone invites us to a seminar, I'll be there.
Someone is inviting us to a conference that we will attend, and if we have an opinion, we will express it at the conference.
We can't.
Because Egypt is our older sister, but we have opinions and we discuss them together.
All this is necessary when the time comes for us to be with you a lot.
So it was canceled due to this policy.
And he also told us that he respects the Egyptian people.
Certainly you're asking about how many contracts were cancelled, ask about how many Egyptians are coming to Qatar at the same time.
But as a state policy, as I told you, the Egyptian people in Qatar are very close to our hearts.
On this day, June 4th, last year, I stirred the feelings of the Arab nations when I closed the Israeli office that was published in the arts on June 4th.
When they say "We said we wanted to close them," if they wanted to close them, it should have been done 12 years ago.
Not every country had a campaign before reconciling with Israel before it had secret meetings between Arab states and Israel.
And after the reconciliation between most Arabs
With Israel, whether under the table or on the table, or talk to it in any way.
If we wanted to arouse sentiments, we should have done it at past Islamic conferences.
At the United Nations, Abdel Nasser's ally hosted a feast at Israeli Ambassador Gabriela Shalev's residence.
I was one of many guests who attended this party, and I don't know why the ambassador did it.
Because at the United Nations we are sitting next to Israel, and no one is denying that.
Or we find a little hope to drive away the sorrow from our Palestinian brothers.
Now the administration has changed, and I had a small gap on the topic of Egypt, but unfortunately.
It wasn't me, it was you.
My question is about the United States, the new administration, and its impact on your (Qataris) relationship with the United States, given the presence of the largest military base in Qatar.
There are no differences in opinions.
Diligent in resolving many issues in the region
Even if they were serious, we'd help them as much as we can.
We expect a special relationship or a solution to the problems that existed between you and the Bush administration.
Many of these cases have been resolved.
The prince from Qatar spoke yesterday in Paris about what is happening in Iran.
And you have special relations with Iran despite its relationship with the United States being bad.
First, we must place it in the context of internal affairs because we must respect each country and its internal affairs.
Lebanon after the elections
Before the elections, Saad Hariri said on this program that the Doha Agreement ends with the establishment of elections.
Is this still your vision, or do you see the agreement as still standing, or is it necessary to come up with a new agreement?
The Doha Agreement was for a phase that would compel them to hold peaceful elections.
A year and a half has passed since the Doha Agreement.
We were following it day by day, minute by minute, until they reached the elections according to the Doha agreement.
That we recently intervened in one of the constituencies to correct some misunderstanding that had occurred.
You still have a bit to finish the settings in Lebanon.
I'm always close to Lebanon. You know how Qataris love Lebanon and enjoy going there.
The first country I visited after a Western country was Lebanon.
Quick question and answer about what's happening in Yemen?
You were involved in the Huthain case, and there are some charges claiming that you supported them.
Or your involvement brought them face to face with the state. Now there is a greater danger, and it is the danger from the south.
And we suffered a lot, and that's why we're standing here, not there in Qatar.
We faced great pressure, but this was our vision and the position of His Highness the Amir.
Sensory subject
Stability affects us positively, and instability affects us negatively.
Our job is to mediate fairly between two parties.
And we signed an agreement.
But I understand that might have other reasons.
And always stand by them, I stood by them in every situation.
And I'm not basing it on facts.
See, there's nothing between us.
We sell them.
I say this with an apology, knowing that there's a large Arab audience that doesn't agree with me.
Dear viewers, thank you also for listening, hoping that we have provided you with some of Qatar's foreign policy.
In conclusion, greetings from the program team, and this is Ahmed Mansour bidding you farewell without borders.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Condolences to the viewers, peace be upon you, and welcome to this special interview.
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani is the Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State of Qatar.
Certainly, why do I say it's a special and exceptional interview? Because...
Qatar and specifically the man was the main sponsor.
Sir, just one simple and direct question.
With this in mind, it happened because there was an Arab consensus from the beginning.
And we tried that when we went to the United Nations.
The Arab agreement was important, and the Lebanese management from both sides was important.
To get some results
I am very concerned about external interference.
Many opinions and suggestions from the outside.
Lebanese and international Arabic if you want to say
They went through phases but with meaning.
This walking isn't easy, it doesn't mean these stages were calm.
What does it mean that the problems in Lebanon...
Taste of truth
In other words, when you were gathered and just now directly joined the Lebanese line and the Lebanese folder.
Do you know that the Lebanese complex is very big?
A Lebanese international regional Qatari needs strong encryption.
It could also be a complex job that was magnified due to external interventions.
Because we know that Lebanon is a beacon for the press, a beacon for culture, a beacon for tourism, and a beacon for many things.
Lebanese don't want to allow it.
To affect peace and security in Lebanon
The first problem
External Effects in Lebanon
Suddenly, after twenty-four hours, she decided to take everyone on one plane.
From the plane straight to meet the Emir of Qatar.
They weren't expecting that. They couldn't rest for a minute. You didn't want to honor them.
The secret is what you leave them not having and not thinking about too much.
Taking a lot from the call.
We propose bringing them to Doha because we need Joe.
Or you will gather them with much difficulty.
And his father's name is Malek Katere.
We are taking them out of these circumstances into conditions where they can find a solution.
If we want to succeed, we need to get them out of this atmosphere.
And quickly.
God precedes us with half a rifle or half of Beirut.
And we succeeded because they agreed to go to Doha.
The parties decided to go to Doha.
Some people want to say that Qatar favors one party over another.
And I'm from Beirut, though.
His Highness's policy was that we were mediators.
In this process
Direct
Did you consult seriously?
by the major parties concerned at least about what is happening here in Lebanon, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Syria
Especially the brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, I spoke with Prince Saud.
And his support for the idea became apparent.
We benefited from Prince Saud that
Everyone wants a solution.
Her excuses are weak.
If I relied on logic
Her excuses are weak.
It was necessary to remove it because there is tension in Palestine.
There is no such thing as an Iranian nuclear issue.
The Arab Council must have a mechanism to resolve issues.
Is the African Union better than us at solving issues?
And try to bring the ends together.
And why can't the Arabs, who have an old league, hold conferences to solve problems later?
Uniting the Arabs or gathering the parties, if he does, is to intervene in support of the oppressed.
This is under study.
If we want to wake up the Arab world, not the LIG.
The Arab League is just a tool for implementation.
One of the officials was here, and he is Speaker Nabih Berri.
He needs S-S.
Now he sees that the Lebanese have agreed.
Well, listen, we...
And above them is Qatar.
What one day led to results.
Arab interest
That will be a strength for the Arabs.
We tried.
At the United Nations, when we went, the Doha Agreement.
The solutions they proposed to solve the problem were not for any other reason.
There is no doubt that
And a more important role in the whole Arab world
To place
Stop that by our agreement.
For others to come and help us
Because this is a serious matter.
Until we reached the point where everyone was playing in our yard.
In our courtyard.
Certainly, it is very important that we place the interests of our people above all else.
Now we need the Arab League after this agreement to see what we will do with our Palestinian brothers.
We'll do it for Somalia.
Why isn't Somalia a member of the Arab states?
Sudan is not in the Arab League! Iraq is not in the Arab League! Why don't we give it a try?
We are part of the Arab world and a small part.
I hope this suggestion isn't the idea.
Qatar has good relations with Syria and Saudi Arabia.
I believe that if we don't ask them, they won't do anything. They'll only do what they can.
The wish that His Majesty King Abdullah
King of Saudi Arabia
And his brother President Bashar
Because historically, Saudi Arabia and Syria had an agreement.
What could be a transient stage
And with God's will, we will find.
Sticky, I want to ask, if you don't mind, could you participate in this part?
There's not even a lamp now, but you kind of have confidence.
Unite any Arab countries we ask for it.
And that was his policy from the start, but that's the issue.
What happened in Lebanon, does this indicate that the region is on the brink of serious changes?
In Lebanon, the best jobs are for local teachers and Lebanese affairs officials.
Not expensive for this position.
I wish the opposite. I wish this were true.
The beginning of a new phase in the Arab world.
We are capable of creating.
It will happen somewhere else.
In another sense, sir, are you afraid of the armament that existed during a previous period?
From now until the end of George Bush's presidency.
There's no doubt that you still want to talk about Palestine now, the topic is Gaza.
I want to ask
No one needs us like that.
I was asked to take care of the humanitarian aspect in Palestine.
We can't deliver the medicine to you.
We are neither food.
Electricity for the patient in the hospital.
Who will die when the power goes out.
I wish
We call on the Arab League to agree on a specific amount for this matter of food and medicine, and we call it food and medicine.
We don't want the Red Crescent to pick you up.
Red service will take you there.
My apology but the Arab side is committed to this Israeli siege.
I don't want to go into details, but I want to say that as Arabs, we need to deliver medicine and food, even if we don't agree with Hamas.
Saudi Arabia has made great efforts, and they promised at the Holy Kaaba.
Because this disagreement will only benefit the other party.
His saying "Don't deal with this party because we will bring you the solution" is not correct.
And
So far, I have no clues to the solution.
Are you afraid of an American-Iranian confrontation in the near future, or do you expect it?
This is of course possible.
No one beats Qatar in generosity.
Iran is an important neighbor to us.
As much as we might agree with all their policies or as much as they might agree with our policies in Qatar.
For example, they say why don't we want you to have relations or contacts with Israel?
Perhaps some consider you an integral part of it due to the American bases located there.
We don't know how to deal with this.
Who said that after the visit of the Emir of Qatar to Saudi Arabia?
What might have met, consulted, or spoken with the Saudi host
In Istanbul, from the negotiations between Syria and Israel.
And I can say that it was a coincidence.
Second place, Saudi Arabia wanted to come up with a solution, and I was in contact with Prince Saud.
What happened in the last few hours.
A change in negotiation strategy.
Either from your side or from others'.
We are responsible for
And we all went in and locked the room behind us.
And in the end, we found ourselves... Then the intervention of His Highness was very important.
And from it, the intervention action.
Regardless of the topic, continue now.
And his message was clear when he said, "We know our size, our place, and our role," as if...
I want to work alone without involving any other party.
Whether it's Arab, national, or regional.
Because
They became a responsibility.
Did you see this or not?
We are working to prevent some jealousy because we are a nation.
Lee Doolee
Can or cannot
I think this will be the assembly that brings profit.
The final question is about your relationship with Washington. Is it long-term? Is it natural or special?
I can say that our relationship with Washington is improving.
Doesn't mean we don't have different opinions in some cases.
But this is our right. If they talk about democracy, this is democracy.
How is she coming? How does she walk on the ground?
If we talk about the economy, it's excellent. If we talk about education, it's excellent.
"And it's true, but if we talk about politics, I'd say it's good."
In my opinion
In my opinion, we should set aside the confrontation with Israel.
And if we want to stop playing in the Arab court.
And reconcile the Palestinians.
We are united in one opinion to be a respected force.
No one is alive.
To be something effective
Many thanks to all my dear followers for your support. We'll meet again, God willing. Best regards.
Welcome, viewers, to this dialogue with the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani.
"This is a dialogue."
We are trying to explore the political reality of the Arab and the efforts of the Arabs.
His Highness, Welcome
To study what's happening in Gaza.
And I hope through this dialogue that we can appreciate
Light on some of your questions
The brutal Israeli incursion into Gaza
And our goal was to be a unified Arab stance.
Dealing with friendly nations
Sister countries
And how can we come to find a clear and strong Arab stance from the Arab countries?
And then, we find settlement areas.
From our perspective, we know that more than one Arab country has been subjected to aggression.
In an insulting manner.
And no one was punished.
We are punished for everything, whether done intentionally or unintentionally.
"We are the experts."
The world and the lonely ones who are always targeted.
Always disciplined in a way.
Calculate
"Until we can't anymore"
For convergence at the leadership level
To gain the commitment of discipline campaign.
We didn't want to create a rift in the Arab world.
And there were five more verbal agreements.
By a two-thirds majority of the members
But the purpose of the meeting is not
They want it to be right and our view to be wrong for the sake of the goal.
Solve the problem, don't just talk about it.
But will it be solved at the expense of Palestinian blood?
What they wish for now is that the ministry does not cancel Qatar's request.
And this was confirmed by His Highness.
In the speech he gave, he did not insist on having the summit in Qatar if it would cause any embarrassment. He did not insist on having the summit in Qatar; it could be anywhere.
An Arab stand where they respect us.
Us and the Ministerial
We want to tell them that the Security Council resolution was issued.
and Israel
He was not involved in the decision and continued to kill and bomb in Gaza, and he still does.
And I need to ask the Arabs what we're going to do about this.
What are we going to do?
What is it when Israel finishes?
To implement the remainder of the Security Council resolution
Or there will be a boycott because Israel didn't stop.
Shooting, what we force our brothers to do.
I have a decision that is above all.
A few days ago
We're going to talk about the ministers' meeting.
See how you stand in this in the end.
Certainly, we support holding an Arab summit. This was our idea, and some other countries, including Syria and Yemen, also requested the summit.
No Kuwaiti Arabic like this.
Or arrange us in the camp of moderates.
And the non-moderate camp
And they do not intend any good.
Why did the West do that?
As an observer, supervisor, and unobserved Arab
You won't find a moderate state or a non-moderate state.
And we want to know what is moderate and what is not moderate. Does moderate mean following Israel's plans?
Keep it as it is without getting ashamed.
We just want to keep the case open.
In other words, this is an important question.
Are the countries
You are following Israel's steps and wanting to solve problems in their way.
I don't want to say that he's following Israeli plans, and I don't want to accuse anyone.
But I say
If we name the coordination camp
What is moderate in Western eyes?
Are we agreed on slaughtering a certain category of Palestinians?
Of course, the elections took place.
I am neither a defender nor an opponent of Hamas, but I am speaking from experience.
The existing truth is that there is
Idea
Some people call it an extreme move.
But we need to ask ourselves, what does this extreme action demand?
He doesn't ask for his rights, nor does he ask for what's not his right.
We'll categorize them.
Another one got killed too.
Up to now, because we
My inner self is Arab and my intellect is Arab.
And it starts happening.
That's why we don't want to fight a war on behalf of others.
Yes, Your Highness briefly.
Prevented from attending the Arab summit
I can't say they prevented it, there were some efforts and the matter was almost known.
Prevention topic
And also, as I told you, we might be
Take a vote and get thirty percent.
but this was not the aim because it's not the issue of challenge as much as it is the issue of an urgent need, that's what we think.
And others, thinking that this is not urgent.
We appealed to the Security Council.
Or there is a decision in the Security Council.
The decision is for the Security Council; Israel said it would end and then consider the matter.
All I want to focus on again
We strive to implement the decision on the weaker party.
What will he bring that's different from what was in the first meeting?
For amendments to occur, sometimes there are disagreements.
Very much.
Will we be ready to have a clear Arab stance?
Humanitarian aid
Support our brothers greatly.
And here also to address the Israeli party and tell them
No one wants that, we need to verify that.
Why do we freeze it?
Four hundred and four, we were committed to the ceasefire, four hundred and four, and the Israelis were not committed.
It's normal to have arguments in meetings, but in reality, that's not the case.
Describing their attitudes and what's in their hearts.
One of the grievances reported.
Someone described Hamas' actions as divisive.
Not even a little
This country is in danger, and we have responded to it, and we have a brother among the ministers.
And I want to know, is this what the West says?
For these abnormal movements, fragmentation, and other names
And we don't want to be like other men.
And therefore it always means, and I don't mean anyone by it.
Which foreigner did they find?
"Whether a Western country or Western countries find"
Among the Arabs
Sweet, oh high-ranking sheikh.
An Invitation to a Second Ministerial Meeting
His mission must be one thing.
Why are the Arabs divided into many factions and sects?
One million Israelis mobilized
What was issued after Resolution 180?
The issued decision.
Israel will carry out what it has not done after it completes the mission.
There is no doubt that the Arab delegation made an effort.
Let's be grateful for this decision.
We demand Chapter Seven because Israel is above the law, Israel.
And if they are questioned, they will say, "We understand."
What is the mistake of the Arabs if?
If that's the case, Israel won't be questioned.
And he is above international law.
That's right.
Why did you go to the Security Council and why did you link the Arab Summit to what the Security Council would issue?
At the top, the Security Council is experimenting on us.
A tough decision is needed.
Decision
A formal job gets him off the hook.
We were afraid of the West.
And we work hard after they make their decision.
I don't want to go off-topic.
Those who carried out the attack should rebuild Iraq in its entirety at their own expense because they are the ones who destroyed it.
What we ask from the government of Iraq, we do not ask from the dead.
No compensation.
Walking like that in Sudan when they started talking about Bashir's trial.
My dear friend
Your Highness the Sheikh
A Major Diplomatic Victory for the Arabs in the Security Council
Listen, they had some difficulties in the Security Council because the first speech was about a presidential statement.
Results
What Israel did.
It will be approved in two days, in a week, after he completes the task.
Because they didn't collect it from her.
Sorry, but people have to gather.
Because Israel agreed after completing the mission.
Do you have an alternative to the decision now?
All we've done
Some brothers, unfortunately, with some efforts.
They participated in the siege of Gaza.
I don't need any relations with the West, and my friends are enough for me.
Against the West, not against America.
They don't know the language of interests.
Your friends if you are strong.
Or if you have an opinion.
And in the end, they'll take one percent of our opinion and say we were winning.
What is victory?
Including
I can't divulge the precautions to your family now because the decision hasn't been made.
The council is master of itself.
Co-founded
We participated in the training to some extent.
But I wasn't invited to the meeting with the Arab ministers and the US Secretary of State.
But I want to say that the brothers who didn't go are enough.
I looked at Arab parties for certain interests.
In this regard, His Highness Sheikh
For years until now
Listen, brother, I don't want to talk about accusations.
I can claim that we were taught everything.
Even if they are people from
There was an Israeli rejection, an international rejection, and we contributed to this rejection.
And from there the dispute began and the siege began.
And last month, Israel killed twenty-eight Palestinians during the ceasefire.
And we let them starve until they're fed up because we don't want them in power.
The partisans, O Sheikh.
Say: "Indeed, the Palestinian struggle is determined."
In other words, if it were
The creator of the Palestinian conflict might have been a Palestinian conflict.
Tell someone they're not 100% correct.
I don't want to say that Hamas is 100% right.
I don't claim that and I don't say that.
But, the point is usually in the middle, equidistant from everyone.
And not only the mediators, but we Arabs are equidistant from everyone.
"But not wanting it to exist, therefore we should terminate it in any possible way."
Twice the soldiers practice right and left.
And once you surround them, you don't give them money or salaries.
And when we create a positive model in the West Bank
Let the people in Gaza see how people are living.
Luxurious life
And completely the opposite in Gaza.
Invited to a second Arab ministerial meeting, but this time.
The ongoing dialogue between Hamas, mediated by Turkey.
This meeting, which you insisted on attending, is searching for ways to exceed expectations.
It would be a trick if we launched another initiative.
We don't have any initiatives.
In this issue
Because Egypt is an important Arab country.
You are asked to assume a role, and we support any Egyptian efforts made to achieve a mutual understanding.
But important
Why don't you come?
Tomorrow with a party that seems to have defeated another party.
And there is no way to consensus.
Balanced Egyptian Initiative
Between international requests, Arab requests, and humanitarian requests
And the requirements of Egypt's role, which is an important role.
It is a leading Arab country that we all appreciate and respect.
According to you, what is required from Egypt?
The proposals now, the current initiative does not cover these requirements, Your Excellency.
I have a vision for the program.
We hear some information from here and there.
I don't want to explain something I don't know.
With all due respect, there should be a Palestinian government or presidency, and we all recognize the Palestinian presidency.
But there are also people.
We are injured in another party, we need to take their opinion as well.
Why do we perform these intermediate actions?
Reaching a point of view
Hamas's position was clear: this decision didn't take our point of view, so how can it be issued?
The decision to involve the Arabs without contacting or consulting the main concerned party is the issue.
We only want, of course, to deal with Palestine as a state.
Stride along with the basket as a side hustle.
Now there is division between one party here and another party there.
This means that if we deal with people from Gaza, we have to stop dealing with people who are in the bank or in the Palestinian presidency.
We deal with the Palestinians as one people and one government.
They ask for someone from Gaza to be with them.
And now we're starting to coordinate with each other.
What was announced about it?
Welcome, first of all, to the decision, which did not mention a mechanism, welcomed the Egyptian initiative and any other initiative.
Some considered it as a mechanism.
This is a detail, but I didn't understand from reading this decision that it supports the Egyptian initiative.
We hope that the Egyptian initiative will succeed in its implementation.
Now enough.
I have no doubt about our brothers in Egypt.
Because Israel did not accept the Security Council resolution.
And it is considered that the decision no longer exists because Israel did not accept it.
Until you accept it, things will change on Earth.
Yes, Your Highness, Sheikh, when talking about Egyptian efforts.
In cooperation with Turkish efforts at the same time
Or an Arab excuse.
Or Arab conflicts that did not reach their solution, so it came to fill the vacuum.
Supposed to be filled by Arab parties
I welcome Turkey's suspension.
A list that must be valued by Arabs and Muslims.
Turkey is an Islamic country.
So this is a natural role.
And that people follow him.
"There is no Arabic word or pronoun that can resolve the situation."
They say Dahklo will complete the mission.
There are only clear Arab stances and cutting all this aggression and it is ongoing and evasive.
I want to be a mirror reflecting Arab attitudes.
Israel can postpone the decision, I don't want to talk about an Israeli-Arab war when the people who always call for peace.
And we have a country that loves to live in peace.
They did not call for an Arab war.
Clear Arab stance
In the context of initiatives and proposals, of course you're following what's happening.
And the proposals and conditions set by Hamas
Are you thinking?
Now as an on-the-ground observer
And the political result of the military operation will now allow Hamas to set its conditions.
Does it have to be correct?
We agree on this point and disagree on that point.
The second thing
I don't know about these negotiations, as I've already told you, they're not happening right now.
The second thing
"Masha'Allah in the required places by Arabs."
This is the reality in Arabic.
It has witnesses after the Huthayl operations began.
It seems that the Arab street is taking very advanced positions.
As governments, we have...
Certainly, I am sorry that some people describe the gift of the people.
They're telling me this problem again.
Representing people's views
Bosses now
In other words, if you want to
Until they see
Of course there's a high ceiling and a modest ceiling.
Normalization and diplomacy with Israel
Qatar to
The office of Israel's representative in Doha was closed.
Qatar, which is hosting this event.
The Arab side must be radical and adopt radical positions.
What has not been agreed upon by the Arabs is a collective agreement.
Just a little if we had an Arab agreement.
A contract is one thing, and relationships are another.
We are ready.
When we go with our Arab brothers
If there was clear Arab resolve and credibility.
They engage with others, not just countries with which they have relations.
Countries that don't have mountains
very important
Don't be agents for others.
Why doesn't Qatar set an example in this field?
If this model wakes up, I can be in it.
But we want more.
Qatari model Qatar is committed as part of its Arab commitment.
Like
They don't sell one in place of the other.
Our problem is that credibility among Arab states is lacking.
And unfortunately, I won't say our secret, I won't say pokers.
That's why it's very important.
We skip formal parties everywhere because we must rise above that.
Some ambassadors condemn demonstrations, some expel ambassadors just as Chávez did.
And that's part of the disagreement.
Some of them asked for the ambassador and those who summoned the permanent member states, and all of these are movies about our people.
We talked about the modest ceiling of popular demands.
For high expectations, some demand the opening of fronts; some demand that Syria open its fronts with Israel.
Listen, brother, I told you that we call for peace and not for fighting with Israel.
And we want to fight Israel.
War with Israel
And how did they agree?
This is another problem.
Let's talk to each other and solve our problems.
What His Highness said caught my attention.
It is conditional that nations do not sell each other.
What do you mean?
I want now
The streets won't have mercy on us.
Your Highness the Sheikh
What is happening today is the completion of a project that began in 2006 during the Lebanon War.
Or there is a disagreement.
Just like you, I want to know that there are differences in goals.
Lebanon had a free land.
Some parts of the lesson are planned to be deposited with the United Nations.
Or similar to it.
Lebanon, I want to say that we have addressed the issue of the Lebanese to a great extent.
Israel, of course, needs weak states around it.
Why does he dominate and have the upper hand?
Certainly, there are countries that support it, and they are foreign countries.
That's why you want to remain the only power in the region.
And today they want
To replace this example with "غزا" (invaded) would be: "To invade this instance."
In Lebanon, you speak with how many sects?
And how many sides
There is only one side in Palestine.
But I can assure you again that the problem in Palestine is that they listened too much to many Arabs and foreigners.
And this is where the gap started, and each one thinks that the other is trolling them.
In your opinion as an observer and a viewer
No matter what his plan was, it was going to end in broken bones.
As Arabs, we accept this because it could happen to those who are disobedient.
Or he expresses his opinion.
Either Israelis or others in the future.
We set a high example.
In obedience and assistance in breaking bones
We have a moral saying: "Me and my brother against my cousin; me, my brother, and my cousin against the world."
Now we should not be at odds with Hamas, but I am not saying that Hamas or anyone else is infallible and does not make any mistakes.
They all have mistakes.
Now we need to leave this topic.
He waded up to his knee.
Because here, failure is not the failure of the group.
Your Highness, Sheikh Qatar, in the past, has usually tried to submit proposals.
And initiatives by Liwaa for sustainable solutions happened in Lebanon.
We'll talk about what happened in Darfur in a minute, even if you're in a hurry.
Until here
I don't want to rely on our brothers because sometimes there are sensitivities.
One country is doing all these facilities, we don't have a problem either as long as there is a solution.
Our goal right now is not to make Qatar a main title.
What was among the objectives of His Highness Sheikh...
One of his goals was how to stop the bloodshed.
And put an end to tyranny.
What happened was an illusion.
And we are in Qatar.
Do they know something we don't? I don't think so.
But the most important thing is to have good intentions.
"A solution that honors solutions."
Speak about the initiatives, it is useful to know what the initiative said about resolving the Darfur crisis and the Justice and Equality Movement.
And the government of Sudan in Khartoum.
And thus it is essentially about solving the Darfur problem, because the Darfur problem at its core
The godfather helped.
but we don't escalate a cause just because we made it international
Based on revenge against the system, and now we want to solve the problem, but we don't know how.
And we always strive, as mentioned before, to implement decisions. We are the best at implementing decisions.
Removing the status from the competition Is there also a competition in the Darfur case?
I don't want to go through this.
Before we conclude the dialogue, Your Highness Sheikh, there is an economic summit.
This summit, do you want to attend it?
What you're not doing won't harm the summit.
We wish it had taken place in a different atmosphere than the Arab atmosphere, but it was planned.
What is shame?
"Masha'Allah if the Arab leaders attended this summit."
What about the blood of the Palestinians in Gaza? And here they are gathering for financial and economic reasons.
Assistant in heating
No one seems to be afraid of these streets.
No one knows the circumstances. I want, of course, for nothing to happen to us, but safety first.
And to protect
but no one takes someone in his little pocket
Thank you very much to the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani.
Dear viewers, wherever you are, peace be upon you.
What is the point of this celebration and the credibility of the statements by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights?
Disaster victims are the most neglected people in the world.
Look at our Arab region and how little they care about this matter.
These and other questions will be asked of our guest today in today's episode.
Former Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Conference on Disability
And he holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Social Work and Sociology from Qatar University.
Master's degree in Social Planning and Social Policy from Helwan University in Egypt
And held several positions in the field of disability.
She was a founding member and general manager of the National Committee for People with Special Needs.
In nineteen eighty-nine
And the vice president of the National Committee for People with Disabilities since 1999.
Until 2003
I also contributed to the establishment of a rehabilitation center for people with special needs.
For people with disabilities in Qatar
Our guests witnessed the launch of numerous programs, projects, and media campaigns.
Activities related to people with special needs in the Arab world
I also contributed to delivering lectures, participating in meetings, seminars, and forums.
Hello, Lady Hissa, you are with us in this episode.
The term used is "people with disabilities."
At the very beginning, we introduced the term 'disabled' perhaps in the 1980s or earlier.
Most educational concept
Among those who provide them with such education
An important document at the United Nations appeared in nineteen ninety-nine.
The term refers to and before we go into details
From other regions, although there are areas that are not classified as developed countries or are classified as poor countries.
And Latin America, especially Latin America, in fact, this trend there is the strongest in any other region.
But the statistics have proven the opposite.
The orientation towards legal rights exists in the Arab world and exists in many countries.
There may be resources and political will as well.
It's telling you here that some statistics you might know about
Eighty percent of countries are poor.
UNESCO says that around ninety percent of children with special needs from poor countries do not go to school.
Sadie Hesse doesn't know how to comment on these statistics.
Very real
I have seen it in Darfur, in Gaza, and in areas that experience such incidents like wars and conflicts.
Here, you won't distinguish between a disabled person and a regular person because there are so many of them.
In fact, the children of illiterate females, for example, are almost three and fifty or two and fifty.
And in other countries
There are many barriers that prevent these children from accessing school, even if they do not have disabilities.
Good luck, the city doesn't have an infrastructure for this child to find a school.
He can't carry it.
For children and other residents
These gondolas and projects are great, but we hear little about them.
Except when we talk about International Day of Persons with Disabilities, which the world celebrated just a few days ago, what is the goal of these celebrations?
The situation in the world
Better than people who don't have disabilities.
Such organizations came and established many projects.
He practices a very important healthy strategy.
By means of this strategy
There's not much difference between working in humanitarian affairs and working with marginalized groups like people with disabilities.
Now we will have awareness in the Arab world, and it is better.
At the point of awareness, we pause to take calls and continue our conversation.
Thank you.
I have two questions I want to ask her because she was at the United Nations before.
The second point
United Nations laws calling for the fight against systems that hinder society for children, for example, the Syrian intelligence system.
Is there a law that allows for requesting a trial of the system as is the case in Syria?
So, Suleiman, your question is clear. Suleiman Kraou from Syria, thank you very much. With us is Nayef Saeed from Kuwait. Hello, Nayef!
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Peace be upon you too.
Good evening
Good evening, welcome.
If possible, I am one of those with intellectual and mental disabilities.
I hear the Arabs say that a free man understands by gestures.
And there is a verse in the Quran that says, "In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. God has given us speech. Praise be to God who has given speech to all things."
I sat for thirty years without speaking a word or two a day.
Praise God for making me write.
I meant to quote the Quran and found...
People attack me because I use the Quran as a reference and consider me a hypocrite.
They attack me, not knowing they're at the bottom of hell.
All I got was insults.
And we speak the truth.
If your house is made of glass, don't throw stones at others.
And of course, psychological disabilities.
Sulaiman's brother also falls under the same definition.
United Nations programs or their reactions regarding the causes of disability, such as political goals or other objectives.
Go to various agencies and organizations.
Let's discuss with them, convince them, and find out their level.
There are no disability topics or issues on their agenda.
UNESCO, the International Labour Organization, UNICEF, and indeed these organizations have already placed disability.
Haya is one of the programs that strives not to remember children with disabilities.
With good opportunities and schools.
From various environmental perspectives
UNICEF also
But there are shortcomings that we must acknowledge, that there are shortcomings in the United Nations as well.
What are the main points of weakness and negligence that you mentioned?
United Kingdom
The problem of routine and bureaucracy
I was in my country, the State of Qatar.
but it had routine and bureaucracy that obstructed
My work is especially challenging at times due to constraints or shortages in quantity.
"They are either lazy or want to fight disabled people for recognition."
Until he reached a point where it was acceptable, unless he placed it in a separate article as desired by the Global Weakness Movement.
Part-time jobs can be suitable.
Unfortunately, there's no coordination between them.
"He had the biggest eyes."
Survey, which was implemented by the special rapporteur and applied to countries.
Among the employees or people who work on such programs
Unfortunately, we only received three responses out of forty-eight organizations and agencies, and they only provided us with three answers.
Don't put it down.
The topic of disability is a permanent, stable, and enduring subject for many years, although this topic is primarily a human rights issue.
In the recent period, praise be to God, two or three years ago.
The issue of disability has at least become legitimate through events such as seminars and the like.
Peace be upon you
My lady's stable, why are there no binding laws and decisions for Arab countries and who is responsible for activating these international regulations?
For Arab countries and salary distribution, for example, distributing a salary to the disabled.
Are there dedicated funds from the United Nations?
Will this money go to governments or to UN agencies, and will this aid actually reach the disabled?
The final remark is not binding decisions for Arab countries.
Many thanks, Ahmed Halabi from Greece.
With us is Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia. Welcome, Ibrahim.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
This adopts the proposal.
To write directly to the Secretary-General of the United Nations
Why is it being moved to this box?
Productive factory
Allocating only one percent of annual net profits
Go back to the guest in response to callers' questions.
And say, "The doctors advised him to undergo surgery, but"
It's expensive and he doesn't have money, where will he get help?
He is from Algeria.
I think this is important for meeting my brother Naji's needs.
Like any other rights, the rights of people with disabilities
All these rights and duties must be obtained by the citizen.
To sign the international convention for people with disabilities, this agreement is legal and binding.
And satisfied the rights and needs of the people within a national scope.
Or even at the non-governmental level
Binding on all states and limits the implementation of these laws.
At least at the level of officials, there should be awareness.
It's necessary to at least work on these treaties in this manner.
A moment if there wasn't a strong commitment to it.
There is no response to the monitoring reports you are generating, even if there is interest.
I'm afraid I've forgotten the password to the document that binds us ethically, not legally.
It is binding and legitimate.
And I understand that these issues will be resolved or discussed, or that they will be part of the context of a society suffering from many problems.
Naji Zakarna, Manager, Qatar Center for the Deaf Sign Language Expert at Al Jazeera
First, Mr. Ali would like to express sincere thanks to the island.
Those who have passed this time have watched this episode live.
Now Ali is speaking and saying that he is very proud.
She was a servant to all the special needs people in the place where she was and still is.
And we support her and stand by her always and forever.
And also say that there are many people with special needs.
Some of them here don't know about this agreement because there weren't any training courses.
Upon them, especially in schools or hospitals or in public and private institutions
And it is necessary to publish this agreement.
The law addressing people with special needs in all countries of the world.
And he kept emphasizing and insisting on this.
Adopt and sign this agreement.
Like the State of Qatar, some countries have signed this document aimed at serving people with special needs and serving us.
Many thanks, colleague Nagi, speaking on behalf of Ali.
Many thanks
Your opinion could be a decision.
Former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, we could start with a proposal submitted by the caller Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
Establishing a fund to support
A donation box that accepts contributions from any country.
This means that the fund has to spend it on activities carried out by the special amount when it is working.
Even the Arab countries did not make donations except for one: Syria.
Fulfilling those commitments is a problem within the United Nations, therefore
The box
Lack of commitment by member states, unfortunately, and lack of interest.
Unfortunately, many people say with all boldness what it means we don't care about the current situation.
Indeed, the question of duties.
On human rights
In its broad and generalized form
The marginalized, especially.
That's why there are those covenants.
Even these countries fulfill their duties, but it's a good idea from the brother.
Above that, it is necessary that it is not an independent box, meaning independent in its form, but rather the organizations that already exist in the region.
What they have in their budget
Special projects for people with special needs in Gaza
Assistance for people with special needs
The problem always involves political factors.
A state or government dramatically ensured its support.
With a limited number, unfortunately.
For nominal amounts
The father is disabled.
Certainly, citizenship was revoked.
Shiloh took his bride.
Sometimes from
Teaching problems
Unveiled or uncovered by choice
Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.
Peace be upon you too.
And we want
They consider themselves knowledgeable.
I wish Arab countries would allocate a portion of their budget
Many thanks, Behjat Karawan from Kuwait.
Aisha Mohammed from Qatar, hello.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
Good evening to you and Sheikhah Bint Khalifa.
Badr wants to send her a message of thanks and appreciation.
In recent years
With our best wishes; Parents of Special Needs Children
For Her Highness' constant support of them
Bearer of the Honor Flag from Tunisia, Welcome
There is no other level, it's genetic.
I believe there is genetic care that reduces the percentage of disabled people.
In our Arab customs, generally a cousin marries his aunt's daughter.
By this means at this stage, a stage of disability and thank you.
See the comments on what the viewers said.
In general, as I said, at the national level
He knew there were programs for guidance and support.
Falls under healthcare services
They also fall under the Hammad Medical Umbrella.
I believe within the psychiatric clinic and the programs of the Supreme Council for Education.
Special Education Division at Sadak, I still don't know if it exists or not.
But in healthcare services, yes, there is support and there are medical services.
And rehabilitation tailored for such cases.
Prevention is better than cure. Genetic factors and consanguineous marriages were mentioned. Are there any awareness campaigns?
For example, to raise awareness.
In this neighborhood
Certainly, this is a very important and crucial point.
One of the things that I and others have talked a lot about and shared a lot on.
Soft, conducts awareness campaigns and specializes in it.
Conducted by the World Health Organization
And also UNICEF
Now in many Arab countries, including Qatar
And the Garden of Tunis
Now there is a binding decision for early inspection.
And it was implemented in many countries.
Barefoot all the way to the preventive direction
Do campaigns receive any positive response?
Especially when they go against customs and traditions.
Certainly, his difficulty when colliding with the collective culture.
She has decisions, she has strategies, she has the will to deal with it and is committed.
The problem with early testing, for example, is that this is a very important issue before marriage.
Your question is whether there are statistics on people with special needs.
Especially people with special needs from the Arab region.
Arab region
And especially
With the recent events that happened in the region
In conflict-prone areas and hotspots, especially in wars and conflicts, etc.
For every person killed, there are three disabled people.
And what happened in Lebanon and Darfur and many other places.
I don't see it as a matter of sufficiency or priority.
Human rights principles
There can't be anything for disabled people, their programs, and plans.
Agendas within institutions in government and non-government ministries
In cases such as war or unrest
Only your words, High Commissioner for Human Rights at the United Nations, Michelle Bachelet.
The most important and strangest thing is what the International Monitoring Committee for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities said about the census.
None of these disabled people are included in the population statistics.
They don't always announce it.
For example, in the State of Qatar, when they conducted the population census, I think it was more than five years ago.
For honesty
In collaboration with the Planning Council and with
Prepared by the council as a realistic issue and shared with us like a special informant's office.
To add more categories for disabilities
Things that need to be present
Types of these needs All these important details that should lead you to a result
Is there a disabled person present?
Not but
Statistics are somehow progressing in this regard.
Peace be upon you
Thank you, madam, for this program and thank you, Sheikhah Hessa.
But I thank God that I am a Qatari and I receive all this care from my country.
My daughter is now a student in independent schools and receives a good education, praise be to God.
And I would like to thank Ms. Hessa.
Its driving rollers and its rollers that don't make us feel fear or anxiety for our children.
Praise and thanks to God, and thanks to her and those upon whom this category depends.
Many thanks to Fatima Al-Dosari from Qatar, still with Qatar with Latifa.
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you too.
My dear sister, reality, expectations, and what we anticipate is solving our children's problems.
This is the role of Sheikhah for our Qatari children.
I hope she can answer this question.
Hello, peace be upon you
And I testify to the services provided by the State of Qatar, especially for the hearing impaired.
We had a program for early detection of hearing loss.
There is a Higher Council for People with Special Needs.
Characters with disabilities, regardless of the type of disability.
Certainly, civil society gatherings, non-governmental organizations, or other communities.
Because reality and what we wish for, if measured after five years,
What was provided to the affected five years ago and now.
"Many thanks to Karim Naseem from Jordan. Now let's return to our guests."
Certainly
The association as a whole with its members and especially with their families who
Disabled children have great ambitions and high expectations.
Either at the planning level or at the implementation level
But for one of the points you mentioned, which is a very important point.
Children cannot obtain documents or otherwise, whether in Qatar or anywhere else.
The international conference is like many international documents.
I committed to translating them into plans and strategies.
To enable these services automatically
On the basis of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, regardless of religion, race, color, gender, sexual orientation.
"Masha'Allah, Sheikhah Hissa, you have served as a special director before. You were at the United Nations dealing with disabilities after six years of work."
Did you see Tmani?
I feel the time wasn't enough or the financial support wasn't enough.
Here there are many achievements that have been accomplished, and I am proud of them.
In partnership with or through existing organizations and through government institutions in many countries.
Especially in the Arab region
This leads to more research and larger studies.
We started a global survey and had more than one report.
Awareness-raising is an ongoing process that must be worked on continuously and dramatically.
Coordination among Arab countries
And among the people themselves are those with special needs and their organizations, because they
They have a duty to fulfill.
They have to fight for
Many thanks
Thank you.
At the end of this episode, I thank everyone who shared their opinions and comments with us.
Tomorrow, God willing, we will meet a new guest.
Join us with your messages and letters in a new episode of "Live." Goodbye.
Good morning
I'm very happy that you're here with us.
First, before we start asking you various questions and talking about this morning.
Thank you, Shayma. May you grow up.
The entire Middle East deserves this international achievement.
Qatar has truly put itself on the global football map.
Thank you, Qatar.
Oh Ali, move forward, Ali!
First, I'd like to say good morning to the viewers.
And I extend my congratulations to him and to all Qatari citizens on the hosting.
And God willing, as Sheikh Mohammed said,
It was a dream, and God willing, it will become a reality, and work will start today or during the announcement period.
Did you expect Qatar to host the World Cup in two thousand and twelve?
Why, despite having powerful allies like the United States, Japan, and Australia, were you afraid in this area on this particular issue?
No, look, if we're honest with each other, I said there's a 70% chance Qatar will get it.
This is very strong.
He has global and competing plans.
We were competitors.
Why are we afraid?
Thank God, Qatar's file was very strong and deserved it.
Truly, I am the profile of the 2022 World Cup and the host in Qatar.
How do you think the players themselves feel?
They are in the field, of course they feel very happy, God willing.
By the way, we were talking off-air, but we want to hear it on-air.
The moment of announcement.
When I could, and whenever I saw the news, I was amazed, astonished, and astonished at the crowds.
On the radio
Then all the people joined us.
They heard about the announcement.
How did you like the international media?
On the level of sports channels, everyone was supportive, especially the Arab channels, praise be to God, everyone supported us.
When they announced that Qatar had won and would host.
All Arab countries have announced their full support for Qatar, through the media, human resources, and volunteers, in the future.
Arab countries are famous for their generosity.
Shaima reached international fame in the media.
I went at that time to celebrate at the Waquif market.
Even the French Press Agency was filming there.
We had interviews with him as well.
They all cooperated, Qatar now, daily, I remember.
A hundred times a day, bearing in mind that it is the smallest place on Earth.
I think everyone knows Qatar even on the internet.
To host the 2022 World Cup
In other words, any footballer who dreams of serving his country by being on the team.
Certainly, any player, whether in the Qatari league, would like to represent the team.
So, it's a positive thing that someone works very, very hard.
Be in the league, even when you're in the league, dedicate all your efforts.
He doesn't exert himself in training or in matches because he carries the league's logo on his shirt, so he has to conserve his energy.
Look, the responsible people have made a great effort in taking care of young players, teaching them professionalism from a young age.
Taste, sleep
Tell me about your experience, you've played at different age levels. How was your experience, and which level was the most important to you?
Was, of course.
I worked my way up through the ranks, from the youth team to the first team.
Get to know camping with the club and with the league.
Every stage has its own unique character.
Yes, Lana, God willing, you were moving between
We're both getting used to your sporty side now.
We always saw you as a sportswoman. We really enjoyed watching you. We used to get sports news from you. So, how is sports going for you?
Ana, by chance, don't watch any different from talk shows, in talk shows he would ask famous stars about their lives, and in sports he would ask stars as well.
Habib Ali and others in their sports field.
On the contrary, the sports field is active.
Especially since we are the capital of sports.
And Qatar has now become the capital of world sports and football.
Instead of presenting a variety of talk shows, social, economic, and cultural programs
No different things, volleyball, basketball, different tournaments.
Still sports.
Excellent, great
Welcome, I am here.
I wish I were twenty now, not twenty-five.
So what did the young players think they had a very big chance?
I hope they take advantage of this opportunity.
This is too much for me. What do you want to tell the players?
Insha'Allah, the young players who will become a bright hobby in the coming days, Insha'Allah.
Of course, I told you this is an opportunity they need to seize.
And it's a golden opportunity.
Your understanding is of great benefit to me.
Tell us, are you busy? Are you working on new shows that you'll be presenting? We know you're coming on your vacation.
Tell us about your news, God willing.
Always keeping up with events, we are preparing for the Asian Cup to be held in January.
We've only been free from the Gulf Cup for a few days, but we'd like to congratulate Kuwait on winning the Kuwaiti League.
News programs are also available to cover events.
My first media appearance was through Qatari TV, of course my roots are from Qatar TV.
Ana shakker l-hayr alladhi hum baya'tuhu liya. I thank the good that they have brought to me.
Carry the media message on different channels.
Weather, whether it's news, sports, or other channels.
Thank you, Qatar TV.
We wish you success, we are still on the same subject.
First, I'd like to thank the management of Al-Wakrah Club.
And its people, I was in Al-Wakra Club from
My childhood
The sheikh was here with us yesterday, Sheikh Nasser was with us.
He's still at the club.
I am still the son of Al Wakrah.
But, as I told you before the show started, I'm a professional.
Dalli li every individual in Qatar
We know that young people also love sports and depend on them.
How sport became a social issue.
Media awareness primarily plays a crucial role in promoting sports across various aspects of life.
I said the youth rely on it, and schools also recognize the importance of sports in school.
For example, they celebrate what sports event?
In Qatar as well, you see signs on the streets, reflecting an awareness of sports.
Allocating seats for women in stadiums and venues.
This is an indication of women's awareness and participation in the field of sports.
And now we have the Qatar League for Women, for female players.
I believe that sport is developing.
I also think that this period
To produce large projects and develop sports awareness, I believe this period is sufficient.
If you consider and implement carefully.
Enough and necessity should be used wisely, as I said.
And also, there's one point, how does the new generation benefit from the league?
Everything is available: capabilities, experience, and equipment.
And there's also something important, praise be to God, we are in Qatar, as all Arab and Gulf societies know, we are known for our passion for sports.
How can we attract this audience to follow sports news and football matches in Qatar?
And attending the games at the same time
More people in Qatar love sports and football, but the problem is that they don't attend games.
In my opinion, when you browse web forums, you'll find that there is a great deal of interest, especially in most club forums.
No job surpasses football in popularity.
As a Qatari citizen, what do you think is the best solution to attract you to come and watch, aside from being a player or athlete?
What can we do to get the audience, like your friends, to attend?
It depends on the person themselves, there's no general concept.
Some people want to see it on TV at a house gathering.
For example, Japan, Japan created a Braille plan to attract the public in a big way.
You don't have to participate in the games, collect points, or anything, so they are looking for solutions, hopefully.
and Arabic
The most important point is that every player will be here in Qatar especially in two thousand and twenty-two, Lana, what do you think we need?
Aside from financial support, what do you really think we need?
Providing the means to make them ready as a Qatari league and participate in a major tournament, the World Cup.
Time passes quickly with good people. When the director told me time was up, I said, "Really, God willing."
We always achieve the impossible, realizing the dream we thought was impossible. Thank God, we live it in reality.
As Sheikh Mohammed said, it was a moment of celebration, but the hard work begins.
And God willing, 2022 will be an event worthy of the name Qatar.
Congratulations to all who live in Qatar and truly, Qatar has become a global landmark.
To host two years and twenty-two days.
Thank you, Lana, the creative presenter. I wish you success, and I will always watch your shows to stay updated with sports news.
Thank you, certainly happiness.
Qatari Youth Talents
They sang a new type of song that's popular now.
Repeat with music and a fast rhythm.
And also a rap crew of amateurs, God willing.
Stay with us, we're starting now and good morning.
We're trying to take a look at the subject.
We can define rap briefly as a fast music.
What is a repeat performance, but not a rapid rhythmic singing of the song lyrics?
Dali uses many weights and addresses different topics and problems.
It can be personal sometimes.
Social, emotional, or political.
It's not quiet.
It's largely free.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
But he returns it.
He is praising his voice, which they consider a secondary element.
Generally, sound isn't important in rap songs.
That's why he's not called a singer, but a rapper or MC.
Rapper's care about these elements in songs:
For example, the flow of sound, the flow of sounds, coherence and conveyance.
They have followers, fans, and supporters.
They have a special style of singing.
And I want you to know that they will give you a better idea than me personally.
Good morning, hello.
The first thing was a period when we wanted to do something new.
When it's something special.
That's why we ask, "Why do we rap?"
And rap is an art present in all countries of the world.
Therefore, why is she absent in Qatar?
We said we'd try something new.
We gave him an idea containing a message.
We are talking about the advantages and disadvantages that occur in society.
So, we send a letter first and second, it's an art.
This is one of the fine arts, for the viewer's information, it has addressed many social and psychological issues among young people in a dramatic way.
Time changes, and this works; we want time to change.
Before, there was little acceptance.
We've been singing, since about two thousand and five, acceptance was slow at first.
We say that our new beginning was in 2010.
No acceptance and popularity more.
People want to sing and perform in a rap style now, have you seen that?
Yes, of course, a high percentage of people.
And what else is there? We see and talk about it. You were the founders of many teams.
Beautiful band and I think you have concerts, can we talk about this band?
How was it founded, how did the idea come about that someone could form a band, and how many are there of you in this band?
At first, we were before we were a gang.
I've been living in Doha since 2005.
This shows that anyone who loves the concept of rap and can rap, can sing and release it on the site.
I can carry, Salman can carry, someone can carry, so there was a competition.
We met people.
So, we started competing with each other.
Then, after a while, after all these years, we reached the year two thousand and ten.
Before 2010, there was a group system, meaning each group on its own, and every three or four groups were together.
We said why don't we unite as one group under the name Qatar Rappers.
Or English rap.
We agreed on that, so we said under one name, and we are all one hand together.
And we attach this to the foot and say the same idea.
Approximately twenty-five people.
Twenty-five, wow! God willing, a large group.
So, does anyone here play or or or do you all rap?
Formatting and Composition.
You can say it's a personal thing.
Excellent, how would the organization of these twenty-five be? How would the organization of this number in the band be?
Everyone has their own abilities.
So that means everyone in the band can make a complete song.
Without the help of anyone else
Capabilities can be different, for example if Salman is better than me.
I'm listening to him and telling you to change the words here, change something.
Each one can turn into the other.
We help each other a little.
Or a company that disowns you, until an official entity disowns these actions.
And there will be the right distributors.
Let the work be done in a luxurious style, and make sure it's something official for you.
Frankly, we hope to receive support, and we got this support from a company that came and adopted us by producing an album for us.
We don't have a problem.
Some matters are a bit difficult.
Why do you think the first move should come from you?
Why might an individual be introduced to the first CD?
Later, you can bring in companies, what do you think?
Around 2007, I worked on CD releases.
I divided it among my friends.
How was the order?
I believe.
Slowly because in 2007 rap might not have been prevalent in the Gulf.
Not like how it's popular now.
We were talking before we went on air about great groups like Palenque and Castro.
Shall we talk about it?
They said they're organizing the party for you.
They completed all the costs, procedures, coordination, and work; we honestly didn't expect this level.
Frankly, we were surprised and it was a great job.
He was a bit nervous because there were no ads and nothing before the show.
There were no ads or anything two days before the party.
We think no one will come because the notice was short.
They weren't inside before the party started.
That was a good point.
This means that our voice reached the elderly as well, not just the youth.
We thought the idea would appeal to young people.
At this point, we realized that many age groups were listening to us.
Is this a particular song that the audience loves?
Viewers interact with the majority of the songs.
Yes, most songs, but there were a lot of songs and I was very young.
The whole group
What are words, how do they deal with different subjects?
We're talking about the current situation.
At least, even if it is *
Law kallo, qabl * translates to "If not now, when?"
Be destroyed.
In other words, there's a rhyme.
We ponder every word and try to find better synonyms.
Sure, do you have some songs? Can we listen to one of them?
One of the songs you produced
We hear it and see the public's opinion.
I hope they like the words.
Thank you, Ali. I liked the introduction because it mentioned the name of my program.
Had a KD and DJ MREldoha program
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
KJ Hada Mrs Bobo with SKT one hot to body
Don't forget, the show airs at nine thirty. Everyone has to watch.
Producer: Hasan Al-Naama, Presenter: Shaima Al-Hamd
The director is Nasser Al-Malki, and the guests are Qatar's rappers, of course.
Because it actually has the name of the program, thanks guys!
I have to shake your hand for you and the people in the control room.
We broadcast it yesterday.
And who wrote the lyrics, or is it like that?
Everyone writes their word.
It's necessary to write to Joseph.
They didn't write it because of their love for music and passion.
I think you should write about the 2022 World Cup and the Asian Cup, I think if you are able to.
Of course, personally, we'll write a song about this topic.
But, I don't think it can be formal at this stage.
Think about including patriotic songs.
"Through Rap art"
Yes, seriously, today, everyone.
We're seeing it live now.
The cup has arrived and the streets of Doha are decorated.
So, viewers, as we've seen, Doha is decorated to celebrate the Asian Cup.
The concerned agencies have made all preparations to host.
And it will be the largest crowd.
I think they'll crowd the corniche side.
They confirmed they are ready to host this important sporting event.
Will there be any parties in the coming days?
No offers from the authorities, they promised to bring you a show.
But, still, there are some complications.
There are some procedures and issues, so we're still not sure.
As we were trying, if I met Youssef and saw
Some of them, I have a song topic,
If we found that the song suited him.
And the possibility of implementing them.
We were greeted at home.
And then send it to Youssef by email.
This island is from the song of Yusuf.
By any chance, are you traveling abroad?
In this region with millions of fans
Don't just copy, but listen to those who are ahead in this field.
And we try to be competitive.
Why don't you take some ideas and copy some things?
And whatever, I'll take the idea and do it in a different way in a song.
I formed a band and they have more than one album.
A person named Abdullah Al-Daeel
He has the experience and ability to detect groundwater.
This talent is the ability to discover underground water reservoirs.
One of the residents of the city of Marrat.
This is very common among experts.
Who determines the location of groundwater before drilling?
Dally needs or might need to dig some wells somewhere with water.
With the help of copper rods and pomegranate branches
Or tin, through which water stores can be identified.
What tools are used?
To discover groundwater
This was in ancient times.
Now, it has been replaced by a copper column.
We place the two sticks parallel to each other.
And he walked slowly.
We notice, when we walk by a stream
The scythes are going to open.
Now, we're passing through a waterway.
It opens like this.
That's just how it is when you're crossing over.
Now we are in the middle of a watercourse.
And here, it will be the middle.
Thus, in this way, we can determine the path of water or groundwater in the ground.
And the learning is repeated more than once in more than one place so that we can focus on the most intense place.
Abu Ibrahim confirmed.
In reaching an advanced stage of this profession.
For his discoveries to be very accurate.
In Marrakech, outside Marrakech, in Essaouira, in Agadir, and in Ouarzazate.
More than one hundred and fifty good wells have been discovered.
The error rate is not more than five percent.
It requires training, experience, and a gift from God.
Strikes modern equipment and laboratories.
In a short while
Abdurrahman al-Marshed
Doha Morning Show
Murt, northwest of the Saudi capital, Riyadh
We have seen this report and your promises of more reports from Arab and international countries.
And the Gulf countries, if God wills.
And we arrived at different places but with different addresses.
Important meaning
I believe there is a large group of Gulf youth in the Gulf.
Do you follow certain characters as a guide?
Let him not continue.
There's not much difference between all the Gulf rappers in general.
What is a contest, I mean if I produce a song?
Dell is just a specific topic.
We could call it a meaningful competition.
We're connected, but no one is me.
In Qatar, there are churches, God willing.
She has a fan and a CD.
Many companies want to adopt it.
Do you want to reach this point, hopefully exceed this point more and more, God willing.
We wish you unparalleled luck on this journey.
Here, upon receiving the cup, let's see some clips from Cornwall.
In addition to a group of Qatari youth
"He, who can be understood from the West, is a Gulf poet."
No rap music, but also a unique band of 25 people.
It's very important for us to stay in touch with you so we can know your news.
If you assume that you have an email, a website, or a forum.
How do people communicate with you?
You had your own website.
There were some issues with the hosting company.
"Sometimes, for some reason, it becomes clear."
Eventually, we faced many problems and closed it.
What's the use, the site will glitch and not close.
So, what can we do? What are the alternatives to solve this problem?
United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, and even Morocco and Egypt
You need to stay in touch with them to keep up with the latest news and the songs they release from time to time.
What's your alternative now?
Currently, we rely on special pages like
In the name of whom
OK, what happens when you search for our name on Google?
Qatar's rap or Qatar's rappers
See if you can produce your own video.
For the program, I worked on it yesterday.
You've uploaded many videos to YouTube.
Songs with pictures
Song and the same thing, with pictures
We need to see you improve more.
You need a place where you can all gather instead of each of you having equipment at home.
Mixer, piano, computer, and guitar.
Frankly, I hope we find support.
For example, a company.
CD production
A special place was allocated for us.
I'm working on our behalf.
No good today, might as well work for ourselves.
We don't want this.
What is different from what Yusuf said.
We need a video clip.
And the owl.
Music videos go viral quickly.
He is more easily swayed by ideas.
If there's support, it'll work out in the end.
And your beautiful voice will be everywhere.
It's a type of art that deals with various topics and issues.
Thank you, Youssef Al-Naemi and Salman Al-Abdullah, for coming.
Let's see it and wish each other success from our program, friends.
These projects were, yes.
There's no project ready yet, but it needs some technical development.
Expiry Date
When you go to the cashier, you have the total and all the details.
Recognize goods instead of reading the components of each item.
In series with the cart
Related to the garage, so he can choose the material he wants.
Most of these projects reflect children's feelings about the problem.
You have a lot of activities and goals.
The center offers a range of programs and activities that focus on one central idea.
We have ten objectives set by Her Highness Sheikha Moza in establishing the center.
No, we want
Take it straight from his house to the underground train.
He is handsome, but his mind is on clothes.
All stores in Qatar that sell curtain shirts.
It might be with the car key, I press the button.
Looking for my lost items led me to the key.
Soft, shall we go back to the projects that the center will work on?
Teach children while they are young.
Skills development and talent adoption
So, it varies according to different children's skills, media, and research skills.
Personal skills, such as public speaking, persuading audiences
Skills vary, and we've developed a special program to cater to them.
We started with Photo Media, we did very well in this project, we reached the end of it, we graduated from the project.
We also got numbers from children and young speakers.
And their creativity...
Do you have young presenters?
For television, it's very important that they show children's programs.
I want them to prepare for television.
Through their TV, Qatar TV
We support them until they reach the age of eighteen.
We welcome them wherever they are.
This is the National Television.
We need to attract, identify, and develop these talents.
Either media or research.
Intellectual dimensions
Reading and diverse other fields
Is there collaboration? Do you exchange ideas?
In all fields, such as the Promise Speakers program supported by the Ministry of Awqaf.
Our exhibition, the Generation Exhibition, is also...
The scientific club played a significant role in improving projects and also provided technical support.
The main role was played by the Higher Education Council, through supporting schools and partners.
Sayyid Abdulla, move to a building like Katara.
Dale includes various types of activities and clubs as well.
Do you consider this a step forward towards greater success?
In addition to moving to a separate building
Regardless of the very large place
Dealing with the public is easy.
He is a pioneer and has unique projects.
And in receiving the guest and introducing them to the programs presented to the child
This is our big project for the next three years.
National Project for the Development of Reading
Sponsored by Her Highness Sheikhha Hessa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani
She took on this project and supports it.
A big project, will be reading development, writing a story, and developing children.
Various cultural skills are particularly associated with reading.
Certainly, there are different programs.
"Let's go ahead and move."
And we'll be rearranging some of the activities.
Design and develop it to be suitable for visitors to Qatar.
We wish you success, through this center.
It contains very important ideas.
First, I'd like to thank you for hosting.
The most important thing is that, just as we deal with the boys, we also discover that
Today our cub is different from our cub.
They need more care, focus, and time.
Listen to his interests, his fantasies.
Connect with him mentally.
Hell ... %pw, the way they treat their children is like a hotel, providing accommodation.
Go to a bank, get money.
Children really need someone to listen to their thoughts and imaginations.
In the past few days, they transferred us to 2030.
At this exhibition
I wish success to the winning projects.
Thank you for being here, Mr. Abdullah Al-Jaml, Director of the Children's Culture Center. We wish you success.
Why do these projects become realistic and never remain a dream forever?
Ladies and gentlemen, the Children's Culture Center was launched last night at the Diplomats' Club.
Celebrating the Closure of the National Exhibition of Future Generations' Dreams under the Slogan "Dreams of Generations: Realities or the Nation of Tomorrow"
Organized on the occasion of Qatar's National Day, with the participation of more than seventy children from Qatar.
There were many activities and several competitions at the exhibition.
Creative projects for children
Welcome Mr. Abdullah Al-Jumaily, Director of the Children's Culture Center, good morning and welcome.
Good morning, my dear sister.
First, I'd like to thank you for the time you gave us.
Let's talk about this exhibition, it's truly unique.
We are happy to be with you in the program to cover as many activities of the exhibition as possible.
This is the national exhibition of the dreams of a generation.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, this exhibition.
In contribution to the Center for Children's Culture
National Day Celebration
Who was *
Stabilizing the children
Live with a dream.
In the project
This project or dream
Children's thoughts are very broad.
We limited it to twenty or thirty.
And other key areas of Qatar's Vision, 2030
We started training children in four stages.
One-eighth, considering the mechanism of brainstorming and the tools that expand the scope of thinking.
What do you mean exactly by this sentence?
Facts over Nation's Tomorrow
Why, anything a child wishes for today.
He grows up and the project grows.
In fact, that was the true interpretation of the vision, that the children live from today.
I dream big.
Whether it's environmental, health-related, human development, or any other field.
State patronage
I think when we know there are children somewhere
Or at a specific exhibition
All that was available through
The exhibition, there were also guest of honor.
For teenagers to learn from, as great role models.
Because, two or three days ago was *
There were also violinists who won various awards in the Gulf Cooperation Council.
They had a schedule for presenting their projects.
Yes, the pictures are the best proof of what you say.
This is a collection of pictures from the exhibition and various activities.
Here is the owner of the latest project, the forest.
No, we don't want to talk about the black balls.
This is a brilliant idea, we can simplify it for the viewers, it's one of the children's innovations.
What exactly is this substance, the colorful ball, that we're talking about?
Suddenly, there are four or five projects dealing with this subject, one of them is the colored ball.
They also call the smart professor.
He doesn't kick the ball out of bounds.
The colors differ.
Assuming that in the future, this will greatly help in matches.
What next, after all these dreams?
And be attached to things related to his field of interest.
I believe especially when there are responsible people who take these small projects from small minds into consideration.
But who knows, maybe these projects will serve us, says the president of the Football Federation.
Think about the idea of the colorful ball.
Does he want it?
Often, he visited projects related to soccer.
Supported us and approved these projects after seeing them.
And enter other projects as well.
Why didn't our children do it? People also voted for many of the projects.
Okay, which projects were present at the location and received the most votes from people?
No committee can assess them; they have a way to evaluate projects.
The first, second, and third projects that won the awards.
The forest, won the first prize.
I was very precise in the details of the projects, and the project is ready for implementation.
Of course, you need many administrative elements.
There were many detailed aspects in the brochure distributed to visitors.
Certainly these are the images we see now.
hadik biza3 almeeshari3at alkebira This is a phrase in Arabic that translates to: "That's the place for big businesses"
Maybe they're trying to do what they see in movies and cartoons.
Indeed, part of it was taken by the institutions.
For example, I'll name the projects. Are these the projects?
Have sex, use it, and return it.
From two hundred and seventy-seven students
Qatar University celebrated yesterday the graduation of 247 students from the 33rd batch.
And His Excellency Dr. Khalid bin Mohammed Al Attiyah, Minister of State for International Cooperation
A large number of parents and faculty members
And today, the university celebrates the graduation of seven hundred and seventeen students.
We would like to thank our colleague Salman Al-Muwahhid, and we will remain in the same artistic atmosphere. Today, we will be with a dear guest.
From the Tasanif family, the actor Abdelhamid Charshani.
He asserts himself through numerous works such as Hearts for Rent,
They worked hard to prove themselves in the field of art.
Especially since the field of art is unfamiliar with praise.
Why?
Thank you and good morning. I'd like to say good morning to the viewers.
No, I'm influenced by the show's staff and cast.
We're going to watch a very short clip of your work, and then I'll start talking to you.
Are you laughing at me?
Take the fake coat and bring the original.
Go and get it.
You have the coat, you'll bring it again.
What? Give me the blanket, bring it back! How am I supposed to bring it back?
She has already ground the maize in her stomach, shame.
I am a member of a five-member committee.
High Committee of the Conference
That's not it.
I have no objections.
This is a sample, a short part of a series that we will see the second part of.
We would like to ask you about your participation this year in Part Two.
Could you take us on a tour of your parts in the Tsanif series, where each episode covers a different topic?
What is your contribution? Can you tell us about it?
Certainly, afterwards.
I passed by her place at that time.
Marat is also famous for the mountains.
I valued what the poets always glorified.
What dates have witnessed and remain in her memory.
And it shows how old its history is.
71 kilometers north of the capital Riyadh.
And some people believe it was named after Amr bin Qays al-Tamimi.
It is distinguished by its antiquity, the sweetness of its water, and the purity of its air.
Poets were inspired by him and enamored with him. He was renowned for the most part by Mount Cometh.
They call it Wadi Kmit.
Certainly, Madinat Marid is an ancient city.
It existed before Islam.
There were some old things with an unknown history like Khalid ibn al-Walid's well.
We're in it now.
The great companion Khalid ibn al-Walid (may Allah be pleased with him) ordered the digging of this well when he passed through during the Ridda Wars.
It still remains to this day.
Wisdom says "be silent," and I silence you many times.
Whether I saw him once or many times.
Another effect is the Qumayt Valley.
Why did he endure this hardship for so many years?
It was enough for the city for a whole year.
From the beginning of the rainy season until the next rainy season.
And the date of establishment of these ruins is unknown.
One of these is the bride and one of these is...
Jabal Komait is one of the landmarks of the city of Marrat.
There were many proverbs and poems built upon this mountain.
Many people from all over the kingdom come to him.
One of the important sites is the Well of Al-Waleed.
He had a position in Mecca during the Ridda wars while he was on his way to Al-Yamamah.
He ordered him to put it there and told the men to dig this well.
I am among the people who drink from its water and wash with it.
Yaqut al-Hamawi mentioned in Mu'jam al-Buldān that Khalid passed through Marrat.
An old mud house was restored to its original state.
It consists of various sections reflecting the architecture, heritage, and antiquities of the region.
The poet said of her before: "When we came to the water, it was enchanted water."
We came to Wadi Kamit, not Wadi Al-Anajil.
Sir Ayman, God willing, there is cooperation between the family, the guardians, the center, and the child as well.
And I believe there are different ways in which he can be with you at the same time.
It's fine for him to miss the training session.
Regardless of whether it's the trainee, the student, or the child that comes to us.
This record contains his full personal information.
Even his monthly grades, for example, he has a rating every month.
We were responsible for the minds program.
In every four sessions, there is a report.
The guard through the password and username,
We promised him, can he come up?
Yes, he sees the level he has reached, translating at the center for a long time until now.
Yes, we have different models to look at.
We have a daughter.
With Mr. Ibrahim, who will make peace with us later.
We'll see different models, it would be better if we had enough space.
But we came up with a girl model.
You undergo different tests before going on air.
We'll ask her math questions and various questions.
We'll take a short break and then I'll be back with you to show you this smart girl, stay tuned.
The actor performs, the audience is very intelligent now.
If he does what takes him from the first ring or the second ring or the third ring, if his feeling doesn't care about the work, it will be done by the remote.
He's going to do it himself, he has twenty thousand other things to do.
Correct, twenty thousand series, correct.
Twenty thousand episodes. Some people don't have that, they focus on one work.
He is able to watch other performances.
Thus, this is the majority.
She claims that I only watch TV during Ramadan.
Of course, we welcome you among us, our esteemed guest Abdul Hamid Sharshani.
Do you want to say something to the audience or to your admirers who love you? Of course, I am one of your admirers.
Hello, do you want to say something?
And tell them, "Happy New Year."
We really don't go out much, don't show up much, and don't do much, for the reason I told you before.
What's coming will be better.
Insha'Allah, we wish you all the best in your endeavors this year.
God willing, we'll have another interview with you to talk about those plays.
Everything leads to everything else.
Fashion tables are very popular among many people and are awaited by lovers of new trends.
Welcome, dear viewers, to our live broadcast from the morning of Doha.
Certainly today we are talking about the Skills Development Center and a group of students who have registered at this center.
This center provides various sciences.
Certainly, they focus on developing the second abilities.
And also to make their minds work fully.
Mrs. Nesma and Mr. Ayman Khalegly, Head of the Skills Development Center
Hello and good morning.
Welcome aboard.
And we have with us the beautiful Omaima, good morning Omaima.
Good morning.
How old are you, sweetheart?
I am in the seventh grade.
God willing, we wish you all the best.
What things are provided for our sons and daughters?
This has already been discussed with Mr. Ayman and Ms. Nesma, and it was specifically tailored for the well-being of our children.
Minds Math Mental Program
Finger counting and abacus.
To achieve certain goals, we need to reveal a small part of them.
Have you noticed, Sir Ibrahim, if there is a difference among the students in the first two days?
And after maybe three or four months?
Whether taught in public, private, or even independent schools,
Basically, the program scientifically works on specific methods.
After I passed the first level of the program,
Why are they bringing back the old bootlegs or continuing to develop them?
Has the child reached a certain stage or what updates have occurred?
We are aiming to work in a scientific way, a scientific program.
What are some of the methods and mechanisms that are regularly applied?
Using scientific technology in an organized manner.
Before the start of the program and after taking this lesson or the levels he has gone through.
Mr. Ibrahim is with us now, as you can see, viewers. Omaima is one of the students who have registered at this center.
We wanted to do it live today, so you viewers can see the importance of this.
If you're bringing the bisht, I have no objections.
This is a very fast and very small part of a series of classifications that you will see the second part of.
But as we watched this part of the series, it reminded us of the first season.
Could you tell us a bit about your roles in the series "Tsanif" where each episode covers a different topic?
This year, the trend is that...
Unexpected spike in virtue
Encourage by providing opportunities.
Sixteen episodes in the second season.
He was a ringmaster in a circus, in one ring he was a sheik, and in another he was a baker.
So, let's make different types of rings.
Mr. Ghanem Al-Sulaiti is from Qatar.
We have representatives from Qatar.
I can't recall many actors right now. Of course, we have actresses from Bahrain like Zahra Ebrahim and Ebtisam Abdullah.
We don't have
Faisal Rashid and Mahmoud Adel.
Tara, hello
Without Tara, the young actors won't perform.
We now have few jobs in Qatar. There are two jobs per year.
Qatar Television, which also produces dramatic works, tells us this as well?
Qatar TV provides an executive producer.
The TV channel did their best, but they only produce one show a year and all the Qatari actors want to work.
That was the reason.
I responded to you. It's just one series, and all Qatari actors want to work on it.
So, if someone finds a scene, they should thank God.
Thank God for everything.
Therefore, let's go back to your beginnings.
Certainly, I'd like to thank him very much.
I consult him on various matters.
Of course, the actor Abdulaziz Jassim is among the best of humans, even after the dispersion, yes or no.
In his plays, we started working with him in theater when he became the first executive producer. Abdulaziz Jassim, we worked with him for television and theater.
For it is He who has adopted us, taught us, and made us.
Then came Mr. Ghaniem in his lifetime, and did the best he could, in the flood of 2000.
Because he gives us opportunities as youth.
They have thirty to thirty and thirty tasks a year.
We have two jobs a year, thank you, thank you Tara.
"The Deadly Feeling" is a production of Tara Arts.
The director responsible for the series is Mr. Monir %PW.
We're back, dear viewers. Today, we'll be talking about interactive medicine.
A letter by word, a word by hand.
This treatment has been practiced for a long time.
We have a guest.
The exam format is as follows.
"They're small, the degree of pain."
Look inside the hand, you want to feel like there's something like sand or broken veins inside the hand.
Relax your hand.
Mr. Sahbi has another nerve.
I felt stressed and tense.
Left side.
Now, dear followers, we are examining the left side of his body.
Let them know what we're doing.
Both health problems will be apparent. Now we know about the headaches and dizziness he experiences.
Is there any pain?
Pain means problem.
Problem! What does "problem" mean in this context?
In this case, the sinuses, the ear.
Does he have a tremor? Do you have a sinus problem or any previous issues?
I had an operation, but that was a long time ago.
Is this tonsillitis or what?
He gains weight even though he doesn't eat much.
Sweet, your left shoulder.
This is because of the nerve; when I told him he had a tense nerve.
Ten years ago, he walked barefoot on the beach.
We don't know when someone walks on the beach, I want to remember that they're emptying.
Both the uneven land is not mine.
Negative energy may %PW.
And he was surprised that you discovered these things through the massage.
Certainly, children are the most important.
Oh boys, praise be to God. This is for mother, focus with me!
Why does he suffer from milk and the food he eats?
Her child is parallel to her, she will put it down and the child will automatically close.
Close your hand.
I'm fine, thank God.
She will find it in a few seconds and the child will be happy. First, she will be stuck by the mother due to the pain here.
After that, you'll see the gases suddenly escape.
What are the discoveries you are making, Mr. Abdulaziz?
In addition to other problems, people are now suffering from arthritis, bone issues, headaches, thyroid problems, and obesity.
The second thing for periodic pain or menstrual pain in general.
By focusing on a rock or stone, by pressing here, you command the Almighty God over lower back and period problems. If you have pain,
In a few seconds, God willing.
Pregnant woman
Delivery has become easier for her.
Either here or there, God knows best.
They told her she might give birth in the seventh month or she might give birth in the ninth.
Except on the sands.
If you walk on sand, it's fine, but if you walk on stones, no.
She must eat seven soft dates for breakfast; soft dates are better.
If she doesn't have soft dates, ripe ones are enough.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. I seek refuge in Allah from Satan, the rejected. My discovery is from the Quran.
"You claim that God was unable to remove this soft date from its place, but He was indeed able."
Thank God, and I seek refuge from the word 'I'.
She must bring one of the stones or small balls.
Belly button connection. For example, if you forget and come to the belly button connection bed, hold hands.
You will see in private hospitals, an Eastern lady will come.
This is common in East Asia.
No need, you have my mobile number now.
Just the mobile!
To cooperate with each other, I advise everyone who is listening to me now.
Give freely and abundantly, and you will be blessed. You were created to worship God first and foremost.
First of all, it's about serving people. Secondly, I'm not a religious scholar or a sheikh; I'm an ordinary man.
Thank you, Mr. Abdulaziz, for this wonderful conversation, and thank you as well for our guest.
Thank you for coming, and I wish you all the best.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al Thani, Director of Public Health at the Supreme Council of Health, will tell you more about that.
Good morning, Sheikh.
Let's start with a look at these activities.
Healthy Steps Program towards Qatar
The program is part of the national strategy to combat obesity.
Since more than four of the top obese countries in the world are Gulf states.
We launched a strategy in the Supreme Council of Health, of course with the Ministry of Education and other authorities, to combat obesity.
They're afraid of its further spread soon.
One of the programs to combat obesity is Healthy Steps for Qatar.
We can organize the competition together, making it an international one.
The program consists of six weeks.
Every week is different from the next.
To raise awareness among seventh and eighth-grade students about the importance of health at this age,
Because at that age, they don't know themselves.
In the first week, as you remember, it was about what is your favorite fruit?
The second week passed.
You need to walk! Every time you walk, you earn points.
This is a map of Qatar. Every time someone doesn't get points, they move and their school and class advance.
A beautiful competition was created among the students.
In the second week, only water is drunk, we do not want tea to be drunk.
We tell him to drink water, but he doesn't. He always drinks a lot of cola and doesn't feel thirsty, so he doesn't drink water!
Then, in the fourth week, your favorite sport.
At school, there are some games that some people don't like.
Let's focus on the sport he loves.
We can make him exercise.
The child is eating a healthy meal.
And their families know that they have to make their children eat a healthy meal.
And Al Jazeera Academy, an academy for girls and girls, so we can take.
Of course, this is a pilot project, and if it succeeds, God willing, we will increase the scope in the coming years.
The students are happy and feel more energetic.
We need more games, we enjoyed a lot with our colleagues.
The girls say their skin is better now, the pimples have decreased.
Like this, like this, and awareness happens.
Parents know about their children.
And their brothers in the other classes ask him, "How are you?" and they learn from their brothers.
And God has begun to spread that many schools are eager to participate next year from now.
Inshallah.
Qtel was the official sponsor in supporting this.
We had the Aspire Zone, which hosted sports competitions and awareness events.
Ali Ali Ali Ali is on the dining table.
Thank God for all these authorities, some of whom I remember and some I've forgotten.
Thanks to God, everyone participated with a part.
And otherwise, the brothers did that in the form of separate lessons, curricula, or
There was variety.
We tried to do different types and involve as many people as possible.
She is the future generation.
To disseminate or promote this experience as much as possible in Qatar.
You don't have anything to critique, you need to fix that.
After its recent spread and its grateful results.
Insha'Allah we will spread because there are people asking us why we weren't present.
Eat, eat healthy food and achieve this, you won't have any problems.
What we have in this age, starting from a young age, is reaching what they love before they reach twenty or twenty-five.
Your Highness mentioned a series of titles, each group has a title.
If we return, we'll try in our section today to be about closing events.
And if we remember correctly, in our program, we had more than one guest.
We repeat, what information do we want to provide to the students every week?
Sweet, of course, first of all, the first week is your favorite fruit.
Each chapter was about fruits and their benefits.
What are the benefits of fruits rich in vitamin C?
So he began to like some fruits, not all fruits were his enemies.
He may be sensitive to one or two, but why not eat the rest?
The second week passed, people think walking is only for the elderly, why should young people walk?
What does it mean when I grow up, I'll walk?
On the contrary, you walk to rest your mind and head.
And it makes the individual want to go for a walk, as it improves mental clarity.
You took the students on tours.
Yes, they were all obliged to walk, whether at home or at school.
They record their points through the class teacher.
They didn't walk today.
That was an event; here people walked, the girls' school walked.
We want them to love this, be creative with unique ideas.
The spirit of competition and professors should think outside the box; instead of giving them ideas to comment on, we want them to come up with their own.
Everyone has a skill in this field.
Of course, the third week is about drinking water, all the time we try to make them drink water, so they don't feel thirsty and crave soft drinks.
Of course, the fourth week is your favorite sport.
If we could discover his favorite sport and encourage him in it,
He will be interested in sports.
He loves sports by playing them, he plays sports unconsciously.
We said before that we would talk about the Qatari Association for Multiple Sclerosis.
Welcome our guests today in today's episode who are with us in the studio.
Thank you.
We are happy to be with you at this show.
And part of that illness that some of us haven't heard about.
Initially, as the Egyptians say, we will go straight to the point.
Chronic illness
That affects the nervous system in the human body.
The period between twenty and forty years.
The patient still doesn't have medication, and the cause of her suffering is unknown.
It affects the active group in society, usually the youth.
A treatment used for patients suffering from cancer, may God protect you from any harm or other illnesses.
This disease is an infection in the brain neuron and spinal neuron.
The central nervous system in the human body is located in the brain and spinal cord.
The body assumes that a foreign body has entered the body.
The neuron is
Cover this wire.
White cells or white blood cells start to kill or dissolve this insulating layer.
What led to the lack of access to nerve signals, attenuation, or interference.
Leads to paralysis, may God protect you.
Despite advancements in medicine, there is still no cure for this disease.
Sweet, apart from the solutions, we want to know how we get it.
So, one must be cautious about this matter.
The main reason for that is quality of life, the nature of food, or circles of life?
Or what is the precise direct cause that leads a person to suffer from this disease.
All we have now are theories.
Even after marriage.
They are trying to solve human health problems.
Yes, yes.
All these topics can be somewhat controversial in society.
So far, we don't know the cause.
Nice, the age group that might have this disease, multiple sclerosis.
Of both sexes.
Of course, after the disease appears after forty years, it slows down with the person.
So far, we haven't found a cure for this disease.
Is this evidence of a large number of people in the Gulf, the Arab world, or are we talking about Qatar?
In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, statistics indicate that they have twenty-five thousand cases.
And Qatar too.
Just last week, I heard about three or four infected cases.
Currently, we have one hundred and twenty-five patients, that's what's recorded in the files.
And many people, when they get such a disease, go for treatment in other countries.
"Mashallah, Mr. Abdulaziz, are there any effects like someone who has gotten this disease?"
Will there be any signs that tell the patient's family or the patient themselves that they are living with multiple sclerosis?
This virus, for example, is deadly.
We must be clear about this, it's not a virus.
Because nerve disease, the nerve controls the whole body.
In attributing a specific reason to a particular place, or type of food, or lifestyle.
