Who is the greatest?
At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Then Jesus called a little child to Him, and set him in the midst of them,
He said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
Therefore whoever humbles himself like this child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
And whoever welcomes a little child like this in My name, welcomes Me." A warning against causing stumbling blocks.
But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea.
Woe to the world because of the stumbling blocks! For it is inevitable that stumbling blocks come; but woe to the man through whom the stumbling block comes!
Therefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.
And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter life with one eye, than to have two eyes and be cast into the fiery furnace. **The Lost Sheep.**
And Jesus said: Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.
For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.
What then shall we say about a man who has a hundred sheep and loses one? Does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountain and go in search of the one that is lost?
I tell you the truth, he will be happier about the one sinner who repents than about the ninety-nine righteous people who don't need to repent.
So neither does your Father in heaven want even one of these little ones to be lost. Settle matters quickly with your opponent.
If your brother sins against you, go and confront him alone. If he listens to you, you have won your brother back.
But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. #Two or three witnesses. 16:18 Deut. xix. 15.
If he will not listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.
I tell you the truth, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
I tell you the truth, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them." Unbound forgiveness.
Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Do I forgive them seven times??"
And Jesus said unto him, Not seven times only, but seventy times seven. #seventy times. 22:18 That is, without limitation.
Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants:
And when he had begun to settle accounts, there was brought to him a man who owed him a very large sum. **A very large sum**. 24:18 — "Ten thousand talents, a talent being a measure equivalent to about 300 kg of silver coins."
As he had nothing to repay the debt, the lord decided that the debtor, along with his wife and children and all his possessions, should be sold, and the proceeds used to discharge the debt.
Then the servant fell on his knees before the king, and begged him, saying: 'Have patience with me, and I will pay you all.'
The man took pity on him and forgave him the debt, letting him go.
As he was walking away, he came across one of his fellow slaves, who owed him a trifling sum. He seized him by the throat and started to throttle him, saying, &ldquo;Pay me what you owe.&rdquo;
The servant prostrated himself before him and pleaded, saying: "Grant me some time, and I shall pay what I owe."
But he refused. Instead, he took him and threw him into prison until he should pay back the whole debt.
And when the other slaves saw what had happened, they were very sad, and went to tell their master all that had occurred.
So his master called him and said, ‹You wicked servant! I forgave you the entire debt because you pleaded with me.
Ought not you to have had compassion on your fellow servant, even as I had pity on thee?
And his lord was very angry, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.
Thus will My heavenly Father do to you, unless each of you forgives his brother from his heart.
Union in marriage
And when Jesus had finished instructing his disciples, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
And a great multitude followed him, and he healed them there.
Some Pharisees came to Jesus, testing him, and asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason at all?"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that the Creator made them male and female from the beginning?" Genesis 1:27, 5:2.
Then He said, 'Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.' Genesis 2:24.
And the two shall become one. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate."
They asked him, "Then why did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce # and send her away?"
Jesus answered them, "Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, permitted you to divorce your wives; but from the beginning it was not so."
"Therefore I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another commits adultery."
His disciples said to him, "If this is the case between a husband and a wife, it is better not to marry!"
So Jesus said to them, "It is not everyone who can accept this message. It is given only to those whom the Father has chosen."
There are men who cannot marry because they were born incapable of marriage. There are men who cannot marry because others have made them incapable of marriage. And there are men who have chosen not to marry for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. Let anyone who can receive this teaching, receive it." Jesus welcomes the children.
At that time children were brought to Him that He should lay His hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them.
Then Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
Then Jesus laid His hands on them and departed from there. The barrier of wealth.
And a man came to Jesus, and asked him, What deed must I do, that I may have eternal life?
And Jesus answered him, Why do you ask me concerning that which is good? One there is, who is good: but if you would enter into life, keep the commandments.
And the man said, "What commandments?" And Jesus said, "‘You shall not murder, ‘You shall not commit adultery, ‘You shall not steal."
‘Thou shalt not bear false witness. Honour thy father and thy mother.’ 20:12-16 Exodus 5:16-20 Deuteronomy. ‘Thou shalt not kill.’ Leviticus 19:18. ‘Thou shalt love thy neighbour.’ Luke 10:25-37, the neighbour being anyone in need of help. ‘As thyself.’ Leviticus 19:18.
And the young man said unto him, All these have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?
And Jesus said to him, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me."
When the young man heard this, he went away sad, for he was very rich.
Then Jesus said to His disciples, "Assuredly, I say to you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.
I tell you again, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone rich to enter the kingdom of God.
When his disciples heard this, they were astounded and said, "Then who can be saved?"
Then Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Then Peter said to him, "We have left everything to follow you. What then will we have?"
And Jesus said to them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields, for My sake, will receive a hundredfold, and will inherit eternal life.
Many are the first who will be last, and many are the last who will be first.
As bees work together gathering nectar, producing honey.
The kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.
It was agreed with the workers that they would be paid one dinar per day, after which he sent them to work in his vineyard.
The master of the vineyard set out around the ninth hour, and saw men standing idle in the marketplace;
So he said to them, 'You also go into the vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right.
So they went and worked in the vineyard. He went out again about noon, and at three o'clock, and did likewise.
And around five o'clock he went out again and saw others standing in the marketplace. He asked them, ‹Why do you stand here all day idle?›
And they answered him, No man hath hired us. He said unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive.
At the end of the day, the master said to his steward, "Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last and ending with the first."
So those who were hired at five o'clock came, and each one received a denarius.
Then came the first-hired, thinking they would receive more; each one of them also received a denarius.
So they took it and began to grumble against the householder.
And they said: ‹Those who were hired last, worked only one hour, and they have been paid as much as we who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat!›
So the master of the house said to one of them, "My friend, didn't we agree that you would work for me for the wage of one dollar?"
Take thy wage, and go thy way. I will give unto the last, even as unto thee.
> 'Have I not the right to do what I wish with my own? Or are you envious because I am generous to others?'
"Thus the first shall be last, and the last shall be first." Jesus prophesies about his death and resurrection.
And as He was on His way, Jesus called the twelve aside and said to them,
Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death.
<b>And they will deliver him to the Gentiles to mock and scourge and crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.</b> <b>He that serveth</b> is the <b>greater</b>.
Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.
And Jesus said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.
Then Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup ##the cup that I am going to drink?" "We can," they answered.
He said to them, "You will indeed drink my cup, and you will be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with. But to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
When the remaining ten heard this request, they were very angry with the two brothers.
Then Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the rulers of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and their great ones exercise authority upon them.
But among you it shall not be so. Rather, whoever would be great among you must be your servant.
Whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave.
So the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many." Jesus heals two blind men.
As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed Him.
And there were two blind men sitting by the road. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"
The people rebuked them and told them to be quiet, but they shouted all the louder, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"
So Jesus stopped and asked them, "What do you want me to do for you?"
So they said: "Lord, open our eyes."
Then Jesus put his hands on their eyes, and at once they could see, and followed him.
Long live the King!
As they approached Jerusalem, they came to Bethphage, near the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two disciples,
And he said unto them, Go into the village over against you; and, behold, as ye enter into the village, ye shall meet a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him hither.
And if anyone says anything to you, say: ‹The Lord needs them, and will send them back again soon.›"
This has been done that the prophet's words may be fulfilled:
Say to the daughter of Zion: #Dear Zion. Behold, your King is coming to you; He is humble, and mounted on a donkey, Even on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden."
So the disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them.
And they brought the colt and its mother, and laid their clothes on them; and He sat upon the clothes.
And most people spread their cloaks on the road. But others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
The crowds that followed cried out, «Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest heaven.»
And when Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred. People asked, «Who is this?»
The crowds following Him were saying, "This is the Prophet Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee." Jesus in the temple.
Then Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling doves.
And He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer'; #House of Prayer. 13:21 Isaiah 56:7. But you have made it a 'den of robbers!' #Den of Robbers. 13:21 Jeremiah 7:11."
And some blind men and lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.
The chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying out in the temple, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" And they were indignant, and said unto him, "Hearest thou what these are saying?"
Jesus answered, "Yes indeed! Have you never read, 'Out of the mouths of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise'? "
Then Jesus left them and went away. He went to a town called Bethany, and he stayed there. The Power of Faith.
And in the morning, as he returned to the city, he was hungry.
And he saw a fig tree in the distance, and he went to it, but found only leaves on it. And he said to it, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.” And the fig tree withered at once.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed, and asked, "How did the fig tree wither away so quickly?"
He answered, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be lifted up and thrown into the sea', it will obey you.
And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.
And Jesus went into the temple, and the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?
Jesus answered them, "I also will ask you a question, and you tell Me: The baptism of John, was it from heaven or of men?"
Where does John's baptism come from? From God or from men?" They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, 'From God,' he will ask, 'Why then did you not believe him?'
And if we say, 'It is of men,' we fear the people, because they all hold John as a prophet."
Therefore they answered Jesus, and said: We cannot tell. And Jesus said unto them: Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things. As for the two sons.
And Jesus said, "What do you think? A man had two sons. And he came to the first and said, 'Son, go and work in the vineyard today.'
The son replied, "I don't want to go." But he changed his mind and went.
Then the father went to his other son and asked the same thing. The son replied, 'Yes sir, I will go.' But he didn't go.
Which of the two sons did his father's will?» They answered, «The first.» Jesus said to them, «Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going ahead of you into the kingdom of God.
For John the Baptist came to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him; but tax collectors and prostitutes did. And even though you saw that, you later refused to repent and believe him. *The parable of the vineyard owner's son*
And listen to another parable. There was a landowner who planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a winepress in it, and built a watchtower. Then he leased it to tenants and went on a journey.
And when the vintage season came, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive his fruits.
But the peasants seized his slaves, beat one, killed another, and stoned a third.
The owner sent more slaves than the first time. The farmers treated them the same way.
And he sent his son, saying to himself: ‹Surely they will respect my son.›
But when the peasants saw that it was the master's son, they consulted together and said, 'This is the heir; let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.'
So they seized him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
"What do you think the master of the house will do to those servants when he comes back?"
So they said to him, «He will destroy those wretched men and will rent out the vineyard to other farmers who will give him his share of the crop at the harvest.»
And Jesus said unto them, Have ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner? This is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?
Therefore I say unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.
"Whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder."
And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they knew that he was speaking about them.
So they tried to arrest him, but they were afraid of the people, who regarded Jesus as a prophet.
As the wedding feast
And again He spoke to them in parables, saying:
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son.
And the king sent his servants to call the guests to the wedding feast, but they would not come.
So the king sent his servants and said, "Go back and tell those who are invited, 'My banquet is ready; my oxen and fattened cattle have been slaughtered, and everything is prepared. Come to the wedding feast.' "
But the invitees paid no heed, and each one went his own way. One went to his farm, another to his business.
And the rest seized the king's slaves, beat them, and killed them.
Then the king was furious and sent his army, which killed those murderers and burnt down their city.
Then the king said to his servants: 'The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy.
Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage feast.
So they went out into the streets and gathered all whom they found, both righteous and wicked, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.
When the king came to see the guests, he noticed a man who was not dressed for the occasion.
Then the king said to him, "Friend, how did you come in here without wedding clothes?" But the man was speechless.
Then the king said to his servants, *Bind his hands and his feet, and cast him out into outer darkness; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.*
For many are called, but few are chosen." The Pharisees seek to entrap Jesus.
So the Pharisees went and plotted how to entrap Jesus in what he said.
So they sent some of their disciples to Him, along with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that You are honest, and teach the way of God in truth, impartial to anyone; for You are not swayed by appearance.
So tell us your opinion: Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"
But Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, "Hypocrites, why are you testing Me?
Show me the currency you use." So they brought him a dinar.
And he said unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?
So they said to him, "Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's." And he said to them, "Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
When they heard this, they were amazed, and left him and went away. The Sadducees sought to trap Jesus.
On that day, some Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, came to him and asked him,
"Teacher," said Moses, "you can read in Deuteronomy 25:5,6 how that: 'If a man dies childless, his brother shall marry his widow and raise up offspring for his brother.' "
And we were seven brothers. The first one married and died. Since he had no children, his wife was married by the next brother.
And it happened to the brother next in line, and the second next, and the third, all the way up to the seventh.
And when they all died, the woman also died.
To whom of the seven will she be a wife on the Day of Judgment? For they all married her."
Jesus answered them, "You are mistaken, because you do not know either the Scriptures or the power of God.
Understand that in the resurrection there will be no marriage, nor are the risen given in marriage; for they cannot die anymore, for they are like angels in heaven.
As for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which is written:
<'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'> #I am the God of Jacob. Exodus 3:6. <God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.">
And when the people heard this, they were amazed at His teaching. For He taught them as one having authority.
And when the Pharisees heard that Jesus had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.
And a scholar of religious law, attempting to trap him, asked,
"Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?"
And Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. Deuteronomy 6:5.
This is the first and great commandment.
And the second is like the first: 'Love your neighbour #neighbour as yourself.' Luke 10:25-37 makes it clear that our neighbour is anyone in need of help. 'Love him #him as yourself.' Leviticus 19:18.
The whole Law and the Prophets depend on these two commandments.\" Christ, the Lord of David.
While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them:
"What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?" The Pharisees answered, "The son of David."
So He said to them, "How is it then that David in the Spirit calls Him 'Lord,' saying:
The Lord says to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet"?
If David thus calls him Lord, how can he be his son?
No one could answer him, and no one dared ask him any further questions.
Jesus criticizes the religious leaders
Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples,
So he said, "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat.
Keep and practice all that they command you, but do not do as they do; for they say things, and do not do them.
They fatigue people with burdens that are hard to bear, yet they themselves do not want to make any effort to follow them.
All the good deeds they do are done for show. They make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long; #fringes 5:23 Some Jews wrote verses from the Bible on small leather sheets, put them in little boxes and bound them with strips of cloth to their foreheads or left arms, displaying their piety. They also lengthened the tassels of their garments.
They love to sit in the best seats at banquets and in the places of honor at feasts.
They love it when people greet them with special greetings in the markets, and call out to them: 'Teacher.'
But you are not to be called ‹teacher.› You have only one teacher, and you are all brothers and sisters.
Do not let anyone on earth call you ‹father›, for you have one Father, and he is in heaven.
Do not let people call you ‹Lord›, for you have one Lord, Christ.
The greatest among you shall be your servant.
Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
Woe to you, Pharisees and teachers of the law! You hypocrites! You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to.
Woe to you, Pharisees and teachers of the law! You hypocrites! You devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. Because of this, you will receive greater condemnation.
Woe to you, Pharisees and teachers of the law! You travel over land and sea to win a single proselyte, and when he is won, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves.
Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!
O you blind fools! What is the greater, the gold, or the temple that has been sanctified by the gold?
And you say: "If a man vows a vow, he is not bound by his word, but if he vows by the gift that lies upon the altar, then he is bound to make good his vow."
You fools! What is greater: the gift on the altar, or the altar that makes the gift sacred?
For whosoever sweareth by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon.
And if anyone swears by the Temple, he swears both by the Temple and by the One who dwells within it.
And if anyone swears by the heaven, he swears both by the throne of Allah and by Him Who sits thereon.
Woe to you, Pharisees and teachers of the law! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, #mint and hyssop and cumin, but you neglect justice and the love of God. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former!
O ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel!
Woe to you, Pharisees and teachers of the law! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.
You hypocritical Pharisees! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean.
Woe to you, Pharisees and teachers of the law! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside, but inside are full of the bones of the dead and all kinds of impurity.
Thus you also outwardly appear righteous to others, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.
Woe to you, Pharisees and teachers of the law! You hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.
And you say: 'If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have been among those who killed the Prophets.'
And thus you bear witness that you are the offspring of those who killed the prophets.
So complete what your forefathers began.
O ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?
So I tell you, I will send prophets and wise men and teachers to you. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and others you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town.
Therefore shall ye be held guilty of all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zechariah the son of Berechiah, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar. #Abel ... Zechariah. Old Testament 35:23 The first and the last whose murder fell between the times of the first and second Temples. (See Genesis 4:8, 2 Chronicles 24:20) Slain between the Sanctuary and the Altar.
I tell you the truth, the punishment for all these sins will come upon this generation. Jesus warns the people of Jerusalem.
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone God's messengers! How often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing.
Behold, your house shall be left unto you desolate!
For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. #Blessed be the Lord. ~ Psalm 118:26.
Jesus Foretells the Destruction of the Temple
And Jesus left the temple, and as he walked away, his disciples came to him to call his attention to the buildings.
And Jesus said unto them, See ye all these buildings? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.
While sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, "Tell us, when will these things happen, and what will be the sign of Your coming and of the end of the age?"
Jesus answered them, "Take heed that no one deceives you.
Many will come in my name, claiming, ‹I am the Christ,› and will deceive many.
You will hear of wars and revolutions. See that you are not troubled, for these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines:
But these are only the beginning of the birth pangs.
Then they will deliver you up to tribulation, and will kill some of you, and you will be hated by all nations on account of My name.
At that time many will fall away, and will betray one another. And many will hate each other.
And there shall arise false prophets, and deceive many.
And because of the increase of wickedness, the love of many will grow cold.
But he who endures to the end shall be saved.
And the gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto the nations; and then shall the end come.
When you see the 'Abomination of Desolation'#Abomination of Desolation. 15:24 See Daniel 9:27, 12:11, and Matthew 11:31. As spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place; let the reader understand.
Let all who are in Judea flee to the mountains,
And the one on the roof shall not come down to take the things from his house.
And the labourer returns not to his house, to go therein.
How difficult the situation of pregnant and nursing mothers was in those days!
But pray that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day;
For then there will be a great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever shall be.
But if the Lord had not shortened those days, no flesh would have been saved; but for the elect's sake, whom He chose, He shortened the days.
For if someone says, 'Behold, He is here!' or 'There He is!' do not believe it.
For many false christs and false prophets will arise, and will show signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.
Behold, I have told you all things before they come to pass.
Some might say: 'Christ is in the wilderness', do not go there. Or, 'He is in the chamber', do not believe it.
For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.
Wherever you find the corpse, you will find the vultures too.
Immediately after the distress of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will be shaken.
At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven. And all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
And He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.
Learn from the fig tree. When its branches become tender, and the leaves appear, you know that summer is near.
Thus also, when you see these things taking place, you will know that the time is near—#TheTime. 33:24 Compare with Luke 21:31. It is imminent.
Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be done.
The heavens and the earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. Only the Father knows.
But no one knows when that day and hour will come, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
"As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be when the Son of Man comes."
In the days before the Flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, right up to the day Noah entered the ark.
For they knew not what would come to pass, until the flood came and took them all away. So shall also the coming of the Son of Man be.
At that time two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left.
Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
Therefore let us be alert, for we know not when our Lord will come.
Make sure that if the house owner knew at what hour the thief intended to break in, he would stay awake and not let him rob his house.
Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. The faithful and wise servant and the evil servant.
Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master will set over his household, to give them their food at the proper time?
Well done, good and faithful servant!
I tell you the truth, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.
The evil servant says to himself: 'My master is delayed.'
So he begins to beat his fellow servants, and starts eating and drinking with the drunkards.
Then comes the master of that servant in a day and hour he does not expect.
So He will punish him and place him among the hypocrites. There the people will weep and grind their teeth in frustration.
Like ten girls
Then the kingdom of heaven shall be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them are dumb, five are smart.
And the foolish took their lamps, but took no oil with them.
The clever ones added some oil to their lamps.
So the groom was delayed, and all the girls grew weary and fell asleep.
But at midnight someone shouted, 'The bridegroom is here! Come out to meet him!'
Then the maidens arose and trimmed their lamps.
And the foolish said to the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.
The wise virgins answered, 'We cannot, for our lamps are going out. Go you rather to the merchants, and buy for yourselves.'
And while they were going to buy the oil, the bridegroom came. And those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast; and the door was shut.
And the other girls came up and said, 'Master, Master, open up for us.'
But he said: «I tell you the truth, I do not know you!»
Therefore be ye also ready: for ye know not the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh. The Three Servants
The kingdom of heaven is also like a man who was going on a journey, and called his servants and entrusted them with his property.
And he gave one five bags of money,# five bags. 15:25 Literally "weights or talents". A talent was about 27 to 36 kilograms of gold, silver, or copper. two bags to another, and one bag to the third. To each according to his ability he gave them, and then he went out immediately.
So the one who had received the five bags of seed immediately invested them, and gained five more.
And the one who took the two bags did as the first did, and earned two more bags.
And the one who had received the one bag went off and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money there.
And after a long time, the lord of those servants returned, and reckoned with them.
So the one who had received the five bags of grain came and brought five more bags, saying, 'My lord, you gave me five bags of grain; here I have brought you the profit, five bags more.'
His master said to him, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master."
Then the one who had received the two bags of coins came and said, 'Master, you gave me two bags, and here are two more that I have gained.'
His master said to him, "Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master."
Then the one who had taken the single bag of seed came forward and said, "Master, I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you didn't plant and gathering where you didn't scatter seed.
I was afraid of you, so I went and hid your bag in the ground. Take your money.›
His lord said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant. Thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:
Why didn't you deposit my money in the bank, so that when I returned I could retrieve my money with interest?
So take the bag from him and give it to the one who has the ten bags.
For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.
But the worthless slave, throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. For the Son of Man will judge men.
And when the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, He will sit on His glorious throne.
Then shall he sheep and the goats be separated from one another, as the shepherd separater the sheep from the goats.
He will place the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
Then the King will say to those on his right: 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, a stranger and you welcomed me.
<html> <body> <p dir="RTL"> ›You clothed me when I was naked. You took care of me when I was sick. You visited me when I was in prison.</p> </body> </html>
The righteous will answer him, "Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?
And when did we see you a stranger and take you in, or naked and clothe you?
And when we see you ill or in prison, we will visit you.
Then the king will say, "Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me."
Then the King will say to those on his left: ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
For I was hungry and you did not feed me. I was thirsty and you did not give me a drink.
<html> <head> <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /> </head> <body> <p>You welcomed me not when I was a stranger.<br> You gave me no clothes when I was naked.<br> You visited me not when I was ill and in prison.</p> </body> </html>
The wicked reply: 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and not minister to your need?'
The king will say, "Truly I tell you, in as much as you did it not for one of the least of these, you did it not for me."
Thus the wicked go to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.
Jewish leaders plot to kill Jesus
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he told his disciples:
"You know that after two days it will be Passover, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified."
And the chief priests and the elders of the people were gathered together in the palace of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas.
And they planned to seize Jesus by treachery and kill him.
They said, "This perfume should not be wasted. It could have been sold for a year's wages and
While Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
A woman came to him with an alabaster flask of precious ointment, and she poured it on his head as he reclined at table.
And when His disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying: "Why this waste?"
This perfume could have been sold for a large sum of money to be given to the poor.
Then Jesus knew what they were thinking in their heart, and said unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? Hast thou any thing to say unto me?
The poor will be with you always.#The poor will always be with you. Deuteronomy 15:11. But I will not always be with you.
I have poured the perfume over my body to prepare it for burial.
I tell you the truth: wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her." Judas Iscariot betrays Jesus.
At that time one of the Twelve, whose name was Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,
And he said unto them, What will ye give me, if I deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.
From that moment on, Judas began to look for an opportunity to betray Jesus into their hands. At the Passover meal
On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
Then Jesus said: "Go into the village and tell the man, 'The Teacher says, "My time is near; I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples."'"
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and prepared the Passover meal.
And when evening came, Jesus was reclining at table with the twelve disciples.
And as they were eating, He said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray Me."
And they were sorrowful, and began each one to ask him, saying, Lord, is it I?
Jesus answered, "It is the one who dips his bread with Me.
The Son of Man is going as it has been decreed, but woe to that man who betrays him. It would be better for him if he had not been born!"
So Judas, who was going to betray him, asked, "Rabbi, is it I?" Jesus answered, "You have said so." The Last Supper.
And while they were eating, He took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, "Take, eat; this is My body."
Then he took a cup of wine, gave thanks, and said to them, "Drink from it, all of you.
For this is my blood, the blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
And I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it anew in my Father's kingdom."
Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus foretells Peter's denial.
Then Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away from me tonight. For it is written, `'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'`\""
But I will go before you to Galilee."
And Peter answered him, "Lord, even if all are scandalized because of you, I will never be scandalized.
And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
Then Peter said, "Even if I have to die with You, I will never deny You!" And all the other disciples said the same. Jesus prays alone.
Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane; and He said to the disciples, "Sit here while I go and pray over there."
And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and troubled.
Then He said to them, "My soul is deeply grieved, even to death. Stay here and keep watch with Me."
And He went a little farther, and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; #the cup. v.42 The cup of suffering. yet not as I will, but as You will."
And he came to the disciples, and found them asleep; and said unto Peter, Could ye not watch with me one hour?
Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
And he went away again, and prayed, saying, "My Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done."
Then he came again, and found them sleeping; for their eyes were heavy.
And he left them again, and went away, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.
Then He returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners."
Arise, let us be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.» The Capture of Jesus
While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, suddenly appeared. He was accompanied by a large crowd, armed with swords and clubs. They had been sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
And the traitor had given them a sign, saying, &quot;Whomever I kiss, that is He; arrest Him.&quot;
And immediately he came to Jesus, and said, "Hail, Master!"; and kissed him.
And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.
Then one of the disciples, putting his hand to his sword, drew it and struck the high priest's slave, cutting off his ear.
And Jesus said unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.
Do you not realize that I could call on my Father, and he would at once send me more than twelve legions of angels?
But if you did, how would the books have been fulfilled which were written, that these things must come to pass?
At that moment Jesus said to the crowds, "Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as though I were a robber? Every day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not arrest me.
"But this has happened so that the scripture might be fulfilled." And all the disciples left him and fled. Jesus before the Jewish leaders."
Then those who had arrested Jesus led him to the house of Caiaphas the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had gathered.
And Peter followed him at a distance, and went up into the courtyard of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, to see the end.
And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.
But they found none, though many false witnesses came forward and spoke all kinds of lies against him. Finally, two men came forward,
And they said: "This man! Why, this is Jesus, the Nazarene! Mark the words, we tell you. He saith, 'I am able to destroy this Sanctuary, the Temple of God, and in three days to rear it up again.'"
Then the high priest stood up and said, "Are you not going to answer any of these charges? What is this man saying about you?"
But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest said unto him, I adjure thee, by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.
And Jesus answered him, I am; and ye shall see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, «He has blasphemed! What further witnesses do we need? You have heard his blasphemy.
**So what do you judge?** They answered, **He deserves to die**.
Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists. They slapped him.
They kept asking him, «Prophesy, who hit you?» Peter denied Jesus.
Meanwhile Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. And a servant-girl came up to him, and said, &ldquo;You also were with Jesus the Galilean.&rdquo;
But Peter denied it before them all, and said, «I do not know what you are talking about!»
Then he went out to the gateway, and said to those standing there: “This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.”
Then Peter denied it again, and began to call down imprecations on himself, and to swear, "I do not know the man!"
And after a short while, those who stood there said to him, "You are certainly one of them, for your accent reveals you as a Galilean."
Then began he to curse and to swear, #Cursed be he. 74:26 Saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.
Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And he went out and wept bitterly.
Jesus before Pilate
And in the morning, the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel together against Jesus to put him to death.
They seized him, led him away, and handed him over to Governor Pontius Pilate. Judas hangs himself.
When Judas, who had betrayed Jesus, saw that they were determined to put Him to death, he repented of what he had done. He returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
And he said: "I have sinned by delivering up an innocent man to be killed." And they said: "What is that to us? You shall yourself bear the guilt."
And Judas cast the pieces of silver into the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.
So the chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, "It is not lawful to put them into the temple treasury, since it is the price of blood."
They decided to buy the Potter's Field as a burial ground for strangers.
And that is why the field is still known as the "Blood Field" to this day.
And thus was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet: And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value.
And they bought the Potter's Field, as the LORD had commanded me." #See Zechariah 11:12-13 and Jeremiah 32:6-9. Jesus before Pilate.
And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.
And when the chief priests and the elders accused him, he said nothing.
Then Pilate asked him, "Don't you hear all these accusations?
But Jesus gave him no answer, not even to a single charge, so that the governor was greatly amazed. And he failed to release Jesus.
And it was the governor's custom at the feast to release one prisoner, whomever they asked for.
And there was one prisoner famous among the people, called Barabbas. #Barabbas. 16:27 Or Jesus Barabbas, as it is in some Greek copies.
When the people came together, Pilate said unto them, **'Whom will ye that I release unto you? Jesus, which is called Christ, or Barabbas?'**
Pilate therefore knew that they had delivered him up through envy.
While Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message, saying, "Don't have anything to do with that innocent man. I have suffered greatly today in a dream because of him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas to be released, and Jesus to be killed.
So the governor asked them, "Which of the two do you want me to release for you?" And they said, "Barabbas."
Then said he unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.
And Pilate said unto them, Why? What evil hath he done? And they cried out the more, Let him be crucified.
When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, and that a riot was developing, he took some water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood. The responsibility is yours."
So all the people answered, "His blood shall be on us and on our children."
Then Pilate released Barabbas for them; and having scourged Jesus, delivered Him to be crucified. The soldiers led Him away inside the courtyard; they stripped Him, and put a scarlet robe on Him.
Then the soldiers led Jesus to the governor's headquarters. They called together the whole cohort to assemble around him.
They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him. #put ... robe. 28:27
They twisted a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling down before him, they paid him homage, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
Then they spat upon Him, and took the reed away from Him, and smote Him on the head.
When they had finished mocking him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes back on him. Then they led him away to crucify him. Jesus on the Cross.
When they had left, they found a man from Cyrene named Simon, whom they pressed into service to carry the cross.
And when they came to a place called Golgotha, which means 'Place of a Skull',
They gave Jesus wine mixed with gall to drink. But when He tasted it, He would not drink.
When they had crucified Jesus, they divided up his clothes among themselves by casting lots.
Then they sat there and guarded him.
They placed above his head an inscription that read: 'This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.'
And he was crucified with the robbers: one on the right hand, and the other on the left.
The Maroons hissed and shook their heads.
And they say: "You who would destroy the Temple and build it in three days, save yourself, if you are the Son of God, and come down from the Cross!"
And the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders mocked Him, saying,
He saved others, but he can't save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him!
Placing his trust in God, may God save him now, if He indeed wills it. Has he not said, ‹I am the Son of God›?"
And the criminals who were crucified with him also heaped similar insults on him. The Death of Jesus.
And from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.
And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" #Eli ... sabachthani. 46:27 From Psalm 22:1. "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
When some of those standing there heard it, they said, "He's calling Elijah!" #Calling Elijah. 47:27 The word in Hebrew is 'Eli', and in Aramaic 'Elio', which sounds like the name 'Elijah', a well known prophet who lived around 850 BC.
Then one of those standing there ran and filled a sponge with vinegar, put it on a reed, and offered it to Him to drink.
The rest said, «Let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.»
Then Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up His spirit.
And the veil of the temple was rent in twain #The Veil of the Temple. 51:27 The curtain that separated the Holy of Holies from the rest of the Jewish Temple. The Holy of Holies was the symbol of the presence of God. from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;
And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose.
And when Jesus had risen, His saints arose too, And, entering into the holy city, appeared unto many.
The Roman officer, #Roman officer. 54:27 lit. 'centurion'. And the guards, who were keeping watch over Jesus' body, saw the earthquake and the other events that took place; they were terrified and said, 'Surely he was the Son of God!'
There were also women looking on from a distance; they had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs.
Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. #the sons of Zebedee. 27:56 James and John. Jesus was buried.
And when the even was come, there came a certain rich man, named Joseph, of Arimathaea, who also himself was Jesus' disciple.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate ordered that the body be given to him.
And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth;
And he laid him in his new tomb, which he had hewn out of the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting opposite the tomb. Guarding Jesus' tomb.
And the next day, being the day after that of Preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate.
They said, "Master, we remember that this deceiver said, while he was still alive, 'After three days I will rise again.'
So he commanded that the tomb should be guarded until the third day, lest his disciples come and steal the body, and tell the people, "He has risen from the dead." And the last deception would be worse than the first.
Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye a guard of soldiers, and go your way; make it as sure as ye can.
So they went and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone and setting up a guard.
Resurrection of Jesus
And the Sabbath being past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.
And there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.
And his countenance shone as the lightning, and his raiment was white as snow.
The guards were terrified of him and became like dead men.
And the angel said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.
He is not here, for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay.
Then go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead, and behold, he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him.' Behold, I have told you."
Then the women, fearful yet filled with joy, left the tomb quickly and ran to tell Jesus' disciples.
And suddenly Jesus met them, and said, "Rejoice ye!" And they came, and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.
So Jesus said to them, «Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.» False Report.
While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
So the chief priests and the elders consulted together and decided to give the soldiers a large sum of money,
And they said unto them, It is reported among the people, that Jesus is risen from the dead: And they say, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.
«And if this news reaches the governor, we will convince him, and keep you safe.»
The soldiers took the money and did as they were told. And this story has been spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus speaks to his disciples.
The eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
And when they saw him, they worshipped him; but some were doubtful.
So Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
And teach them to obey all that I have commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.»
John the Baptist
This is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
As it is written in the book of the prophet Isaiah: "Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, to prepare thy way."
A voice of one crying in the wilderness: "Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight His paths."
John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness, baptizing people as a symbol of their repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
And all the country of Judea, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, came unto him, and were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
His clothes were made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
He said: "After me will come one greater than I, the sandals of whom I am not worthy to stoop down and untie."
I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." Jesus' Baptism
At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
And as he came up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Holy Ghost coming down upon him in the form of a dove.
A voice came from heaven, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased." Jesus' experience.
And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, was led by the Spirit into the wilderness;
And he remained there forty days, tempted by Satan; and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him. Jesus chooses some of his disciples.
And after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,
He says: &quot;The time has come, the kingdom of God is near; repent and believe in this good news.&quot;
As he walked along the Sea of Galilee, Jesus saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew, casting their nets into the lake; for they were fishermen.
Then Jesus said to them, "Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men."
They untied their nets at once and followed him.
Then he walked on a little, and saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, preparing their nets.
So Jesus called them, and leaving their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men, they followed Him. Jesus casts out an unclean spirit.
Then they went to Capernaum. And when Jesus entered the synagogue on the Sabbath, He taught.
They were amazed at His teaching, for He taught them as one who had authority, and not like the scribes.
And there in the synagogue was a man possessed by an unclean spirit. And the spirit cried out,
What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God.
Jesus rebuked him and said, «Be silent and come out of him!»
Then the unclean spirit tore him, and cried with a loud voice, and came out of him.
And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying: «What a new doctrine is this? For with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.»
The news about him spread throughout the whole region of Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Then they left the crowd and went to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told Jesus about her.
He approached her, took her by the hand and made her sit. The fever left her, and she began to serve them.
And that evening, as the sun went down, they brought to him all who were sick and those who were demon-possessed.
And all the city came together at the house's door.
And Jesus healed many that were sick of diverse diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him. As soon as the sun was down, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he, laying his hands on every one of them, healed them.
And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.
So Simon and those who were with him went to look for Him.
And when they found him, they said, "Everyone's been looking for you!"
Jesus answered them, "Let us go somewhere else to the nearby villages, so I can preach there also. For this is why I have come."
He went throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons. Jesus heals a leper.
And a leper came to Jesus, beseeching him, and kneeling said unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
And Jesus, being moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.
And the leprosy departed from the man, and he was cleansed.
Then Jesus warned him sternly, and sent him away.
And he said to him, "See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest, #show yourself to the priest. 44:1 The priest was the one who was to declare him clean, according to the law. And offer the offering for your cleansing, as Moses commanded, #as Moses commanded. 44:1 See Leviticus 14:1–32. for a testimony to the people."
But the man went out and began to tell his story everywhere. This made it hard for Jesus to enter a town openly; he stayed out in the country, and people came to him from every quarter.
Jesus heals a paralytic.
And after several days, Jesus returned to Capernaum. The news spread quickly.
So many people gathered that there was no more room, not even around the door. Jesus was preaching the word of God.
So they brought to him a paralytic lying on a bed.
But they could not bring him to Jesus because of the crowd. So they removed the roof above him, and after digging an opening, they let down the cot on which the paralytic was lying.
When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
And some of the religious teachers were sitting there; and they said within themselves,
"Why does this man speak like this? He's insulting God with his words! For who but God alone can forgive sins?"
Then Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Why reason ye thus in your hearts?
Is it easier to say to the paralytic, ‹Your sins are forgiven›, or to say, ‹Rise, take up your mat and walk›?
But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins—he saith to the sick of the palsy:
"I tell you, get up, take your bed and go home!"
