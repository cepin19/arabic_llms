The greatest in the kingdom of heaven
At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
So Jesus called a little child to Him and set him in the midst of them,
He said, "Truly I tell you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
And whosoever shall receive one such child in my name receiveth me.
And whosoever of these little ones that believe in Me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea.
Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks! For it is inevitable that stumbling blocks come, but woe to that man through whom the stumbling block comes!
If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into eternal fire.
And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter life with one eye, than to have two eyes and be cast into the fiery hell. Like a lost sheep.
Behold, do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that their angels in heaven always see the face of My Father who is in heaven.
For the Son of Man has come to save what was lost.
What think ye? If a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?
So shall I say to you, there shall be joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine righteous persons, which need no repentance.
So it is not the will of your Father in heaven that one of these little ones should perish. If your brother sins, go and reprove him in private.
But if your brother sins, go and reprove him in private; if he listens to you, you have gained your brother.
And if he will not hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church also, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.
But if he will not listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a tax collector or an unbeliever.
Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
And I tell you that if two of you agree here on earth concerning anything you ask, my Father in heaven will give it to you.
For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them." As the slave who is not forgiven.
Then Peter came and said to him, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?"
Jesus said unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.
Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants:
When he began to settle accounts, a certain man was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.
And having nothing with which to repay his lord, he had himself, his wife, and his children, and all that he had, sold to meet the debt.
The slave's pride bowed down to him, and he prostrated himself, saying: "My lord, give me respite, and I shall pay all that is due."
And that slave-girl's master freed her and left her as a gift.
And when that servant had gone out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii. And he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, "Pay me what you owe!"
The slave's pride said to him: 'Halt, O Ali, that I may fulfil all your needs.'
So he went and threw him into prison till he should pay the debt.
When the companions of the slaves saw what had happened, they were very sorrowful. They came and related to their master all that had occurred.
Then the master called the servant and said to him, 'You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me.
Should you not also have had compassion on your fellow slave, even as I had compassion on you?
And his lord was wrath, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.
Thus will My heavenly Father do to you, unless each of you forgives his brother from his heart."
Marriage and Divorce
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
And a great multitude followed him, and he healed them there.
The Pharisees came to him to test him, saying, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason whatsoever?"
And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female?
And he said: Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
"For they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate."
They asked him, "Why did Moses command that a man should write a certificate of divorce and send her away?"
He said to them: "Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, permitted you to divorce your wives: but from the beginning it has not been so."
And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth her that is put away doth commit adultery.
His disciples said, "If this is the situation between a man and a woman, it is better not to marry!"
So He said to them, "Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall enter the kingdom of heaven. But he who does the will of My Father in heaven.
For there are eunuchs who were born thus from their mother's womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to receive this, let him receive it." Jesus blesses the children.
At that time some children were brought to Jesus that he might lay his hands on them and pray. The disciples rebuked them.
But Jesus said, "Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of heaven."
And he laid his hands upon them, and departed thence. The rich young ruler.
And behold, one came to him and said, "Good Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?"
And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good but one, even God. But if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.
He said to Him, "Which commandments?" Jesus said, "You shall not murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not bear false witness."
"Honour thy father and thy mother, and love thy neighbour as thyself".
The young man said: "I have memorized all these since my youth. What else do I need?"
Jesus said to him, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."
And the young man went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.
And Jesus said to His disciples, "Truly I say to you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.
And I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God!"
When his disciples heard this, they were utterly astounded, and said, "Then who can be saved?"
Then Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Then Peter answered Him, "We have left all and followed You. What then will there be for us?"
And Jesus said to them, "Verily I say unto you, Ye which have followed me, in the regeneration, when the Son of Man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields, for My name's sake, will receive a hundredfold, and will inherit eternal life.
But many who are first will be last, and the last first.
As the laborers in the vineyard
For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard;
So he agreed with the workmen for a dinar a day, and sent them to his vineyard.
And about the third hour he went out, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace;
So he said to them, "You go your way; behold, I tell you, I will give to these the third part of my vineyard.
And about the ninth hour he went out and did the same.
Then about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle. To them he said, 'Why do you stand here idle all day?'
They said: "No one has hired us." He said: "Go you also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive."
When evening came, the master of the house said to his steward, "Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last and ending with the first."
So came the owners of the eleventh hour, and they received a denarius each.
When the first group came, they thought they would receive more if they took it by the dinar. So they too took it dinar by dinar.
And they grumbled at the master of the house.
Saying: 'These last men have worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden and heat of the day!'
And he answered one of them and said, Friend, I owe thee not a penny. Didst not thou agree with me for a penny?
Take what is yours and go. I want to give the same to this last one as I gave to you.
Or am I not free to do what I wish with what belongs to me? Are you envious because I am righteous?
Thus the last will be first, and the first last; for many be called, but few chosen.** Jesus prophesying His death and resurrection.
As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the Twelve aside by themselves, and said to them,
Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, who shall condemn him to death,
And they will deliver him to the Gentiles to mock him, and to scourge him, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.** The request of the sons of Zebedee.
At that time the mother of Zebedee's sons came to Jesus with her sons, and kneeling down she asked a favor of him.
And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Say that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.
Jesus answered them, "You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup I am going to drink?" "We can," they answered. "We can be baptized with the baptism of suffering you will undergo."
And he said unto them, My cup indeed ye shall drink; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized: and to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.
When the ten heard it, they were indignant at the brothers.
So Jesus called them together and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.
Let not this be among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant,
Whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave.
And the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." Healing of two blind men in Jericho.
As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed Him.
And two blind men sitting by the road, when they heard that it was Jesus, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!
So the multitude rebuked them that they should hold their peace: but they shouted the more, saying: Behold, Lord, the master, have mercy on us.
So Jesus stopped and asked, "What do you want me to do for you?"
They said: "Lord, let our eyes be opened!".
Then Jesus touched their eyes and said, "According to your faith let it be done to you." And their sight was restored. They followed him.
Entry into Jerusalem
And when they drew near to Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, unto the mount called the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,
saying to them, "Go into the village ahead of you. As you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.
And if anyone says anything to you, say: 'The Lord needs them.' And immediately he will send them."
So that what was spoken by the Prophet might be fulfilled, saying:
Say to the daughter of Zion: "Behold, your King is coming to you, gentle and mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey."
So the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them.
And they brought the ass and the colt, and put on them their clothes; and he sat thereon.
And the multitude spread their garments on the road; others cut branches from the trees and strewed them along the way.
And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.
And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred, saying: «Who is this?»
And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee. The Purging of the Temple.
And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves.
And He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer'; but you have made it a den of thieves!"
And the lame man was healed, and leaped, and stood up, and walked, and entered the temple with them.
When the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying out in the temple, saying, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" they were indignant;
And they said to him, "Do you hear what these children are saying?" And Jesus said to them, "Yes; have you never read, 'Out of the mouths of babes and nursing infants you have prepared praise'?"
Then He left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and He lodged there. The fig tree withered.
And in the morning, as he was returning to the city, he was hungry.
And he saw a fig tree by the wayside, and he went to it, but found nothing on it except leaves only. And he said unto it, "Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever." And presently the fig tree withered away.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?" they asked.
And Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, not only that ye shall do also without the fig tree, but, if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.
And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive. Enquire ye now of the Lord's anointed.
When He had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to Him as He was teaching, saying, "By what authority are You doing these things? And who gave You this authority?"
Jesus answered them, "I also will ask you one question; and answer Me, and then I will tell you by what authority I do these things:
John's baptism: was it from heaven or of human origin?" They reasoned among themselves, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'
And we say: 'From the people', we fear the crowd, for they hold John as a prophet."
They answered Jesus, "We do not know." And He said to them, "Nor will I tell you by what authority I do these things.
"What do you think? A man had two sons. He came to the first and said, 'Son, go and work in the vineyard today.' "
He answered, "I don't want anything." But he went away sad.
And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, Here am I, Lord; and he went not up.
«Which of the two did his father's will?» They said, «The first.» Jesus said to them, «Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God ahead of you.
For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him. The Parable of the Wicked Vinedressers
And another parable spake he unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a man which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.
And when the time of the fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the vine-growers, that they might receive his fruits.
So the Carmels took their servants, and some of them they whipped, and some they killed, and some they stoned.
Then he sent other servants more than the first. And to them also they did likewise.
At last he sent them his son, saying, 'They will respect my son.'
And when the Kramon saw the Son, they said among themselves, 'This is the Heir! Come, let's kill him and seize his inheritance!'
So they took him and led him out of the vineyard and killed him.
«When the Master of Generosity comes, what will He do to those honorable ones?»
They said to him, 'These evil men are destroyed on evil terms; and a good vineyard shall be given to other vinedressers, who will render its produce at the proper seasons.'
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head of the corner; This was the Lord's doing, And it is marvelous in our eyes'?
Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people that produces the fruit of the kingdom.
And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken to pieces: but he on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.
And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke about them.
And they wanted to seize Him, but feared the multitude, because they regarded Him like a prophet.
It's like the king's son's wedding.
And Jesus spoke to them in parables, saying:
The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king, who made a marriage feast for his son.
And he sent his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they would not come.
So he sent his slaves to say to the guests, 'Come, for everything is now ready. My oxen and fattened livestock are killed, and everything is prepared. Come to the wedding feast!
But they neglected it and went away, one to his farm, another to his business,
And the rest seized their slaves, reviled them, and killed them.
When the king heard this, he was furious, and he sent his troops, who killed those murderers and burned down their city.
Then he said to his servants: 'The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy.
So go to the road junctions, and invite everyone you find to the wedding banquet.
So the slaves went out into the roads and gathered together all whom they found, both evil and good. And the wedding hall was filled with guests.
So the king came in to look at the guests, and he saw there a man who had no wedding garment.
Then he said to him, "My friend, how did you come in here without wedding clothes?" And he was speechless.
Then the king said to the attendants, 'Bind his hands and feet, and cast him into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
"Many are called, but few are chosen." Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's.
Then the Pharisees went and plotted how they might entangle him in his talk.
So they sent to Him some of the Pharisees and Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that You are truthful and teach the way of God in honesty, and You do not care about anyone's opinion, for You are not swayed by appearances.
Then tell us what you think: is it right to pay the imperial tax or not?"
Then Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, "Why do you put Me to the test, hypocrites?"
Show me the tax treatment. They presented him with a dinar.
And he said unto them: Whose is this image and superscription?
They said to him, "To Caesar." He said to them, "Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
And when they heard this, they were amazed, and left him, and went away. The resurrection of the dead.
On that day some Sadducees came to him, who say there is no resurrection. And they asked him,
Saying: "Teacher, Moses wrote, 'If a man dies without children, his brother shall marry the widow, and raise up issue for his brother.' "
So we had seven brothers; the first married and died. Having no issue, he left his wife to his brother.
And the second and the third unto seven.
And the woman died last.
At the Resurrection, to which of the seven shall she be wife? For she was the wife of all!"
Jesus answered them, "You are mistaken, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God."
For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.
As for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken unto you by God, who said:
I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.»
When the crowds heard this, they were astounded at His teaching. The supreme commandment.
And the Pharisees, when they heard that He had put the Sadducees to silence, were gathered together.
And one of them, a lawyer, asked him as a test, saying,
"Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?"
And Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
This is the first and great commandment.
And the second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself.
"These two commandments are of the whole Law and the Prophets." Christ and David.
While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,
Saying: "What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is He?" They said to Him, "The Son of David."
He asked them, "How is it then that David, inspired by the Spirit, calls him 'Lord'?
The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at My right hand, Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.
If David thus called him Lord, how is he his son?
No one could answer him a word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him anything anymore.
Beware of the scribes and the Pharisees.
Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples,
Saying: "The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat,
For whatever they tell you to keep, that you should keep and do. But do not follow their actions, for they do not practice what they preach.
They tie up heavy loads, hard to bear, and place them on people's shoulders, but they themselves are unwilling to lift a finger.
And they do all their deeds to be seen by men. They make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long,
And they love the foremost seats at feasts and the foremost places in mosques.
and the greetings in the marketplaces. People will call out to them: 'My Lord! My Lord!
But you, do not be called 'Rabbi'; for One is your Teacher, Christ, and you are all brothers.
Do not call anyone on earth 'father', for you have one Father, and he is in heaven.
Do not be called teachers, for one is your Teacher, Christ.
And he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.
He who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees!
But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men; for you neither go in yourselves, nor allow those who are entering to go in.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For ye go about the sea and the land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.
Woe to you, blind guides! who say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but he that sweareth by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor.
O ye fools and blind men! What is the greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?
And whoever swears by the altar, swears by it and by the offering upon it.
O ye fools and blind men! What is greater, the gift or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?
For he who swears by the altar, swears by it and by all that is upon it!
And whosoever sweareth by the Temple, sweareth by it, and by Him that dwelleth therein;
And whosoever swears by the heaven, swears by the Throne of Allah and Him Who sits thereon.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faith. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others.
O you blind leaders! Straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.
O you Pharisees, blind! First clean the inside of the cup and the dish, so that the outside also may be clean!
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness.
Thus also do ye outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.
And ye say: If we had been alive in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the Prophets.
You bear witness that you are children of those who killed the prophets.
Fill ye the measure of your fathers.
O you offspring of vipers! How will you escape the judgment of Gehennah?
So I send you prophets, sages, and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town.
That all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar, may come upon you.
Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all these things be fulfilled. Jesus wept over Jerusalem,
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem! Thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!
Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.
For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!'.
Signs of the End Times.
Then Jesus went out and departed from the temple. And His disciples came up to show Him the buildings of the temple.
And Jesus said to them, "Do you see all these? Truly, I say to you, not one stone shall be left here upon another, which shall not be destroyed."
While sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will these things happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?"
And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.
Many will come in My name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and will mislead many.
And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars. See that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines and pestilences, and earthquakes in divers places.
But these are only the beginning of the birth pains.
Then they will deliver you up to tribulation, and will kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for My name's sake.
And then many will fall away and betray one another.
And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.
For the increase of iniquity, the love of many shall grow cold.
But he who endures to the end shall be saved.
And the gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness unto all the nations; and then shall the end come.
When you see the 'abomination of desolation' spoken of by Daniel the Prophet, standing in the holy place" (let the reader understand),
Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains,
And the one who is on the roof must not go down into the house to take anything.
And let not him who is in the field go back to fetch his cloak.
Woe to those who are pregnant and nursing babies in those days!
May your coming be not in winter or in the Sabbath.
For then there will be a great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever shall be.
And unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be saved; but for the elect those days shall be shortened.
Then if anyone says to you, 'Behold, here is the Christ!' or 'There he is!' do not believe it.
For false christs and false prophets will arise and show great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.
I told you so.
If they say, 'He is in the wilderness', do not go out; if they say, 'He is in the inner rooms', do not believe it.
For as the lightning flashes and shines from the east to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.
For where the carcass is, there shall the eagles be gathered together.
And after the distress of those days the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky and the celestial powers will be shaken.
And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory.
He sends His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.
From the fig tree learn the lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender, and the leaves are full grown, you know the summer is nigh.
Thus you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near, at the very doors.
Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be done.
The heavens and the earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away. Be prepared.
And the day and the hour knoweth no man, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.
Just as the days of Noah were, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.
For as in the days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark,
And they knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
At that time two shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
Two grind at the mill; one is taken, and the other left.
Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.
And know this: were the master of the house to know in what watch of the night the thief would come, he would keep awake and not let his house be broken into.
Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. As the faithful and wise servant.
Who is the faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath set over his household, to give them their meat in due season?
Blessed is that servant whom his lord, when he cometh, shall find so doing!
Verily I say unto you, he shall set him over all that he hath.
But that slave, the lowly one, in his heart would think: My master tarries.
He starts beating his slaves, dining and drinking with the drunkards.
The master of that servant will come on a day he does not expect him, and at an hour he knows not.
He cuts it off and assigns his portion with the hypocrites. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
As the ten virgins
Then the kingdom of heaven shall be likened unto ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.
But the foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them;
And the wise took lamps and containers of oil with them.
And as the groom slowed down, they all yawned and fell asleep.
At midnight the shout arose: 'Behold, the bridegroom comes; go out to meet him!'
Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.
So the foolish said to the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.
The wise women answered: "It will not be enough for us, no indeed. Go rather to the merchants and buy for yourselves."
And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast; and the door was shut.
At last came the other virgins too, saying, 'Lord, lord, open to us!'
He answered and said: Verily I say unto you, I know you not.
Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh. As for the talents,
As it were, a man going on a journey called his servants and delivered to them his goods.
And he gave to one five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability. And straightway he took his journey.
And he who had received the five talents went and traded with them, and gained five more talents.
And he who took the two weights, gained two other weights also.
And he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his lord's money.
And after a long time the lord of those servants came, and reckoned with them.
So the one who had received the five talents came and brought five more, saying, 'Lord, you entrusted me with five talents. See, I have gained five more.'
And his lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many. Enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
Then came he that had received two talents, and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.
His lord said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your lord.'
Then he who had received the one talent also came and said, "Lord, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you have not sown, and gathering where you have not scattered seed.
So I was afraid and went on and hid your talent in the ground. Here, take what is yours.
And he answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant. Thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:
So you were to put my silver in the bank; and, when I came, you would have handed it over to me, with interest.
Take the talent from him, and give it to the one who has the ten talents.
For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.
And cast the unprofitable servant into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. The sheep and the goats.
And when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory.
And all peoples will gather before him, and he will separate them from one another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
Then shall the Goats be separated on his left hand; but the Sheep on his right.
Then the King will say to those on his right: 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.'
For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, a stranger and you welcomed me.
You clothed me when I was naked. You visited me when I was sick. You came to me when I was in prison.
The righteous will answer him, "Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?
And when did we see You a stranger and take You in, or naked and clothe You?
And when did we see You sick or in prison, and came unto You?
And the king will answer them, "Truly I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me."
Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.'
For I was hungry and you did not feed me. I was thirsty and you did not give me a drink.
I was a stranger and you did not welcome me. I was naked and you did not clothe me. I was sick and in prison, and you did not visit me.
Then they also will answer, saying, "Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to You?"
He will answer them, "Truly I tell you, in so far as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me."
So these shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life eternal.
Conspiracy to kill Jesus
When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he told his disciples:
"You know that in two days it will be Passover, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified."
Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people gathered at the house of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas;
And they consulted together how they might take Jesus by craft, and put him to death.
But they said, "Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people." Jesus was anointed.
And Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper.
A woman came up to him with an alabaster flask of very expensive perfume and poured it over his head as he reclined.
When His disciples saw this, they were indignant, saying, "Why this waste?"
"For this precious ointment could have been sold for much and given to the poor."
And Jesus said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman: for she hath wrought a good work upon me.
For the poor you have with you always, but me you have not always.
For she poured this perfume on my body to prepare me for burial.
Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also a record be made of the things which ye have done, for a memorial of you. The betrayal of Judas.
At that time one of the Twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests;
He said, "What will you give me if I deliver him to you?" They cast him thirty pieces of silver.
From that time he sought an opportunity to arrest him. The Passover meal with the disciples.
On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
He said: "Go into the city, to such and such a person, and say to him, 'The Teacher says, My time is near; I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.'"
The disciples did as Jesus commanded them, and prepared the Passover.
And when it was evening, he reclined with the twelve.
And as they were eating, He said, "Truly I tell you, one of you will betray Me."
And they were exceedingly sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Am I he, Lord?
He answered and said: "It is the one who dips his hand with Me in the dish, he shall betray Me!
The Son of Man will indeed go just as it is written about Him, but woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.".
And Judas, his betrayer, answered and said: «Am I the one, Master?» He said unto him: «Thou hast said it». The Lord's Supper.
And while they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, "Take, eat; this is my body."
He took the cup, gave thanks, and said, "Drink from it, all of you,
For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.
And I tell you, I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom."
Then they went out to the Mount of Olives. And Jesus
Then Jesus said unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered.
But I will go ahead of you to Galilee.
And Peter answered Him, "Though all may deny You, I will never deny You."
Jesus said to him, "Truly, I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times."
Peter said to Him, "Even if I have to die with You, I will not deny You!" And all the other disciples said the same. (in Gethsemane)
Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the disciples, "Sit here while I go and pray over there."
Then he took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled.
And he said unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.
Then he advanced a little and fell on his face, praying, "My Father, if possible, let this cup pass from me; yet, not as I will, but as you will."
Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter, "Could you not watch with me one hour?
Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
And he went away again, and prayed, saying, "My Father, if this cup may not pass away from me except I drink it, thy will be done."
And he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.
And he left them and prayed a third time, saying the same words again.
Then He came to the disciples and said to them, "Sleep and rest now. Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners."
Let's go! Look, the one who betrays me is near.». The arrest of Jesus.
While he was speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived, accompanied by a large crowd with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people.
And he who surrendered himself gave them a sign, saying: "Whomever I kiss, he it is. Hold him fast."
And immediately there came forward a man running, and fell down before him, and said, "Hail, Master!" and kissed him.
And Jesus said unto him, Man, why art thou come? Then came they, and laid hold on Jesus, and seized him.
And one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the high priest's slave, cutting off his ear.
So Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place; for all those who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Do you think I cannot now call upon my Father, and He will provide me with more than twelve legions of angels?
How should the books go on: That's how it should be!
At that hour Jesus said to the crowds: "As if it were a robber you have come out with swords and clubs to seize me. Day after day I sat teaching in the temple, and you did not arrest me.
And this was to fulfil the words of the prophets." Then all the disciples left him and fled. Before the Sanhedrin.
And those who had seized Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered.
And Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. He sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire.
And the whole council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death;
They found none. Though many false witnesses came, they found none. But at the last came two false witnesses,
And they said, "This fellow said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest said to Him, "Are You not speaking openly to us? Why do You speak in parables? Behold, You say, 'I tell you what you see, and it shall be, and what is still future shall be revealed to you.' Therefore, tell us, what do You think? What is Your opinion? What have these men testified about You?"
But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.
Jesus said to him, "You have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming with the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has blasphemed! Why do we still need witnesses? You have heard his blasphemy!
What do you see?« They replied, »He deserves to die.«
Then they spat upon him, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands.
Saying, &ldquo;Tell us, Christ, who is it that smote thee?&rdquo;. The denial of Peter.
But Peter sat outside in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him, saying, "You also were with Jesus the Galilean."
And he denied it, and said: «I know not what thou sayest!»
Then as she came out into the hallway, she saw Jesus standing there, and she said to the people, "This is the man!"
And he denied it with an oath: "I do not know the man!"
And after a while, they said to Peter, "Surely you are also one of them; your accent betrays you!"
So he began to curse and swear: "I do not know this man!" At that moment the cock crew.
Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: "Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times." And he went out and wept bitterly.
Judas hanged himself.
And in the morning all the chief priests and the elders of the people plotted against Jesus to put him to death.
So they bound him and led him away, and handed him over to Pontius Pilate, the governor.
Then Judas, who had betrayed him, seeing that he was condemned, repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
saying: "I have wrongfully shed innocent blood." They replied: "What have we to do with you? You are the one who sees!"
And he cast down the pieces of silver into the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.
So the chief priests took the silver pieces, saying, "It is not lawful to put them into the temple treasury, being blood money."
And they consulted together, and with the money they paid for it, bought the potter's field, to bury strangers in.
That field is called "The Field of Blood" to this day.
Then that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying: *And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value:*
And they gave him a field; and there he hath made a pottery yard, as the Lord commanded me. Before Pilate.
So Jesus stood before the governor. And the governor asked Him, saying, "Are You the King of the Jews?" Jesus said to him, "You say so."
And the chief priests and the elders complained against him, but he said nothing.
And Pilate said unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?
He didn't reply to a single word, which surprised the governor very much.
And it was the governor's habit, on the feast day, to release one prisoner, whoever they might ask for.
At that time they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.
While they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release for you: Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?"
For he knew they had delivered him up through envy.
And while he was sitting on the throne, his wife sent him this message: "Have nothing to do with that righteous man. I suffered greatly today in a dream because of him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus killed.
The governor answered them, "Which of the two do you want me to release for you?" They said, "Barabbas!"
Pilate said to them, "What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all said, "Crucify him!"
So the governor asked, "What evil has he done?" But the more they shouted, "Crucify him!",
When Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but rather that a riot was beginning, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood! See to it yourselves!"
And all the people answered and said: "His blood be on us and on our children."
Then he released Barabbas for them; but Jesus, after flogging, handed him over to be crucified. Mockery by the soldiers.
So the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium; and they gathered the whole cohort around Him.
They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him.
They wove a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
And they spat upon Him, and took the reed, and smote Him on the head.
And after they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him.
As they went out, they found a man of Cyrene, named Simon, whom they pressed into service to carry his cross.
When they came to a place called Golgotha, which means Place of the Skull,
Give him gall mixed with vinegar to drink. And when he tasted it, he would not drink.
When they had crucified Him, they divided up His clothes, casting lots for them to see who would get what. This fulfilled the Scripture which says: "They divided My clothes among them, and for My clothing they cast lots."
Then they sat and kept watch over him there.
And they put over his head the accusation written: "THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS".
Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left.
And those who passed by were wagging their heads at him, reviling him.
saying, "You who destroy the Temple and build it in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross!"
And the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders, likewise mocked, saying,
He saves others, but he can't save himself! If he is the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him!
He relied on God, let Him save him now if He wills! For he said: 'I am the Son of God.'
So the two thieves also, who were crucified with him, reviled him. Death.
And there was darkness over all the earth from the sixth hour until the ninth hour.
And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
So some of those standing there said, "He's calling Elijah."
And one of them ran, and filling a sponge with vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave Him to drink.
And the rest said: "Hold your peace. Let us see whether Elijah will come to save him."
And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.
And the veil of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. And the earth quaked, and the rocks were split;
And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,
And they went out of the graves after his resurrection, and entered into the holy city; and appeared unto many.
And the centurion, and they that were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, and said, Truly this was the Son of God.
Many women were watching from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee and ministered to Him.
Among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. The Burial.
And when the evening had come, there came a rich man from Arimathæa, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple.
So he went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Pilate ordered that the body be given to him.
And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth;
And he laid him in his new tomb, which he had hewn out of the rock: and then he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.
And Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The guards at the tomb,
On the day after the preparations, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together at Pilate's
Saying, "Lord, we remember that the false one, while he was still alive, said, 'After three days I will rise.' "
Let the tomb be securely sealed until the third day, lest His disciples come and steal Him away at night and tell the people, "He has risen from the dead." Otherwise, the last deception would be worse than the first!
Then said Pilate unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can.
So they went and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone.
Qiyamah
And on the Sabbath day they rested, but at the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the sepulchre.
And there shall be a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord shall descend from heaven, and roll away the stone from the door, and sit upon it.
And his countenance was as the lightning, and his raiment white as snow.
For fear he shook, the guards quaked and became like dead men.
And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.
He is not here, for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
Go quickly and tell his disciples: He is risen from the dead; and behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.
And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: and ran to bring his disciples word.
As they were going to tell the disciples, Jesus himself met them and said, «Greetings!» They came up and took hold of his feet and worshipped him.
Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me." The guards' words.
And behold, two of them were going that very day to a village called Emmaus, which
So they gathered together with the elders, and consulted; and they gave the soldiers much money.
Saying: "Say that his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept."
And if it reaches the Governor, we will plead with him, and we shall make you secure."
They took the money and did as they were told. And this story has been passed down among the Jews to this very day. Jesus appears to his disciples.
And the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had appointed.
And when they saw Him, they worshipped Him; but some doubted.
So Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
And teach them to obey all the commands I have given you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age." Amen.

John was baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
And all the country of Judea, and they of Jerusalem, went out unto him, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.
John wore camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
He preached, saying: "After me comes the One who is mightier than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie."

saying, «Ha! What have we to do with You, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are—the Holy One of God!».
And Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent, and come out of him!"
And the evil spirit tore him, and cried with a loud voice, and came out of him.

And as he spoke, the leprosy left him and he was cleansed.
So he rebuked him and sent him away at once.
And he said unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.

When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
And some of the scribes were sitting there and pondering in their hearts:
"Why does he speak like that? Only God can forgive sins."
At once Jesus knew in His spirit that they were thinking this way, and He said to them, "Why do you think this way in your hearts?
Whichever is easier, to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise, take up your bed and walk'?
But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins"—he said to the paralytic,
I say unto thee, Arise, take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house!
And immediately he rose up, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion. And he called the name of the place, Healing.

And the scribes and the Pharisees, when they saw Him eating with the tax collectors and sinners, said to His disciples, "How is it that He eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard it, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. The Question about Fasting.
