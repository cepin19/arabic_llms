If you don't want it, I do.
O Sultan, what are you saying?
Haram 'aleyk firsat firsat! Yaaytana layyidan 'anzay'aha manna! Haram.
Then I'm not intruding on the subject; I have just as much right to take as you, and you even have the right to take precedence over me.
Sultan, for the love of God, don't bring us any troubles.
Saleh will never happen, God forbid.
Upon your conscience, is there a brother who advises his brother with what you are telling me?
Are you hungry?
I found a tray with rice and meat in front of me.
The teapot has neither owner nor keeper, nor anyone who cares for it.
Say the truth about yourself.
This Chinese woman is not put in front of us again.
Don't act crazy, Saleh.
Don't let the opportunity slip away from us.
La la la Don't even try It's impossible Impossible It's not me who acts like this
The problem is he's scared.
I'm afraid I might choke on it.
This is a government project, everyone's taking and sucking up.
This is a rule.
Right now there are people with no interest in the projects, yet they take
He is the chairman of a major project committee.
Why him, he has the thread and the needle.
Global Beaches Millennium Project (Third Millennium Infrastructure - Phase 1)
The bull gored him.
This is where the extractor hood is.
If he has taken it
And what's it got to do with you?
You have the right to take from their project.
Since his car was broken down.
Who reached the project's location? Not me.
If it's like that, then you're right.
Whoever gives you the right to the petrol will fuel your car four times and five times.
Let him be.
Don't be a stubborn mule.
Reach out and hug me.
Your aunt's real estate agent.
Now, according to you, they say you're a millionaire.
A third of the muddled up stuff is a legitimate right.
1/3 is commission
The one who strikes the popular team.
They say they're throwing a party for the nation.
We're buying a new car.
Shoo away the bees.
We lined up the row.
There's no use, Auntie.
May Allah guide him, Inshallah.
He eats halah with him.
Last night I tried all night long
This is an opportunity.
For goodness to prevail.
And good will hopefully spread.
This is a well-known thing.
Let's keep it between us.
Don't go outside!
Behold, I have a witness in heaven.
Just a quarter.
A problem that could stick in our throat like a bone
Real looked exhausted.
He's sitting with him today.
Morning for two hours.
And he began to be convinced.
The meeting with him is scheduled for a bit later.
We definitely need to work on it together properly.
The one who wants to cut off our livelihood
They didn't start meeting with him unless they were hopeful.
My brothers Ali and Othman
I don't know
As I'm starting my first day of work today,
It's all yours.
How could it not be?
Sure, but are you sure you want to take it?
Now I will ask you
You're hungry and walking down the street
Are you eating or not eating?
I am an Akil.
It's alright.
The teapot's back.
We're currently discussing the first item on the meeting agenda.
If there's anything in you.
And if you have any concerns,
I want to know
We're all in this project together.
May Allah guide you, Saleh.
You might, because it's your first time participating as the head of a committee in a government project.
This is a simple task, brother.
Our share goes down as
As part of the project budget
Child, how's the child?
So no one would feel anything about the matter.
We put a lien on his soul for the amount.
This amount has been debited.
By the project's LL initiators
It's not possible.
No no no, Saleh.
You know the origins.
But apparently there's a little fear inside you
This is definitely his right.
In the beginning and the end
It's all in our hands.
I've got your eyes on me, huh?
What's wrong with you? In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful, what's wrong with you?
My friend's new car
He says "Ahoy."
The car of Rajje is okay, fine!
In a prominent location
Only one has the money on him.
I haven't heard or been told anything yet.
The one who bought the land and registered it in his name
Please.
Now he wants the money in his hand
It's so captivating right now.
It's not us, we're not idiots.
That's it.
Mayyina Al-Rashi
It takes us out the Eastern Gate.
He wants to eat a bite with his own soul.
Don't nod your head.
Or your brother
You come and sit, let your heart be at ease. Come.
I thought about it all night long.
It can't be helped, even if he's innocent, they deserve it.
I made him agree.
This is the supposed one.
inshallah you won't just take it once, but many times
This project is beaches of the third millennium
(Infrastructure)
Then they begin the second stage.
And you continue with him
May Allah reward you, you didn't fall short.
The best translation is: The fact that you only made him agree is beautiful.
You're no different from anyone else.
But there's nothing in it.
But hopefully, I convinced him.
We want his lineage.
They all agree.
He said it after he agreed.
It seems they're inviting them to attend the budget allocation meeting for the project.
It is their right and they must follow it.
We've got it confirmed.
We need them to be submitted as soon as possible for approval.
Please make yourselves comfortable.
Do you know who this brother is?
This could be the brother of my lady; he's with me yesterday.
This means this.
You have the doors, windows and everything related to the finishes.
Sweet sweet.
That's enough for you all so we can finish.
You've chosen your own path.
We take something.
Let's give our souls a week to ponder.
We set the amount we'll take.
We have people waiting and wanting.
Abdulaziz's words were just.
Each person can set NTD 500,000.00 for themselves.
This week, Arket has kept itself busy.
He determines the amount he wants.
They decided, contemplated, and determined.
How are you doing?
A child according to your desire.
Don't mind them.
She's a Chenou in what are you in what's wrong with him?
I have no idea what possessed him to join us.
What are you bringing into this project?
This is a government project.
Your brother's name is Sultan
This is the Adriel's Place.
Hours until the car broke down on us.
Sign up pls.
Abdullah's document
There are three more besides him.
I've given up on him.
Let's just get our budget and get out.
No, no, this is a lump sum.
He became speechless.
So he's got kids, the poor guy.
If anyone has Zayd, let him make it twenty-five quarters.
And a quarter of my love.
Everyone's sticking close to each other.
These, how many are you distributing to each of them?
Waied
May Allah have mercy on him when mentioned.
Yes, mom.
Oh La La La, but this is the last one, Dad.
No Dad, if you're going to Thailand it's for treatment.
Give me a second.
Why are you making such a big deal out of it?
Remaining only the first stage, between brackets: infrastructure.
Not used.
They added three thousand.
Buy me watches from Thailand, the ones with the whole face glittering like that.
I've recorded them.
My leadership
I already registered, I just wanted to double check with you about the name.
My love, I tell you, Mom.
The Chinese inkstone
The budget must be set. It can't stay open-ended like this.
Tomorrow everyone will state the amount of money they have in mind during the meeting's adjournment.
It's all right, don't worry about it.
A million coffees
Wide Habibi
Hey, hey, hold on a sec, this is a bit much, give us a chance to catch our breath!
The committee is currently adopting the project budget. The issue of money is now settled.
I want more.
We told you to keep quiet about the scandal, but you're creating a ruckus in the Ministry's courtyard.
Ooo, our supporters, don't embarrass us!
Yaa yeh had al-heen wesal as'3indkem meshtame3een kalekum ahnii
We've cut the electricity and there's one round left.
They lit a fire in the Ministry's courtyard.
O Allah, grant us! O Allah, grant us!
I've heard.
Oh my, how much did you reach in the budget over there?
My brother is not
With the project we are all in this together, all 50 million of us.
This is only the first stage, just fifty million.
Total amount received: JD
This is valid.
O you, owner of the cup's rein! Salem.
May you be blessed with good health.
And hurry up, let's get going. The beneficiaries are all waiting for us.
It's not a problem, as long as there are no discussions about the budget being adopted. That's the most important thing.
And from tomorrow we start implementing the project.
It serves a very large segment of the community.
This is your millennium project, God willing. International Beaches.
This, God willing, is the first stage.
(Infrastructure)
This project is for the benefit of future generations.
Of course, on behalf of the program's family, we would like to congratulate you and also extend our best wishes on the occasion of the inauguration of the project, which I believe will take place tomorrow, God willing.
It took them one and a half million years to complete.
One and a half years
Once again, of course, under the name of the "Future Tenders" program
This project
For future generations
May God perpetuate our blessings of petroleum.
Second, third and tenth stage
With the presence of a delegate
Welcome!
They ask why we're gathered here. When will the sirens bring us news?
We will not go down (singing) 'Taps' for you.
Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. You have grown old and senile.
We all sat down, the sun killed us with heat.
O daughter of mankind!
But I see nothing.
The sea is my only homeland.
Why did you remove it?
Eiman told me that your sister, Monira, is here.
My dad's story about the desert.
I said: "The child's justice is lopsided. Go see who cut her off and fed her false news."
It's not me, it's this land.
The one and only thing that makes a guy say: "This is my dad's" when seeing a farm out in the wild.
Then I'll tell you those stories.
Do you have brothers
They work hard, Alhamdulillah, investing in land, real estate and businesses.
My head aches.
Ava ya Iman.
And then, my sister.
How come you don't know?
They're forcing it upon me.
These two are my brothers.
And nothing is sweeter than honesty.
Because of the money
We now have to believe her when she says she's taking him to hospital.
It has now been many years in the courts with her brothers.
Nineteen years if not more
He never returned.
The Al Salmeen brothers are thieves.
He came back and told me yesterday.
I just want to build a mosque before I die.
You don't know.
I do not say that my brothers are like that, God forbid.
Now my father has been gone for a few years
Why now are you coming to ask?
And she saw the farm.
After Ashabi
Not every three months he goes to check on her.
The falcon was a gift. Let us know what's going on.
It's not up to my mood.
We have changed, by God, the sisters don't see Arial.
The solution is with me.
Where are you from?
And she's not even my girlfriend.
Munira Šajn
And whoever submits to Allah in Islam
It became fifty thousand.
Because I dared to ask about my father's land out in the desert.
I'm sure my rights are more than this.
Each one lives in that villa.
And their children in the best schools.
Lean on me, Munira
I won't stay silent about my rights
That's it, I'm taking my share.
We invest the money in the company. It's better for you too. No maybe.
All in each other's heads
Died the mercy in people's hearts
Don't say the Brothers will turn out better than my Brothers.
Just you wait.
Twelve years
And I've dealt with these courts.
And in the end
I neither got the right nor the wrong.
Why do they do this?
That's why I tell you, Mom, charm them.
Treat them gently.
Beelthron Sevenfold
Why do courts take all these years?
We are all four hundred thousand
We, if we reach millions like other countries
And I swear, Mom, I don't think so until the verdict is out.
My brothers are inside me.
I swear, Mom, I don't want anything.
O my mom, what can I say?
I say: 'Only Allah can suffice us against the wrongdoer.'
Hasbunallahu wa ni'mal wakeel.
You didn't have a court date last week.
Insisted, oh my mother.
The judge says: Write a memo.
And here we are, mom, from one memo to another.
They're investing millions, Mom. You're witnessing it.
And I will make them two earrings and a brooch.
I'm not taking it seriously.
That's why I'd do the same if I were you.
I'll keep quiet about what they give me.
Because the woman
Your father's wealth is with us.
Real ones ask you.
She has it in her possession.
A few inquiries regarding her share.
Just want to get to know and leave.
If there are any proofs.
Change your mind and replace it.
I'll go with a light spirit
I expect an official waiver for us.
50 and a half with her real working on it.
Do you want to know or shall I bash your head in the toilet?
What made her speak now?
But greed
And heaven is not my fate.
My father inherited it and decided it's yours, or so it seems.
Neither him nor I could decide.
This is the Will of Allah.
Why do they torment my father in his grave?
I expected my brothers to look like this.
This money is good for nothing.
She's been working for thirty forty years.
I don't know how to behave, Nasser.
The lands, buildings and real estates are easy to know about.
I don't know how much they earn.
Even the company
You have the right to go out and experience everything.
And I'm not giving them back.
How can I return and be at peace with them?
It's not up to you.
It's not up to you. I have the right to look into everything.
An agency without a doorman
Your sister has granted a power of attorney to him.
He is authorized by the power of attorney to access everything in our company.
Saad Falcon
Yay itool alsanah.
Falcon Salvation.
Mr. Nasser
With your permission, I'll take it.
At your command, Sir.
And go ahead of me, O Allah.
With your permission, let's go.
Let him not have anything to hold over us.
Sure, if I were to complain now.
He said you're blowing him off.
Let him have it his way.
In his hand he holds an official document.
Officially, we can't prevent it.
He has the right to be informed of all matters without exception.
If the budget and accounts are tight.
We give her 40,000 every three months.
If the budget is tight, look carefully.
Strike twelve at eight.
Zen divided her portion into three.
Thirty-two
Do you know how much it adds up to?
This is what we want.
These are not including the known lands and projects.
And we're having fun.
We are not afraid.
Welcome is appreciated, what's not welcome is what's currently here.
He'll deal with her.
They give their sisters small amounts of money to live on.
Already married.
Her husband supports her.
I want the money!
Yes, this is the correct way of thinking!
At your command.
Let him rest.
Even my desk
My brother Rashid means, this should have been done from the start.
At your command.
File File
When I knew her true worth.
Not the villas and lands you know nothing about.
They were seven.
Look at sixteen lands.
Stumbling in the dark
She was shocked.
It's definitely haram.
Stay behind them.
O father, I beg you, please don't mention the court.
The hottest thing in humans
The coolest thing about the envious is that they get angry.
A text minute.
And then he says his usual line.
Seven four two thousand and I don't know how many
They see a feast, Dad.
You shouldn't move out of the room at all, Mom.
Insha'Allah, Allah will heal you.
La la la, this house is your house.
My brother Nasser and my sister Manar
After we seized the door and expelled him from the company
Round up one guy who was with me in school and send him over to me.
One whose name is Abdullah
I'll be back.
Ikhsi 'aad.
It means he can influence them.
Inshallah he will be able to.
iii
We do not resort to the courts.
The courts see beyond the memos.
And delays and the butchering of lawyers are all lies.
Years went by.
Time goes by.
And not a single cent do you receive from them.
May Allah have mercy on her soul, Um Salmeen.
She instructed me the day before she died.
She told me to toughen up and go to court.
Our courts
She died and didn't get a penny from her inheritance.
The case is still with the judge, and she's dead.
How about we're like the other countries
Hello Abdullah
Brother Abdullah
Two years have passed.
This is my brother Saad.
May God keep you close to one another.
The most important thing
Fellowship and Brotherhood
Dear Rashid,
You're like my brother.
Don't let problems and money
Do you have another topic other than the one my sister is discussing?
Please.
And why should I keep quiet?
He's right.
They are begrudging me my father's halal earnings!
Yesterday my mom said your brother's wife is سعد.
And her father is a correspondent at the Ministry.
All from my dad's halal money.
We have waited all this time.
Last-ditch effort.
Sent them your friend Abdullah.
They were rude and disrespectful to him and kicked him out.
Angelfish are swimming with Abdulrahman and the Al-Shabiso men.
Sure, why not!
He said "Inshallah, Nasser".
Right Eye.
I'll take them to court.
You forgot the deceased mother of Salama and her pilgrimage (Hajj) from the courts.
The Salamins' brothers can go to court.
Just my brothers
They may slightly fear what people say.
They might say it's a fault to go to court, what would people say about us?
Let's see what Abdulrahman the volunteer is up to.
Live long and prosper
The Khutbah Yaum'ah is
Close the door, please.
What are you saying, my son?
He speaks the truth.
Please, get out now. Go on.
I'm going to court tomorrow morning.
And why would I postpone it until the day after tomorrow?
Then I decide, not you.
Ashbiir means from now till the day after tomorrow
Hello, my brother Rashid.
Take it from me.
I told you so.
Threaten them with court.
Right now he's begging me to postpone my departure.
Because they have seen the truth, my darling.
It's necessary that I go to your sister's place, Manar.
What's this?
Here's what you wanted to know: Lo and behold!
The attendees are greeted.
A very small model of the Court House.
May God protect you.
The attendees are greeted.
You're welcome.
It's you who said it.
Don't go today, please stay.
Let it be after tomorrow.
For God's sake, I'll prepare this memo for the courthouse.
Tired, we're ready. It's a straight road ahead.
Two guests are entering through that door.
As soon as we entered through the door
You put all your things down.
The phone is made of metal so it doesn't make the *beep beep beep beep beep* sound.
Take the elevator to the 8th floor: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8.
Two worlds collide at the writer's desk.
If you need a certain judge, look no further than Jufi Alqadhi.
And this too.
Do you want to complain about us?
Coming along the way
And when will you take your rights, Najouf?
You take the six hundred.
As he said.
Goodbye.
Dinner is at my sister's place tonight.
Oh, they approved his project at the Ministry. Walid.
My sister tells me I'm flying with joy, I can't believe it.
He told me to approve the project, and your dinner will be at my place.
Alhamdulillah, it was not meant to be. Oh well, once is enough.
Oh, how happy you must be now, Abu Waleed!
He's got it down.
My sister told me yesterday that she was so excited she couldn't sleep.
Subhan Allah, indeed, Manal.
I am not familiar with these matters, but Allah has sent him helpful children.
Inshallah, I will tell your father.
Apologies for any mistakes.
We love you, Uncle Walid.
May God bless you, Bou Walid. You didn't hold back.
May Allah enrich you and increase your goodness, Inshallah.
What a great cook you are, Waleed!
Get yourself a good accountant and secretary to organize your work.
They said to me: "You just sign the office lease and leave the rest to us."
Please come in, my uncle.
O my beloved, the apple of my eye!
My father is a Blackberry.
We want to build a big house
See him reply in his face.
Dad, didn't we agree that today after eating you would give a speech?
And now, dear audience, we have the project owner's speech. Please welcome my father, Abu Walid, who will grace us with his words.
Forgive us, it's back.
Congratulations, congratulations Abu Waleed!
You deserve it. You deserve it. May it bless you. You deserve it.
Honestly, you know your way around business and trade.
This project has a story, my friends.
How are you doing?
That's how it is, thank God.
That year
Japanese team is playing with us tomorrow.
I'm at the Souq Waqif.
I don't know about him.
This is a catalogue of the Mal Factory's Multipurpose Halls. Our Ministry has requested a tender for their services.
Any contractors available for hire will build for you.
What is understood
Any contractor
The Japanese are not a joke.
It's invalid. It just tells you, the the the computer.
I want a cinema.
I want a kitchen set.
I told you the day I submitted the catalogue to the Ministry's Committee.
How's your agreement with the factory?
I paid them an amount
Introduction
The most important thing is to coordinate with the factory.
Signed by His Excellency Dr. Rami Hamdallah
And they gave me a deadline too, until when I can place my first order.
Finally, I'm tired.
They approved it.
Just waiting for the stroke of His Highness Sheikh Bo Faha's signature.
How are you doing, Secretary?
Uncle Bu Fahd said he didn't attend [work] consistently.
I'll order you a guy.
O sweet son of Walid, I have done a good deed.
The problem is that Bo Fares might come or might not come.
A day off
He has no time.
Come here now.
You are the manager here.
I want Fahd to slaughter me.
Not necessarily him to sign it.
The insides of all these files are cluttering my desk and need Fahad's signature.
And the solution is
God be with you.
It's 2:15, Abu Waleed.
Time's up.
I don't think Bu Fahad is my uncle.
God help you, come tomorrow.
You say you've known the manager for a long time and he's your buddy.
What's wrong with you?
A manager like this, sitting on his chair, just posing in the office.
The times make them sit idle at their desks.
Loss, but the starch in their keffiyehs is a pity.
Of course, I quit the office. I'm coming as a substitute.
That means they don't do anything at all.
Only at the command of Abu Fahad will they move the chair.
Yesterday the manager asked about you.
And do not neglect the rights of God's creatures.
It seems like you're going to them again today.
Oh, he's in a spot of trouble, isn't he?
Every day I encounter a problem.
Because the factory is giving me a deadline.
No, God willing, no. May God forbid.
And if he asks about you
Not just you waiting for Bofahd
Take a look at these files.
They're all waiting for Bu Faisal's signature.
I expect him today.
Relax, you guys
Go and take a walk!
If I will talk to you
If anything happens, I'll message you, but don't call and scare the crap out of everyone, okay?
Bye, God be with you.
Forgiveness, you've invented the lady.
O son, it has been a month since they agreed to appoint me.
Just let the men sign, my brother. What's this talk?
Your procrastination is going to ruin my daughter's university enrollment, dad! The papers for the mission are not even ready yet!
My problem is with the factory's delay. Delay, delay.
You all wait a bit.
All your transactions are expected.
The real drinks his coffee, but when he finishes, they bug him.
It's quiet, he said. It's all quiet.
Hello, may your life span be long.
Goodbye.
Just a moment, everyone.
Just a moment, where are you all going? Hold up for a sec.
Understand what happened.
What happened next?
He has an important trip coming up.
He's got a private entrance.
This is his usual state.
Oh, my brother, our interests have stalled.
Every day do an inner inner move head.
What's up? Look at Bu Faisal.
Your strive, father.
God forbid
She finds her from nowhere and mom's nowhere to be found.
The factory in Japan
The deadline is about to expire.
And your aunt from the other side.
She's so poor, she's got no money.
She finds it here, she finds it there.
Mom, I'm very worried about Dad.
Don't leave him alone.
I speak.
Hello, who's there?
Uncle Walid
So you tell me about the factory and your sister-in-law's money.
Wait for Bu Faisal, okay?
It means, Dad, how long must I wait?
They couldn't come up with anything better than
Here we are waiting for Bu Faisal.
Oh dad, you've never held back on me.
Just all my friends will be attending university next week.
Shadur yabeh
The telephone is by the window.
May you only have good thoughts, my patience is with you.
Who's speaking?
I hope Bu Fahad comes.
I don't know what to tell you, my sister.
You've been very patient with us.
God helps.
Uncle Walid is not doing well.
My boat caught him, he's shivering and trembling.
Because the deadline is about to expire.
There are five days left.
He spends all his money on it.
In God I suffice.
O eternal eternal eternal!
Inshallah I'm feeling good.
This is a wonderful place.
Most of the above is running.
The second text under the mall doesn't move.
My earphones are making me 50% deaf.
I've made a discount for you.
My apologies
Inshallah, all your affairs will turn out for the best.
My sister didn't hold back.
She's waiting on her money a little bit.
May Allah reward her with goodness.
I got it from your sister but
Our manager has appeared, God help us.
It seems our manager heard.
God only knows what this manager has planned.
I'll get it from him or from Khalid.
God is eternal, and God is a problem.
And tomorrow is the last day.
My rights are being wasted.
O Eterna Deus.
Aim at the brain. Aim at the brain.
Where did you learn to speak?
You hate me to the core, don't you?
Brother Bou Walid
I'm reaching out to you because you're breaking my heart.
Just stand by on the phone.
Goodbye.
You've always been a law-abiding person.
We held you up as an example.
Don't think I'm oblivious to your daily post-work outings.
I am able to sue you.
And then there's this mobile phone.
I'll take it out on you instead
I've placed you on the audit committee.
I'll go inventorying with them today.
Don't you dare leave work during office hours.
And when it appears
Do not blame me afterward.
Poor guy, today's his last day.
My uncle's long telephone cable is waiting for a call.
I'm afraid he'll get fired.
O father of Waleed, it's my phone that's ringing.
It's heartbreaking.
Let the poor guy go.
O father of Waleed
O mankind, indeed
What's up with you, Abu Waleed? Neither do I call you on the phone.
Please finish your transaction, spirit.
Don't worry
You don't hold back, God knows.
It seems Daoum is with Bu Fahd.
What should I do for you?
This is a senior official.
Where does he go?
O God, bless Pakistan.
My brother is heading towards Pakistan.
Pakistan's third office is on the right.
I don't cough.
Wait for Bu Faisal.
Do not sit.
Do not show me.
Do you want it or not?

Oh, guys, the Rial's at it again!
Do you know how long it's been since?
And throughout all these years it's been you.
Amodi Papers & Stationery
Get in, it's falling!
Back and forth between these ministries.
But we were young
Hi, what I see in front of you is a bag of rice. I put it on my shoulder like this, as if I were carrying a plaster cast for kids.
And Allah willing, may Allah protect you, I learned to ride a bike.
Especially after the sicle I learned on and bought.
Really green olive.
And they flirt with me because I ride a bicycle! Oh dear!
Making a living and raising the kids
The manager has arrived.
When it's done, God willing, it's our treat.
All praise be to God. All praise be to God.
The kid is ruining the job.
I bear witness that you have done more than enough, oh father of Saeed.
Now the prophet of comfort has returned, oh brother. Alas, farewell.
We're here.
What you don't want anymore, I can stretch it out for a year.
Just shut up.
May Allah reward you with goodness.
You extended me four years.
And I should have retired a long time ago.
All the kids are working.
The last one yesterday attended.
He's back now, Abu Abdulaziz.
I seek comfort.
And your job is a correspondent.
Okhnafroush is good.
It's really happening.
I've eaten knofroush maybe four or five times in my life.
It's so yummy!
I smell it in my nose
Everything Tamer desires will come true, God willing.
Please contact the Human Resources Department.
You finished the papers.
I've been there since yesterday.
Your transaction is delayed like this.
Yo, I'm so bored!
That's it.
Do not sever us, O custom!
Hello Dad, Khaled.
From this moment on, it's over.
Inshallah we will rest, Oh father, we will rest. Woe to us!
Sweet sweet.
I'm at work and can't get out.
The General Administration for Human Resources can proceed.
I have a transaction over there.
I want you to take it and bring it to the Civil Service.
Thank you, dad. You're the best!
Where are you going?
My yacht is raining, I'm going to the bank.
And our determination is unwavering.
Now
The bank is waiting for me.
Pickle it with someone.
No Dad, I can't leave work.
Okay, okay, let's go. See you later.
It seems he didn't agree.
He says he can't go out.
What's up now?
Tomorrow morning on my way to the bank
I have been learning all these years.
Surely, he feels frustrated.
Thus, it is better for him.
You let him rest now.
Poor Ferhan, he's happy to be going home.
He called me, he said Khaled.
Deaf so he can finish his transaction
Fear Allah.
Every man for himself.
My mom feels sorry for the khunfaroosh.
Oh my, I hope it won't break.
I do not regret the khunfush.
But I say, whoever leaves work and such.
May Khalid rest in peace.
He's lying in his room.
Those who perished in their sea
Good morning dad
Hello my daughters
Dad, may he deliver you.
Just tell me the manager's really angry.
Here are my studios.
Hello, Um Saeed.
Told you, let the kids be self-reliant. Why aren't you listening?
When I retire.
And upon him be peace.
Here I am, waiting for you, with the khunfaroosh in front of me.
Today we will eat it.
Bye, God be with you.
Dad, I'm sorry I forgot to tell you.
My dear father
God be with you.
Yes, the one near the market.
Get out of here ASAP!
The moon has risen, my daughters, the moon has risen.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Masha'allah!
John deleted the tweet.
Ils ils ice
I told you to stay at home.
Teach your children how to manage themselves.
Sausage, Yam Saeed.
Their circumstances are difficult, I have to help them.
Okay, okay, calm down.
I'll get you a glass of water
I'll bring you some khunfروش for you to eat.
He's feeling dizzy.
And the taxis
And on his face
The branch in the market has closed down.
They want the business card.
Once they're mounted
The papers were brought to him.
Thank God your book is ugly.
Each one relies on themselves.
I told you
I want you to rest
Hayaak iles yana.
Don't miss the delicious lunch!
Dept. to dept. behind government transactions.
<h1>Adabg man Vazah lo Vazah</h1>
Deals with the kids
Whether I treat them as elders or as juniors, indeed, you've pampered them.
The kids have nice, important jobs.
Their time is packed, what can we do?
Every day except meetings with the manager or the old boss or the minister.
They have nice jobs too, and they need time to hire. Oh my!
And you'll be done with your transactions, and your etiquette is running wild, and a second job is making you a bouncing ping pong ball. How much more sitting around idle?
Right away! May Allah reward you.
Now go, farewell.
Oh God, forgive us, O Bushahin!
They finally called me, saying it's done.
If your dad sends them tomorrow, the transaction will be completed.
Thus, I will be very late.
Fear your Lord.
Tomorrow is absolutely out of the question.
Out of his love for you
He's really bothered and exhausted by your treatment of him.
You don't even respect the grey hair on his head.
He's been lying in the room for two days now.
I'm wandering the streets, suffering from the sun.
May he give you the treatment.
And deliver his soul from death.
Committee work from morning till night.
My reputation, Mom
It means "My foundation is delayed."
As long as tomorrow is your last day and the committee is coming.
Your transaction is due for processing tomorrow.
But if not, come at night and complain to me about them.
He has a committee meeting tomorrow, he has to attend.
What's up, Dad?
His teardrop in his eyes.
I didn't lie to my dad at all.
The committee changed their minds.
They said it'll be ready by the end of the week.
Tell it to your father.
Oh dad, don't go
I'm going to Heaven, I'm not coming back.
I'm not sitting in this cafeteria with these disgusting women.
He's laughing at him.
Okay, fine.
I'll go apologize to him.
I'm going to him
Thank you very much.
Khlood, Dad.
Thank him he's wrong.
And it turned out he was selfish too.
And it won't tire you out, even if the committee doesn't come.
You're the goodness and the blessing.
From now on.
We conduct our transactions ourselves.
Tales from the House
And here's your head, let me kiss it.
Hello, hello, hello my friend!
Good morning!
O dearest father
Through the whole wide world
Mall Mapik gets angry.
And I don't feel cramped.
And you're still like I told you.
I need the settlement of this transaction ASAP.
I want to finish it myself
They told me to come quickly.
You have a meeting.
With His Excellency the Minister
Her happiest moment, Dad.
Let's go with these big ones.
Oh, my joy! They said my son is with the 's and alas, this is him.
Trust in God, your soul's permanence is marble.
Where are you, Boussaid?
And the one who brought you up
Dad, the envelope is right in front of me.
Just come by and I'll send the envelope with the messenger.
My love, Daddy.
It means "it has happened".
It seems he forgot.
Because the committee met after an hour.
There is no god but Allah, may He protect you.
My son has a meeting with the Minister today. Oh dear!
Give me just the transaction.
Hello, my situation is work-home and home-work.
I don't see anyone.
Peace be upon you.
Please, be my guest.
I la la la, I didn't say anything, I didn't say a thing.
Any of the weeks in the summer go to the desert.
And he says to me: "There's a mouse in the farm."
He departs in the morning
He's very comfortable there, of course.
And I'll add a verse to the poem for you.
She's apparently a great cook.
And his spirit
With peace,
What's wrong?
What's the matter, my dear uncle?
May Allah guide you.
La la ya book M ma finy shay, ma finy shay.
Your papers are scattered.
That one's at the farm.
And that's a plenty.
<h1>Refigt Deal</h1>
I'm thirsty, Dad. I want some water.
Yip li mai mai
My dear children
No no, cross it out, cross it out, I don't want it.
Don't write like this.
I'll let them scratch their heads in wonder.
Big sister, come quickly!
And you're the metal pan.
La la la time to kill
Yes, by Allah, my sister.
Allow me, my sister.
The one they call the League and the Cup
And he spoke about the referee.
My mother doesn't know what to make of this boy. He's a handful!
And hold her to it, it's not just empty chatter! It's not just empty chatter!
People have returned to their usual state.
They want him to speak on the radio and TV.
And more than that
Take him, seize him, my sisters! Throw him in jail!
Do you swear, my sister?
O daughter of the 'life' (or 'existence'), these days no one benefits anyone.
Shelah by problems
And Allah, right now if he were to die.
I won't let him talk nonsense. As he put it, we've had enough of that.
Praise be to God for his safety.
We were blessed with her visit.
Goodbye.
I'm running late for work, Mom.
Hear me, Dad.
I was up all night yesterday.
And I warn you.
Right now I just wanted to remind you, Dad.
Okay, Mom.
Impossible after connect.
No radio, no TV, not even Ooredoo connected
Your sister, Aisha, has been living here for two days.
And Manira, your fiancée, her tears are flowing in streams down her cheeks.
For God's sake, Dad, have mercy on us!
As you said.
Nonsense.
May you never feel distressed.
Your uncle, Bu Amnira
Jane after you got out of jail.
And that's it.
Take off the veil.
After visiting my dad, I gave him his present. He accepted it, so fingers crossed and touch wood, all will be well.
The second time he'll grab you by the hand and take you to court. Let go of his daughter!
Okay, Mom.
Repentance after I say
If you contacted the radio or the TV, it's your own fault.
I've repented.
Let me just go now.
Between you and me, only this talk.
My boss told me.
We don't want him here.
This will go tomorrow and mix up about the management.
Just do us a simple thing.
What should I tell the manager?
Oh, he has a million excuses to tell.
Where should I go
That's it, I'm done.
I missed you
Yes indeed.
Goodbye.
I told you
Do you know, Saleh, what I told you?
The public interest has forced us to reduce the number of correspondents at the Ministry.
That's right.
And the one who delivers you is only Us, not your babblings.
Sweet of you.
Nonsense.
Yes indeed.
I'm still here.
We have some work for you, please.
What's this mess, Dad?
Lean and sober
I miss you so much, ask about Salah.
I've got you a present.
Munira was standing and listening when I was telling you.
I already told you, Dad.
I hear them through my ears I've just come from the mill
Go now, you're in.
Let me deal with your father
The prison shower, we said it was a mistake and kept quiet.
We stay quiet now, after they fired him.
Just because we're family.
Did you know?
I seek refuge in God from Satan.
Inshallah everything will be fine.
Remember Allah, He will guide you.
May I have a coffee? Keep your coffee for yourself.
I know you well.
Bored.
Your uncle is giving you a two-week deadline.
And Allah will not hold you back by your hand and guide you to the court so that (I) can divorce you.
Oh my, even if I get out
It's none of your business!
Just bear with yourself
Even if someone tells you.
Do as you hear yourself.
That's not just nonsense.
Yes, my dear uncle.
But don't punish me these couple of days.
I want to hear you say it once, just once. No nonsense, please.
It's done.
To be you the police
Mom, you misunderstood.
My cousin has a problem, so we asked him to speak on the radio tomorrow.
He was a bit hesitant.
We felt like we were talking to him in a public place so we hesitated.
So I told my first cousin's son that I would lend him the house and that it's best if we speak in private.
Did you feel like he wanted to say something?
It means he's hesitant, he both wants it and doesn't want it.
They came from somewhere.
Bas bas bas bas bas bas bas
I am not your mother, I don't know you, and I disown you until the Day of Judgment. Have I made myself clear or not?
Saleh Saad
No God, may He save you. That's it, finally! Thank God, we're rid of it.
You have a sense of responsibility.
An example of a successful employee
But unfortunately
Though I tried.
Peace be upon you.
Why did you bother coming all the way here?
I was just about to ask the secretaries to let you know not to come.
Shahin, what's up with you?
You didn't know who this is.
Is there anyone in Qatar who doesn't know Saleh? Enough of this nonsense!
You're valid, not just gibberish.
Nonsense.
What job?
But there are no jobs , you know the circumstances .
Real, why haven't you employed him?
I'm busy at work.
I swear I went everywhere, Manira.
Even one person told me before I came that there was a job, but they took it which means it's gone.
Her husband divorced her yesterday.
It means my responsibility has grown this big.
One dimension has become his huge responsibility.
I really don't know what to do, God.
He's getting closer to the Minister.
But I honestly don't think it's fair.
He thinks I'm afraid that he'll take my place.
That's enough, you're killing me!
Who told you I play basketball?
Just want this method to be far away from me.
I think about a way to slaughter him.
I'll finish it in one go.
Just what?
I know him.
It's not the one who talks on the radio
I'll prepare the meal for you.
And you're just a bite of information.
You, Saleh, are a very patriotic citizen.
You are a proud citizen
Thank you.
I swear I've had enough.
I consider your voice to be the voice of truth.
I too, my dear Bou Fahad, have had a little chat with him.
O come back, O Saleh, be true!
It's been a long time since we heard him talk like that. He's the one who always says we've had enough of nonsense.
I want to get to know him.
This is a natural thing, Saleh.
I'm camping in the desert.
Straight ahead, straight ahead, straight ahead.
And few are those like you.
Your speech is very sweet.
Your voice on the radio sounds much sweeter.
We heard only him, not his gibberish.
Ambla, come on, just this once, for BouFahd. There are some who will say it, for sure. They'll say it, loud and clear.
That's enough nonsense.
This is the real one, may you live a long life This is it.
Your request continues, it never stops.
It's a little tough.
Then stop it all.
I wish it would continue because of people's issues and problems.
Hear me, Saleh.
I'll give you just one problem.
You, Saleh, are the voice of truth.
I want you a little bit.
A senior official said this:
O brother, say it! Tell her it is so, by Allah!
Yes, by Allah!
This is your chance
Opportunity knocks twice.
Yes means yes.
What's wrong with you? Don't you understand?
Please wait just a moment, brother.
Some problems and woes and highs
His Excellency the Minister
The Ministry has requested eight thousand pipes in its latest project.
<b>Compressed load bearing capacity: 120cm</b>
But this employee
Agreed on pipes capacity.
To benefit from the difference in price.
Nonsense.
You didn't hold back, you didn't hold back at all, brother Saleh. No more nonsense.
There is no god but Allah, he protects you.
This call is a special request.
Inshallah you will name him Yes.
Last but not least, bsna khrabit bsna khrabit.
Do you know?
Life and what it makes one do.
That's the last one, promise.
Sultan Asdak took flight.
The minister was carried away by the speed.
He said something true.
Now A returns, leaving the stage clear for Bu Fahd to play by himself.
I do all the tasks.
Oh, you who have a long life ahead of you.
The minister's attendants are present.
Goodbye.
Nonsense.
That's it, this is the last one. Seriously.
Ooh, here are the papers for the job, Your Highness. Just kidding.
It means those who wanted to reach him have reached him.
Hear my words.
Because he is afraid
I'll talk about him and expose his scandals and misdeeds.
You peek at the flaws and criticize.
They fear you
My sister A'isha deceived me.
You're the kind one.
Tomorrow my uncle is your father, Abu Amenira.
The condition is: I'm working.
Those who criticize and point out flaws have nothing better to do.
Why do they hate our country?
Do we have faults?
We don't do 'connections' or 'favors'.
I've never heard the word wasta before.
In our government offices, it's first come, first served.
We don't have bribery.
I don't know her.
Look at the employee.
Do foreigners get paid more than locals? Absolutely not!
We do everything with our own hands
You're a child of your mother, your father's child, never in our land has a lady been a lord.
He gets angry at you while you're still in the job.
We are the best people
The best country
Flawless
And thank you.
Shomkhrabt yesterday on the radio
Mom, I want some candy.
There's no candy except after dinner.
That's it, kid. No more candy.
The shirt was ripped open at the seams.
Oh my, Wadool and I were playing.
I don't know if you're playing.
Just a rip in the shirt.
O my lord, may Allah protect you!
Come and see what your brother's son has done.
The one who told you that we didn't need to buy it, as it was expensive, was right. I said, "It's okay, it's for the kid, it'll look nice."
See what's up.
This can't be cancelled, it's already cancelled the shirt. I can't give you a refund.
He does what he wants, of course no one supports him.
Mom, where's the halva?
See the crack running **deliberately** through the workers.
He returned carrying a newborn.
He's thrilled, it's the first time he's wearing it.
I've waited for you.
Where's the change?
In the garden
Why is this happening?
Dad in the subject between us
I love it.
Save yourself the embarrassment.
Place your bet and roll the dice, little one.
He's left to do as he pleases.
Wreaks havoc
Don't educate me.
Teach me.
We're raising them.
On excessive mistakes, respect yourself.
Epithelial cell
You're fighting like a bunch of kids.
Away from me, bay.
Oh mother, don't you ever interfere!
Tell him to treat his children fairly, listen to me, both of you listen carefully.
O you, young man!
I swear you're like a child, I won't let you distinguish between a kid and a grown man.
At last I've found out.
The blame is on me, not on you.
Let's go up.
These people do not deserve even one.
Even to return to them.
It's better if one.
Time of the calm hearts
Okay, okay, done. Bye-bye. See ya.
But the Minister wants the documents urgently, I'm expected to provide them.
Okay, okay, I'll deal with the Minister later. It's none of your concern; I'll handle it.
The calamity has passed, the disaster has passed, the catastrophe has passed.
Her new dress, no way Aisha!
This this is not the action of a child.
You're right.
La la la Ju beh behdel al-ثياب tabehdel
Joey Joey
It means there's no hope you'll get to wear it.
My tight pants are so tight that I can only wear them alone.
No no, this definitely isn't cut by hand.
I'll tell you, it's like a paradise with an electric chainsaw.
But I swear by Allah, who has done this will pay.
I tell you
Who wants some candy? Come on over!
I still know
If you still know, take a walk around the villa.
I love you not just because you know how to ride a bike
I love you because there's something else in you
You speak the truth.
Do you want some candy?
I want two.
I'll give you four units.
Who tore our clothes in the closet
How's your dad doing now?
He has a big scissors so he can cut the car with it.
Under the bed, there's a bag of lollies.
Back when they'd go to such extremes.
No one else has done this mess.
Why do we keep quiet about it?
The most important thing
We insist on our word.
A young boy, born into wealth, grows up to be a dandy.
Any computer.
He's talking nonsense.
The breaking I saw with my own eyes is impossible for a child to do.
Why won't you believe me?
Go ask your friends, go
Just a moment, please.
This is your state.
Every day you argue with your mother.
Where are you, bygone days of yore?
Oh Allah, with Your forgiveness and well-being
May Allah guide you.
Huge scissors are estimated by Ezel.
It's you who seeks your peers.
Look at the *shalaakh*, Mom!
Going to get some heavy-duty scissors.
Respect yourself, Sultan. Respect yourself, Awash.
Oh dad, please come, for the love of God, and figure something out for them. Come on, dad.
How do I begin?
And each one of you
You are fathers
And the child is born.
The child is born.
You are my brothers
Hear my words and make peace. Stretch out your hands.
Now, what are you up to?
Good news, oh bird! I have torn their garments apart!
Their clothes are done for after this mess they've gotten me into. They've lost my files, my data, my documents – they've lost everything!
By God, I won't let him!
I'll bring you a museum-worthy Arabic speaker. Mark my words, I won't let you down!
Don't worry about him.
Tick tock tick tock, until he gets tired and leaves.
My brother is not sober, I know him well.
And everyone greeted each other.
My father doesn't mean it. His heart is full of hatred.
Oh no, I broke the computer.
O Falcon
Sultan Atte Atte Atte
Oh, come on, have some fear of God, Mom!
Give him attention, be careful.
Go play outside with your cousins, Dad.
O Allah, O Allah, may Allah guide you.
May Allah bless you.
Real each one gets his share
You've left nothing for the kids.
Inshallah, Mom.
Their brother Abdul Rahman
It may be the first time, Mom.
Do you know, mom, it's 'awwah' the 'oud'
Does he know how to talk to people?
He gets along with them.
Don't be angry with me, please.
You're the ones who are supposed to.
Each one has a role.
May Allah reform you, may Allah reform you.
Even you, Dad, have become like them.
O my mother, my mother, they've beaten my son! May God never let you have a say in anything! Go away, go away, go away!
O mother, my heart aches.
O my son, the last of my sons!
You've let us down, guys.
The ones deleting were the kids, the kids.
I'm not convinced.
I see them with both my eyes
Tell it to the kids, they won't believe this heat.
He says from above
Oh, he's a big shot from above Flinton, but only from up above.
Hey, I'm not drunk, I'm sober!
You are welcome to go.
You might be a bit tired or your head's spinning.
Do you know who these people are?
They told me they're coming to throw rocks at you.
<h1> Ahma S </h1>
O my beloved
I'll tell you, go and relax now. They've already signed a commitment, that's all. What else do you want?
In the name of God In the name of the Most Merciful God
What's this? Oh dear, oh dear!
God suffice me against the enemy.
O my mother, O my mother!
It's all your fault.
It's because of you.
Akbar bas sigar Malet 'alaykum wa-'aqlukum
They took me to the hospital, I kept fainting, I was dying.
I've never seen him before.
And I see him not taking his eyes off you, O Hazi.
Oh, he wasn't registered in our business.
But now he's been attending the course with us for a week.
It's obvious he's dying to meet you.
Don't be so heavy, it's not that big of a deal.
No, sister.
He doesn't say I throw myself at him.
He left me, a son of a wealthy man, I sighed.
Let things become natural again.
Now he's the one chasing after you, and he's the one who's fixated on you.
Yes, I do feel the same admiration towards him.
I just feel like the right opportunity hasn't presented itself yet.
O my nation, in the nation
I'll destroy you and show you how my shell works.
Don't wait, my dear young man. She's coming to tell you, "Excuse me, I'd like to get to know you."
O brother, let _you_ take the initiative.
You're right.
But I'm waiting for the right opportunity.
The Right Opportunity
More than you're enrolled with her in the same subject
The teacher is hard.
Say it, O so-and-so.
O you, over there! Hey, what's her name?
It's been three months we're giving each other the eye.
And no one knows the other.
O brother, you're from way back when.
It really is necessary for you to go and tell her: "Please."
Can I get to know you?
‏It's not as strong as it used to be.
Waiting for the right opportunity to come to me.
Well-behaved and polite
I swear I have no idea what you want exactly.
We finished shooting the series yesterday.
Yes, by Allah.
You've never forgotten us and have never failed to provide for us.
Right now, I'm free.
We're buying the villa behind us; it belongs to Waleed.
I hope he won't get married tomorrow, otherwise we won't see much of him anymore.
What's the use now?
It's been a long time.
And you bring good news.
It's been a few days since I saw her door; it's still empty of buyers.
And they bought the land through the Development Bank.
May God bless them in it, Inshallah.
Hello, Dad. Good morning.
Hit the starter, uncle.
Thank you, Book. May Allah reward you. May Allah reward you with goodness.
Hello, hello, Norah! You're most welcome. The car's working now. Consider it done. Come on over, I'll drive you there. Dad.
And peace be upon you.
What's up?
Neighbours are sitting and chatting, what do you have to do with them?
I say get out of it, it's better for you.
Neighbors are hanging out together, what do you have to do with them?
I have a nice brother who's borrowing my car and I can't get it back.
With your permission, with your permission, give me your car key.
After turning on the car
I leave you in the *Titanic* mood you're living in.
Farewell.
Goodbye.
Now you know a lot about me
And I only knew Walid.
Waleed Rashid Abdullah
Sure, a lot of people, when hearing your father's name, would think you're the actor's son.
Masha'Allah the same name
My father is Rashid Abdullah, the actor.
Rashid Abdullah is a famous actor
Why didn't you have dinner with them? Someone had that Basmatic.
O come on, tell me!
How did you know the famous actor Rashid Abdullah, Yara?
Yes, that's correct.
My friends from university know them and she's the one who told me.
Oh, he loves it and he's the only one who watches his performances.
He said we no longer live next to anyone famous or valuable in the community.
O my heart, my joy!
Shahlila, Shahlila, his blood is light, yes indeed.
His son turned out to be just like him. May God reward him for relieving me.
True indee
He returned, Drito.
I really need to take a picture with this actor I love.
Oh my, he's stolen the words right out of my mouth, that Abood, my cousin's son.
I read an interview with him in the newspaper.
He says they are filming a TV series about the old pearl diving days.
I say, I've brought you a lamb to celebrate the new house!
Prove that yes, you are a good neighbor.
Hello, is there anything new with Saleh?
We have many names.
They said: "May God protect you, Abu Sa'd. Your name is among them."
It is determined based on need and employee experience.
We don't know
We might be able to take you.
Please let me do something for you, I can't do anything for you.
In the name of God, your enemy.
We said we'd move and settle down before then; we'll furnish it later when God provides.
Fix your work
He's back, Abu Ali.
Please don't consider me a stranger.
Anything you need
I'm at your service.
Good neighbour, and I'm your brother.
But now I heard and saw
زين Mashallah! You really know your furniture.
I'll go with you.
You don't have to worry about it, sister.
Whenever you want to choose the furniture, let me know.
My love, her father is applying for a loan. If they approve, we'll buy all new furniture.
And here I say it again.
The answer is the edge.
We are Ahl Al Bayt today.
Her sister doesn't know how to study by herself.
I just want her to be self-reliant.
Of course I was speaking to her.
That means I should make up a story for you and tell you I talked to my friend.
O my dear mother, Ali!
I'm not for anything.
She loves me and I love her, I get along with her.
You are dreaming.
Let me arrange your marriage with your cousin's daughter
Let's leave it at that.
It's up to you.
My man will never forgive you.
Benjov
Good night.
And you're from her family.
Best Ali
This car is busted.
Every other day she creates a new incident or drama.
The daughter has returned, God bless you. She's back from university.
And she's always blushing.
Our daughter is our daughter.
It's alright.
There's no need to go out of your way, my brother Rashid.
There is no god but Allah, may He protect you.
The car is parked in the courtyard and the driver is sitting idle.
Empty Bank of Development didn't skimp on your house and car
This is not our car
Rashid Abdullah's neighbour's car
Hollow relationships have evolved.
We discuss issues of common interest benefiting both parties.
Wow, that's a tremendous development, Hazy!
Let's go.
Mom, he's embarrassing me again.
I agree.
Noura said she thought her daughter was accompanied by the driver every day to university.
To say to her that my dad's car will take a week to repair.
No, by Allah, not a bit!
She said: "No, the driver brings her every morning."
By Allah, O Ali is the best of witnesses.
Good people
La-la-la, Ya Bok.
There is no might and power except by Allah.
Ooh la la, what can I do now?
Chasuoi Masouliyat wa Rai.
My daughter is going to the university.
As long as your connection is Professor Rashid Abdullah,
We can't say anything anymore. That's it.
Busad Busad
I'm sorry.
My uncle knows his goat is precious to us.
Thank you very much, may God reward you, Bossaad.
Everyone loves you, Mashallah!
God is beautiful, she's beautiful.
He's back, guys. Leave Professor Rashid alone; he's busy.
Apologies, apologies, Mr. Rashid. Did we interrupt you?
At your command, ready, ready!
Lucky you, you've got a strong wasta.
Well, we're your buddies and siblings. If we ever need anything at all, remember to treat us with extra care and attention.
Just tell me where you want it, I'll bring it to you.
She's so mysterious, why is she eternal?
You're going to introduce me to Manal?
They agreed, Mom, they agreed.
Manal spoke to her mother about me.
I don't believe you.
Um Walid
Do you have any dresses for a party?
I didn't understand.
The fortune is for Walid, God willing. May my eyes' sight come true.
She spoke to me again, the poor thing.
Accessories are taken.
Accessories Jewelry
This is my mother.
Now you're going to get a fancy car
Masha'a Allah Masha'a Allah
Masha'Allah, I can't handle it.
Mom, I'm not with you anymore.
To everyone she gave, she gave the car.
And the chauffeur
Here it is: ``` If I go with you this way, they won't believe that this handsome and kind man is the husband of this queen. ```
Mbye
Inshallah you will leave in the clothes you are wearing now.
Halaaaaaa la la la la la Lafa 'aleyk
Without my makeup, you wouldn't even recognize me.
They say who's this old man coming towards us?
His Highness' coffee
I didn't recognize you, by Allah! I said this must be someone from the cabaret, not Bou Ali. You're not Bou Ali.
What do you think?
And his walk is still unsteady.
May God bless you. We are going to propose a match for Ali and are heading over to their place.
People of the Akbariyeh
I managed to get myself a car with the money from selling the agal.
I'm sure I'll find it with you.
The last series I acted in
In a wedding scene, I remember any wedding.
I was wearing that black bisht that glistened.
And Uncle Fadi taught me how to wear the bisht.
For your brother, whom God protects, has never worn a bisht.
Masha'allah, you're shining bright like a star!
That's how it'll be once I've entered the mills with the group.
That's not fair.
As you say, my brother Rashid.
‏You don't have any buttons left.
Good
The one I always see with me and Kholod
The story goes like this:
You are my beloved.
We are family now.
And we don't want our daughter Nora to go far away.
Noura is the right of Walid.
My mother tells me she sees her at the university and there's no one better.
This blessed hour
Inshallah I will tell her father. God willing, all will turn out for the best.
Why did they reject him?
Because his father is an actor.
Soul of Red Bull
Tell Rashid that he's wanted ASAP!
Where are you?
Scream out of the pain of oppression.
You say it's because his father's an actor.
Shame on you!
I am an actor.
But I am the most honorable.
I act on stage for two hours and my part is over.
My representation ends here.
You play roles.
I represent
I present them with a message that will benefit them.
You guys
I wear the actor's costume.
On stage
You guys
You acted in Al Maylas.
The wealthy sheikh.
Who's the actor among us?
Who is the real actor?
Don't be sad, Waleed.
Hold your head up high
We are not honoured.
Did you miss the sight of me coming in right now?
And I hear her screaming at him, "Don't turn around! Don't turn around!" The poor guy, it's heartbreaking.
He walks his lady.
She says it's like a horse's heaven.
It's Thursday, my friend.
It's Thursday.
My wife is not a morning person.
I'm jealous of him.
That's why it'll go like this.
So that neither the women see him nor he sees the women.
I saw how attentive his wife was.
Cedar does not wither.
But they won't show up at the office tomorrow.
Thursday, please, please show them how he wears the suit.
Thursday showed off his clothes to Faraj.
Isn't your wife the one you call 'the well-dressed'?
Oh, it's Thursday already!
O hollow-souled Ashibe
Poor brother.
How much longer will you stay like this?
If you could hear the talk behind your back ...
No, mashallah, some even say it's probably more.
Why am I doing this?
I'm envious of him.
Jealous of whom?
I often sit in front of the television
This is it.
Yes, by Allah's oath.
It's okay.
Hello sister.
The eyes dried up.
Right now, I'm imagining you and listening to the voice of a real man.
Sometimes I pick my clothes up along the way
Respect yourself and divorce her.
It's difficult. I can't let her go.
There's nothing, there's nothing, there's nothing, there's nothing, there's nothing.
Don't come close to me, just stay away.
Hello, how are you?
My intention is good.
You need me.
It's these kinds of people you hang out with that mess you up.
And especially this one. I don't like her at all, not even a little bit. She's so annoying with her 'blessed life'.
The beard of a young boy, newly sprouted, like a freshly planted seedling.
The gallant one who doesn't shy away.
May I suffer in my grave
Let me talk it over with her.
What's up with you? Tell me.
Understand each other
I don't see anyone here.
What's wrong with you? What's happening?
Thursday is the day our friend comes.
Just saw the boat and he's sitting there talking to himself.
No, I say the lame one on his head is hopping, hopping high.
Normal Thursday this poor guy.
He's reading everything aloud to his mother who's sitting in front of him and talking to her.
May Allah suffice me against his wife.
They say it's Thursday at your place.
Right now he's got a very important international call, the connection keeps cutting out.
And what about this message?
I say, may God assist you, Khamis.
What's wrong with you? Why aren't you sleeping?
I really don't know, it hasn't occurred to me.
Regarding the meeting tomorrow,
With the female delegation from the Ministry
Yes, it is possible.
God guides you, Khamis.
These names come from the Minister's office.
And then come.
You're afraid of her.
If I were talking to Salem, I wouldn't have been scared.
Truth be told.
Why is the kid hiding behind the water tank, scared and trembling?
Just like that.
Did you see the last digit in the second-to-last number sequence you have?
Latest figures
The last number you called after you deleted the woman's number you were talking to.
Tell me her name, oh father of many women.
Sure, the English translation is: Time to time to time
Saalim told her riddles.
Saloom Refeji F F F Val F al-Amal
My brother didn't believe me.
And then why are you dressed like that?
I intend to embark on scuba diving.
And God, my brother, you didn't let me wear it. She told me to go out like this.
Call me
My husband's dad called.
Hajj Murtaza
Say it, brother, get the pen, I'll give you the number.
Some of you are administrators.
This is how you guys are, you men.
You're a nutter just like him, but I'll show you.
If you intervene again, the only response I can give you is through the Minister's office.
These are horses.
She threatened me, saying that if I complained about her to the Minister's office, she would get me.
This is bold, indeed.
This one is planning to cut off my livelihood.
But I was the one who was wrong to agree with you and call her
Joof 'ead ya Khamis
If she complains about me, go to the Minister's Office.
They came to me and told me the whole story. Get me out of this.
I don't care.
You're such a scaredy-cat!
My brothers and sisters
Good morning everyone.
It's an honor to have you present at the meeting.
Where are the rest of them?
Knock and scatter!
It's Thursday today.
Yes, Your Highness.
Phone sugar
No more screwing around, leave it at the office.
The whole meeting will take just one hour.
This is my phone.
It became, it happened.
From that day on, he stayed with you and didn't go home.
Where does he go?
There's no way out.
Today's mood: same as yesterday
Jealous, jealous Aliyu is jealous.
My love, this is not jealousy.
He sits alone in the hall at night.
I tell her everything I say to my mother
Mother is dead.
That's why I brought you here to see if you can come up with a solution.
Madame A has asked you to move out of the section where women are housed.
Military rule is an abomination.
Read below Akko's signature: Shokran
My brother, please transfer me to the Social Care department.
Are you sure you've been transferred to the Care Division?
Why is it strange?
Thank you, God bless you.
You are Mr. Khamis.
Contact the Minister's Office and inform them.
Welcome to your new department!
And bring your colleagues from the office too.
Jesus and Saleh and Jasim
O Khamis, the Minister decided to transfer you yesterday.
And today you start your new department.
I explained to you , and told you about my problem with the family .
You're a trans cow from the Ministry.
It means: "Shall I go to the Minister?"
Today he took his annual leave.
And he won't be back until a month and a half has passed.
Oh, what a mess!
And that's my opinion too.
The Minister B.E. holds the same speech.
Let's keep an eye out for a place for you, because this time we'll have to transfer you, as a lot of people have told him about your problem with your wife.
I'll tell you the truth.
And the solution is
Their saying goes: "If a woman calls me, don't talk to her."
What do you think, can you iron them?
I had them put your toys in the car. I put them in a cardboard box for you.
Together
I put 10 for you, assuming you are five in the office, so each one is on two.
He's scared of his wife, he's really scared of her.
Imagine us all named Basami Rayeel
My name is Abdulghader
And that's how it is like that.
He's sweet and handsome, that's why everyone's so protective of him.
In the name of God, what's wrong with her?
Call me when you're free.
O Abdelkader, who is sitting next to Hassan, who in turn sits behind Khalil.
These clothes, everyone can pick whichever they like.
Goofy, here it is.
The mute Farah
What's up with you lately?
Please.
Where is the Care Office?
There should be five employees.
What's your name?
I am sweet.
I am married to Minon.
I'm Minion.
You are now fleeing the project right in front of us.
We sat with them.
They said it's out of gas.
They said.
<font color="FF0000">Welcome to my place! It's so nice of you to come by.</font>
I can't
I went to the kitchen and made a mess.
Oh God, oh God, oh God, please make some tea, God.
Oh God, oh God, oh God, no way!
Oh yes, oh yes, listen to the men, hear their words.
O Allah, have you forgotten that we are the children of Scorpio?
Oh Allah, oh Allah, and here I come without any thanks to anyone but Him. Oh Allah, oh Allah, oh Allah, oh Allah, oh Allah.
The bank considered it a sound project.
He kept getting a busy signal on the phone.
Poor them. They're waiting for you.
And what else troubles me but this uncle and these brothers?
Khadama travelled on the basis of one month, and now it has been three months.
O Allah, farewell.
All the amendments are in our favor.
The boy's ours.
Oh, please do make the garden.
At least he'll go somewhere , two or three flats at least .
They say the garden is a breath of fresh air for the residents of this complex. The bank is
Real men are discussing; they don't need women's opinions.
Let's go crazy
You placed the coffee, now that we're here, show yourself, scram!
A garden not.
Just a minute.
Sis, you know I love football.
Amj and our brothers don't know that you play football at school. If they found out, they would kill you.
Introduce yourself.
She said to her
I say let's drop the subject, it's better for you.
And I do not see myself
La la la la, I've got you on my mind.
I have so many worries and responsibilities in this life.
Your right, you're our blessing.
Oh, my uncle Shahin is here.
Mā shāʼ Allāh
This is Thursday.
Length and width
Thobe fear
I searched and searched for a wife for him, but I couldn't find one.
Lineage and descent
I'll tell you something
Thursday's wedding.
This is from the Resources Department.
Yes, Your Highness.
Keep it on the side.
She has a few notes on the proposal.
Omg, it's so cute!
Do you have anything else?
May you live a long life.
Take care of them and if I have the time, I will meet them, God willing.
What did you do with the employees we sent you?
The best events
I'm leaving now, I'll talk to you later.
What's happening?
You're crazy!
We are older sisters than you
We've been suffering misery for a long time.
Do you know, Fatoom, what sports she plays at school?
Tell them table tennis.
They should have slaughtered her, damn it.
The delicious appetizers are coming this way.
You don't know who we are.
What's our origin?
Do you know what scorpions are?
This time we smashed his face.
Grand Scorpion
Scorpion
Let's slap her across the face
Enough for her.
You keep your worth for later.
My jealousy won't stop me from designing architecture like you.
My initiative is yours.
Scorpions don't have daughters who work in the streets among men.
Engineering, Construction and Power
Where have we ended up, exhausted, among the scorpions.
Let me break down.
No no, Sultan, no!
Present, O Scorpion of the incense!
Talk to me, mixer Fatum.
Let your brother Falcon seize his chance
And God knows they're doing wrong.
Don't worry, my love. Don't worry, it's at least enough that you're my everything.
Hello, how are you?
Why do they want you tomorrow morning?
After the rain.
Shadur, ya saqr, iنزِل
Let's go, let's go!
Where does he go?
Not a single word.
Where are we going, Zain?
We told Joe to bring it and not a word.
They wrote "Education" instead.
And even nursing, if that's what you'd like. We have no objections.
Ashtebin bad
You have two options.
So you know we're democrats.
You said we're pressuring you.
O Nursing or Education
O Allah, send her down, quick!
Bring us a copy of the order.
Go away, scram!
Oh, Dad, that's a huge scorpion!
The Scorpion's Sting has proposed a marriage alliance for you.
It's all good, uncle. When's the engagement party, inshallah?
Professor Aminah
What you're asking for seems very difficult.
I can't travel, Abu Khalid.
I have special circumstances.
The Minister has confirmed it.
It's very difficult.
Think carefully, Amalnah.
Don't make a decision now. Think about it tomorrow.
How does your mother work?
That's why we're keeping quiet.
I have a suggestion.
Let one of them travel with you.
We don't have girls who travel.
Turkish for "End this mess."
No shame nor decency
Some of us are still keeping you busy at work, Zain.
Tomorrow you go and apologize.
Sure, the text you provided translates to: Go left, then right.
I hear you in silence
Thursday, son of the scorpions.
Among us.
Yes, he's an idiot and uncertified.
Just a scorpion.
My sister is cooking right now.
What should I do, Fatima?
I am broken and weak.
That's as far as I can go.
There's nothing we can do.
What's up?
Next Thursday will be the engagement ceremony, God willing.
We'll call you and tell you the time according to the sheikh's procession.
O sweet laughter!
The spirit of the season, clothe thee in garbs most fine.
My father's soul, may your clothes be blessed with the spirit of the season.
Killing me, this laughter of mine.
My brother, I beg you.
I don't want to hear a single word!
Make us a cup of tea, coffee and cake.
Right now, Aisha, how long have you known the Minister?
I'm afraid it might be a rumor, Abu Khalid.
Amnera is a candidate for a ministerial position in the new cabinet.
Amnira deserves it.
Inshallah it's not a rumour.
Are you working tomorrow?
We all collaborate to serve the nation.
Through everyone's contribution in their respective positions. Thank you.
Good luck to us all.
Thank you, the Minister's efforts.
Thank you very much.
Thank you
May it live long, may it prosper.
Peace be upon you.
I'll wash it with soap, as you advised.
This is the general supervisor of the women's football team.
How is your sister Fatima doing in the game?
In the name of God, what God wills, God is Greatest.
Captain Fatima has caught the big fish according to the ways of the elders.
Captain Fatima is gifted, goodbye my son Yahya.
Captain Ashraik, in my sister's soccer game, what position does she play?
Just the head of the war.
Going to China
Captain Jana, go away for a bit. China.
May God assist you.
Your sister is playing an important match.
She was studying Education but I went today and transferred her papers.
Let them study at the school with the architects.
Any captain, because there's no difference between the real deal and the fake.
Indeed, he pours the coffee, but only pours.
Come, where are you going?
I got tired of waiting.
You are an ass. A real ass.
Go, hurry up, greet your mother and tell her to evict me.
Oh God, oh God, may your father and your father's father be bereft.
Indeed, it's a state of being.
The cups you have are cold.
All year long they had no idea, but the very moment they hear you have some work to do, they know.
Hi, how are you? How are the kids?
I missed her.
She was told: "Inshallah this time you will be with us in the series."
Of course, she's playing the lead role.
Joe, Ali, look for Nouf's role, no one can play it but Shoula.
My love, there's something called makeup that can make her look younger.
Mary is twenty-six, my mother is twenty-seven episodes.
My father benefits from Khol Sho'la.
He gives us lectures that have no beginning and no end.
I'm afraid a bone might get stuck in our throat.
The most important thing is that he doesn't know the company producing the series is yours and Hamdan's.
Inshallah I didn't delay, my brothers.
And Kahou, Rashid and Ray after
The director is ready with the technicians.
Okay, folks, let's get started since time is ticking.
Whoever wants to speak, let them say their piece.
Jank Hamed wants to say something.
Honestly, I don't think there's anything better than this series.
Come see the day this maid hanged herself.
And I'll tell you which scene impacted me the most.
Servant Day commits suicide
The day her soul was hung on the bank's hook, the bank hook drooped, drooped, drooped, and blood dripped, dripped, dripped from her neck.
They found him and she started yelling at her son, I swear it's action-packed!
And I shot at him, and I shot at him, and I kept shooting until he reached the front yard of his house.
The action's peak.
The police will search the EMSCOM building.
Honestly, this series is incredibly awesome.
All you do is re-enact the series, you get up on the table and put on a show.
This is a rape of artistic integrity.
And the rape of societal values
A show based on bizarre events
Unbelievable
Seventy-Two Murders
What's up with all this crying?
You're famously unaccommodating when it comes to others intruding.
Go easy, go easy, brother Hamad. Let's be democratic.
We settle the matter by a majority vote.
O Brother Nasser, don't hide behind the majority and democracy. In critical evaluation of any artistic work, there is no democracy and majority rule.
You're involved due to your government job in this matter.
Goodbye.
Did I tell you I heard the bell?
And when he rose, there was an Indian with a bag in his hand.
Yes, if someone asks me, I tell them: yes, I am Mama Hessa.
I opened the bag.
The ring turned out to be worth around eighty thousand, I think.
I'm afraid this Indian might bring these things over by mistake.
No Dad, it's not a mistake.
This is Samira.
Hamad's wife, our company's manager.
And this, from God, is a gift from her to you.
I love you so much.
The ring is very fancy.
I have never dreamed of owning such a ring.
May God bless you, my dear Hassa.
This is my dad in this series. I call this series the Series of Goodness.
Ali and Hamad are among the employers, but since they are also employees here, they cannot present the series under their own names. So it's presented under the name of:
And what else but this ring?
I'll tell you, but it must be just between you and me.
I'm telling you, she's crazy!
Your husband is a cunning wife.
The one they call the Magician.
Give me five percent off, will ya?
No, my darling, they're not sweet if they agreed to four million.
Your husband is getting 200,000 lovely Ariary.
I say we give the university girl's role to Nada.
I love cycling and wish to run away with someone special.
Our next series is called "The Rape of Conscience"
They contacted me about a role in a TV series.
I just want to know one thing
Our Gulf series are always like this. This year's trend seems to be rape.
What will my role be, my love?
And you too, my love, are one hundred percent certain.
Zeen got back from embarrassment.
Now ya ya ya
My love has just made all this lovely breakfast and you're telling me you're leaving?
This is Omar, the manager's secretary.
God willing.
He never asked for me at this time.
And he said the series they're going to make is weak and trivial.
It's a sin to waste money on him.
زين and then what's up?
May God protect me! What am I supposed to tell them? I'm scared that Rashid the idiot has said something bad about the series to them.
Don't be afraid.
Leave this matter to me.
A sick man
Social series
This is Tony, I saw him a few days ago on TV.
May you live a long life.
The series currently airing is named "Rape of a Virgin Rose"
It seems like the budget they're asking for is way too high.
It needs a big budget.
Then don't forget that the company producing it is local.
May God keep you safe. I yearn for her touch.
Rest assured.
I read the artistic page.
We hear these days about the start of filming The Rape of Conscience
A whopping budget has been allocated for it.
While the series is said to not live up to the required level.
And another says the series is a school for teaching deviation.
There's a high chance they'll stop the filming
Peace be upon you
Peace be upon you. Hello, Abdul Hamid.
Hello, hello! Welcome, welcome! Make yourself at home.
Good morning
Good morning, welcome!
I'm journalist Eli Munir and I have an appointment with Professor Hamid.
I'm walking, but I'll rest a bit because I have a meeting.
Mercury allows us to exploit the design and create a cosmic space.
By the way, we will contact all the correspondents around the world so they can reach out to us.
That's your job done.
Mercury Production Company
And the discussion of its themes makes the series one of the best works ever in the history of the world.
Do you believe it? It's who wrote this.
If you have no shame, do as you please.
The eye is ashamed.
Is it conceivable that we have journalists like this?
A journalist is supposed to have principles.
Coming to you here.
What are they coming to register positions?
Yesterday I met Sha'oula, the minister's messenger. Do you know what she told me?
Our series makes you cry, its events are strange.
Tomorrow is the first episode and I'll watch it with some people.
What do you think, Mom?
Oh, my patience is running out, Mom! This is only the first episode!
A child; no one talks to themselves except in Gulf series.
And then she dried up saying: 'I'll slaughter my children unless you help me.'
Oh my sons, art is a matter of taste, not the odd cases you bring up and generalize to the whole society and people.
Mom, this might fly in the realm of visual art, but it's a whole different ballgame in drama.
Ooh, don't hurt my head!
It appears to be İğldun, the Turkish one.
No more, Dad. Don't control me from now on. At least watch the first five episodes.
The series has been cancelled.
It would be haram to let our children watch such things.
My brother, it's not that bad.
Some series are even worse and are being shown
This work is originally by Brother Salem.
Indeed, it was your mistake.
And built each house.
Go pick the people who understand the dimensions and the intricacies of the lines.
And offer it to them.
It's not us.
They didn't stop.
The Minister passed by with his guests.
I went to greet him.
It's us who approved the series.
His Excellency the Minister
Let's hear Nasser's opinion.
My colleague is the one who took the blame.
I only reply to messages that praise the series.
Never worry, ever.
Tomorrow I will see what's written, and I will send messages from myself thanking and praising the series, and I will say that these readers have sent them.
inshallah
You must be happy
This year
This we agree with him.
The best series in the history of Gulf drama
They all agree with the Minister's escorts.
I'll walk with you, we're agreed with the journalists.
Headings Headings only
I wish for a re-rape of the conscience.
Thank you to the Minister of Media for this series.
Oh, how I wish they'd bring it back again.
I was the first one they called from the Minister's Office.
The remaining batch of your serially numbered funds has been released.
They're only human after all.
And you still haven't seen anything yet.
To tell you the truth, we've invested our money and made a profit, and the profit was excellent.
And the series is a failure.
The author himself tells me he's remorseful.
I'm here now suggesting a second part of the series.
The Minister , as between you and me ,
There was a story about the press and the illusory success we created.
And he said, "You know, I'm not comfortable with the series from within."
It's impossible for him to agree with us on a second part.
If the Minister himself requests a second part,
I cannot
But I reiterate my thanks.
For all employees
In this series
And I congratulate them on their victory.
They deserve it.
The truth is, it's an honor for our work to win such awards at these prestigious festivals.
It's the biggest proof.
I don't know, you're telling me this out of the blue.
Not an easy guy to deal with
The Golden Award is 100% guaranteed.
Ashkan wants to tell you something.
Some readers and the press are hypocrites.
He tells them there's a second part. Why doesn't he say there's a *second part*?
As long as you have these Arab TV festivals and the Gulf is doing artistic laundry.
Laundry Art
I hear about money laundering.
It's not art.
Illicit funds
The same thing series
What shall we do with the drunken sailor?
What shall we do?
It's not us who signed a contract with them, they need to commit.
Write to them.
Our products are exported abroad: roti, small and large bread, triangles, and assorted.
We are the mute ones signing the contract with them.
Two million dollars
What did you do with the Australian baker?
This is the inventor of the roti.
They told you what product he's making.
They told me it's rotti, but I don't know what's inside the rotti.
Bisoyy allah yslemk rotty abjarar
You call it a **zipper**.
Instead of you taking this roti, which you call "samon",
This is the work of inventor Eishelha
<h1>Roti Jeans</h1>
This secret
You eat roti with soshta.
My brothers are doing strange things indeed.
This dough is processed using a unique technique, giving it an incredibly silky texture from the very first bite.
Various flavors of Sitah Strawberry, Cut Strawberry Sitah, and Coffee Sitah.
Do you know how much I'm invested in this project?
Three million dollars with invention rights
Come, Sameh
Yes, Abu Nasser.
At Your Highness's command.
We went there yesterday, Your Honour.
What you're saying, Samih.
‏Your son Nasser took them yesterday to play a game of football with the team he's part of.
I agree with him.
The team that's responsible for the mess we're in because of the security and drivers should be dissolved.
And then we're considered lacking because our mom only has one guard. If he gets hurt, we're in trouble.
The desired outcome should be a fan base.
And when you took the employees your mother mentioned, the seven-teen.
I told you something
About the important people in the company
The ones who form the heart of the company.
The baker's dough for the hospitals.
Therefore, I am very angry at the boy.
It's shameful, it's not right. You're a son of a prestigious family, it's not appropriate to run after a balloon and have people laugh at us.
Does whatever he wants with them.
But it only takes the important people who form the heart of the company.
My team has a game today and I'm missing four players.
We don't want any excuses.
What's done is done.
Hamdi didn't come to work today, sir.
I rode along with him.
He told me to wear
And they made me stop at the Qol.
The match looked
Next thing I felt nothing.
They tell me one came rolling my way, but I don't remember.
Does that mean you used to play as a goalkeeper?
Just for Nasser's sake.
There is no might and power except by Allah.
Inshallah we won't be afflicted by these football and other such troubles.
From today onwards, O Nasser!
There's nothing called a "Korah".
Cancel your team for today.
All the Khababiz went back to the bakeries.
What about your opinion?
Dad, the topic.
I don't want to hear anything from you
I'm asking you, Father Nasser.
Let's hear what the boy has to say. Please, I'm begging you.
Just for you, Abu Ahmad.
I see, what's up with you?
Tomorrow we have our last game in the tournament we're playing.
Don't break his heart, Abu Nasser. I'm begging you. Please.
Hi guys!
Congratulations!
Good good good congratulations!
O professor Nasser, quero que você venha agora.
May God bless you, my team was on point today.
Professor Nasser Lazem
You promised us you'd throw a party.
Do you want me to call and book you a hall in the hotel?
And once, I'll let the journalists and newspapers come too.
No, Rashid. I'll do it at the majlis.
Because my father saw joy, play and victory, he may make the team continue.
Bring the cup! Bring the cup! Bring the cup! Bring the cup! Bring the cup!
God hears you.
I saw some photos with the players and he even did a press interview with them.
The sports page editor, Wako, is going to interview him.
What a picture!
Don't go far away from me
O Allah, let the icon appear decent.
You tell me I don't look happy.
Mom, what do you think about the boys' incredible achievement? The players did a great job!
With the fighting spirit
And effort
Loyalty to bakeries.
Oh, Nasser. We witnessed the Bakeries team play throughout the entire tournament. Their record was 4–4–2.
Loyalty to Bakeries and its Coach's line.
Thank you, Uncle Abu Nasser.
May God protect you.
This guard
The singer of the league's anthem and the cup winner will perform with you in a concert.
The tail isn't the Council's.
They sent their delegate to arrange an interview with you.
Bring the cup! Bring the cup! Bring the cup! Bring the cup!
We know Hanna, we're cheering for the youngsters.
Inshallah, I witness that you will see it in the future.
Yes, goodbye.
Her phone is non-stop, Mashallah! You're pictured in the papers, blessed with footballing prowess!
You know who was talking to me.
Tamer told me he got a deal on the engines.
Now you're famous; the newspapers don't just print your picture, they write beneath it: 'Patron of International Bakeries – the First in Sports'.
I'm far from the ball.
What is this talk?
I've been like this since junior high.
The person next to me was playing football.
Stay away from the ball.
As long as the one beside me plays football, I'm getting closer to the ball.
I'm close to sports, so I'm an athlete.
That's it, we're not international bakeries anymore, we're international playgrounds.
Yesterday I heard him say he wants to open a sports club.
Of course, today we meet at International Bakeries. We'll see you there, Bin Nasser.
To develop football
Of course, we talked about it before the match. We want to know your predictions before you step up on the stage.
The match is tough today.
The team that controls the text box will have the upper hand today.
Inshallah, we are currently contacting professional player agents to develop the International Bakeries team.
His name is Saud. Listen here, when it comes to seriousness, by God, seriousness is upon him.
Listen Dad, the deal that went through for the players' shipment that arrived.
We didn't gain anything.
When I gave you the prices
<b>Prices we sell to the world:</b>
That's what I mean, the Gulf is not like the rest of the world.
Of course not.
Hey, do your work!
You just have to let me know when the Gulf buyer comes.
Keep your backpack unzipped.
Two defenders, one midfielder and one holding midfielder.
Look, my dear, I'm telling you the four tail players.
Three of them are the head.
Two hundred thousand
$ Take them all at once, Jack.
How many do you get for six hundred? I'll give them to you in a cheque for $550,000.
Sweet, this is for the empty ones now. We're doing the Brazilian now.
This is the Player of the Season. This is his soul for a million and two hundred thousand dollars.
They put the price here, but wait, let me show you where it is. It's right above. Look, here it is. I'll show it to you via fax. May God bless you from a club in the UAE.
You are the owner of the jar, and the jar has deceived you.
Thank you.
O Mashallah, Jack Lee, Jack Lee, the man is a duck.
How are you?
Knee. Knee.
Knee. All knees.
We don't fool around here. No one has a cruciate ligament anymore.
O father of Nasser
What is this tensor muscle?
Barbecue the whole lamb, you did a fantastic job, oh Allah!
Honestly, you really succeeded, Bin Nasser. Great players, the Brazilian especially, it's all thanks to them.
May Allah bless you.
I say the storage storage these cardboard boxes oh god storage
Masha'Allah, you have another business!
La la la just players
Hollow Insulon Crates
Buds Oh yes, buds I'll fetch them from the African jungle.
Yes indeed, why not?
Carm is a hero with only one cartoon.
There were ten of us.
He says he hasn't heard it.
They say these are buds.
Now that we're here.
Why don't you give us this *hal* *hal* bud a chance to advertise with them?
During my lunch break, I'll say to my dad, "Abu Nasser, this is the deal. If you take care of it, raise it and treat it well, it'll be of great service to you."
Then the national team will go, then he'll cheer for them in the stadium.
How many many many many
‏ Slowly, slowly on it, slowly, slowly; it's still very tender.
Put it in the annex, Airbone. Goodbye.
Anything you need, I have all the players.
If the coach were mine
We're leading the game 2-0!
Dad, this is a coach in Spain.
I don't like it.
The successful coach.
The traffic warden during the match.
The north, for example. This line is opposite to the Al Wakrah line.
Honestly, we can't let this coach have his way.
Dad, the coach has only been with the team for less than two months.
We need to figure out a solution with him.
If Korah understood the action of the parties, he would not have sat throughout the match, attacking from the deep.
He's sitting on a trap, waiting for an intruder.
Oh mom, by Allah, don't hurt my head!
The supposed one should be extracted from Kakonumalalawe.
Oih'tuahtsima'ahtewa ha'awa oshkwa'ahniwa'owa a'ohshkwa'tahtamowa.
No no no no no. He absolutely cannot play.
Shululu Habubu Taba Lawa Khala Iuli
Any line.
According to the plan.
<h1>Hololu's Delight</h1>
Something that is not required need not be between the manager and the team coach.
And today's man of the match, the team's star, scores a super hat-trick! Well done, Jakolamandanda!
How come we don't understand football?
Hear me, O Sultan!
Let him go home.
Don't send him by car to the bakery, let him take a taxi.
That's it, I'm done with you.
Oh God, stay with me online.
That's so nice what my dad did.
The coach makes us sit like this.
What should I do after?
The team has been dissolved.
Farewell our team!
O my mother, O my mother!
He's not sober, he just said: "You're divorced, come here". Tell me the truth, did they really divorce?
I told my mom from the first day I saw him that I didn't like this guy.
I feel it's not my responsibility.
Let's leave all the unnecessary chatter and focus on the present.
Her father's spirit of truth will inform you of the story behind your daughter's divorce.
And Allah, I will tell you, my brother Rashid.
But why did he divorce her?
No, it's not okay, Abdullah. We have the right to know why the girl divorced.
Please don't interfere, it's none of your business.
How could I not intervene when the man is here in the council asking about his daughter's divorce?
Who doesn't know how to appreciate a spouse or respect their feelings.
And who is she, this Barcelona?
It's understandable that one doesn't know what they don't understand.
Barcelona isn't just one.
This is Guardiola's team.
So, I should go to the man waiting for me in the majlis now.
If you won't go, I will. That's it. Stay here, get out of it. You people don't know how to raise your daughters.
Don't be so cocky!
She left FC Barcelona.
Messi, the soccer wizard, never fails to amaze, consistently scoring hat-tricks in every match.
Maradona, who is Maradona, said Mitsu is better than me.
And her shameless daughter dares to insult me! Just you wait!
Our daughter is neither a Barcelona fan nor is she a Thobna girl.
Why specifically your talk?
Hear me, oh Allah, guide her.
Your intention is to be my old one
He'll go and apologize to her and make amends.
Get lost!
And then, thank God, we have a lot of goodness.
Our homes will be filled with happiness if we can make our children happy.
Oh please.
I'll only marry you if your future wife is a Barcelona fan
Oh my, I'm not bothered.
Mom, he doesn't understand. Forget her, she's gone to hell.
Hack away, Mom!
Do you know, Mom, they're the ones who are losing.
You are the one and only I wish for.
Hack, Mom!
It's haram, I broke my heart.
Poor thing, it's been two days since she had a bath.
Sadly, the marriage only lasted a mere month.
What's wrong with you? Why do you want to get me involved with him?
Mom, I don't want to be stuck with him.
And who told you such nonsense that doesn't make sense?
Don't worry about her.
This might be a boy.
<h1>This
May she have plenty.
You're talking about the building I wanted to buy and turn into a serviced apartment hotel.
Is it the one in Mansoura?
His father's right, that means tomorrow when his son takes our daughter, I'll ask for the building.
And if you are unable.
Talk to her brother.
Hear me out.
His dad's a millionaire.
Do you know what a millionaire is?
Opportunity knocks twice.
You know that out of their excessive wealth, they have a palace in Spain just for their annual summer vacation.
Here's the fuel and the whole Barcelona story. How on earth does that mean?
The Jealous could have started this rumour about him to prove their daughter's innocence.
If we assume that the story is true and the guy really loves Barcelona and is loyal to Catalonia,
Supposedly, his wife respects that.
And the team didn't make a mistake.
This, assuming the story is true.
May God protect his father, whose name is Abu Burjien, because he has two towers on the corniche.
I made them in a strange way, like a rope twisted together.
Those who see them from afar think they are one tower.
O you who bring good fortune, come in the name of Ha.
Ah Hai Allah, who comes to us.
God bless you, too. Give me your hand; let me feed you. God bless you.
Thank you darling
Just let me know, my son Abdullah is waiting for your reply.
Oh no, Um Abdullah, please don't worry, the apple of my eye.
I look around the GCC and find none better than you.
O Allah, make them present us with their estimates for building the structure.
I have finished, Tamer my master.
They contact you, the family
Check their wedding orders, prepare the cheque and I'll sign it.
In the Name of God, as He wills. In the Name of God, as He wills. With your permission, Your Excellency. With your kind permission.
After Abdullah's divorce reply
May Allah give us children and wealth.
May God bless you, my aunt.
You clothe him against the cold.
I only know that Mom booked our tickets, but I don't know where.
Mom, I'm asking where you booked for us.
My mom says she booked us a trip to Malaysia
What's wrong with Malaysia? Let's go!
Goodbye.
What's wrong with him that he's crying from his honeymoon?
What's wrong, Mom? Tell me.
Tell me what's happening, Mom.
Wide Jaifah herself ummah
Why does she think she's all that?
Arrogant, let her take care of it.
Oh mom, it's beautiful that you sent her to her parent's house.
It broke my heart.
Hi Mom
What's wrong with it like this?
There are signs.
God bless you, please don't forget to bring us some olive oil from Spain.
Where should we go in Spain?
<h1> Engine </h1>
My mom says she booked us for the Maldives.
Oh yes, Maldives is beautiful.
And have fun, hopefully in the park!
Now I said you're coming back cheerful from the travel.
What really gets my goat, Mom, is why he takes the kids.
Come and carry the suitcase.
It happened among them.
What's wrong with you, my dear sight?
Shut up, you and whoever likes you. You're trying to teach me about my own son?
What's wrong with you, Mom? What's bothering you?
I get depressed when I see the surface.
May the one who annoys you never live, Mom.
Let her take care of it, just divorce her. Divorce her! Don't worry about her, your dad has plenty of money and there are plenty of girls.
Hush, you and your friend, old boy. I know him well. He's got no reason to be so upset.
Go, mom, call her and divorce her.
<html> <body> <p
Weh weh say it three times
You are divorced. Moment by moment, don't rush it. Twice more.
Divorced. Divorced.
Indeed, my nerves are frayed.
Just go, my dear mother, go and rest. Don't worry, please. Girls are like that, as the saying goes: they're always willing to help. Go, Mother.
Ooo meshkalâ.
Just because I saw you at the dance hall
Knock on it, knock on it, let me talk to him.
My mother said he's obsessed with me. Finally, he divorced me. He said: "You are divorced, divorced!"
Why would he dare to let you go, the one who has no shame, he's so rude.
Now, when she's alone at the disco, she's my *shabeastooy* :)
And when necessary, I'll shake my G like there's nothing in it.
It's all good, what's the big deal? The world's not ending.
I'm going to his house right now to wash his legs, and then he won't know you're a girl.
It's me, Abu Abdullah. My daughter got divorced.
My daughter has divorced.
A feather grows on its head.
Do you sell and buy them from Toys"R"Us stores.
As Yufej burns right now on Banteg, my nerves are on fire!
And they didn't do anything, poor things.
Mom bought you the peeled apple, let her go.
Normal, you have the best ones, do whatever you want with them.
On behalf of Real
That's none of your business, who cares!
Drink from the cup you made others drink from.
And the thing that your soul doesn't desire.
Do not make it easy for people.
Do you know whose garden this is?
In a strategic location
Indeed, we rely on God.
Not a meager price to pay
My current status is standing.
I need to get the approval of Sheikh Saqr.
Yes, I went to his office but didn't find him.
I went to him the week before yesterday, they said he was traveling.
It's got to be tomorrow at the latest, or the day after that. My situation is stuck, I need the approval of Sheikh Saqr.
The soul of the mills
No no no no this is official business.
His place is at the office, not at home. God bless you.
After eating
Bo Saqr is back, you sheep.
Listen, everyone has a key.
Oh, say, Abu Fahaad
You are what you know
He introduced me to him. I only see him on TV, and you didn't tell me you met him during Umrah.
But we're not that close.
God cut off your talk.
May Allah guide you, and you hardly waited for me to finish knocking, at least ask why this invitation.
May God guide you in this occasion.
The month has thirty days and he makes dinner fifty times.
I suggest Your Highness gets put in the Guinness Book of World Records.
The most one in the world to cook dinner
Who is this brother of yours?
Welcome, what a blessed hour it is!
It is our honor, Your Highness.
Dad, he's a kid!
She says that Bu Saqr makes dinner every day.
This is what we see.
Just so you know, tonight's dinner is a special occasion, Abu Falah.
Today, God willing, your son Falcon.
Mā shāʼ Allāh, he is deserving. May your life be prolonged. Congratulations!
Good news, the son of a virtuous man has arrived. Welcome father!
Peace be upon you.
Shanhew
On this occasion, my son Saqr will pick up the car of his choice tomorrow at the agency.
I've been waiting for approval for a year and a half.
My current halt.
But when I got to him
And happiness.
Oh God, may He guide you, Abu Saad.
That's not how things work.
It's over.
The exhibitor admires and chooses the car that appeals to him.
We buy him three
I'll take you there.
I encourage myself.
You didn't tell me you met him last year during Umrah.
Today, his young son Shaheen
Evening is his game.
This is your chance
He passed by and blessed him.
May he live long!
Oh Falcon, son of Saqr
May God protect you, you are safe, my friends.
We praise Allah for the safety of our son, may Shahin live a long life.
May God protect you.
Only from my brother.
May you live a long life.
Didn't recognize me
And Allah, deception is worth it for You.
I was with you during Umrah, O long-living one, last year.
I even bought a red rosary.
I am God, may He save you.
I was at the hospital
Azure is one of our sons.
I'm honored to meet you.
Should I or shouldn't I? I'm still hesitant about entering the world of trade. Have you decided yet?
I wanted to be with him, my brother.
Why, Dad, trade is great.
You've never set up your own office.
Al-Saqr
His longevity makes me fearless and bold.
Shanhew
A gift from Skyr I have.
A whole floor
And if trade loves you and comes to you, you will say to her: "I don't want you."
There's nothing like you today. Everything's available to someone like you. You got your driver's license, praise be to God, and the world has opened up to you. A free car and the best office on the corniche.
Yesterday, Bu Abdulaziz told my father that if Saqr wants to join the business, he'll make him his partner, giving him 50% ownership.
Oh mom, how can I possibly manage both trading and university?
Mom, don't force me into anything I don't like.
And all these agencies, offices and VIPs are throwing themselves at you for free, Masha'Allah!
An opportunity, my friend, in this day and age, to start a business with no capital!
You only have your father's love as capital.
Be smart and invest it.
Believe me, my son, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
‏Oh God, Rose, quickly prepare lunch!
Masha'allah wow wow wow wow even the ajwar and pepper are available!
Left nothing, left nothing. Tomorrow, I'm afraid he'll take the spring roll agency.
Echoing the opening up of China'
This is what you were hoping for. You know what they say today.
My son wants to further expand his investments.
He wants to dip his hands in the Caribbean Sea and invest in the islands over there.
May the envious keep their distance.
My father said your son has just entered the world of business.
He owns twenty franchises, six restaurants and has stakes in two banks.
I gave him the cold shoulder, he doesn't want any certificates or favors.
It seems, Allah knows best, that it hasn't been inaugurated yet.
That's the one in the northern area of our office
My heart desires him.
May Allah bless you. Congratulations, Abbas!
In the name of God.
May God bless you.
No pain, no gain.
What dad, what a whole year of hardship and exhaustion at the supermarket.
What's the story? The thing is, every day he comes to the clinic.
This secretary, whose name is Samir, sprinkles me with sugar.
He tells me this is Saqer, son of Bosaker, who wants to join as your partner instead of taking the shop from you.
After he entered with you as a partner.
There is no might nor power except by Allah.
But after I saw you chatting with him, oh well.
Who's your brother?
He said to him buzz off.
Why do you tell him you have an Iranian baker?
As we were walking past this place, there was a small signboard with the name: **Shunu Shunu**.
The neighbourhood bakery
No, I want a different name.
And peace be upon you.
How's work with you?
Tomorrow or the day after, God willing, we will finish the workers' housing plan for the Mustakbal Company.
LaLa, Monsieur Sar becomes Madame Elisa. I introduce you to Monsieur Sar, the owner of the company.
Hi, how are you?
Let her take one of the company cars.
Thank you very much, you're so kind.
That cooking too is a science.
Today someone comes to you and says they work in the business field, and they have several arials they want to invest.
But what lies between us has no knowledge, no education, nor study of economics, not even of trade.
One like this
I think he's wasting his time and will lose.
Did you hear, Abu Nasser?
I heard the two chit-chatting.
Sweet talk
This is my son, Falcon. Mashallah! He's something.
Masha'Allah, may he be blessed.
Stuff him today
His Highness, we are not talking about your son, Saqr.
We're talking about the base.
Your son is an exception, may God protect him.
He says speak about the base.
My son's falcon hooded and tamed, He trained it by himself.
He gave her a car as a present.
He sold it, invested the money, and he himself advised to do so.
Masha'allah, ka ka jahtoh.
Oh, dad, we're talking about regular people.
And one of them did exactly what Abu Nasser did to him. He took him by the chin and placed his hand on the way.
Mashallah, he's like a falcon with commercial talents.
Powerful economic tendencies
Who is his father?
It's haram, I swear I'm amazed.
What God wills.
*Gulf Money* in the Economic Referendum
Please come in.
Wa'alaykum salam. Hala hala Salem.
What's wrong?
I really don't know what to tell you, Salem.
Yes, I will inform you.
I got the whole story straight.
They say the company faxed dad.
And they said: "It's over."
My residence is bearable.
As you can see
He tells you the moment he heard the news.
He fell into the office and the fax was in his hand.
And he has mercy on him.
He taught me archery, the saying goes, and when I grew strong, he shot me.
What did the doctor say now?
Pray for him, Salem.
I am shocked.
Responsible in this life
A man gives to the poor with his right hand, without his left hand knowing.
This association, of course, delivers donations to Muslims throughout Asia and Africa.
But of course, I want you to also explain to us your goals and future steps, God willing.
In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful, our goal in the Saker Charitable Society is to achieve solidarity among the nation.
In addition to sixty blankets for our unfortunate brothers in the Pakistan earthquakes.
This also finally means that we now support seven poor families.
A salary of one hundred and thirty-two Ariary only.
It's not that we're too late.
Right after that, we'll come to see you.
My life
This is Khalid and his wife inviting us over tonight at the hotel.
O yes, any place, any place where you and I are, that's where I'd be happy.
My life, may God keep you for me, Oh Lord.
Oh my dear!
This is my livelihood.
This bakery
And the money will benefit you.
5 arial bagels, 3 arial loaves of bread.
Two knees.
Bag five beegah zayn zayn
Sure, it's six in the morning.
O Allah, ya Gawais!
The captain has arrived; let's have breakfast.
He wants men.
Please, Your Highness.
It's Shenu.
The request I'm about to make needs to be confirmed by you with a simple "done". I have to hear this word, "done", ringing in my ears.
Hello Nora
Alnoud's upset with you.
Why would I ever intend to upset you?
Inshallah we will do our best.
Why are you upset?
Our Nora comes in two simple and sleek designs.
Don't say that, Enoud will get angry.
Why Lebanese people have a sweet tongue
You still haven't gotten over yourself and stop prattling on with him.
I also want Aliya.
The sweetest outfits for the sweetest Nawara.
They call her Nawara.
There's still some hot jam left.
I paid twenty thousand and twenty thousand Ariary.
Mabrouk Ameouine, inshallah.
God is with you.
Hello, may you have a long life, Um Saleh.
Hi Fadi, I can see you look busy. Don't want to keep you.
With my eyes, I'm here.
Hello Hello
The message arrived yesterday.
Come on, you loser!
And you liked the joke.
Okay, did you bring the design with you?
I didn't have time to make them, show me your designs and I'll pick from those.
Honestly, your taste is sweeter.
It makes us work envy.
The project went smoothly and is about to start operating.
He tells you that he's doing a project just like yours.
Design and Tailoring Studio
Women's Clothing
This is Boo Nasser, who has nothing to do with trading.
Your sons are here.
His cousin's son
These days
It's all good, my cousin.
Do you believe I was sleeping? They woke me up and said your cousin's son wants to see you.
The best of luck, hopefully, consider it done!
Inshallah, all will be good.
O how I wish
I have no plans to undertake any projects , like , you know , any at all .
Just so you know, are you looking for a partner or something?
I heard that you're planning to come by, so I thought I'd drop by too.
Welcome!
If you want more available.
Thanks be to God, the job is excellent.
What should I do, father of Saleh?
It was only delayed last week.
Yes, by Allah.
Insha'Allah, goodbye.
It remains he.
Are you sure?
And with it the detail, and you don't even know the big headache.
What's next?
It's rent next to your shop.
O envious one! O full of hatred!
Before I knew the market was open to everyone.
I need to meet you.
Your heart must be open to your cousin.
It's me, I'm asking you.
Pretend, deceive and laugh at me. What am I to you?
I want to do my work as a team.
You're taking up a sticky spot in my place, ruining it for me.
Wallahi, it's true, but they didn't say come here. It's stuck in my throat, like a wisdom tooth that's bothering me.
This is envy, this is malice, by God, by God, I swear you've worn me down with it. This malice has exhausted me.
Hello, my dear friends!
Go ahead, Abu Saleh.
He's got me on it, I swear I'll box you, you guy with the big belly.
I stretched my hand, just as you stretched yours, and kept me, just as you kept your meal.
Ava ya jamâ'a
O people, send prayers upon the Prophet.
I swear I didn't do anything
I was advised to hire a designer from the Philippines.
No one's gonna bullshit you.
Why, oh why? Why, of all people, a Lebanese?
They chit-chat, joke and laugh together, having a great time.
I see Bo Saleh brought a Lebanese guy.
He kept telling and convincing me.
He bewitched me with his words.
He convinced me and made me pay twelve thousand riyals.
And after two days, I swear to God, I went to the used goods market and found its twin there for nine hundred riyals.
Get your money out.
Lebanese designer
Can I meet the professor? Yesterday you said it was difficult, and tomorrow will also be difficult.
Yes, by Allah, today was also very difficult.
I feel like Abu Saleh has been different these past couple of days.
It's Fī Eh.
No, I don't know what's going on with it.
Abu Saleh is very mentally exhausted after his cousin opened a store and hired a Lebanese designer just like him.
It's been two weeks since I've been in charge of the store's sales.
What's wrong with this place, Ghatar? Why does every shop that opens here get copied by another 'Ghatar' right next door? I'm thinking of opening a shop here, but I'm afraid the same thing might happen to me!
La la la with designer Fadi, thinking of a solution.
How come like this right now?
We're sitting like we've eaten a full course meal.
If we choose this shape, I think the rent of the venue wouldn't even fit our budget.
A place far away from them
That means leave them the stage.
Gasoline, you said? The discount is 15%.
I hope you don't give away evening gowns for free with every wedding dress!
O my people!
There's a store that just announced: with every wedding dress purchase today, you'll receive two evening gowns for free, and there's also a 25% discount!
Let's go, let's go.
Wait two weeks and they will release the same dress. Buy two wedding dresses and get two dresses for free with a 25% discount.
They are attacking us.
I think so too, because if we leave them alone, they will destroy our home.
Don't you worry!
What's up?
This is quite a challenge, and I'm up for it.
It's not a challenge, dude.
Well done! That scoundrel doesn't want anyone else to make a profit off of it.
Don't worry, you'll get the news within two or three days, even if I have to shut his place down at once.
Well done!
Stay Stay Sugar Sugar I'm coming to you now, I'm coming. Okay, bye.
The best thing that happened to me
Saad says the place is unbearable, the stench is awful, he doesn't know where it's coming from.
The smell has nothing to do with the air conditioner.
Her scent hasn't left the place for at least six days.
100%
Yay for the night
The electricity has been cut off from the shop.
This is correct.
Right now, will you sign a pledge or shall we make a case and open a file?
Do you want me to make you something?
I extinguish its existence.
Uncle Bonasr, something strange is happening. No one is entering the shop.
Uncle Bou Nasser is sugar sugar with a client who's coming to me, I'll call you back, it's weird.
Ekhweh 'alayhi fee sareereh ta'yeeh yoon.
His mental state is fine, I'm afraid. I was too scared to tell him that the bank called about the installments.
His cousin's nasty son owes him money.
This time around, Zain's really gone above and beyond.
Therefore, if they mistakenly enter the store and see Saad the designer, they scream at him and run away.
I am so hungry, my stomach is growling loudly and my eyes are staring at the ceiling.
My mother did this to me
Saad is at the store.
What's wrong with him, he's bewitched.
When women see him, they invent fears.
My mother made it.
Lose me, lose me.
You gave me a lot of trouble, brother.
I'm afraid they will imprison me.
I have no evidence against him, so I can't go and file a complaint.
I don't know what he did, I don't know what he did.
Let him deserve it.
Tell me what dark magic spell you used on him! You turned the designer into a monster; women are scared when they see him!
There's a rumor spreading about him.
It's urgent, tell him the filming crew needs him ASAP!
O people, may Allah save you, if you come across someone who desperately needs help, convey the message to them: They are urgently needed!
And God, they're raising my blood pressure. He's going to slaughter me. This isn't right, Mr. Abdullah.
Oh dear Ahmed Habib, please don't get so upset. You're a kind soul, and this kind of anger doesn't suit you, dad.
O God, I contacted him so much that my ears are hurting. But it's no use, this extra is driving me crazy!
You don't do anything. Everything's on my head.
Joe's heart is burning with hatred for you.
His sweetness is twenty-five scenes of sixteen. Oh, Hamad, we want to finish.
And then, should I stop the filming because of an extra?
The production rush.
But I'm not involved, Mr. Abdullah. Why are you giving it to me?
My love, may no one disturb you.
What happened to Abdullah?
Bit players who are in over their heads.
Oh, Ahmed, I don't want just anyone to be my love.
Joe Lee, make me feel elite, elite. He can convince people that he's a true millionaire, a billionaire even. Not just anyone can do that.
Professor, if you please, just send me the photos and your request will be fulfilled within half an hour.
Not just anyone, Ala'a. Not just anyone. I'm still explaining it to him, I'm telling him.
Right, I'll manage by acting in two scenes instead of one.
You, Fantwa, bear the responsibility, and you, the Production Manager, are also responsible.
When they will meet
They're doing everything in their power to appease the director who's getting increasingly irritated. It's all for show, really.
That wants a one with special features I get him a secure one.
Are you for real?
I didn't hear what the director said.
I have a joker in my hands. May God help you with him. Hopefully, he will be useful.
SS Saud Akyar
Sa'ud Qawatay is how I know him. Sa'ud Akhnar.
This is what they called him when he was little: As'aud Akhnar. When he grew up, they called him Qawatay.
Tins of lychees
I'll tell you why he's unfortunate. He goes around collecting cans from the streets and sells them by the kilo.
O brother, sing with majesty, not with disgrace!
Its shape must fit the hole. I've heard people describe it as such, and indeed, it has neither length nor width.
It's definitely fine.
Inshallah, I'll tell you. You guys nailed the makeup, it's 100% suitable. His blood is light-hearted too.
So what are you waiting for? Let's talk.
I don't have the number.
I'll just take Amir with me and go to him.
Where is Saudi's house?
He says "the" in Arabic.
Hush hush, you.
Sa'ud Qawatay
We have a guy in our neighbourhood named Saud Containers.
I'm sure he's in the neighborhood, but I don't remember which house.
This is a house of a man called Saud, where he lives with his mother only.
Yes, that's right.
That's not Saudi cans.
This is Saud's laptop
Definitely, it evolves with time. It's not just a fancy can.
He is tall and sturdy with a slight olive complexion.
He started to suppress the lowly laptops of Adimah, shouting: "Oh God, oh God, oh God!"
Going to the vegetable market to buy them for me, where's the other one?
I swear, Dad, I have no idea.
This is the one she always wears.
I have another one, it's the second ghutra right next to me.
The right to justice.
This is what I've been looking for. Where has it been hiding?
Fix and Buffs
Dad, please iron it a bit before it gets all crumpled.
Just these two days I've been feeling extra
Oma Allah, I've been worrying about you since yesterday. I want to take you to the ER, let's go to the ER. You keep telling me no.
Oh mom, they said they'd give me
Praise be to God, here it comes, Dad. It's better than your idle sitting around.
Go ahead, Mom. Have a safe journey.
She's getting all worked up, acting like a fool and blowing her top.
‏ Sit a while, move a little, and the camera moves with you.
Yes, Ja'far, yes.
My laptop
Abdallah Al-Lamah is a great actor.
This is how we do it, I'm the son of Fatima and Abood, how are you doing?
How are you, my slave?
Just calm down. Over here, respect yourself a little, in front of everyone.
The boy from our neighbourhood
Arkad Arkad Arkad Arkad Ahe Ahe
I love acting, hopefully they'll give me a role to play you.
And Allah, my brother, it's not your cup of tea.
I'm so tired, swear to God. I didn't sleep at all last night.
Asthma God heals.
May Allah heal her.
Falling in Spring
O professor, o professor!
He has his mother's asthma medication.
Director not a doctor
He's talking rubbish, you've got nothing!
What's her mother's name?
Ptooey at you. What do you think?
I heard what they say about you.
Tell you it's light, make it heavier, a bit more heavier.
Give me half a million to fix my car's tire.
Give him three million and he'll bring me dinner.
Tony, why are you speaking like this?
Because I'm heavy, as some people requested.
Joe, oh professor, you're oblivious! Our neighborhood's production is represented by actors on a high level.
Currently, it's excellent, meaning it suits the role perfectly.
Sweet, I'll help you too. I'm just a viewer, I have no clue.
Hey Sharon, how's your place?
And Allah, he's fallen for a guy called Rabee.
The professor took him into the makeup room and did his makeup. Salman will get you the outfit.
‏ Walk walk walk It's really nice
EE
Listen, my brother, leave the car here until we're done shooting. I'll call you when we're finished so you can come and get it.
Don't worry, there's someone giving me a ride.
I'll get him to you, don't worry. Thanks a lot, brother. Appreciate it. One moment please.
Oh, come on, call your mate, this extra, hurry up, call him!
Please call Saud, his laptop is in the make-up room.
Let him come on, brother, to brush my teeth.
It's written right in front of me.
Let's say: O Allah.
I'm done, seriously.
I didn't expect it from you.
We won't stay quiet about what
We won't remain silent about our rights
Be patient.
And know who I need Abu Abdulaziz
Why did he divorce her, brother?
Just divorce her, that's it.
We don't marry a thief's daughter
No, we don't need it. What do you think?
When you're done getting ready, head into the dressing room to change, and we'll be ready for the shoot.
My teeth are precious to me.
O you with the camera, this scene has been shot too many times.
Why not?
We don't want any more tea, dude. I'm getting bored and my stomach is full. I'm done with tea. It's been an hour since we ordered. How much longer must we wait?
Dad, without you I haven't seen anything yet. This is just the tip of the iceberg.
May God grant you health and well-being.
Masha'allah, they are fast.
May God protect you, may you live a long life. Be safe. Goodbye.
Hello everyone
They say Ouoabdelaziz sends his regards to you.
Inshallah, may you live a long life. Inshallah.
Sweet ones.
They will Islamize you and they will love your nose.
The first time someone loves me for my looks.
> How do they love them on their noses
Problems
His nose got a scoop of ice cream Your lips are sweet, so sweet.
Indeed, you haven't laughed much lately.
It's all yours.
Best Actor
Is he okay? What's wrong with your voice?
Dad, Dad, I'm waiting for you. I'm tired.
Come quickly!
Welcome, sheikh! Welcome!
Uncle, search here or search by yourself over there.
Hear me, o
Yes indeed, let's go!
Empty respects are overflowing.
It's destiny, Dad.
And peace be upon you too, Your Highness.
Let it be Let it be Let it be Let it be
Don't worry, Dr. Hassan, it'll definitely work out. Come, come.
Yes, Dr. Hani, what's up?
Let him rest in the office, God willing.
I haven't got it.
Inshallah everyone will recover safely.
Please, Your Honour, please.
Shutup or I'll give you a punch right in your face.
My name is Bu Abdul Aziz
Call me, uncle.
How are you, uncle?
By God, on this Halloween!
Yes, Your Highness.
Please sit down, Professor.
May God bless you.
With the smile
Go with him, teacher Rashood.
And Allah, indeed, has done nothing for him. I will show you what he has done, of which you have been informed.
Can I get a doctor ASAP, mate?
Dr. Amy is sick.
Wait your turn, it's your turn, turn, turn.
Hear me, o
Can I get a companion?
Dad, I'm feeling tired quickly.
Oh, with how often you go to the hospital, you should take your mom every week. You haven't seen any of them, yet they're all good-looking and would settle for the least handsome among them.
Not like the country girls
Let the girls from the country come this way.
Done, kid. Find yourself a girl from the hospital.
My mood has been fickle.
But brother, you don't give me a chance!
That's enough, kid. Go up to her, make her laugh, pinch her cheek, give her your number—your intentions are honorable.
There's nothing.
Respect yourself.
And then he said: "If you don't mind, let's go back. I'd like to talk to the security guy."
No no, I don't want anything.
It is not necessary to leak.
I am a cat.
No, no thank you.
You can take it and go.
The one who talks to you is a real Mr. Frosty.
Will you marry him? Yes, you will marry him.
I want the bisht, I want the clothes, and I also want the car. I'll rent it from you.
O Lord, give them their reward.
La la la, hold on a second!
O Allah
What's up, it's the awesome Al-Marzooz!
Welcome, hello and greetings! We're so glad you're here.
My eyes beheld a dream last night.
Just wish you were here
I'll tell you, they were amazed by what I did for them. It was a very classy and unique party.
One regular and one diet.
It's Malja's turn to apologize now.
What's this?
Mom, I'm scheduling a meeting with my colleagues tomorrow at work.
Inshallah I'll send them this.
I'll heal him.
Noura, come here!
What's this?
My friends are the kings of exposing people's scandals.
The Attude makes everybody talk about us.
Give me the money and tomorrow I'll buy you something classy.
I'll meet them now.
I have to take him there tomorrow.
Right now they've opened up my nation's stall so we can go get something that'll make us look good in front of everyone.
O you
Its price is suitable and the quality is really good.
Above average means it's not the highest quality.
And there's chocolate for the fantastic chefs out there. But sorry, I thought you might also need the price.
After this dear soul, why would you bring me to the dearest?
Unbelievable, your artistic touch!
Heidi's Royal Chocolate
The same chocolate that the Spanish Royal Court always orders.
Give me this.
Congratulations! By the way, it also comes with a warranty certificate.
Please, please, rejoice!
Come on, brother, give us some of that chocolate, will you, brother?
I say, what's the occasion, oh sly one?
It's not Saleh Abdelkader who's in the accounts.
‏With blessings, he deserves it. Come and give me one too. Come.
Please serve us coffee ASAP.
My aunt went to their wedding.
Oh my love, I went to their wedding, it was disgusting. You won't believe it, my sister.
I heard your aunt's words.
That's why I want to throw you a wedding that doesn't even exist.
There's not much left, only a month and a half.
I arrange everything.
But he just leaves me alone.
You're not living in the community. You don't see the people who organize their weddings, putting all their money into it.
And I saw your soul
When I bought you something decent, I saw how they praised you and your taste.
They said it's awesome and beautiful.
That's right, but how much did we pay?
The money we paid for the coffee should have brought four sheep for the wedding.
And if you're giving her the money, that's all you need to do. Your mother knows how to do the rest.
That means they agree with whatever we choose.
And you truly have no taste.
What do you think of the Halakusha?
But discrimination costs more money.
Why? Why was the past so sweet?
What do you think of Hedi?
The first time in Qatar's history, someone thought of making a wedding stage designed like a computer mouse.
With your permission, a little bit.
Just talk about anything but the wedding couch and the preparations. That's the place where the women sit and do nothing but chatter. Keep quiet about that.
The Real is waiting for us.
We want this fancy couch
The Strange Couch
I guess it's a 2011 model.
Okay, we've taken the mouse.
Save yourself this hassle for your own benefit.
The important thing is, if it's Noah's Ark, they'll add twenty thousand, and if it's the mouse, one hundred and twenty-five thousand.
We're ready, fire away!
You're not the first one to get married.
Do you think you'll be getting married in the Comoros? That's a wild idea, my friend.
We're only at the beginning.
If you don't want a couch, then where will the bride sit? In a sieve?
Iron and paint, and grill the wood.
And people are happy.
They're taking advantage of us and lying to us. These guys are con artists.
And you, what do you mean right now?
I'm upset and angry.
I don't want to get married, that's final.
I speak to the mother of the bride and tell her: "Saleh has difficult circumstances."
He doesn't want to get married because he can't afford the wedding expenses. Seriously, I'll talk to her. I'm serious.
We received a selection of roses from the Netherlands today.
In my opinion, you should put them on the wedding tables.
Definitely for the first time in Doha
and the Middle East after
Put it on the bill.
It means "Come on, it's easy!"
Two seventy two, easy.
But, hey, Samir, I don't wanna see this lineup at a wedding.
I know after people talk.
Consider it done. They're booked.
You really do earn more than me.
The door opens for you that you don't know how to close.
May God help you, Saleh.
Just come on, God guide you, you should have tried to fix things a little.
I have decided, thank God, to go and see a girl from any Arab country.
They say the whole wedding won't cost more than $1000-$2000 and you should jump at the opportunity.
May God bless you, my dear.
Inshallah next month is his wedding.
You just determine how many cards and tell me.
The cards are just a formality, the main thing is that people know they're invited, where and at what time.
This is all that matters to you, not what people might say.
People know the level of the wedding from the invitations.
I got the cards today, I know what people are saying.
They leaned on their wedding as long as these are their cards, they haven't seen the cards of so-and-so and so-and-so.
We didn't say it like that. We'll order it online.
Its cover is made of panda fur fabric with a silver snap button.
It's understandable, but I don't care about you.
I won't become a tooth sweetener for women's cards. We ask for them, we really do.
And Allah, he's breaking my heart, my brother.
Poor guy, they're definitely putting pressure on him.
Oh, Real, everyone has borrowed from him!
He sold his car too.
His face looked twenty years older in the morning light. He walked and talked to himself.
I don't blame him, my brother. God knows when we will ever develop.
Close the door, please.
Forgiveness, my brother.
Do you mean you didn't try to convince them that you're having a modest wedding?
What do you mean by that?
Why am I living alone?
The problem is our community's obsession with appearances, ostentation and bragging.
It's mandatory for you to be sick with the same disease.
If you want to live in it.
Once I saw the mother-in-law's wedding ring.
I only wanted my clothes.
Leave it in God's hands.
Just tell me.
How did you get married?
And my father won't let me marry who I want.
And then, my brother, even if I decide to get married,
I'm considering getting a foreign one or even an Arabic one.
Yes, by God, your country is telling me so.
We had decided to bring a DJ for the music.
Ms. Um Nasser's daughter-in-law is that singer who performed at her son's wedding.
This singer is famous, but I forgot his name.
What's wrong with you, my dear?
It's not to your liking what I'm doing?
His friend sold his car and now every day one of their gang gives him a ride.
As I entered the room, I found him talking to himself.
I see your tone has changed now.
So my brother Saleh is really sick, mom.
I don't care about either of you.
I am no less than others
Don't leave me alone, guys.
And if anyone converts to Islam, it's only because my brother has spent all his money and borrowed from everyone.
And if you embrace Islam, you will keep quiet, won't you?
My mom has new wedding demands, and my brother said he's cancelling the wedding. He doesn't want to get married anymore.
Now I am where
Inside Isoon has first aids.
He says now luckily they will arrange a room for her in the hospital.
My colossal blunder
You do you, sister.
Dr. Galja says you're not to speak and will give you an injection so you'll sleep.
Where he rests, he lets us mock those who matter and those who don't.
I'll tell him to bring Abdullah Arwished. He says he doesn't have any money.
And thus upon your mother.
She feared for her.
Soul, soul for her Soul, kiss her on the head
Tell her I'll do what you want.
Beep to Abdullah Aroosh.
Boyusuf is kind. He doesn't think he'll let me down.
Haram 'aleyk ma laqit 'ead ghair Buiوسف
What's wrong with her?
You're an idiot, Saleh.
But the Minister is Mr. Real Shibe and above all, he's disciplined and trustworthy.
In my opinion, dad, if you went and said to him the things you told me, there's a big chance his heart would stop.
I understood.
Because of the awful crisis you're going through, you want to borrow money from Bu يوسف. Of course, it's Ministry money.
And Allah knows when you will return them to him.
Hi, if the auditing group doesn't come for him, ask him about the money.
It could definitely go wrong.
No one knows what will happen next, he knows how to deal with it.
And Allah, it's up to you, the real one is in his office, and you're the one responsible if anything happens.
The latter part of my life I embezzle.
My uncle, that's what they call embezzlement.
On the first stair
In a white can with a blue stripe, there's a round figure resembling a dove. It goes: "Yibbe, yibbe."
Inshallah 'Amī 'Amī Boyūsef ana ana law ma-ut-tawfīri sa3bah
I'm returning it all.
They called me Boy Joseph.
You came at the end of my life
Please destroy me, Khamis.
Saleh Saleh
Hassan, listen carefully. If anyone else but you were in this situation, they would be in big trouble or even injured. Oh, oh, oh Khaled.
Saleh Saleh
All the ways I've tried are useless. Uncle Boyوسف, I'm drowning.
I can't back out now from the wedding.
These are all bald men I know.
What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you?
La la Malet al-Ro'e Malet al-Ro'e thania
Up the stairs, up the stairs
My uncle Boyوسف's staircase is full of pills. Any one of them will do.
The Gothic one with the picture of a royal is terrifying.
We booked two rooms just for our makeup and hair.
We'll be there bright and early tomorrow morning.
Yabna Abdullah Awarish and his band
You will see my love.
I'm not telling you.
The bomb of the season
We are the first people in the world to use it.
O my mother, O my mother!
Bye, God be with you.
There is no deity except God.
Oh mother, don't forget tomorrow, when entering the hall, to recite the Mu'awwidhat.
The women here have a fiery eye.
I told you it's awesome.
The best groom ever Mashallah! My eyes are cooled by looking at you!
Oh my God, the police are knocking at the door!
I was wrong to obey you, Oh God.
Today is my wedding day!
Ooh, the auditing money.
O Allah, break the locks of the prison.
Boyusuf Boyusuf Boyusuf
Too late.
It's just not right, my brother, if this becomes reality.
The company has offered a contract for three million. Two million of this is just the cost of materials.
Memo to the Minister
We spoke of corruption, but the extent of it never reached such heights.
You're not living in this world, junky.
The Minister has indeed done a great deed for 'Uthman.
And our manager didn't even have to say anything. They said he had it.
I have no idea.
Where are the ethics?
Right has become wrong and wrong has become right.
Is Saad sure that the Minister has been fired, oh people? What's going on in the world?
Finches and only finches.
What's next?
The King's Sister
And this girl is involved with the Minister.
Oh, the wonders of this world!
What's wrong with you guys? Don't you know her? This is from.
This is the new employee that the Minister appointed in Osman's place, the poor thing.
‏ Walk walk walk
What do you want me to do, Saleh? Shall I protest the Minister?
You are mad.
Hear me, Dad.
We have children; we want to live.
We want to live.
What happened?
There's a poor soul standing by the left.
Loyalty and honesty will be the end of you, my brother Saleh.
I appreciate your brotherly sentiment, but we can't do anything for you, pal.
All praise be to Allah. All praise be to Allah in all situations.
What's up with you, Saleh?
Some of the strange things that have happened to me in this world are the deeds of my grandfather.
<b>The things he believes are mind-boggling</b>
My command
I want you to pick up some salad dressing on your way home from work.
I'm trying, goodbye.
Who brought my sister home?
And the rule is: after laughing and chatting, who's 'that one'?
This is my classmate. What's wrong if she comes to me?
Ooh wee, what's wrong with you? You're acting like you're made of money all of a sudden.
What do you say?
What we say, you don't hear.
Your thinking is outdated.
Right and wrong still have new and old.
Right is right and wrong is wrong.
The world has evolved. We're living in the age of technology.
The Age of Global Variables - a world that forms and no one can keep up with.
We have indeed experienced both good and bad times.
Don't blame me, O Menira, it's not my fault if I get irritated and angry!
That's what I see in my day.
Tell her I'm sorry.
It's not going well with the worldly life.
Don't tire yourself out, come and have lunch.
Let me go and rest
Daddy's not mad at you.
Daddy has no money.
There's nothing wrong, go wash your face and have some lunch.
O my love, come to me.
I'm very keen to meet my boss on my first day of work.
It is our honor, Your Highness.
Definitely definitely.
Of course, I know you don't need anyone to remind you of the fundamentals of the job.
But at the same time it's very important.
We retrieve some of the values and principles that were set.
For the public good
As supposed, Your longevity.
We all need to
The loot is a must, Your Highness.
You are thieves.
Thank you so much everyone
And what I want to say as well
Beware of my first day on the job.
There is only one employee among you.
Faithful, devoted and diligent
Just a suspicion
There is an honest employee.
In order to take the necessary legal actions at our Ministry.
I don't bear good tidings, Your Highness.
Thank God we're all thieves.
Good news, my colleagues are ahead and behind me telling them.
Where is Khalid?
Yes, Your Highness.
Khaled, they praised you a lot, lot to me. Mashallah!
Inshallah, may you live a long life.
Indeed, Your Highness, you have an excellent choice!
May Allah guide you.
Why do you let the devil trick you?
Say alhamdulillah she came back safely
Mom, why is Dad in jail?
Shh, Mom.
No more, I swear!
Mom, why is Dad in jail?
You're giving me a headache!
It became Amin.
It's a fault to say my father is not trustworthy.
This is clothes.
Your entire body is covered.
Satin of the world
inshallah I will look for a job that will employ you both.
In a respectful unit, her body and allure are covered up.
Loosen my shirt, it's suffocating me here.
I wanted her by my side.
And she also wanted a top that reveals the upper part of her belly, Dad.
But it's no use, you won't listen to advice, you don't want to take the straight path.
Here I am telling you
Don't blame anyone but yourself.
We'd like to marry our son Rashid to your daughter Sarah.
One of us, Shidor, is building a house these days, but only with straight riyals.
And Rashid is doing well.
Real madrid
The hero emerged from his chamber.
Drunk for twenty-four hours.
Drunk, high, and stoned all day long.
And don't ask about the rowdiness!
And what excellent upbringing, Abu Rashid!
And I have good news for you: there's an hypocrite among us.
How's the trumpet?
Authentic, my son, and how about drugs?
The written one is finished. I'll give you five riyals if you find his eye's color.
Hey dad of Sarah, we didn't come here to ask for her hand in marriage.
He boasts and shows off aimlessly.
A girl with class.
Mabrook ya walidi, mabrook. This is the way of life. Mabrook.
I'm drunk.
And I couldn't walk.
O God, oh dear God!
Bye bye.
Kid, hurry up, hurry up. Call your dad so he can come pick you up.
Call him, please.
Oh, so he could take you away.
‏ He exhausts me.
Is there the stomach of the guy who's walking with a beautiful blonde wearing a ghutra?
I can't believe my dad is walking straight ahead and giving her a stick.
Hello, my dear daughter, Mona.
Majed was not called Abdulaziz
Any justice
My daughter has disowned me.
And you know that since the establishment of the State of Palestine, with its capital in Jenin, in the year Two Thousand and Ninety, after the signing of a comprehensive peace treaty with the State of Israel.
And Israel continues to practice terrorism, pressure and siege on it.
The latest of which are the allegations raised by the Israelis and their Arab friends against the Palestinians.
They smuggle plastic knives through the tunnels.
Especially the second item, paragraph (a), which states that the Palestinian people must trim their nails every day.
We now move on to the crucial meeting.
My dear cheapskate
When Israel agreed to the establishment of the Israeli state
Oh man, what are you saying? You're tarnishing our reputation, dude. Cut it out, you too!
Please.
Pardon me, my lord the Tiger. Pardon me, my lord the President.
Let me say this.
I fully committed to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.
What is this Israeli delegate talking about?
We only deal with solid stone or plastic.
Even our huts, my friend.
What do you Gulf people call it?
In all of Palestine, it's made of wood.
American companies , per the agreement , are manufacturing wooden cars for us .
And the doors of our homes are all made of thermally treated wood, dude.
We do not want speeches.
Don't change the subject.
Mr. President
This point is important. Please vote on this matter, as nail farming is a violation of the convention.
The approving raise their hands.
I just had a strange dream.
To control the students.
I wanted to tell him.
This will be the fourth school I'll be attending tomorrow.
Because I am a strong-willed person from the start as a teacher.
The boys are tearing his clothes while chasing him, but he remains silent.
So many times he came to me without a ghutra.
They said their manager.
Rashid is a nice guy, we don't want to let him go.
The kids are chalking him.
He ironed his keffiyeh in front of everyone in the public square.
They said: "This teacher is a weak-charactered person, they'll ruin us all."
I tell them the cheese spread story.
Maryam 'Ad
And after the whole "cat's meow" thing, this is a brand new one. No one told me about this.
They put a bottle which is full on the chair.
And he sat down.
And he knew nothing about the story.
A dry day when the kids mock him in the schoolyard
That's enough, please.
Your manager, who I'll be working for tomorrow, gave me a call.
But we'll give him a chance anyway.
Because I want to tell you
The era of kindness and weakness has ended.
O your cousin Abdullah
You will see a different Rashid.
And I won't forget to mention the important educational quote:
You're an Education graduate, and I'm an Education graduate.
We all know the saying.
The teacher is the son of the first lesson.
You will see Mr. Rashed Al-Qawi.
And whoever makes a mistake.
Woe betide him!
At first, when he started talking, he told you to be quiet. What do you want to tell him?
Brewing fresh chamomile
Who among you dared to mock and say: "Be quiet, it's best"?
You're the one who told me to shut up, okay.
It's not me.
Kid, you're the one who's like that.
Come the Spirit of the Director's Right.
He said Professor Rashid expelled me.
I don't want to see your face here, I hear you.
Sure, I translated it as: <b>Shrayej fe nerfati</b>
Supposedly, it's not just the first day that's like this. It's the whole year.
Woe betide him!
The one who hears his voice.
I'm explaining, not talking.
Do you know what it means?
Nervous, do you know what nervous means?
It means "nervous" or "my nerves!".
Did you hear me or not?
I also heard it.
Get out of the line!
Soul of the Director's Right
O Allah, take your belongings and get out.
Take your belongings.
Oh, how beautiful!
I'm sure I'm still looking for it.
We haven't seen the professor.
Sure, the translation is: <font color="FF0000">Ice cream with milk is really tasty, especially when it has strawberries inside.</font>
My love Abdul Rahman
Every human is prone to error, and so is the son of Adam.
Dad, it's just for fun!
The most important thing is that the matter doesn't reach Dad.
I want the cocoa that's in my bag.
Present and your teeth are shiny and where's your bag?
In the row
May I see with my eyes.
He says he's delighted with you.
You can't tell the difference between a man of high birth and an ordinary one.
Qarādah looks like a red khazar.
Come, where are you going?
In the bathroom
And you're still in the bathroom
Knock on the door quickly and tell him that the first period has been going on for half an hour. Hurry up!
I'll have one juice and one plaster cast.
I took all their worries away, my friend Abdulrahman is really good for health.
Now go get a PlayStation memory card from Saud.
So what do we learn from this story?
<em>Man</em>
He must have noble character.
This PS is M's. He also said he'd return my entire PS at once.
Inshallah Tamer is my friend, too. My friend Abdul Rahman is my friend.
Right now, no.
We learn from the story.
Of course, you know that I'm leaving this week since I got accepted for further studies.
So I said I had to submit the event file before I left.
How shall I take you in the afternoon? Abdul Rahman told me he didn't know where he wanted to go, but he didn't specify the time.
Madam, her father has returned from travel, and he said nothing. Thank God, I'm off the hook!
Suppose I didn't take him out this afternoon, and he got upset and didn't say anything to his dad. No way, no, no.
Hello, my friend Abdul Rahman.
God be with you.
What should we do, my dear?
Sweet, sweet like this.
We're starting a new Science lesson, my dear children.
Peace be upon you.
Thank you, thank you.
My father
What I didn't ask for from my eyes
Professor, professor, how dare you ask Professor Mei?
The teacher is walking to get water for a student; you're his personal servant. Not on my watch! I'll write about this in the report.
You keep joking around.
Do not raise your voice or shout at me. I am listening.
How much is this? How much does it cost?
That's all the cars we have.
Four cars five
Excellent This is excellent Great! Excellent.
What did you do this?
As you can see, he's building a parking lot behind our houses and at our expense.
Don't say the days of Boonaser
Bonaser Khalas
He is studying away.
Zain broke the table.
On Stupidity
Why specifically?
There's a feather on your head.
Adjust your style with me
It's me or you.
We didn't say anything, Dad.
What's this?
Hear, let things go, it's way better for you.
We're threatened, Dad.
No need, I can handle it.
What are you talking about?
Beh dal ma ashma ya3ni
It looks like you want the A
Do you want it this way? Fine.
Hurry hurry!
Ha ha, that's nice.
It won't be on his terms.
Father's Neighbourhood
We came to Uncle Bonaif's to remember, not to shout.
Who is Rashid, acting however he pleases in the neighborhood?
You made me speak.
Okay, everyone hush. Let's hear what Uncle Bonyaf has to say.
Right now, this filthy guy, who is not worth a single penny, is playing with your nerves.
Let him have it.
If I gave him a slap, he'd stick to the umbrella he made.
The game is played with its people.
That's nice.
With the goodbye
You haven't seen anything yet.
You know he has a jewelry shop.
Agova is wearing those rings and chains.
God has left us behind.
Just keep walking, you'll stay in the heat.
Rashid, who is naive and has nothing, ended up like this.
They appointed him Deputy Director General of the World Educational Center.
He tells you he'll teach you, he's a teacher, you're a teacher too, but look where he is now and look where you are.
It's all yours.
Go ahead, Abdullah.
I'll teach you what the secret is.
The teacher has arrived. The teacher has arrived.
Professor, I didn't do anything.
Do you not know whose son this is?
O my love, I know this one is a boy.
I'll tell you, this is a great opportunity that has come our way.
I'm looking for a job, you made me laugh, you really made me laugh!
It's in the bag, Dad.
Thank you very much, you're the best!
Shake hands with him.
If I greet you, may your mother, after God, grant you peace. May she notify you, God willing. She greets you.
i bye, my love. May God protect you.
Once your brother gets married, he'll become a minister. You'll see, Dad!
Okay, Mom. We'll work on the heavy stuff.
But my dad, if your work doesn't say anything
Just like that, she gave it to you.
It's just a normal thing.
Normal automatically high mate
My dear son, please make my dream come true.
Before your dream, it was my dream.
Reserve me a tower among the towers on the Corniche.
Oh Allah, what are they waiting for?
Thank you so much.
Go for it, Abu Saleh!
I say your friend looks like he's bothering you.
And Allah, one can't tell with him, my brother.
You're the real deal, Bosaleh.
I swear, he picked up his phone and gave it to Bosaleh.
Check out these moves. Sultan definitely holds a grudge against him, a million percent.
It was never a good relationship, him and Bousaleh.
No, Sultan wouldn't do this unless he had something planned.
Is it conceivable to this degree?
He closed the car door.
Finally, he ends up working as the minister's car's windshield wiper.
O dad, don't break my heart, don't break my heart.
For your information, the gossip we hear in cafes is becoming a reality in the country.
But I just can't believe what I'm hearing.
My heart has stopped.
I fear the tale, oh Mother, it'll make me fall in the eyes of the ladies. The one about me and the plates, oh Mother, it's embarrassing me before the ladies.
Say something, oh boss-Sultan, speak up! I'm shocked, damn it!
Please, I know what I'm doing.
No one has any business with me.
I'm working slowly and carefully.
Since she opened the door, this marks the beginning of the plan I have in mind.
I should be the Minister, not him.
Let me work. I have a plan.
Let them carry it
Any plan.
He just has to trust me at the beginning.
They said his eyes are those of a minister, as he was appointed two months before you.
Because I guarantee his load and his spending
Magic can be dispelled.
What is this?
What is it like after?
Any activity which the photographers ban, snap away until his picture burns in the newspaper.
And his smell rises until it surfaces.
Of course, it's back.
Please wait, let me work on it, and I'll show you the result.
On the contrary, Your Highness.
Of course, Your Excellency the Minister.
Then come and tell me.
Thanked him for the lamb; its meat was really tasty.
The real deal's at the door, rise for him.
Don't become a laughing stock, people want to see you thrive and you want to diminish yourself.
The Minister is most welcome.
La la la, I can't imagine myself as the Minister's secretary, just a picture, a picture of the Minister's secretary.
Slap him second.
And God, brother, I really liked your plan!
I want to take you there.
Photo Photo Photo
Any Minister needed
Okay, I'll tell you in a moment.
Go to the second last page.
Blow up a picture of him with the groom.
Say: "Lā ilāha illā llāh."
Each day has its picture or pictures.
As you say, a social activist. Goodbye, goodbye.
They all love you, but something's wrong with you, I don't know what.
Melas in every wall
Two envious and jealous people are hating on you; they only throw stones at the fruitful tree.
Go down to the market
The machines are preparing.
Peace be upon you.
Hello, peace be upon you, hello.
You're very welcome.
Shh, it's Abdulhadis Abdullah's turn.
This is my husband
I am a cat. Meow!
Three hundred and fifty
Let's hope this is a good person.
As of today, I'm still at home. Hopefully nothing's wrong.
Oh God, today I have a splitting headache, my body feels broken, and my colon is acting up as well.
I'm exhausted, honestly. I've been searching for a whole month now.
Let me relax today
Hello Oum Sultan
I say
O driver, please take me there.
I'll see you've analyzed it
You've seen the purple fame's effects.
I'm glad you're convinced.
Honestly, it's clear.
Your minister is apparently quite complacent. It seems he's enjoying the status quo.
I'll send you my brother Saad.
No, by Allah, I didn't follow any activities today or read the newspapers, I have no idea.
Good tidings, O Allah. Farewell.
God will surely give the ant wings.
Peace be upon you, my brother. Is there no conference for you tonight at the hotel?
Wedding
That absolutely means no activities at all. Not even a birthday party or a wedding.
I don't know, but you can see the hotel behind us.
Oh, they're staying at the Warakam Hotel.
Excuse me, I'll leave you in the car and go ask.
Soul soul soul Take your time, go ahead and ask a soul
May everyone succeed, God willing.
Ikhilina Halozier needs to rest and relax.
It means he couldn't find a single party, wedding, or any other occasion to crash.
Twelve thousand hotels and not a single one had any rooms available. His luck was as dismal as his face.
My silence doesn't mean I agree.
I couldn't find anything for his birthday.
Indeed, you can catch the second half.
Every number has a face.
He who doesn't sleep won't eat, my brother.
Oh, uncle, he's an idiot! He says, first take a picture of him and then do the *qirada*.
My children tell me they're holding a contest based on the Minister of Religion's photo.
One person asks the other, "How many photos of the minister are they putting in the newspaper today?"
And the winner gets a prize.
It's not like that. Come have a coffee and listen to the daily comments in the newspaper about his photos. They say this guy never stops talking.
The end of his rule is nigh.
It's all over, as they say; the butterfly, when God wills its end, nears the light.
People greet you and send their regards to you.
They became one of the country's most famous celebrities.
At your service. And who might this be?
You ruined my prestige.
May Allah protect her and protect them.
They all got married, only Amal's still single.
This fate.
It's not written for me to promote.
I have already forgotten about the marriage.
God suffice me against the one who was the cause.
<h1>Hollow these two liquids that are sitting over there</h1>
May they be healed.
Juve who plays with his hair
This is my horse or my little daughter
After my father died — I mean, was slaughtered.
The two gifts are bigger in size.
It's haram to leave him attached to the maid.
Oh God, go make me some tea.
I wanted to talk to my mom, but she has not one, but two servants.
We told Um Muhammad: "This boy is not your daughter's. He's mine. He's not yours."
Do you have another story besides Kholod and the domestic workers? It's always about the domestic workers and Kholod.
Mom, it's not good like this. Khalid is always with the maid 24/7 and doesn't want anyone else.
Oh God, get out, let me rest, I want to sleep. How on earth...
My uncle Khalid, your brother, has become very skinny.
Wait a bit, if I don't inform my dad about you, that is.
I'll tell you, Kholod. What's the matter, Kholod?
Saud says that Kholod puts on makeup and acts like a girl. What's the deal? What's the deal?
O Saud, O Saud!
He puts makeup on his face; it looks like a child has been playing with it.
I saw this huge elephant and it wasn't even visible.
Sweet, gentle and delicate.
I am Bahasha Saud.
It's been a long time since I saw you.
When I grow up, what will I become? Answer me now, what will I be when I grow up?
And you, my beloved Khaldi, will become an officer, while Saad becomes a soldier.
Every year we go to London.
Any trembling word in Bahrain
Let him bring Susu, Faho and Khalood.
And give my regards to Samoura.
I seek forgiveness from Allah the Almighty.
Today my dad told me to choose.
Do you want me to build it on the sea or on the land we own?
I don't want to choose.
I, my love, would live with you anywhere
Thank you, my dear.
I learned to fish for Samak.
God, Oh Hope! I wish I could blink and then have someone tell me: Hope, you've graduated!
It's not a men's perfume.
My mother only, its smell is very strange
O Lord, what's happening to me?
The way you talk has become very feminine.
You forgot you're a man.
inshallah after that I'll talk to people outside
I finally believed you, Khaled.
Please get out of my room.
Oh, what a pity, Kholod.
You fell from my eye.
Oh please, don't hurt my feelings. I swear I'll tell my mom!
This is my son and I know him well.
Therefore, O Khalid, the apple of mine eye, I wish all children were like you in behaviour and sentiment.
And you, hopefully you don't see someone gentle and quiet and say 'my daughters' about them.
Shame, shame! You should not be talking about your brother like that.
Just because you're blowing it out of proportion doesn't mean it's not a small issue.
What's worth it, spray a little perfume that smells nice. What's the difference between men's and women's perfumes?
Tell this story in front of my father
I have
I'll keep quiet just so Muhammad won't sense anything.
Oh, where do these girls hang out?
And God forbid she's so beautiful.
Don't look at it, don't look at it!
I swear I'm afraid that I sense something that concerns him.
Give yourselves comfort.
I know you're all looking at the Bluetooth devices that are popular these days.
I'm waiting for Saad, but let him come.
How are you, Saad?
May God keep you.
I say, we're waiting for you; we still haven't played cards.
Why not?
Do you want to drink something?
His hollow self lies here in your apartment for the second day now.
On his Bluetooth story.
O my brother, the oud is in harmony with us.
Afraid of him
Don't even try, it's over. Don't even try.
Oh please, Mom, ward off the devil for my sake.
I've booked already.
I've had enough, where do I put her face among people, I have no face.
I'll do what's best for my dad.
Tell him anything.
Oh, those kids! Oh, I tell you!
This is the end of it, Mom.
Remember when Khalood was little
Surely, this must be the result.
It's forbidden for you, get up and get out.
The truth always hurts.
The jar broke.
I could never live in Doha.
My face
I have had my phone turned off for a while.
And the blame falls on you, O Hope.
And you, my two daughters, you spend your whole day at home.
Perpendicular and I am a real one, who spends all day dealing with people outside.
It's tough, Omal.
I can't live all day and all my life with my head bowed to the ground.
My dad has been feeling for a while that something's up and that there's been a change in the house.
And when my father's away, I'm oblivious to what's happening in the house.
My father sometimes I blame him, sometimes I don't.
Malouma ya Amal, when I remember his toil and dedication to his work, so that we may live with dignity among people.
And I blame him.
When he left his responsibilities at home and family behind.
We don't want to dig up the past.
My dad knows or not?
Just me planning.
Transfer via Bluetooth
But I won't give it to him.
I don't want to see my father's shock with my own eyes.
It hurts a lot.
Whatever it is, O Amal.
It's known through us
<strong>Better than what is known through others</strong>
Our house has been lost to such an extent.
Because a dirty bomb named "Khlood" exploded inside him.
Customs and traditions
They taught them with utmost rudeness.
Sadīn ʾaḏānihim ʿanhā.
O you who hear!
Only one voice
It's the voice of filth and perversion.
Waidyson is all good.
Sure, the Arabic text "شاللي طرا ع بالك" translates to: "What's on your mind?"
Suddenly, I decided to travel for studies.
All we can say is may God assist you in your endeavours, my son.
God will help you.
The gifts have returned, those that came from travels, not those of the travelers themselves.
You are right.
This base
But for every rule...
Come with me quickly, my hope.
O my dear mother, she's dried up.
Not a peep.

Bo Sa'ad
What's wrong with you, Bus'ad?
Dad, what's wrong with you, Dad?
Dad
Don't be upset.
You're a great human being.
Why would a young man wish for a wife?
I never divorced you because there was anything wrong with you.
I divorce you.
Because it's impossible.
Let my icon be the father of my orphans.
One weirdo like your brother
Hello Salah.
Every day I come here, it's hollow.
First you all look so vague.

That first one under the dirt.
God's truth, that's a strong statement! Are you up for it?
You're wasting your time, I swear a lot of money is being wasted.
Say "mashallah"
Let's go, let's go.
It's been seven months of constant nagging. Please, just drop me off at home.
A failure and a disgrace.
The story teller is among you, my dear friends.
It's been seven months now.
My ears are ringing.
Get him out of here, we're fed up with him!
Saffrooh wa hat-oo fee ghair-uh
Fahmi doesn't understand what this word means, he doesn't realize the monetary losses involved.
He's had his driver training, now let him go.
You're the first person to come to my house in the last six months.
Zeen, after all, says new and different things.
This petrol in Aheen and Ahad Mihr Abatash is 500 riyals per FAL kilo, half a riyal per litre, it's all very expensive, Dad!
Finally, you've lost it, my hero. Listen to what I have to say.
You're the first guy I come to give money to.
Seven hundred
You're just a newborn babe, not even six months old yet. This is eight hundred.
I need money.
This is Adriver – you're Esawi. You're talking ancient. You're the new kid.
This is 700 Al-Hayyan 800.
Rawh
He says he'll only come if you give him 100 riyals.
300 is useless.
I am speechless, you are amazing.

Lists his financial sponsor.
Why are you coughing?
This person's first sponsor is his/her wallet.
My heart beats one hundred and sixty.
How cool are you!
The wool is not like you to cough.
There's no coffee.
In God I suffice.
I sat down to see inside his heart.
There's nobody.
Even the phone I bought for him has a package.
Hello.
I'll do it after.
They did their best. They took his passport and kept it with them.
It's easy, brother. You're the boss.
Tomatoes everywhere
The problem is here. The problem is here.
After all this, they scatter.
Iohciona wayciona
I told you so, deport him!
But I think I'll keep him.
I'll go wherever he goes.
Travel means travel.
I'd rather pay for his ticket and send him over than have him stay here gathering money.
My stomach turns. I wish I could just catch him.
Showertime buddy, no one's buying right now.
At the beginning of the game you were way too nervous, I could tell.
We're only afraid our team won't score goals.
We want more than three, we want ten, twelve, fifteen.
You made me feel as though you were scared of the opposing team before the match.
I'm not scared of the opposing team, I'm scared of ours. I'm afraid we won't score. I'll tell you more than three.
This is our team's level, I know it, I'm talking about our team's level.
Sure! Here is the translation: A lot of confidence from you
The opposing team has nothing to show.
The cute foxes have already scored the first goal.
Where are you going?
Oh, my house!
Inside a car
Come, I have an Audi with me. I'll give you a ride.
Oh, my thanks to you, my friend.
You won't beat our team, will you?
The matches are just beginning, the league has just started.
He's what he said.
He tells you there are many problems.
O Allah, Mahmoud, bring it here.
O my companion, the noble Egill, rise! By Allah, we must ride!
Come on, Uncle Saqid.
Please, sir.
What's all this he's making himself out to be then?
Ooh, the Indian guy.
Yes, uncle, it's a ball canon.
There's no saying this isn't the Foxes' speech.
Sweet little by little.
Oh Allah, oh Allah, the match is about to begin, quick! Get me some water, the Foxes are playing today! Quick!
Our dear viewers, we have with us one of the most famous supporters of the Foxes club, also known as "The Foxy One".
But they say you won because they were short-handed.
This talk is all talk, no action.
What's missing in what? This is a very very strong team, with a dozen players.
Ohd's incomplete minus two, it's hopeless, same same.
This is a fox devil.
This is the best fan we have.
Congratulations, foxes! Here's a word of appreciation directed towards you: Congratulations!
All talk is valid.
When the foxes speak.
This is soaring in the sky above
This is fair play.
See my brother
He received it with great enthusiasm.
Please come in, sweetheart.
Where's the Indian boy who kicks the ball?
I haven't seen him for some time.
Oh uncle, with great anger, he won't stay here anymore.
The affection from a few days ago, I didn't recognize him, he was sitting in a cafe in Flagio, a place called Star Bucks, something like that.
I remember this guy used to count with us in the ahwa, he didn't even have a cup of tea.
If my eyes don't deceive me, the boy has twenty riyals for baksheesh.
Why did he do that to me?
My dear fellow, he's schmoozing with the bigwigs at the club. He's getting things sorted, so they won't mess with him.
I say Foxy.
My name is
My mom says: "Sui in rahti, sui in jiti."
You're an idiot to cheer for such a lousy and weak team.
This is my Fox Heart Money Team.
Your heart will stop my money.
Goodness is found within the truth.
Have you never heard the poem written in Al-Hikam?
The day our match was with them
Please, please, O Fox, say it, This is a poem, say it.
My mother oh Allah in a world of secrets I am lost
This is my money, indeed. I have plenty of it.
I don't sleep at all at night.
You know we're a relationship of Foxes fans.
<h1>The winner's name</h1> <p>You can't tell me the winner's name so I can get an exclusive scoop, can you?</p>
We have a press conference where we will hopefully announce the winner's name.
Say what's beautiful
This superfan, known as Thaalob, was honoured today by the Foxes' management in a kind and beautiful gesture.
And Allah
Thaaloub, congratulations on this wonderful honour! This is a most excellent gift.
Snow egret, is this a pen or a sword?
And Allah is the Most High.
This is a nod to
I tell you it is
We need to inform the police.
Sit down. Keep still.
All this for the love of money, fans.
La la la ya bok, it's not him, this is a different guy.
I tell you it is
You're late.
I don't know the timings of the matches, bro.
Now, how are we going to catch him?
There's only one option left, we wait for the Foxes' next game.
I found it.
<h1>Zein joined us!</h1>
Hey, you're late!
Ako ako ako ako
Give him the bag, the whole bag. Give him one more behind his back.
The story is that we're not sure if this is him or not.
I tell you, it's him, Dad, it's him.
I say we go to the two guys and ask. We tell them the driver you have there, where did he come from, how did he arrive, when did he arrive?
Dad, you have to turn one trip into two.
I'm going to inform them, I'm certain it's him.
May Allah bless you. May Allah protect you. My name is Niam.

This blew up in the second plot next to his.
Say: My father will give him over to you, the son of Abdelrahman As-Sabji. May there be safety, may there be safety, may there be safety.
No, God forbid! It seems we've got the wrong person. We're here for a friend of a friend and mistook you for him.
God the Almighty creates and shapes a human being in His own image and likeness to resemble forty people.
Thank you very much, Your Highness. You're too kind.
La laa Allah ysalmek Forgiveness, all forgiveness Thank you, thank you
Oh Allah, grant us Your forgiveness, for Your permission is dear to us. We seek Your pardon, and peace be upon you, O Allah. Peace be upon you, indeed.
And you say you're certain?
What's up with your dad now? Oh boy.
What did you do, Walid?
And I walk and carry my bag.
O Allah, hasten his return.
Get up and go to your room!
God only knows.
God willing.
Come back now, let your father explain this to you.
Before my father knew
Shattered into a million pieces.
Let's go buy one just like it right away, Mom.
Before my dad came
And the one who will make you enter Paradise, oh my dear mother.
You know your dad, when he gets angry he becomes like a Jinn.
You are the soul of your room, don't leave it.
It's nothing.
By accident, he knocked over the vase. His backpack fell and broke.
Mom, I'm scared for him.
Mom, where did you go?
No, no, his father's not sane!
It's haram on you to do such things to the boy, Mom.
Amziyin, his heart's in his throat, yet he's determined to pull through.
I say, Mom.
Do you think you know where the boy went
Okay, I'll make you a telephone.
God willing.
My aunt, I know where Waleed went.
Come here, I need you. Where are you going?
O Allah, O Allah
I am here.
And if my grandmother were to embrace Islam, I wouldn't go home.
Please come in.
I haven't seen the vase.
I have no idea.
That's how your father, may God guide him, scared you.
Come here, mom.
Don't worry Dad, I'm home.
I have the solution.
We didn't say anything, Abu Waleed.
I'm fulfilling your request, Abu Walid.
For your sake, I'll forgive him this time.
I don't see him at home.
His place is where the hell is it?
It's him, it's his
Okay, don't worry, Walid. Your father didn't do anything to you.
Of course, Dad.
Yes, Dad, yes.
I'm keeping it here because I'm afraid that one of the kids might grab it and break it.
My father recommended me to buy another one just like the one Walid broke.
Exactly, I went there and this was the last one in the shop! My luck! Oh my goodness, where are the kids?
In the room they study.
Oh Allah, protect her.
Just these values, and I'll get up.
O what a beauty!
Let's go, guys! Hit the books.
Dad, just this game and we'll get up.
Dad, if you love me, don't tell Uncle
Dad, don't tell your brother. Dad, this is the last time, I swear.
I contact him.
You, specifically, insulted my friend at the coffee shop.
Bro, you'd better watch out if my brother finds out about you.
This phone is no longer linked to my number as long as you keep those memories.
Mom, why can't he be a doctor?
O God, have mercy on her soul.
His heart and mind are worn out from all the suffering.
Poor boy.
Let it be you
Oma, where's Amoula? I don't see her with you today.
I wish she were here.
This sister of mine is insatiable when it comes to playing games.
And O my mother, I never told you the story of Amirah and her son Naif.
May God protect her son, who is as young as an infant.
And the same height.
Yesterday she told me she doesn't know what to do about her son.
She wants to take him to the hospital but her husband Youssef says no.
I heard the story last night.
And she was howling.
He says, "How come you didn't tell me?"
This one has a mental condition.
The boy has no choice.
He takes his son and ties him up outside in the courtyard.
Then he tells him, "Do it again and pee in your bed."
You're whispering in a ruin.
O my beloved Amnera
I tell her: Eat, eat.
Eat with pleasure and in good health!
Oh my luck!
O my mother, O my mother!
Your father has finally noticed you.
Or else I'll slaughter you.
Oh God, hurry up and have a shower before your dad wakes up and creates a fuss.
It's not on me to save you.
Haram poor things.
They are shouting and cursing each other.
I'm afraid something will happen to my children.
I have to take them to their uncle's to be disciplined.
I'm nervous.
They didn't bring down the successful ones.
Why are you sending them to their uncle's?
I've brought forty-eight out of fifty.
Why not fifty-fifty?
Their uncle warned them.
I honestly agree with his point of view.
Let the emotions with you
I need to teach them a lesson.
Bye bye.
Last time. Last time.
<h1>Fifty out of fifty</h1>
Let's not waste our time . I'll make sure to tell them that it's our son .
Why don't you bring fifty of fifty?
Jab jab jab, I'm warning you, but you're not listening!
What you hear is not the word.
Noble in life
Give him alone time. Let me discipline him. Yes.
Okay, Uncle.
For the second time, you will check carefully. This is what you will do.
Let's go already!
Do you know what I'm doing?
We'll make you falafel one after the other.
Be careful not to go with them to public places.
Confusions
Professor Waleed is shouting.
What's wrong with you? Why are you moaning?
This is an excellent grade.
Strange that you cry.
Supposedly, you're happy.
You, my son, while everyone else boarded their buses and left, waited for anyone who could take you.
At the school gate, waiting for the bus. The bus has arrived and the kids have disembarked, but not with them.
Have you heard about the boy who committed suicide today?
Hello, may God bless you, we are presenting the certificate.
And his father threatened him if he doesn't get straight A's.
Waleed, Waleed, come back, Waleed, come back!
Greetings to you all live, and welcome to a new episode of Without Borders.
Oil accounts for over thirty-five percent of all energy sources.
The rest goes to natural gas, coal and hydropower.
Thus, oil is the primary source of energy in the world.
The Gulf Arab states and Iran alone possess 686 billion barrels.
Following is Iran at twelve percent, Iraq at ten percent, Kuwait and the UAE at nine percent.
Each of them has seven per cent, and then Venezuela.
Then Russia with five per cent.
The Gulf states and Iran account for two-thirds of the global oil reserve.
to unprecedented prices, surpassing the $109 mark for the first time in its history
In this episode, we attempt to comprehend the many complexities of oil.
The problems faced by the exporting countries
Despite its skyrocketing prices,
As well as the problems faced by the citizens and residents of these countries.
As a result of the inflation and unprecedented rise
which will appear consecutively on the screen or write to us through our website at www.aljazeera.net
Today, the market is the key factor.
and not the producing states
The force of the market determines the price.
and not the OPEC.
Of course, the offer and the request have a role to play.
But other factors
Other factors are the political tensions.
In the world
And real estate markets
and the Bourse and other markets
They headed for the auction prices.
In the *Chemotaxonomy*, for instance petroleum.
And tomorrow the salary will reach $1,000, God willing.
Oil in two thousand and four jumped from forty four dollars.
And today we see that even the prices of petroleum
It oscillates between one day and the next.
Oil prices dropped below ninety dollars.
Rose in the second quarter.
Especially with spring coming in, most refineries worldwide enter their maintenance period around this time.
What always relates to the second quarter.
Seasonal demand for oil decreases.
In winter it drops below ninety.
These all indicate that speculations have power and control over the market now.
Repeatedly, we return to the traditional market of the past.
The market was affected by supply and demand.
LLL The Grand Request Season
Today we see that there is an economic growth.
Today or yesterday, General Fallon, the commander of the Central region in Afghanistan and Iraq, resigned.
His resignation triggered huge reactions related to the so-called impending American war.
Political or geopolitical effects
Impacts the oil market in a very quick and either negative or positive way
The effect will definitely have an impact on him.
And even the speculators also interact with political speculations
Some say a US war on Iran may be confirmed.
Here's what the market will look like. The market is optimistic.
A question arises as the Deputy's quest reaches the White House
And this brought the region back to a state of tension.
This is the badger.
But maybe Falun saw this scenario.
The oil market reacts very swiftly.
Today we prove with figures that there is no shortage whatsoever.
Let me give you an example within the last seven weeks.
In the U.S., oil stockpiles have surged past the five-year average.
Today I don't mean what I say.
Not even for the next war, because today I tell you that the world also has a stockpile of weapons.
Even today's global consumption, look at any country in the world, there are long lines of cars queuing at petrol stations.
This is something else.
What danger does this pose to
What number do you think it could be? I don't know, it might be any number.
Three hundred dollars may be metin, it might even be less.
It might reach a real tension if these tensions reached Turat.
Because, as you said, the Gulf makes up sixty percent.
In a country that is even distant from oil-producing nations.
The effect comes inversely upon the oil market.
It can reach three hundred dollars.
They shifted from stocks and other markets into the oil market today. Over two trillion or three trillion dollars flowed in.
Today we see the printout.
It produces over 100,000 barrels a day.
Tensions in the region are high and anticipation is palpable.
April, as previously stated, is to be the month for launching this war.
And Allah knows best, indeed my generation did not mean...
In the area because it's now the now.
The year is an election year.
The current U.S. administration has only a few months left in office.
George H. W. Bush launched the war on Somalia and sent 30,000 troops in his final days in the White House
We see, but we do not anticipate.
But I do not expect this scenario to be.
Because this scene would be too costly.
You won't pay a thing. You, the Iranians and the consuming nations will pay.
America Today
Now it relies on Africa's oil and has many alternatives.
Let's speak plainly.
You said in your intro that sixty percent...
Oil reserves
But now they import twenty-two.
Their oil is from the West West of Africa.
From West Africa, and however much they import from any region in the world.
Oil production
Because this is a tough number and proven reserves and resources
Deep Water or "Offshore" or Deep Sea Fishing
The Navy, therefore the Gulf will remain a tough number.
and Caspian Sea oil
I consider them dreams, because they are not real or true.
They're ruining and destroying it.
The important thing is, there means
Today, Qatar is the world's biggest energy exporter.
The issue is therefore this: these countries' phone number is a difficult code.
‏Therein and countries' energy needs
Certainly, there is such a thing as secure supply chain security.
And there was internal US opposition, even at the level of General Fallon.
But concerns still remain.
It is up to President Bush
It's you who noticed that political risks don't stem from Gulf states.
It's not about la la la la, it's not a matter of generosity, because no one in our family is generous.
There's a lot of generosity in dealing
But not in my current article
We are not part of any charity work.
Or or the kindness of
Just kindness with the Westerners, not with anyone else.
With America specifically
Where's the market?
Where the economic return is, that's where we'll go.
We will not.
Like oil and gas
You put them on for generosity and
I have the proof.
I have the proof.
Not more than sixty to seventy dollars
Not the rise in prices.
But the dollar's decline, which you insist on.
You are first and foremost Gulfians and OPEC.
The export must be in USD and you refuse.
Change the currency even though the currency has collapsed
Although the return is not in your favor.
No, I'm not seventy.
Just the experts' words, not mine.
Okay, the dollar has dropped thirty-five percent and oil has risen above this drop.
If we take the base year 2004
We'll see them as oil prices fluctuate between $35 and $45.
It means, of course, it does.
The price of oil has increased.
But the increase is slight, the Deputy's efforts are meager.
If we take them
So, we consider it now, basically.
Even these prices
If we compare it to two thousand and four.
I have surpassed even the rate of decrease of the dollar
<h1>The Thrilling</h1>
It interacts with the dollar's decline.
The lower the dollar goes, the higher oil prices rise.
And this too is something the market has begun to sense.
My interests now are to keep it low.
Now the situation has changed. Two years ago, people might have said it was declining, but the situation has changed and there is...
The dollar started losing value against major currencies such as the Euro, the Yen, the Yuan and the Pound.
The question here is, why do you insist on pegging your currency to the dollar?
His currency is weakening and it has no backing.
This is it, this is it! A historical era.
Petroleum and its derivatives are priced in dollars, as is production from the European North Sea, Russia and Norway.
It stipulates that in the mid 1970s, the U.S.A.
cancelled the gold cover that was for the American currency
This is not right.
Primary Medicine is the right one.
The OPEC organizes.
Four Gulf states
Qatar, Kuwait, the UAE and Saudi Arabia
Today's OPEC's share in the global market
40%
Today, if we consider that the world consumes 85 million barrels of oil
She deals with the dollar in pricing her oil.
If priced in another currency everyone would be rich.
You can't escape me.
All oil-exporting nations must agree.
From the adults
Those who hold over 66% of the global reserves are the majors.
Sure, the English translation is: Tiatt but I took it as an export.
Among them are Venezuela, Libya and Iran.
and Cameroon and Angola are members of OPEC.
Do not exceed 40% per day in the market.
is produced and exported by non-OPEC nations
And this one can't stand the 40% guy.
A person cannot breathe without a nose.
In some countries they have tried, but...
A not really real try
It's you who refuse because of the ties with America.
From Dora to another job.
All oil-exporting nations
One barrel yields two demijohns.
They are the loss when he doesn't issue.
His currency has soared.
He sells his oil in dollars.
<em>In the shop</em> <strong>Malek</strong> <em>or the</em> <strong>receptacle</strong> <em>is the one who receives them, he takes his money in dollars and then converts it</em> <em>into his local currency.</em>
His currency is not pegged to the dollar.
True, but it's he.
But your problem is also that you sell in dollars, and your currency is not pegged to the dollar. You have no issue with that.
That's my important question now.
What is the concern and impact if your currency is pegged to the dollar while the dollar is dropping?
Has been associated for a long time.
Especially in the 1970s, when the dollar was a very strong currency and being paid in dollars meant a lot of power.
Disengagement is not that easy.
Painting is easy.
No. Here, it's a no.
Divorce has its costs.
‏The interests of these nations are in it, not against it.
On Profits and Losses
Dogenz announced in yesterday's newsletter that there are four countries that there is a State.
But there's also a report from the Gulf Finance House stating that four Gulf states are in the race for the Gulf's unified currency, as Oman has opted out.
I read the declaration in the Dungeons, and I don't think it's a real permit.
He denied being the Governor of the Central Bank of Qatar.
He said yes and that he would conduct a study, but also that all Gulf states must do the same.
You have to study profit and loss in a calm manner, devoid of emotions.
Let's leave it at that. Let's leave it for further study so they can come up with something.
Joe, I will get you economists to tell you that according to another study,
This study reflects
The Loblaw House is a very simple and tidy thing. They issued a report on March 8th.
Apple Four Days Only.
Global House of Al needs a political decision.
The political decision boils down to two things.
There are only two of them, the first need.
Gulf Cooperation Council currencies. Its intention, along with Kuwait, to issue the currency in 2010 or to study the issuance of a unified Gulf currency.
The second point is to issue a decision to disconnect from the dollar.
Firstly, as for the unified currency
In my personal opinion
We see the introduction of the Gulf unified currency.
The currency The currency will be strong when
It will be It will be
One of the strongest currencies in the world, some say.
And the reserves beyond it and the huge revenues behind them.
So this is what His Excellency the Prime Minister focused on when he said:
It's the Gulf States because no single country can go it alone.
A stronger economic content
An economic bloc today, even the Euro today
But one must not forget that the central bank has a very large role to play.
In the evaluation.
&&& Profit and Loss Account
Out of all these news.
The situation is tense.
Two thousand and eight, as observers Global House say, will continue with inflation.
For a long time in the Gulf states, but the solution is in the hands of the governments.
Some countries have increased salaries to seventy percent, such as the UAE.
To halt the inflationary process
When will you increase the salaries of the poor people in Qatar?
And I'll hear your answer after this short break.
Today's show topic is Gulf Cooperation Council countries' oil reserves and daily production, specifically Saudi Arabia's.
She has reserves of forty six billion, two hundred and forty million.
Two out of ten barrels.
And ten minus nine equals eleven daily.
1,100,000.15 and 2.07 billion.
152110000000 OMR 0.056770000000000006
Bahrain 25.535.000
Total revenues for the year were eighty billion.
From 2003 to 2007
In Europe one hundred billion
Sixty billion in the Middle East and Forty billion
In Asia and other countries
The GCC countries' total GDP was in the year 2017.
The total output for the year 2007 is expected to be 7.997 billion.
In 2,089,911,010.1
The inflation that is eating away at the salaries of employees, workers and those living in this region.
It will increase in 2028 to 38.10.
Kuwait fourteen percent forecast in two thousand and eight nine point eight ten Emirates.
It will become ten, while Saudi Arabia was six and a half, it will reach six.
Eight out of ten
Salaries are gobbled up.
What amounts and percentages will you be increasing the salaries of the unfortunate employees here?
If we want the problem to be tackled
Real processing
Salaries are always increases in salaries are always
It is not the solution.
I am not against increasing salaries.
True, this isn't true.
We are always.
Of course, I believe.
The increases will be eaten up by inflation, which is running rampant and out of control.
To tackle inflation, a Supreme Committee comprising all experts and specialists will be formed.
And now this committee is putting
Because the world is increasing salaries
The golden economic rule says of course
It will be endless.
And whatsoever
Salaries rose and kept on rising.
Inflation will increase.
It must be processed and it must be
A scientific study was conducted by the recruitment-specialist institution Bayt.com, in partnership with YouGov Siraj, a British market research agency.
A survey was conducted among fifteen thousand employees working in Gulf states across twenty different important sectors.
Especially among the job-seeking experts, there is zero job satisfaction.
The inflation is eating away at
<h1>Two especially the experienced</h1>
Thinking of moving away from these countries where inflation is eating us alive.
You will now lose.
This is the simple idea, and it's just about putting it into practice.
Inflation's mate is a rise in salaries.
Parallelism is present.
Is existing and
We are very keen, the state and the government alike.
This dilemma should be tackled with a real solution.
Temporary fixes never solve the problem, they only make it worse.
It means increase it.
We hope it will be for some more time until this committee puts.
All the applications
Here Daghr is seeking your deputy.
Boredom will always be.
There's only so much the state can do, it also tried and raised it to 40%.
A very important point here regarding the increases.
You only increase the salaries of Qataris. The non-Qataris are working for Burkina Faso and Zimbabwe.
You take care of the Qataris but you don't take care of the expats.
The high concentration of it is the reason.
O Ahmed, you live in Qatar, not in Germany.
You talk about this subject and suffer.
Salaries are significantly higher in the public sector.
And vice versa
In the governmental sector
And conversely, the public sector has become
The best elements and competencies have become
I also read the report and we are aware of the issues in the oil sector.
Labor
We are pro at faking it.
Engineers and workers coming from outside Qatar
And since we also interact with the global market,
For all these things the percentage increase is X in salaries.
And hope is with Allah the Most High.
There the government has a plan.
I say controlling inflation is more important.
From the temporary treatment
We will see, and I am sure of it.
There will be
Positive results.
It will be within fifteen percent.
Sweetie said 52.5 billion barrels of oil and 53.4 billion barrels of gas.
No comment. We are the client, not a female one.
My job and, of course, us.
Growth talk also means talking about economic growth and that has to benefit the people.
And of course, any economic growth today reflects that Qatar has the world's highest economic growth.
And vice versa
The gigantic conveyor belts in the country are also a part.
Without these huge conveyor belts and mega projects,
‏The country was also unaffected by inflation.
Played a part in the inflation as well.
This has also led to an increase in market liquidity.
Firstly, regarding the link between the dollar and oil.
Oil was mortgaged in exchange for protection
in the United States of America , therefore stability of governance is a given .
Thank you.
Saad Al-Ghamdi is from Saudi Arabia. Your question, Saad.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy of Allah, and His blessings.
The ring is indeed successful, and the title is good.
What I want to touch on is that the region is now under the shadow of America's current policy.
America's policy in its current war, alongside the cultural war against Islam, is a global economic war.
In the south of China
The U.S. deficit with Japan was also sixty-one billion dollars.
Also Japan had invested in the year 2000.
With America it's nine o'clock equivalent.
A billion dollars, while now it invests over twenty-seven billion dollars with the European Union.
Keeping up with the American politics and making the dollar a must-have currency worldwide
I say we buy now.
The area will become Gulf.
makan
Thank you brother Saad.
Muhammad Al-Waseef from Egypt
Hello, Deputy's Attendant.
The MP's demeanor reminds me of the Arab rulers in the Middle East.
When there is
When there are price adjustments or claims.
Salaries Amendment Amending salaries in accordance with prices, as Your Honour has mentioned.
It takes means in Qatar we consider you guys an example.
Determined not to proselytize the increase. That's an Arabic style.
We want this Qatar, relatively speaking. Abu Adrika is very important to us.
It's his right to say what he wants. Do you have a question? Of course he has the right to do so; he's responsible for this policy.
Question first.
The black deputy must be considered.
One, two, engage with the public opinion.
With the underprivileged, as Your Highness has graciously mentioned. They are the people who deserve care and attention.
The Arab rulers who don't care about the poor
As-salamu alaykum
Peace be upon you.
I'd like to greet you two, and greet 'Al-Aqil'.
I also want a salary increase.
Salaries are great and wonderful.
May God bless you. As for the subject, it's the one that we need to work on its meaning.
With the struggling ones, and hopefully there will never be any struggling in Qatar, we are certain.
The verdict states that Qatar is, as he put it, sending money to the ruling family and the ruler.
That's the important question now.
Let's reply to the brothers.
He cannot rule.
What happens to the wealth?
Now there are whole new cities like Lusail and other places, which means Qatar is really expanding.
The issue is the issue.
Comprehensive Development Plan
Briefly, because there are only two minutes left, our first pick is Qatar.
Qatar is now Qatar post-oil and gas
There is, of course, an explicit policy of the state.
Because I am not her.
Depleting wealth
The wealth is in front of him.
And so the trend is in the State of Qatar.
Middle East's Capital of Education
Today we see ourselves as the cultural city, the educational city.
Today, this educational city houses some of the world's finest universities.
Establishing medical cities, media cities and financial cities
Because today it's all about oil and gas
Of course not. We don't copy anyone.
Other satellite channels
It's not just the island. You're planning to make a hundred islands and you can't stand the one island.
Now, brother, these are the countries of the Gulf, our countries.
<em>In the boom of the seventies</em> <br>Now everyone remembers the boom of the seventies
Today, what we witness in Qatar is growth.
This also calls for a special episode about Qatar post-oil.
Our vision about oil, its future and the region's wealth, especially in Qatar. In conclusion, I convey the greetings of the program's team.
This is Ahmed Mansour greeting you without borders. Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you.
As-Salamu Alaikum Wa-Rahmatullahi Wa-Barakatuh.
Greetings to you live this week from the Qatari capital, Doha.
You are welcome to a new episode of Without Borders.
At the time Qatar hosts the largest US military base outside the United States, Al Udeid Air Base.
Against the U.S.'s enemies in the region
Such as Iran and Syria.
Its doors are open to leaders.
Hamas leaders, in fact, enjoy distinctive relations with the Qatari leadership.
As the Amir of Qatar was the only Arab leader
who visited the southern suburbs of Beirut, devastated by Israel during its war on Lebanon in the summer of 2006
She remains unlimited in her support for the reconstruction of what Israel destroyed in Lebanon.
At the time Qatar reconciled, at the time Qatar reconciled
With its older sister the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia about two years ago
At the same time skirmishes with the regime in Egypt.
As in the Lebanon file, where I succeeded where others failed.
It was in Doha where Lebanese leaders gathered and signed an agreement that safely guided them.
To the latest elections
As files are stubborn.
which was keen to be the driving force behind these files, not Qatar.
The smallest Arab state
In today's episode
We try to understand the principles and rules from which Qatar's foreign policy stems.
For whom?
The tiny Qatar, both geographically and in population, plays these major roles.
What are her qualifications?
In a live interview with the Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Qatar.
For our viewers who wish to participate, please call the following numbers which will appear on your screen momentarily.
The Visit of the Amir of Qatar
The roar of Al Jazeera's cannons desires to improve relations with Saudi Arabia
From the past: an attempted Saudi coup d'etat on the Emir of Qatar in cooperation with some members of the Al-Murra tribe.
In its issue released on past June 20th
What is the nature of the secret deal?
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Many of the most crucial matters
I don't think it's a minute.
Indeed, I have repeatedly stated in numerous interviews here, on this very program, that
We consider it the backbone.
The Gulf Cooperation Council
There was a misunderstanding.
And then
The differing opinions.
I solved the border issue. That was a huge hurdle.
Saudi-Qatari relations have historically been exceptional.
These relations if we observed them
<strong>Between the two families and the two countries</strong>
Misunderstanding marred their resemblance.
Not by us, nor by those before us
As there are no conditions between brothers.
And as for the relationships, I can confirm they are excellent.
For the benefit of the Gulf Cooperation Council
But how was the issue of Al Jazeera's status with Saudi Arabia settled? It was the obstacle or the reason that led to the crackdowns in 2002.
At a ** crucial point
And I repeat to you, if you go back to all the shows, I always say:
Not just the elder sister, but I would say our reliance in the GCC is
The KSA is a significant state in the region.
And we value our relations with them.
There was a war of words, which was evident to both sides.
These countries found themselves.
Failed when the Brothers agreed
The Qatari-Saudi House
Rather, they found that most of them had entered into a dispute.
They have neither a camel nor a cow in this matter.
I don't think it was a strategy on anyone's part to engage in this dispute.
But let me tell you, let me speak frankly here, so that we are absolutely clear.
Many observers believe that Al Jazeera has been biased in the last two years.
At a time when the situations criticized on Al Jazeera's screen persist,
Conditions inside Saudi Arabia
Whether the people arrested , the opponents or others , the list is still going .
Al Jazeera stopped covering these matters.
To change the Al Jazeera coverage of the Hajj
In praise of the system and what the Servant of the Two Holy Mosques is doing at a time that contradicts it.
I haven't seen it first of all. You can ask the Island Administration about this. Don't ask me.
The gathering of the two countries.
Stability in the region
This strategy has continued and grown in strength, first with the stabilisation of the region.
The area referred to is the Gulf region.
Gulf Region
There are many issues brewing in the Gulf region.
His Majesty the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques' call in Kuwait
It resonated with all attendees and the entire Arab world.
He spoke candidly about settling, surpassing and burying Arab disputes.
It's not just about opinions.
No is in politics and politics is about perspectives.
In the Arab world , it is considered that this
A Kind of War
While in the advanced world
You're talking about the same interest.
Now you have stayed for several years.
The current situation is the current situation.
See first.
There is a complete discrepancy between one subject and the other.
The idea that a small state can strike the big powers and make them feel weak in front of it
Any dispute or misunderstanding
It had its reasons.
And its causes came to an end.
The meeting concluded with the leaders' judgment.
Are there guarantees for the future relationship?
There are guarantees between the parties.
On the basis of the love, brotherhood and interest uniting the two countries.
The leaders' words are considered more than mere documents.
‏ Qatar and Saudi Arabia to enhance this relationship.
As we look forward to developing this Qatar-Saudi relationship even further.
For the better and there should be wide fields
This relationship is also reflected in Model B with other Arab States, namely the Gulf States.
As for Qatar, it's an important state.
Okay, Saudi Arabia is an important state.
Egypt is a whole different state of affairs for Qatar, especially now that you have reconciled with Saudi Arabia.
And three organizations: Hezbollah
Al Jazeera
or on the system in Egypt, the largest Arab country
First, let me start with the following beginning.
The Egyptian people
We respect the Egyptian nation.
and her interest in
Many Arab achievements and the sacrifices of the Egyptian people
And this is an issue.
Some think that this is an issue that could be an entry point for an understanding, or a lack thereof, with the Brothers in Egypt.
In the shadow of your saying that you respect Egypt and the Egyptian people, nevertheless;
And we believe Ahau is a good person.
Our dispute with Egypt revolves around two points.
Or a dot.
We prepared for the coup in Gaza and I don't think so.
And we do not enter.
On matters pertaining to other States
I do not believe in intervening in any country's affairs unless there is scope for reform.
Did you have any involvement in the coup carried out by Hamas against the authority in Gaza?
Of course, there was no 'us' in this at all. We only found out about it through the media, just like everyone else.
Yes, we have relations with Hamas and with all the parties.
What made Egypt differ or caused a dispute between you and them on this point?
This is where I'm coming to.
Hezbollah's Plot
Hezbollah's plot
But I'm talking about my country
This matter has surprised us greatly.
If it trembles in favour of Qatar.
The Pyramids of A.H.
She said the pyramids.
To harm Egypt and its stature
Can I respond?
It's clear we're dealing with a conspiracy, as they claimed.
Days will unveil this matter.
The beginning is not from the Gaza Conference.
And I absolve the Egyptian people of it, I absolve President Hosni Mubarak.
If we go back a long way to the MENA conference
Following the Madrid conference, Al-Mina remembers the one held in Doha.
This was an agreement made before the conference was held at our place.
They said we don't want to host the conference.
Oh, guys! We've learned that you have some coordination with Israel.
This is from Qatar
What we want to understand is why
We sat and talked, and the conversation was always pleasant.
It has two wings.
What are they?
In dispute.
<html> <head> <meta
If we're talking about the conference in Gaza, that took place
His Highness the Prince has spoken with all the presidents, including his brother, the Honorable President Hosni Mubarak.
We have heard from a foreign state
The Brothers in Egypt have a certain perspective on this subject; they think it's complicated.
And they kill people while we watch.
If you don't want to meet in Doha, we can hold it anywhere in the Arab League.
It's embarrassing that on the sidelines of the Kuwait conference I discuss the issue of
‏ Israel and the Western world are standing by and watching.
When we came and said okay, now this is happening, there's no power, no strength. We Arabs cannot stop it; no major power has stopped this fighting.
Egypt announces a request to halt the fighting in Gaza , followed by a cease-fire.
Even we.
We must not naively take the Arab street as it presents itself. Our dispute with the Brotherhood is only on one point.
And this is in accordance with international norms.
Their hospitals are insufficient in doctors who have stopped at the borders.
You stood at the borders.
There is and no one enters.
The brothers were very touchy about this issue.
The sensitivity arises from the fact that Gaza is adjacent to Egypt and is considered a part of the national estate.
When we speak of any human issue anywhere in the world, we speak of a human issue.
And we respect Egypt's sovereignty.
And we made our position clear, but this doesn't harm the Egyptian position.
We have high hopes for Egypt.
It is the largest Arab state.
And the one we believe can deliver our voice and the voices of others in the Arab world.
For all other parties
Even the rescue operation after the fall was sloppy.
The Europeans tried to save it in.
What Happened in Gaza from the Conference
Whether a donors' conference or whatever, I consider it a government-saving move.
We were not invited to a conference. We were invited to coordinate among the GCC countries.
We gathered in the Cooperation Council.
<strong>These amounts will not be disbursed to any party</strong>
It will be paid.
For the affected parties in Gaza.
Directly. And that was it.
Because access is forbidden from all directions
I am happy for Egypt and all the people of Qatar are happy for Egypt.
Egypt's victory in political matters is important to us.
But you are rushing ahead.
Just give me, just give me two minutes.
One of the ministers boasted of what had been saved.
Whoever dares compete with Egypt, we will cut off his arm!
And I believe this official has wronged his own country.
No, they didn't fail, and in truth they could only talk about themselves.
The one who helped them with this and that, I mentioned it to my brothers, the Saudis. The Saudis intervened because the King has wisdom in this matter.
The state of affairs in the Arab world
We agree.
The King decides that this is for the best.
We accept King Abdullah's decision because we respect and trust him.
But if one of them prevents (you), then it is a transgression even to revile the one who prevents (you).
As if they were students in a school
I think so.
Sharpness, its essence.
It is believed that Ahau should impose his strength.
We apologize about this matter.
If they think that a small state has no rights, then that right is forfeited.
You're sticking your nose into the Darfur issue
An Arab decision at the Arab League.
An African and a UN resolution
I think the main problem is
The Hezbollah plot was cleared by Qatar.
A plot, I don't know what about Qatar.
If it walked, it could spread the swine flu, starting an epidemic, from Qatar to the world.
Qatar is a peaceful nation that knows its size and capabilities.
But Qatar has its viewpoint.
Qatar has an independent political policy.
If Qatar can solve any Arab issue, we consider it an honor.
Because there is no Arab agreement
Any Arab dispute, we believe, weakens our position regarding our main issues, primarily Palestine, and the other issues we face.
The Arab world has become a receptor.
Even our analyses became the same as yours.
Western Analytics
While we know Shana, we know what happened in Pakistan.
Indeed, I wish someone would roll out the red carpet for me in Washington.
Does anyone blame Qatar?
Did Qatar harm any Arab state?
Tried to contribute financially.
These contributions are provocative.
What's possible is that I order you to say "Peace be upon you", and you reply to me: "You're greeting me, just to annoy me".
This is a second issue , so either you have a problem or you're missing something .
This is a matter that concerns you, not me.
Just in case you have an internal problem
Always tell him.
especially after the speech of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah
In Kuwait, I know this man is being sincere.
A man's word is his bond.
In his heart La la la This no no this talk I always say it
I always say this.
I always used to say, even at the height of our dispute with Saudi Arabia, I said this:
Refer back to all the documents you have in the island but.
The issue is different indeed.
From our side, we say no, we stop at this position.
We tried as much as we could.
I don't want to get into this subject.
I see their matters, I see their mistakes, where?
And we will see, our mistakes do not mean that all the things we have are correct.
This is His Excellency, Sheikh.
There are internal problems in Egypt.
They want to get out of it.
It denies any involvement in any conspiracy against Egypt abroad and severs its ties with Turkey and all other nations.
And God, we have extraordinary abilities.
And they're Mashallah seventy million, if we're able to do eighty.
They also have a problem that needs to be addressed.
You played a role in the Schalit Candie case, despite knowing that this file was very important to the Egyptian government.
I dealt with the French
We received a call from a friendly nation.
There's a Ben Shoufa case, we told our brothers this is with the Egyptians.
We want to see this subject upon request.
Israel and other states should see the other side's point of view on this issue.
When we saw this subject, we told them: "Guys, if it's the same conditions as those imposed on the brothers who are negotiating with the brothers in Egypt"
And this we declared means that there is an official who more or less implied that he was laughing at the entire Arab League.
Indeed, this means – poor guy.
How did he pull it off on us?
The President remains Mahmoud Abbas.
We support this.
Is he addressing his people? Is he addressing us? Is he addressing the Arab world?
The problem is on your end.
I think I think this is a healthy phenomenon
I am not the owner of the island, as I have been accused of.
The island must enter media competition like in the West where there are many media outlets.
There are many media outlets that portray adolescence as a time when everyone swears at each other.
But after a while, they reach the stage of maturity.
Can can can not
Firstly, we are with Saudi Arabia. Our situation is different.
And even if we conceded to Saudi, we accept this in Qatar.
Important relations
And Egypt is an important state , but there is a special nature to Saudi-Egyptian relations .
Also, in terms of population and area, Egypt is the largest Arab country among all Arab countries.
That's true. That's true, but with Saudi Arabia, it's a different story and a relationship with a long history.
It's a personal dispute between the officials here and there.
We respect His Excellency the President of Egypt.
I hope it will be confined to a difference of policies in viewpoints.
I told you it's a problem when the attack on Gaza happened.
The second problem is that they have an allergy to anything Qatar does or might do.
Why don't you try to arrange a meeting with the Egyptian President right now?
Saudi Arabia has intervened in this matter.
And as the newspapers leaked, they first said it was a secret meeting. Then we found out about it the following day.
I met with Omar Suleiman.
In Saudi Arabia
The irreversible flock
And I can't tell you we agreed on everything.
Let's say it so no one misinterpret s it as 'no, you compare yourselves.'
But dignity is dignity, be it of the lowly or the grand.
The Minister said Egypt would need to be adequately compensated.
Playtime among children
I don't think Egypt is bigger than this, I think he misspoke.
Do you have a vision for solving problems with Egypt or are you, like the Egyptian people, waiting for an intervention from the heavens?
This, this. Please, I don't want to talk about divine intervention or anything like that, because only God knows who will live and who will die.
And here I am, inviting you.
Make him think he's got style.
Our pride is in Egypt.
Sure, there must be a way out.
It's either with me or against me.
Any Arab citizen feels the pain.
In the Arab world we feel the pain, this is the policy of His Highness.
States derive their power from sources of power.
The US has sources of power, China has sources of power, France has sources of power, the small armed State of Qatar.
Oath by Allah.
What is obvious is that there isn't any.
That's all random talk. You guys are just chit-chatting.
But we are a small state , a very small state .
And I'll say it a hundred times.
So no one can say we have a sensitivity.
No one will confiscate them from us.
You are now tickling Israel.
But before I go to Israel
What is your vision for solving the problem with Egypt?
The problem is, they weren't the first.
And every day they file a complaint against America. As for the major powers you speak of,
And they deal with us out of self-interest, and we deal with them out of self-interest.
All complaints and all
To sabotage the relationship.
I think it detracts from any major nation doing so.
And it diminishes our Arab dignity to go and complain about each other.
Everything comes and everything we know.
Our vision is to be based on Arab interest.
And we're with them in everything.
Are there any upcoming steps to repair the relations?
But I know there are intimate ties between the President and His Highness the Emir.
If anyone has moved any matters.
Against the rapprochement of the two countries and the two peoples will find himself the loser, for in the end,
Yes, it could be tomorrow, or maybe in ten years. Honestly, I have no idea. From our side, whenever we're invited to a conference, we attend.
Anyone who invites us to a conference, we'll attend and share our point of view during the conference.
What we can is us
Because Egypt is our big sister in any subject. But we have our point of view and we discuss it.
This is all we need. Whenever the time is right, we'd be delighted.
It was cancelled due to this policy.
And as I mentioned, we respect the Egyptian people.
Of course, cancellation of a contract and addition of another one, you ask about the cancellation fees, I ask how many Egyptians have come to Qatar at the same time.
But the policy of our state is, as I told you, the Egyptian people are very dear to our hearts.
Now, on past June 4th, you tickled the emotions of Arab peoples with the closure of the Israeli office on June 4th, according to Arts.
Why do you say we tickled them? If we wanted to, we could have tickled them for twelve years straight.
As long as Shannon as long as everyone was against the peace with Israel and secret meetings were held between some Arab countries and Israel.
And after, after, after all that, most Arabs have reconciled.
Whether under the table or above the table, with Israel or speaking to it in any capacity.
If we wanted to tickle emotions, we could have done so at the previous Islamic conference.
At the United Nations, Nassir Abdel Nasser held a banquet at the residence of the Israeli Ambassador, Mrs. Bella A. Abzug (Belacecji).
Yes, he was one of many guests attending a dinner party hosted by the ambassador for an unknown occasion.
Because we sit next to Israel at the United Nations, no one can deny this issue.
We found a glimpse of hope in alleviating the distress of our brothers in Palestine.
Now the management has changed. Honestly, Egypt was never a big issue for me, but unfortunately,
I didn't grow up; you made me grow up.
My question is about the U.S. and the new administration, and how that affects the relationship between Qataris and the U.S., given the biggest U.S. military base in Qatar.
There is a disagreement in points of view.
Jade solves many cases in the region.
And if they are serious, we will help them to the utmost.
You expect a special relationship or a solution to the problems that have existed between you and the Bush administration.
Many of these issues have been solved.
The Amir of Qatar spoke yesterday in Paris about the events in Iran
Iran has distinctive relations with you despite its poor relations with the United States.
Firstly, it has to be placed within the realm of internal affairs, because we must respect every country's internal affairs.
Lebanon Post-Elections
Before the elections, Saad Hariri said in this program that the Doha Agreement ends with the holding of the elections.
Is this also your vision, or do you see the agreement standing, or will you pursue a new agreement?
The Doha Agreement was for a phase that would lead them to peaceful elections.
It's been a year and a half since the elections in Doha.
We keenly followed his daily, moment-by-moment progress until the elections were held, in accordance with the Doha agreement.
We recently intervened in one of the electoral districts to clarify some misunderstandings that had occurred.
But you still have a hand in arranging things in Lebanon
Always we are close to Lebanon. You know the Qataris love Lebanon and go there often.
I'm the first country you're visiting after Lebanon, a Western country.
A quick question about what's happening in Yemen.
You intervened in the Houthi issue and there are accusations that you supported the Houthis.
or your intervention At least put them in a delicate situation with the state Now there is a greater danger, the danger from the South
And we have suffered what we have suffered. Why don't you stop here, the same soul, and why do you stop here in Qatar?
Indeed, we faced many pressures regarding this issue. However, this was our vision, and H.H. the Prince's stance on the matter remains firm.
The Houthis
And its stability has a positive impact on us, while its instability affects us negatively.
We mediated between the two parties impartially.
We signed a contract.
But I understand that if this is to be exploited for other reasons
And I'll be with them over there. We always stood with them in every single topic.
It is not true.
I see that we don't need to
We sell them.
And I say this without apologising, even though I know many Arab fans will be against me.
I also thank you, our esteemed viewers, for your kind attention. We hope we have elucidated some of Qatar's foreign policy for you.
In conclusion, the program team sends its greetings to you. This is Ahmed Mansour bidding you farewell, Unfiltered.
Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you.
Dear viewers, As-Salamu Alaykum. Welcome to this special interview.
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, Prime Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State of Qatar
Of course, why do I say this is a special and exceptional interview?
Qatar and this man in particular was the main sponsor
Sir, a simple and straightforward question.
I think it happened because there was initial Arab consensus.
We tried that when we went to the UN.
Arab consensus was important, and so was Lebanese determination from both sides.
On reaching results.
It is very important that the external interference
Many opinions or suggestions from outside
Lebanese International Arabic If you like, you can say
But it went through phases.
There's nothing but what leads to something else, which means these stages did exist.
Does complexity mean Lebanon?
For a while now.
When you now gathered and directly intervened in the Lebanese arena and the Lebanese file
Have you found that the Lebanese knot is a major issue?
Lebanese Arabic Regional International Needing extensive code breaking
It's a very tiny and simple contract, but it has been blown out of proportion due to external interference.
Because we know Lebanon is a beacon of journalism, a beacon of culture, a beacon of tourism, a beacon of many things.
Lebanese must not allow
It affects security and peace in Lebanon.
Problem Number One
External reverberations in Lebanon
You decided suddenly, like after twenty-four hours, to take everyone on one plane.
From the plane directly to meet the Amir of Qatar.
They didn't even expect it, which means they couldn't relax for a single minute unless you were doing them a favor.
It's all about keeping them on their toes and making them think.
They make many connections. The secret was
We suggest moving them to Doha, as we need a different atmosphere.
They will gather them in many various difficulties.
In many circumstances
So we brought them out of those circumstances into the circumstances that you're coming to solve.
If we want to succeed, we must transfer them out of this environment.
And quickly
Indeed, may Allah aid us in the path of the Beirut Statement or the Venetian Declaration.
Then they agreed to go to Doha.
The two parties decided to go to Doha.
Some believe that, for example, Qatar is biased towards one side against another.
And from Beirut but...
That His Highness the Amir meant that we are intermediaries.
In this process
Honestly, the State of Sheikh.
Have you seriously consulted?
With the two main concerned parties, at least here in Lebanon, which are the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Syria.
Especially the brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. I spoke with Prince Saud.
He showed his support for the idea.
We benefited from Prince Saud in that we
Everyone wanted a solution.
His justifications are weak.
If he goes, I'll go to my mind.
His justifications are weak.
It should have been removed because there's a lot of tension in Palestine.
The Iranian Nuclear Issue
The Arab League must have a mechanism for resolving issues.
The African Union is better than us at solving issues.
He's trying to gather his wits.
He holds conferences to solve the Fleish Arab's puzzles, which have gathered the cream of the crop for years.
to gather the Arabs or bring together the parties if there are any, and to intervene to support the oppressed.
It must be studied.
If we want the Arab University to be awake, not the University of the Arab World.
With the Arabic execution tool.
One of the officials here was the Speaker Nabih Berri.
**Sin Sin** requires:
Now it appears that the Lebanese have reached an agreement.
And Allah, look, I mean, we
The first is Qatar
It has never led to a result.
The Arab Interest
It is a force to be reckoned with for the Arabs.
We tried it on various things.
At the UN, when we went with the Doha Agreement.
The agenda should be about solving the issue, not any other.
There is no doubt that
The most important role they have in the Arab World in general
In a situation
We agreed to discontinue it.
Come and help us.
Because this is a serious matter this is a serious matter but
Why have we reached the point where everyone is playing in our sandbox?
In our courtyard
It is very important that we put the interests of our peoples and our people first.
Now we need an Arab summit after this agreement to see what we will do among the Palestinian brethren.
What shall we do in Somalia?
What shall we do about Somalia as an Arab League member?
Why isn't the Sudan a member of the Arab League and why isn't Iraq a member of the Arab League?
We are part of the Arab World, a small part of the Arab World.
We hope this is not just a suggestion, this is an idea.
Can Qatar have good relations with both Syria and Saudi Arabia?
I think that we firstly, if asked to do something, we do our best.
But I am certain that His Majesty King Abdullah
King of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
And his brother, President Bashar
As historically, Saudi Arabia and Syria were in an agreement.
A temporary phase.
We will find mom, inshallah.
Yet, I insist on asking, if you please, could you play a role in this aspect?
Even if it's not public, you now have gained some trust.
We strive for any rapprochement between Arab states.
This is His Highness's policy from the outset, but this subject means ...
Is what happened in Lebanon an indication that the region is heading towards serious settlements?
What happened in Lebanon is a local Lebanese affair. Regional matters remain.
Not too attached to this situation.
I wish it were not so. I wish this were not the case.
A new beginning in the Arab world, that's a wish.
We can create.
It will happen somewhere else.
In other words, does the Sheikh's state fear that the recent escalation will
At least from here until the end of George Bush's presidency.
There is no doubt that I still have concerns about Palestine, I mean Gaza.
That means, out of all of us, I want to ask.
We want nothing else.
He orders me to take care of the humanitarian side in Palestine.
We can deliver medicine to them.
And food
Electricity for the patient in the hospital
The one who dies if the electricity cuts off
I wish
As the Arab League, we agree on the amount allocated for this subject of medication and food. We shall refer to it as medication and food.
No, we don't want the Red Crescent to get it to him.
The Red Cross must deliver it.
But sorry, the Arab side is committed to this Israeli blockade.
I don't want to delve into the details of this subject; I'm only saying that, as Arabs, we must get the medicine and supplies through, even if we disagree with Hamas.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has made great efforts and pledged to continue doing so for the sake of the Noble Kaaba.
Because this dispute can only benefit the other party.
Do not deal with this party because we will accomplish a solution for you. This statement is untrue.
And I
So far, there are no signs of a solution ahead.
Do you fear a US-Iran confrontation in the near future or invite it?
This is Ward Ward of course.
At least speak about the State of Qatar
Iran is an important neighbor.
We may not agree on all their policies or they may not agree on every policy of their country.
They say to us, for example: "We do not want your connections or communications with Israel."
Some might consider you to be necessarily party to the American rules over there.
This issue, we know how to deal with it.
There are some who say that after the visit of the Emir of Qatar to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
It's as if he met, consulted, or talked with the Saudi family.
The text is a sentence which has been written in Arabic. Its English translation is: In Istanbul from Syrian-Israeli negotiations
It was just a stroke of luck.
The K.K. was eager to find a solution and I was in contact with Prince Saud.
What happened in the last hours
Change of tactics in the negotiations.
‏Is it from yourselves or from the parties?
We are responsible for this.
And from you from all sides and we locked the room on ourselves.
And in the end, His Highness the Amir's intervention was significant.
And henceforth the invention traveled
The unnamed one, if left unmentioned now, has perished.
And his message was clear when he said: "We know our size, our location, and our role, etc."
He wanted to play the role of a mediator without antagonizing any other party.
Whether Arabic, regional or international.
But nevertheless
It became his responsibility.
Did you want it or not.
‏ Some of that jealousy, some of that "us versus them" mentality, we want to avoid, because as a state, we have to.
These states
You can work or
I think this is the most comfortable combination so far.
‏Perhaps one last or second-to-last question: What is the nature of your current relationship with Washington? Is it cool, extended, outstanding?
Our relationship with Washington is good. Let me put it that way.
There are different points of view on the issues.
But this is our right. And if they speak of democracy, this is it.
How good, I mean, how would you translate it to "good" relations with them on the ground?
If you're talking about the economy, she's excellent. If you're talking about education, she's excellent.
If you're talking about health, and if you're talking about politics, then I can tell you that it's doing well.
In your clear opinion during the upcoming phase.
I think we should leave the topic of confronting Israel alone.
And if we wanted to stop the play in the Arab arena.
We reconcile the Palestinians.
We agree on a opinion so we can be a respectable power
I don't think we do.
We should be something effective.
Thank you very much for watching. Join us again, hopefully, in another edition of the show. My best regards to you all.
Welcome our viewers to this interview with the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani.
In this dialogue
We try to anticipate the Arab political reality and Arab efforts
Sa'adah Sheikh Welcome!
To research what's happening in Gaza
And I hope that through this dialogue we will be able to
Let's shed light on some of your questions.
Israeli entry into Gaza by land
Our goal was to have an Arab stance.
Her dealings with friendly nations
and the brotherly countries
And how to attempt to find a clear, strong Arab position that Arab states are united behind.
And then we find areas for reconciliation.
We acknowledge that several Arab states have violated
arbitrarily
And no one was punished.
We are held accountable for every single thing, whether intentionally or unintentionally.
We are the specialists
The only ones we always target
We always discipline in style.
I think so.
To the extent that we will not be able to
We meet at the leaders' level.
To stop his rampage, we had to discipline him.
We did not want to create a rift in the Arab world.
And there were five other verbal confirmations.
By a two-thirds majority
but the purpose of the meeting is
We hope it's accurate and that our perspective is mistaken, because the goal is
Solving the problem right now isn't our goal.
But will it be washed away in the blood of Palestinians?
What we have requested now is the ministerial, which does not cancel Qatar's request.
His Highness also affirmed
In his speech he said we are not insisting it has to be in Qatar. We are not insisting it has to be in Qatar. The summit can be wherever.
An Arab stance that makes others respect us
Yes, as for the ministerial.
So we want to tell them that the UN Security Council resolution has been issued.
And Israel.
She was not bothered by the resolution and continues to kill and shell Gaza.
And we need to ask the Arabs: What are we to do?
What shall we do?
Is there an aftermath for Israel?
The rest of the UN Security Council resolution shall be implemented.
There must be a stance now that Israel has not ceased
Shooting to not force our brothers
‏ Resolution considering that Fat.
For several days now
We will speak about the Ministerial Meeting.
You ultimately support this proposal.
We support an Arab Summit, of course. This is our idea, and it is also the idea of several other Arab states: Syria and Yemen.
There's already a crack in the Arab world.
And he brought us all to the camp of moderation.
And the Camp of Imbalance.
And excessiveness
The one who bewitched the West.
The moderate Arabs, those they call moderate, and the non-moderate Arabs
We find that there are moderate nations and immoderate nations.
And then we want to know what is moderation and immoderation. Is moderation walking in Israel's plans?
And to bring the issue to an embarrassing end.
Or maybe we just need to keep the issue alive.
This is an important question.
The topic is whether or not Nations
Proceeds according to Israel's plans and wants to solve issues in a peaceful way.
I don't say it's acting according to Israel's plans, and I don't want to accuse anyone.
But I say
The "Moderation Camp".
What is moderation in the eyes of the West?
Do we agree to slaughter a certain category of Palestinians?
Of course there were elections.
I'm not pro-Hamas or anti-Hamas, I'm stating a fact.
The reality is that there is a
An idea.
Some call it the Ridiculous Movement.
But we must ask ourselves what this radical movement is demanding.
She's demanding her rights
Are we separating them?
And we create other blocks too.
Against because we are.
Internal Arabic Intellectual
And this started to happen.
Therefore, we do not want to fight a war on behalf of others.
Yes, Your Excellency, the Sheikh.
Who prevented the Arab Summit from taking place?
I can't say it's forbidden because there are testimonies and everyone knows what's up.
The topic of the ban.
But the , as I mentioned, we could have.
We take a vote and get a two-thirds majority.
But that was not the goal, because it's not so much a matter of challenge as one of dire need. We believe that we
The non-urgent believe it to be an unnecessary requirement.
Okay, we went to the Security Council.
or in a UN Security Council resolution
But the decision is the Security Council's. Israel says it will complete and then consider.
I just want to focus again.
We're not seeing the decision being enforced on the weaker party.
What would it differ from the first meeting?
‏The subject of disagreements usually leads to disputes and differences of opinion.
As important as it is
Are we ready to have a clear Arab position?
Humanitarian aid
From the we openly support our brothers.
Also tell the Israeli side's representative, Eyal
This assumes we should discuss it, but I don't think everyone is ready.
Why don't we freeze the Arab Initiative?
The forty eight , we committed . We committed to the truce in forty eight , the Israelis didn't .
It's natural for arguments to happen in meetings, but the truth is, those arguments
It expresses positions that reflect the feelings in the souls of certain people.
One of the arguments she heard about was
There are some who describe Hamas's movement as a band of rogues.
And not even the minority
This incident occurred and we responded to it along with a brother Minister.
And I think this means what the West is saying.
These are radical movements . These are factions , one person says these are like so .
We don't want to be the men of others.
So it always means and I don't mean anyone in particular.
Any foreigners who
A Western state or Western states you'll find
Among the Arabs
Yes Okay The sheikh's happiness now
Invitation to a Second Ministerial Meeting
The supposed schedule has only one item on the agenda.
Where are you Arabs from all this? What is the position of the three hundred nations? And what not?
A million Israeli softs
Issued pursuant to Resolution 1860
The resolution that has been issued.
Israel has not implemented it yet, the mission is not accomplished.
There is no doubt that the Arab delegation has exerted effort.
This decision is much appreciated.
We demand Chapter VII because Israel is above the law, which means Israel.
And if they are asked, they say: "We understand."
It's not the Arabs' fault if they
If if it is Israel does not question.
She is above international law.
This is the reality.
Why did you go to the Security Council? Why did you link the convening of an Arab Summit to what the Security Council will issue?
At the summit, the Security Council will seek us out.
He needs to make a tough decision.
To the decision.
A responsible official has lost his post.
We are the West, our fear.
And we are among those who testify that after they decide on something, for example,
I don't want to be involved.
Those who carried out this attack on the reconstruction of Iraq will have to pay for it themselves, as they were the ones who destroyed it in the first place.
Let's not ask the Iraqi government or the people who have died.
There are no compensations.
Exactly the same in Sudan, as soon as they started talking about trying Al-Bashir.
His Eminence the Sheikh.
His Eminence the Sheikh.
A major Arab diplomatic victory in the Security Council
It was a difficult discussion in the Security Council, as initially there was talk of a Presidential Statement.
The consequences
Israel has not complied with it.
You will commit in two days, then a week later, after you finish the task.
Because they did not comply with the resolution.
Apologies, people should adhere to the rules.
Because Israel accepts after the mission is accomplished.
You have an alternative to this decision now.
All that we have done
Some of the brothers unfortunately carried out their own initiatives.
The Gaza Siege was a joint effort.
I am a friend of the West and I don't mind us having ties with the West. I'm not.
Not against the West, nor against America
But they speak the language of interests.
Your friends if you're strong
Or if you have an opinion
In the end, our perspective is taken into account by one percent and we are told we have won.
What is victory?
What it entails.
I cannot comment on any reservations right now as the decision has not
And the council is its own master.
You participated in the formulations.
We have indeed participated in the formulations to some extent. Yes, we have participated.
But you didn't call for a meeting of Arab Ministers with the U.S. Secretary of State.
But I'm sure the brothers who went to Iqfon will keep us posted.
I pointed out certain Arab parties' interests.
In this field lies the happiness of Sheikh.
For the past two years up until this moment
See, I don't want to talk about accusations.
I can claim that we have looked into everything.
Are they people?
The Israeli refusal met international refusal, and we also contributed to this rejection.
And hence the dispute began, and the siege commenced.
And Israel last month killed twenty-eight Palestinians during the ceasefire.
And we prefer to starve them until they are exhausted, because we do not want them to rule.
Those those parties are Sheikh Sa'adah.
It clearly states that the dispute is a Palestinian-Palestinian one.
If there were
Who created the Palestinian conflict? Maybe there was a Palestinian–Palestinian conflict.
I agree with you one hundred percent.
I don't say Hamas is one hundred percent right.
I neither assert nor say that.
But May, the broker, usually positions herself as a broker equally distant from all.
I don't just mean the mediator. I mean us Arabs, we should be equally distant from everyone.
We don't want it to exist, so we must end it by any means necessary.
Once trained the right and left forces.
And they were put under siege, with no money or salaries given to them.
And once we create a positive model in the West Bank
Let the people in Gaza see how people are living
A lavish life
In contrast, things are very different in Gaza.
You have called for a second Arab Ministerial Meeting.
Talks are still ongoing through Turkish mediation.
This meeting you called for seems like an attempt to circumvent.
Initiating a new detour.
We have no initiatives.
On this topic
Because Egypt is an important Arab state.
It is required of her to play a role and we support any Egyptian effort that leads to an understanding.
But it is important
We don't come.
Tomorrow he will act as if he has won over a party.
​And the path to concord.
A considered Egyptian initiative
Among the international requirements, Arab requirements, and humanitarian needs.
And Egypt's requirements, as stated below, are a crucial role.
It's an Arabic leading nation that we respect and appreciate.
This is what is required in Egypt.
The current proactive proposals do not meet those requirements, His Excellency the Sheikh.
I have an idea about the **initiative**.
We hear information about it from here and there.
I can't comment on anything I don't know.
With all due respect to the government or the Palestinian Presidency, it must be present and we all recognize the Palestinian Presidency.
But also people
Those affected on one side must have their perspective considered.
For this mediation to succeed.
By the way, taking the view.
Hamas's position was clear: this decision was made without consulting us. How could it be issued?
A decision in which Arabs participate in drafting, without them contacting or taking the opinion of the main concerned party.
We only mean that we deal with the State of Palestine as a state.
We deal with it as a K K K one-sided affair.
But now there is a schism with one party in one place and the other party at the other end.
This does not mean that if we deal with the people of Gaza, we neglect our dealings with the group in the West Bank or the Palestinian Presidency.
We deal with the Palestinians as one people and one government.
If they request anyone from Gaza, let them have him.
And now we are starting to coordinate together.
What has been announced has been announced.
Firstly, the decision did not say it welcomed the Egyptian initiative or any other initiatives.
Some saw it as a mechanism.
This is an interpretation But as I understand the decision from my readings, it welcomes the Egyptian initiative.
We hope that the Egyptian initiative succeeds in achieving its goal.
The fighting comes to a halt.
I do not doubt our brothers in Egypt.
Because Israel did not accept the UN Security Council resolution.
And you consider this decision as if it never existed since Israel didn't acknowledge it.
Even if you eventually accept it, things would have changed on the ground.
Yes, His Excellency the Sheikh is talking about Egyptian efforts.
Efforts to which Turkey also contributes concurrently.
On Arab impotence
As for Arab disputes that cannot reach a settlement, it has come to occupy a place
It was supposed to be occupied by Arab parties
I welcome Turkey's position.
A stance that ought to be appreciated by the Arab and Muslim worlds.
Turkey is an Islamic country.
And so this natural role.
And the people must follow me.
There is no Arab consensus on dealing with the situation.
One says let them finish the job.
There needs to be a clear Arab position against this aggression, against its continuation, and against procrastination.
To be in an Arab confrontation position
Israel has the ability to strike fear in the region. I'm not talking about an Arab–Israeli war, we are among the people who always advocate for peace.
Not us either. We're not a state, so we'd love to live in safety.
But I do not ask for an Arab war. I ask for a stance.
Clear Arabic
With regard to initiatives and proposals, of course you follow what is going on.
The proposals and conditions put forth by Hamas
Do you think?
As an on-the-ground observer
The politician that the military operation has produced now allows Hamas to impose its terms.
It has to be correct.
These we agree with you on. This point we do not agree with you on.
The second thing
They're not here now, they're negotiating. I know nothing about this negotiation, as I told you.
The second thing
Okay in the required situations, Arabs are kind.
This Arab reality
What we witnessed following the commencement of those operations.
No doubt the Arab street's position is far more advanced than
About us as governments
Of course, it saddens me that some describe this wonderful, wonderful, people's gift as a 'hype'.
They once told me about this topic.
Embody the views of our peoples
Presidents now
‏If they wish.
At least they'll see what
Of course, there's a high ceiling and a humble ceiling.
Stop normalizing, stop diplomatic relations with Israel.
Qatar Airways
The Israeli Representation Office in Doha is closed.
Qatar, which takes this position.
The Arab side must be radical and take drastic stances.
Anything the Arabs agree on, we agree on collectively.
Let's start, if there's an Arab agreement
The treaty is one thing, relations are something else.
We are ready.
We walk with our Arab brothers.
Just let there be an Arab decision and credibility.
And they deal with others, not just countries with which they have relations.
Even the countries which have no relations.
Very important
We will not be anyone's clients.
He says, "Why can't Qatar be a role model in this field?"
If this is the only template we're ready to be in it.
But we also want
An Arab model Qatar is committed to part of its Arab commitment
For example
And no one goes to sell anyone the border.
Our problem is the lack of trust between Arab states.
And I don't want to say unfortunately our secret is brokers.
And it is very important indeed.
Official invitation anywhere, as we must rise above this.
Some recalled their ambassadors, others lodged protests, and others still expelled the ambassador, as Switzerland did.
This is part of the dispute.
But some of them summoned the ambassador, and those who summoned the ambassador summoned the permanent five member states, and all of this is just a big show for our peoples.
We talked about the humble ceiling of popular demand.
Some demand that the ceiling be opened. Some demand that Syria open a front against Israel.
See, I told you we call for peace, not for fighting with Israel.
We do not seek to fight Israel
To engage in combat with Israel.
And how will we agree?
It's not a problem either.
The one who made us talk to each other, made us overcome our differences.
I was fascinated by what His Eminence the Sheikh said.
The condition is that nations shall not sell each other.
What do you mean?
It means "now" or "at the moment".
The street won't have mercy on us.
His Eminence the Sheikh.
Is what's happening today a continuation of a project that began in 2006 with the war on Lebanon?
Do you consider there to be a difference?
I don't think there's a discrepancy between the goals.
Lebanon's lands were liberated
The remaining parts are supposedly to be a deposit with the United Nations.
or the like
Lebanon means we have dealt with the Lebanese issue to a large extent
Israel definitely needs weak neighboring states.
So that even Tact will reign, though she has the upper hand.
And of course, there are foreign powers supporting it.
And she therefore wants to remain the sole force in the area.
And now they want it.
They change this example in Gaza.
In Lebanon you talk to how many sects?
How many directions?
While Lebanon sleeps, Palestine speaks of one cause.
But I assure you that the Palestinians' problem is that they listened too much to the Arabs and foreigners.
Two sides . That's how the void became , with each thinking they could dominate the other .
In your opinion, K K K is an observer and follower.
As planned, it ends with a broken bone.
Do we Arabs accept this? This example could be repeated for those who are stubborn.
He says his opinion.
For Israelis and others alike in the future.
And we struck an example.
Highest in obedience and help in breaking bones
Me and my first cousin are on the same side against outsiders, and my brother and I are united against our first cousins.
We assume any dispute with Hamas now, and I do not say that Hamas or anyone else is infallible, or the Authority.
They all have mistakes.
Now we must not let this matter drop.
To bow down the party.
Because here failure is not the failure of the category
His Excellency the Sheikh of Qatar has for some time been proposing initiatives.
The settlement initiatives took place in Lebanon.
It happened in Darfur. We'll briefly touch on this subject shortly.
We are
We don't want to impose on our brothers, as there's sometimes sensitivity about it.
From e state takes such initiatives, we have no objection, as long as the matter is resolved.
It's not our goal to put Qatar on the top headline
That His Highness's objectives were not
These were his objectives: to stem this bleeding.
And we will put a stop to this bullying.
What happened is beyond imagination.
We are in Qatar
Do we know something they don't know? I don't think so.
But the most important thing is that we have the intention.
Sincere in reaching a honorable solution
Talking about initiatives is useful to know where the initiative stands regarding the Darfur issue. The Justice and Equality Movement's solution is .
The Sudanese government in Khartoum
and he will be the one to solve the Darfur issue, because the Darfur problem is his beginning.
Arabs helped
But the issue I'm addressing has reached an international level.
Based on the revenge we took on the system, we now want the matter to be resolved, but we don't know how.
And we always aspire, as I mentioned at the beginning, to implement the decisions. We are the best at implementing decisions.
Taking the issue out of the competition context, is there also competition regarding Darfur?
I don't want to delve into this subject.
Before we conclude this conversation, Your Excellency the Sheikh, there is an economic summit coming up.
Will the summit take place? Will you be attending the summit?
No, we will boycott the summit.
It will be held . We wish it could be in a different atmosphere than the Arab one, but it's scheduled.
It's a flaw.
Okay, if the Arab leaders attended this summit
When Palestinians' blood was being spilled in Gaza, they were listening to financial and economic reasons.
We help fuel the fire.
But it seems no one fears this street
What you know about circumstances, of course, we all hope that safety is upon us.
It will be safe.
But it means no one takes anyone in their little pocket.
The President of the Government, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Qatar, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al Thani, I thank you very much.
Dear viewers, wherever you are, peace be upon you.
What is the point of this celebration and how sincere are the statements of the High Commissioner for Human Rights?
People with disabilities are the most neglected group in the world.
What about our Arab region and its interest in this issue?
We put these questions and more to our guest for today's episode.
The former UN Special Rapporteur on disability.
She holds a BA in Social Service and Sociology from Qatar University.
And a Master's in Social Planning and Social Policy from Helwan University, Egypt.
She has held many positions in the disability sector.
One of its founding members and General Coordinator of the National Committee for Persons with Disabilities
Two thousand and ninety-eight
and Vice-Chairperson of the National Committee for Persons with Disabilities since 1999
Up to two thousand and three
I also contributed to the establishment of the Shafaq Center for People with Disabilities.
**Support for People with Disabilities in Qatar**
Our guest has overseen the launch of numerous programs, projects, and media campaigns.
Activities for People with Disabilities in the Arab World
I also gave lectures and participated in meetings, conferences and forums.
Welcome to the show, Lady Hessa.
The term used is people with disabilities.
In the beginnings, we used the term "disabled" in the 1980s and earlier.
More educationally inclined
They fall within those to whom that education is offered.
In ninety‑three, an important document appeared at the U.N.
Speaking of this term, before we delve into the details...
As for the remaining regions, although some are not classified as developing, they are classified as poor.
And Latin America, especially Latin America, where this trend is perhaps stronger than anywhere else.
But the statistics prove otherwise.
The trend towards a legal approach exists in many Arab countries.
The resources could be available and the political will could exist.
Okay, here let me tell you some statistics, which you probably already know.
Eighty per cent of them come from poor countries
UNESCO states that about ninety per cent of disabled children in poor countries do not attend school.
Ms. Hessa, how do you comment on these statistics?
It's really real to a large extent.
I first saw it in Darfur, in Gaza and in other areas subjected to such events as wars and conflicts.
There, you won't differentiate between a person with disabilities or not; the numbers are vast.
Separating children, the illiteracy rate among females is approximately 53% or 52%.
And in other countries
There are many obstacles that prevent these children from accessing schools, even if they do not have a disability.
The city originally had no infrastructure at all; even if that school were to be found, this child wouldn't have access to it.
He can reach her.
For the children and other inhabitants.
Such projects and agendas are great in theory, but we rarely hear of them in practice.
Only when we talk about the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, which the world celebrated a few days ago, what is the point of this celebration?
The situation in the world
The best placed people are those who have no disability whatsoever.
There are organizations that have arrived and established numerous projects.
He's implementing a very critical strategy for health.
Through this strategy
There is an overlap between human rights and work with specific marginalized groups such as persons with disabilities.
At a degree of consciousness now in the Arab world the best.
At the point of consciousness we pause to receive transmissions and continue our dialogue.
Thank you.
I have two questions I would like to ask, as I am a former UN official.
The second point is what?
UN laws calling for the fight against regimes that hinder the child's community integration, like the Syrian intelligence system.
Is there a law that allows me to file a lawsuit against the regime, as many have done in Syria?
Yes, Suleiman. Your idea is clear. We have Suleiman Krow with us, calling in from Syria. Thank you very much. We also have Naif Al-Saif joining us from Kuwait. Please go ahead, Naif.
Peace be upon you, and the mercy of Allah, and His blessings.
And peace be upon you.
Good evening
Good evening. Please come in.
Please allow me, I am a person with an intellectual disability.
That's right, my friend. The desert dweller understands signs.
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, Praise be to Allah, Who gave us speech and gave speech to all things.
It means I've spent more than thirty years maybe only speaking one or two words a day.
All praise be to Allah, He made me speak.
It means he's speaking in Gran, so I understood nothing.
It means they're attacking me for using the Quran, calling me a hypocrite and implying I'm talking about certain people.
They slander me and target me, yet they reside in the lowest depths of the Fire.
I only got defamed
And they do not steal the sight.
He who lives in a glass house should not throw stones.
And, of course, psychological disabilities
It falls within this definition. The question is: What about Brother Suleiman's query?
‏ UN programs or its reactions regarding the causes of disabilities, such as political objectives or others
Reach out to various organizations and agencies
To discuss with her, convince her, and find out.
Disability themes and issues are on its agenda.
UNESCO is an international organization, and so is UNICEF. The fact is, these organizations deal with disabilities.
It's a program that tries not to neglect children with disabilities.
**Opportunities** and **schools**
<em>In various environmental aspects and</em>
Also UNICEF.
But there are shortcomings, and we must admit that there are shortcomings in the UN's position as well.
The most prominent weaknesses and shortcomings you mentioned, what are they?
For the United Nations.
The issue of routine and bureaucracy
Directly, I was present in my country in the State of Qatar.
But it had routine and bureaucracy hindering it.
My work in particular has sometimes shown me the constraints or limitations, too.
People with disabilities struggle for recognition.
Until it reached a satisfactory point , the movement did not put it in a separate article as the Global Disability Movement wanted .
But it occupied a somewhat suitable part.
Unfortunately, there is no coordination among them.
This is one of the most significant drawbacks for her.
The survey conducted by the Special Rapporteur and applied to States
As part of the staff or as part of the employees in those programs.
Unfortunately, we have received only three responses out of forty-eight organizations and agencies. We got only three replies.
Don't put.
The issue of disability is a permanent, stable and continuous one for many long years, and it is first and foremost a human rights issue.
Lately, yes, thank God. For two or three years now.
The issue of disability has at least been raised through events such as seminars and others.
As-salamu alaykum
Dear Madam, Why are there no mandatory laws and decisions for Arab countries? Who is responsible for implementing these international laws?
As for Arab countries and the allocation of salaries, for example, allocating a salary for the disabled.
Is there money allocated from the UN?
Do these funds go to governments or to UN offices? Do these aids really reach the disabled?
and finally, it is observed that there were no binding decisions for Arab States.
Thank you very much, Ahmed Halabi, for joining us from Greece.
With us is Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia. Go ahead, Ibrahim.
Peace be upon you.
And peace be upon you.
By adopting this proposal
It is to write directly to the UN Secretary-General.

We're back with our guest to answer your questions.
He says that doctors have advised him to have an operation, but...
It costs a lot and he can't afford it. Where can he turn?
He is from Algeria.
I think it's important to fulfill Najeeb's needs.
As with any other rights, the rights of persons with disabilities.
All these rights are due and must be granted to this citizen.
To join the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities This is a legally binding and enforcing convention
Satisfying people's rights and needs within their national scope.
or even at the level of non-governmental organizations
Binding on all States, with oversight to ensure compliance.
At least at the primary official level, there has to be awareness.
So at least if we work on these covenants in this manner,
Even if there were no great obligation
There has been a response to the monitoring reports you have been conducting. And yes, there has been interest shown.
But don't forget that the standard rules are a morally binding document, not legally.
to be binding and ratified
And we understand that these issues will be resolved, discussed or raised within a community context fraught with many problems and issues.
Najy Zakkarni, Director of the Qatar Center for the Deaf, is a sign language expert at Al Jazeera.
At the outset, سيد Ali would like to extend his heartfelt gratitude to Al Jazeera.
‏The person who has kindly just broadcast this special episode
Now Ali is speaking and he says: "I am very proud."
She was a caregiver to all the special needs people in her community and still is.
We support and stand by her side always and forever.
I also say that there are many with special needs.
There are some who don't know about this agreement because there haven't been any training sessions.
Regarding them, especially if they are in schools, hospitals or public and private institutions.
It is imperative that this agreement be published.
It's as if there's a law that caters to the special needs of people in every country in the world.
This emphasizes the need for States to undertake
By adopting and signing this Convention
Some countries, like Qatar, have also signed this document with the aim of serving those with special needs and helping us.
Thank you very much, my fellow Naji Zakarna. You spoke on behalf of Ali.
Thank you both very much.
Your opinion could make a difference.
The former UN Special Rapporteur on Disability Perhaps we could start with the proposal submitted by a caller, Ibrahim Abdullah from Saudi Arabia.
On the establishment of a Support Fund
It is a donation fund and accepts any contributions from countries.
This box is supposed to finance the activities the Special Rapporteur undertakes when performing his/her duties.
And even among the Arab states, only Syria has donated.
Therefore, honouring those commitments is a problem that exists within the United Nations.
The box over there
Unfortunately, there is a lack of commitment on the part of member states and a lack of interest.
Many sadly say with all boldness: "We don't care about the circumstances."
It is a matter of commitments.
Human Rights
Humanity in its broadest sense
Especially the marginalized
But that's why such covenants exist.
Indeed, these countries must uphold their commitments. The idea initiated by my brother is a good one.
It is imperative that there not only be an independent MTF but also existing organizations in the area.
From what she has in balances.
Applications for Disability Projects in Gaza
Assistances for People with Disabilities
It's always a tangled issue, with politics intervening.
His state or government has greatly sponsored him.
The number has sadly shrunk.
For nominal amounts

Good evening to you, and good evening to Her Highness Sheikh's daughter Khalifa.
I'd like to convey a message of gratitude and appreciation to her.
In the past years
Wishes from the families of the special needs community
In Sheikh Hessa's continuous support of them,
Standard Bearer of the Sharif of Tunisia, welcome!
There is another level, the genetic one.
I believe that genetic level care reduces the ratio of the handicapped.
There is in our Arab customs a tradition for a son to marry his father's brother's daughter or his mother's brother's daughter, and so on.
This means at this level . Thank you .
The comment reflects what has been said in the viewers' communications.
The truth is, as you said, at the national level.
I know there are advisory and supportive programs
Is located within the Health Services.
Which is also under the umbrella of Hamad Medical Corporation.
Within the psychiatric clinic, I also believe in the programs of the Supreme Council for Education.
Special Education Department. I'm not really sure if it still exists.
But it is definitely within the health services. Yes, there is support and medical care.
And it rehabilitates these cases.
Prevention is better than cure, and he pointed to the genetic factor. Marriage between relatives, is there a genetic predisposition? Are there any awareness campaigns?
For instance, for awareness.
In this field
Sure, this is a very important and serious point.
And it is one of the things that I and others have touched upon in many speeches and posts.
Yes, there are awareness campaigns not only aimed at
Implemented by the World Health Organization
Also for UNICEF
Now in many Arab states, Qatar included
And Tunisia is confirmed.
There are now mandatory decisions for early screening.
Which has been implemented in many countries
All of this on the preventative side
Do such campaigns receive a response?
Positivity, especially as it contradicts customs and traditions.
Of course, that's the problem: it collides with societal culture.
It is the determination to have strategies and the will to address and engage.
The issue of early examination for instance is a very important matter pre-marriage.
I ask you about whether there are any statistics regarding the disabled.
Especially for the disabled in the Arab region
Measure on the Arab region as 'b' meaning that
especially
With the recent events in the area.
In regions, hotspots of conflict Wars, conflicts and other hostilities
For every dead person, three disabled persons.
Events in Lebanon in Darfur in many areas
No never not enough first the issue is me
With human rights principles.
There must be a place for disabled people, their programs and plans.
Among the already existing agendas of ministries, institutions and governmental and non-governmental organizations.
In situations such as wars or disturbances
Only your word is commissioned by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay.
In the world, and the strangest thing is that what the International Monitoring Committee for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities said is that the statistics are based on the census.
Do the disabled not count at all in the general population statistics?
Doesn't always declare.
For example, in the State of Qatar, the census was conducted more than five years ago.
But honestly
In cooperation with the Device and the Planning Council.
It was prepared by the Council, indeed, with our participation as the Office of the Special Rapporteur.
If you put in more, you get back more disability classifications.
The requirements that are assumed to be in place.
The quality of those observations, all those important details, should lead you to a conclusion.
Is there a disabled person or not?
Exactly, but at least.
The statistics are somewhat reassuring in this regard.
Peace be upon you.
Madam, I thank you for this program and I thank Sheikh Hessa
But I thank God that I am Qatari and receive this attention from my country.
And my daughter is now a student at an independent school, receiving a good education, thank God.
And I would like to thank Mrs. Hessa
And its inspiring role, its role that makes us unafraid and unworried about our children's future.
And all praise and thanks go to Allah, and heartfelt gratitude to her and to those who take care of this category.
Thank you very much, Fatima Al Dosari, who joined us from Qatar. We stay in Qatar now with Latifa.
Peace be upon you.
And peace be upon you.
My dear sister, the reality, the hope, and what we are waiting for, is to solve the problem of our children, the Bedoons.
Where is the sheikh in our Qatari children?
I hope she answers this question.
As-salamu alaykum
And I testify to the service that the State of Qatar has especially provided for deafness.
We had a program for the early detection of hearing impairment.
There is the Supreme Council for Persons with Disabilities.
For persons with disabilities regardless of the type of disability
Even the MG OSO civil society association or other communities
For the reality and the desired outcome, if I were to compare the last five years,
‏What was provided to the disabled 5 years ago and now
Thank you very much, Kareem Naseem, who joined us from Jordan. Back to our guest, La.
Of course the the
Society as a whole, and especially the families who have
Children with disabilities have high ambitions and expectations.
Whether at the planning level or the executive level.
But regarding one of the points mentioned, which is a very important one
Children who are undocumented, anywhere.
The International Convention Many international documents
and commitment to translate them into plans and strategies
to be provided automatically
Based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, regardless of religion, race, color, gender or national origin.
Okay, Sheikh Hessa, as a former Special Rapporteur at the United Nations on disability, worked in this position for six years.
That's what you wished for.
Perhaps you didn't have enough time. Perhaps the financial aid wasn't sufficient.
There are many achievements that I'm proud of.
Through my participation, or through presently existing organisations, and through the relevant government institutions in many countries
In the Arab region, I focus on...
There should be more research and larger studies
We started with a global survey which resulted in over one report.
Awareness raising is an ongoing process that requires constant and extensive effort.
Coordination among Arab States
Among the same people persons with disabilities and their organizations because they are the experts.
But it is their duty to do so.
For which they strive
Heartfelt thanks.
Thank you.
Dear viewers, in conclusion of this episode, I would like to thank everyone who shared their thoughts and comments with us.
Tomorrow, God willing, we will meet with a new guest.
Join us with your calls and messages for a new episode of Live With. See you there!
Good morning roses
I'm so happy you're here with us.
At the outset, before we start and ask various questions and chat this morning,
Thank you, Shimaa. I think I blushed.
The entire Middle East deserves this global achievement.
Qatar has already put us on the world map.
Thank you Qatar
Also, welcome Ali!
First of all, good viewing everyone.
And I say congratulations on the hosting to him and to the people of Qatar in general.
And God willing, as Sheikh Mohammed said.
Before a dream, and now, God willing, it will become a reality, and work will begin today or from the period of the announcement.
I was expecting Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup
Despite strong files, e.g. USA, Japan, Australia, I was still cautious about this specific issue.
No, look, I want to be straightforward with you: I'm seventy percent sure that's not the case.
Our file is too heavy.
View actual global plots and compete
We were as keen on competing
Why are we afraid?
But Alhamdulillah, the Qatar file was indeed strong and well-deserving.
True, the two thousand and twenty-two file and the World Cup hosted in Qatar.
So what about the Al-Farisiyyin themselves?
In this field, it would certainly mean immense and enormous joy, Inshallah.
I really like that. We were chatting before the show, but I thought it would be fun to bring it on air.
At the moment of announcement
Where were you? How did you receive the happiness? How was the shock? I don't know, tell me, tell us, tell the viewers.
On Air
Everyone's watching us.
They drew the announcement and here it is.
How did you see the global media?
<strong>Sports channels, overall, haven't insisted on this issue, especially in the Arab world. Thank God, everyone has continued their support.</strong>
Just an announcement that Qatar has won the bid to host.
All Arab states are familiar with this generous move by her, and it comes as no surprise that she has declared her willingness to assist Qatar in any way needed.
Media from human resources possibly as volunteers in the future
Even at the external media level, Shimaa.
So I went and celebrated my bad luck.
Included them in the AFP (Agence France-Presse) also took a picture of them.
We also have meetings.
No one ever insisted that Qatar should remember daily.
Hundreds of times a day from the smallest spot on Earth to the largest.
I expect everyone will know Qatar by now; if you don't know it on the Earth's ball, it's definitely on the internet.
Owner of the 2022 World Cup
Any football player dreams of representing their country. To be selected for the national team would be a dream come true.
Sure, any player in the Qatar Stars League wishes to represent the national team.
This means something positive, that one should sacrifice themselves even in games.
He supports the national team even if it's not successful. He gives it his all.
It means whether in training or in matches, because the team's emblem is on his chest, so he has to give it his all.
And Allah, the officials did their best in terms of care for the players, especially the young ones. This means they're teaching them professionalism from a young age.
Food Sleep La
Tell me about your experience, you've played in various age groups. How was your journey and what was the most important stage for you?
Of course, it was Allah's will.
Listed in the stages from the youth teams to the first squad.
You train in camps with the clubs and with the national team.
Each stage has its own character.
Yes, Lana. Mashallah, that's amazing! How did you manage to travel so much?
We have already gotten used to you, Lana the athlete.
Whenever we see you, you're always so athletic. We thought we'd grab some sports info and news from you. What's the latest in the world of sports?
I honestly don't consider myself a variety show host. In variety shows, we host celebrities in their fields; we also host celebrity athletes.
Like Ali, many others also excel in their athletic domains.
On the contrary, sports activity.
Why, we used to be the sports capital!
Qatar and we have become the capital of global sports and football
When you're not hosting a variety show, you present social, economic and cultural programs.
You have various fields, volleyball, basketball, various championships.
But then sports.
Sweet Excellent
I really wished it to be true.
I wish I were ten years old now, instead of twenty-five.
The young players got a great opportunity.
They hold it, as the saying goes, in their hands.
Sweet on you, Inshallah. The word I'd like to address to the players who
It's going to be the young up-and-comers, who will hopefully have a brilliant future ahead of them Inshallah.
Of course, I told her this is an opportunity and they really must seize it.
This is a golden opportunity that fell into our laps, they say.
It is necessary for them to make much more use of it.
What's new with you? What's the latest? What's new now in terms of the programs you'll be presenting? I know we haven't seen much of you since the holiday.
Tell us about your novelties, God willing.
Constantly up to date with the event. Hopefully we will be attending the Asian Cup in one month. Get ready!
We just finished the Gulf Cup, by the way, congratulations to the Kuwaiti national team.
The news broadcast is also available, so with intuition we're keeping up with the intuition.
Of course, I'm a staple on Qatar TV. My first appearance was on the Qatari screen.
Whoever initiated the kindness will never be forgotten by them.
And Mashallah, they convey the media message across various channels.
Whether they are private channels , sports channels or others .
May God grant you well-being, Qatar TV.
We definitely wish you good luck, hopefully always. We are still on this topic.
First of all, I would like to thank the management of Al-Wakrah Sports Club.
The Al Wakrah SC fans consider **Al-Attiyah** as one of their own.
My Childhood in Al Wakrah
A sheikh was with us yesterday. Sheikh Nasser was with us.
From the club
I am still a son of Al Wakrah and a Wakrah-born
Just as I told you before, this is professionalism.
Concerns everyone in Qatar.
Youth OK, we know that young people love and are addicted to sports
How can we make an athlete enter the social arena?
Media literacy is primarily about the media's crucial role in spreading sports across various platforms. Let's say it's a significant aspect of life.
You have the youth addiction, but now sports are entering schools. Sports awareness is being raised in schools.
They celebrate any sports event with festivities.
You have the Qatari street, so we will see banners in the streets too. This also counts as sports awareness.
The female element should be allocated, for example, a special place in the stands or elsewhere.
Hi, this is a women's awareness or sports participation initiative for women in sports.
Then we have our very own women's football team: the Qatar Ladies Team.
So, I imagine that, thank God, sports are starting to expand.
I also expect because the time period
To work on many projects and raise awareness about sports I think this period is enough.
If you study properly and work hard.
That's enough, and in the same vein, we need to make the most of it, just like the T's.
Then at some point I wanted to exploit the fact that the younger generations could be exploited by the selection committee.
It means capabilities, experiences, devices, everything is available.
Also, it's important that we are in Qatar, a country well known throughout the Gulf and Arab societies for their great passion for sports.
How can I attract this audience to consistently follow sports news and the matches taking place in Qatar?
And attendance at the same time.
But you should know that most Qataris love sports, they love football. The only issue is with attendance.
If you browse certain club forums or even most club forums, you'll find that the level of interest is much higher.
The football league is of great interest.
As an athlete, as a Qatari citizen, what would make you consider moving away from here, from your sport, from being a player?
How can your friends watch the matches?
He's self-reliant, it's not like he thinks of himself as some sort of a general notion or anything.
Some of them like to watch it on TV, or they gather in councils.
For example, Japan has implemented a large-scale plan to significantly increase spectator turnout.
When you attend the matches, I collect points, whose purpose I do not know. They are currently seeking solutions, so wish us luck!
And Arabic
The most important thing is that every player will hopefully be in Qatar, especially for our File Twenty-Two. What do you think we need?
What do you really need most at the moment?
Providing the means that can prepare the generation to truly live up to the name of the Qatari national team and participate in a big World Cup.
Time flies when I'm having fun, I keep telling myself. My watch says it's almost over, but it's hard to believe when I'm with such great company.
I made the impossible possible and reached the dream that we thought was impossible. But thank God, we are now living it in the real world.
As Sheikh Mohammed would say, these are moments of celebration, but work goes on.
Inshallah 2022 will be an event worthy of the name Qatar.
I congratulate everyone on the ground in Qatar and tell them that Qatar has now become a global landmark.
Hosting two thousand and twenty two.
And thanks to the elegant media personality Lana Al Adawi. We wish you all the best. We will always follow you to benefit from sports.
Thank you so much indeed, the happiness is in the eyes of the Emirates.
Qatar's Young Talents
And they're singing a new kind of songs that have emerged during this period.
But in the guise of a fast-paced musical composition, with an upbeat rhythm.
Inshallah, it also divides its fans of rap.
Join us, our viewers, as our journey begins at this very moment. Good morning!
We try to give it a few looks.
In short, we can define rap as fast-paced vocal music.
The performer recites the lyrics in a spoken word format, rather than singing them in a fast rhythmic tune.
Consisting of a large number of verses dealing with a variety of themes and issues
which may sometimes be personal
An emotional political gathering
It is often controversial.
and largely liberated
Our viewers' rapper doesn't sing the lyrics.
He repeats them.
His vocal range is a secondary factor.
Generally unimportant in rap songs is the vocal
That's why he's not called a singer but a rapper or a rap artist.
And Al-Rabea'h focuses on the following elements of racism in the songs.
For example, the flow of the isochronous flow or the pronunciation
O Allah, their pursuers, their audience, their lovers.
‏ They have a certain rap style.
And I expect they will give you a much better idea than me personally.
Good morning, welcome!
And God, the first thing is, it was a period when we wanted to do something new.
We excel at something.
Why don't we rap, too?
Then rap is an art form that exists in every country in the world.
Why isn't it in the ways?
So we said, let's invent something brand new.
It means we give him an idea of its message.
In it we speak of the negatives and the positives that occur in our society.
It means we use it to convey the message that it's a shroud, you know.
This is an art form that perhaps the viewers might have addressed many social and psychological problems among the youth.
At all times, I expect change, and with the passage of time, my expectations change.
Indeed, Allah made him a bit more foolish.
We sang from two thousand and five Al-Taghrib was the weakest at the beginning.
We introduce ourselves as the new beginning in 2020.
In Tagbl and more popularly
She likes how she tries to sing and perform in the rap style during this period. I noticed this.
A definitely large percentage of people
Also, his job, we want to talk about it. He has been part of so many groups.
Beautiful band, you've had so many successful concerts. We can talk about this band.
How was it established and how did the idea come about that one can actually form a band? How many of you are there in this group?
And Allah, we were together even before the band was established.
Rap arrived in Doha in 2005.
It means everyone who loved the idea of rap would record their songs and upload them to the website.
I descend, Salman descends, Flan descends, so there's competition.
And we met some people.
F means we now compete with one another
Then after a while, after all these years, we finally reached 2010.
‏It was in 2011 when the "groups" system was implemented, meaning each group stood alone, with three or four people in them.
So, we've established why. We should just unite as one group, under the name Rappers Tar.
Or Ballen Lazy Q Rappers
So we agreed on this. We are all united as one, standing together.
And we acted out this thing, pretending, and said that this idea is exactly what we meant.
Approximately twenty-five.
Twenty-five 'w's. Mashallah, that's a big bunch!
Okay, is there anyone who performs rap songs or what?
And he arranges it, and he composes it.
That's a very personal question.
The arrangement of the high-key is excellent, and the organization of the twenty-five is superb.
It's each one means himself with his capabilities.
It means everyone in the band can make an entire song by themselves.
Without relying on anyone else.
But in it, competencies can differ, for example, like Salman is better than me
He hears her and says: "No, adjust the words right now, it's different."
Each one can edit for the other.
Can you help me a bit?
So that there is indeed an official body that adopts these works, or even a company that takes them on.
And have many distributors
That means the work should look so stylish, even fancy. It has to be official and elegant.
And honestly, we really hope for support. We hope to receive encouragement, for a record label to come forward and say: "We'll help you produce an album."
We have absolutely no problem.
Some things are a bit tricky.
So, why don't you think about it as the first initiative coming from you?
Even just to get to know the first CD
So you can later attract female partners, what do you think?
Year Two Thousand and Seven, approximately, I made a CD.
Distributed it among the youth.
How was the turnout?
And Allah
The text translates to: The year two thousand and seven , maybe a little rap art is not very strong in the Gulf .
But not as strong now.
So, we were sitting, chatting, not on air, I mean like for instance, you'd hear a large group of youngsters between Valencia and Kiasto, for example.
Let's talk about her.
They said they're arranging a party for us.
They covered all costs, handled all procedures, and the coordination was amazing. Honestly, we didn't expect it to be at this level.
It really surprised us, it was amazing!
And there was just a little pressure, like there were no ads, nothing like that. It was just the party.
There were no announcements, nothing at all before the party, two days prior.
So we said no one wanted it, a couple of days before the announcement no one wanted it.
As we were entering, just before the party started
So that's a point in our favor.
So, our voices will reach the families, not the youth.
Our perspective is that we expected the idea to be exclusive to the youth.
We have discovered in this stage that there is more than one category of people who hear us.
In a certain song there was a lot of interaction with the audience and the band.
And most of the songs had audience participation.
It's not just the music, although the songs were numerous, and we were a large group.
The group means the whole group is going west.
What are the words for addressing various issues?
We're talking about the situation we're in , but it's coming in fast .
At least, even if it's just a lot.
Even if they spoke before, it wasn't me.
It turned out that you have to go out to the camels Random words
That means the rhyme scheme comes out.
That critique made us think: should we write "Yes" or would "Hai" be better?
Okay, so we have a song. Let's take a look.
One of the songs we made
And we continue to monitor it, and we will also see the public's opinion on the matter.
And hopefully, they will also enjoy these words.
Thanks, I loved the introduction because it mentioned the name of my show
With you, it's KD & DJ Mr. Bobo on the Doha Morning Show.
Good morning ladies and gentlemen.
This key opens Mr. Bobo's with SKT One Hot to Try.
Don't forget the show airs at 9:30 in the morning, so everyone will be sitting in front of the TV.
With us in preparation: Hassan Naama With us in presentation: Shimaa Al Hammadi
Our guest in the directing seat is Nasser Al Maliki Stars of the episode: Rappers from Qatar
Because it really does contain the name of the Al-B family. Thank you, you're all doing a great job. May you remain in good health.
I applaud you, truly. Well done, young folks, up in the control room.
Yesterday evening it was registered.
Who wrote the lyrics among you or who?
Each one writes their own words
Because if I were to get him, I'd write the truth about Youssef.
Not just writes to him these words in love in love with song in love with passion
I expect you have to write in the World Cup two thousand and twenty-one and the Asian Cup. I think you might be able to enter those, right?
We are definitely us, introducing ourselves, we're definitely dropping a song, so in this matter, it's us.
Just because it's a little high society, doesn't mean it's official.
I expect there must be songs in Qatari about the love for the nation.
Through the art of rap, indeed.
Yes, I believe we are all waiting for today.
We are live on air now.
And of course, the cup adorned the streets of Doha.
If our viewers have seen, Doha has been decorating itself to welcome the Asian Cup.
All arrangements have been made to receive.
The cup and Mont are expected to definitely draw an even bigger crowd than we've seen.
Just now I think the length of the corniche from start to finish
<strong>Certainly</strong>, we are looking forward to this important sporting event.
In upcoming parties, hopefully, I will attend them in the near future, hopefully.
It means someone from their side has offered to arrange a party for us.
So far, things are a bit complicated.
Procedures and this is not entirely certain
So I tried to, for example, I saw Youssef and I saw so-and-so.
I saw several people with me, I want them, I have a song topic, I saw the three.
The song suits them well.
The possibility that we can sing it
I'm sitting at home
And then send it to Youssef via email on the internet.
For you, O Joseph, is this part of the song
They also traveled abroad.
Entering this field, they've gained millions of fans.
We don't try to copy, but one listens to what's best.
Just because he's a strong competitor in his own style
There's nothing stopping me from taking ideas from them and copying them.
Just means reverse it, take the idea, twist it and apply it to my song in a different way
They formed their own band and have released over a dozen CDs.
He spoke of a man named Abdullah Al-Dhail.
He has the experience and ability to detect groundwater.
Their ability to detect groundwater reservoirs
One of the city's inhabitants is called Marrat.
There are many experienced people.
To locate the positions of water before drilling wells
And he may need or dig many wells and find no water.
Aided by copper rods or pomegranate branches
Or the fig, from whose roots you can infer the presence of water.
What tools does he use?
The water finder, Al-Makk.
This was the old .
Now they have been replaced by **brass rods**.
Place the two rods parallel to each other.
We now walk at a slow pace.
We watch as we drive past a watercourse.
The train barriers will open.
Now now now we're passing like this now we're passing over a stream
It's open like this now.
When we exceed, it begins.
This is now in the middle of the watercourse.
And from the "A" and here is the middle.
This way, we can now determine the course of the subterranean waterflow.
And of course, the process is repeated multiple times in multiple locations until we find the strongest site.
Confirms Abu Ibrahim.
To reach an advanced stage in this profession.
His discoveries are extremely accurate.
Sometimes in the Fayfa region, sometimes outside in Shaqra, Ahriemlah and Athithia.
Over one hundred and fifty wells have been discovered.
The margin of error was five per cent or less.
You need training, experience, and a gift from Allah.
Surpassing modern devices and laboratories
In a very short time.
Abdulrahman Al-Murshid
**Good Morning Doha**
City of Marrat is located in the north western part of the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
We followed up on this report and promise you, God willing, more reports from Arab and foreign countries.
Gulfian, God willing.
We have reached with you, our viewers, a variety of headlines and titles, each with its own significance.
The Big and the First Title above it.
If I expect there's a large group of Gulf youth in the Gulf itself on Falafels.
There are certain people I look up to.
But it's like, you're not just copying them, you feel like you have to keep up with their work, like, first and foremost.
And God, the Gulf rappers are connected to each other in general.
F means not a competition. Being competitive doesn't mean I released a song.
And he spoke about the topic.
It means being a competitor as you say is goal-oriented.
There should be a connection between us, it only applies to one specific person.
In Saudi Arabia, Qusai's doing great, mashallah!
He became very famous and acquired a CD and a fan base.
And he has so many companies that could potentially adopt him.
May you reach this stage, and hopefully even surpass it, God willing.
Insha'Allah, we wish you success, God willing, through this team.
Of course it's here, and let's take a look at the coverage of this important sporting event, the Asian Cup. Let's see the footage from the Corniche.
And a group of young Qataris
The one who moves, but with a Gulf style, from the West.
There are also emotional songs, rap songs, and outstanding crews of twenty-five people.
It's imperative that one keeps up with your news from the get-go.
So I guess you need to have an email and a specific website or forum on the Internet.
How can one get in touch with you?
And Allah, for a while we had a website of our own
But there were some problems with the hosting company.
So it meant sometimes "yes" and sometimes I don't know what.
So, we faced some problems with it and in the end we finally closed it.
The site is definitely closed.
Okay, what is the current alternative until they solve this issue, as a team?
In the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Morocco or Egypt.
One must communicate with you and stay up to date with your news and the songs you produce from time to time.
What's the alternative now?
The alternative is currently relying on private pages
What's his name exactly?
It's not in Jupiter, it's on Google.
Qatari rapper or Rappers Qatar
You make music videos even by yourself
Did you work on the program yesterday?
We have released more than one video on Youtube.
Song and dance
I'll sing and record a video of it, shooting from behind.
I expect we'll see you develop further.
You need a place to meet up, but everyone should have their own device at home.
The broken computer, piano and guitar
Honestly, I really wish we could get some support.
For example, a company
We produce CDs for you
I'll make you a special place.
From ourselves
But in the end, it's still very personal.
We don't want it to be personal.
And my words are not different from Yusuf's.
We need a music video.
The album is out now.
The power of video clips' spread is, in my opinion, very important.
To deliver the message further.
There's everything with him if there's support.
Your sweet voices reach everywhere
It is considered one of the different arts that deal with problems and issues.
Thank you, Yousef Al-Neama and Salman Al-Abdulla, for joining us.
And we'll watch them, of course wishing them every success, in the name of our Good Luck for Youth program.
These projects were a definite yes.
The iyaa iyaa project is also almost ready, but it needs some technical development.
‏ Expiry date: Price
You'll get to the cashier, you've got the total, you have all the details, you're ready.
And identify the merchandise instead of picking up each item to check its components and any adverse effects.
He's walking in the trolley.
<strong>A person can indeed select the materials for themselves with utmost precision.</strong>
Of course, most of the projects mainly came as a reflection of the child's sense of the problem B B.
He also has various activities and goals.
The center now focuses on the programs it develops and the events it holds, which revolve around a main concept.
Her Highness Sheikh Mozah set out ten goals when she established the Center.
Possible possible also.
He goes directly down to the subway and travels underground from his house to the train.
But its main idea is clothing.
Can you please list all the stores in Qatar that sell black T-shirts?
The house key is also the car key. I have a button I need to press.
Can someone please help me find my keys?
Yes, we're back to the projects you'll hopefully be undertaking through the Cultural Centre.
Early childhood education
Developing his skills and nurturing the talented.
We moved back and forth between a variety of children's skills, whether media or research-based.
If it's personal skills in public speaking and persuading an audience are what you seek, then look no further!
With the variety of all these skills, we set up a special program to serve them.
We started from the media of the future, and we have now accomplished a great deal there. We have reached and completed our final graduation projects.
We have also reached many child preachers.
and their creativity
Do you also have such young presenters?
He's back on TV! And it's essential they present kids' programmes.
We're sitting here counting them on TV
On their television, they watch Qatar TV.
Wipe them out now means we'll be done with them in eighteen years.
Welcome to them wherever they are Yes.
This also refers to the National Television.
Our need to attract, earn, uncover and develop these talents.
From Declarative to Research-based
To issues pertaining to thinking.
To diverse fields of reading
In such collaborations between you, you take each other's ideas
In every domain, for example, the Wa'ed Khateeb Program with the Ministry of Awqaf.
Our museum is a museum for the ages. This is also true.
The Science Club played a significant role in developing projects and also provided technical support for these projects.
The Supreme Council for Education also has a major role, and their support and partnership with schools is equally important.
Professor Abdullah, your move to Katara, this grand edifice,
The one who also gathers a large collection of wonderful events and places to visit.
Is this a push forward for the same center forward?
But you take such a building separately
Far from this majestic edifice
It gave us an easier interface to deal with the public.
And also some pioneering projects are good.
In many of them, guests are welcomed and introduced to the nature of the cultural programs offered to the child.
Because our main project over the next three years is
The National Project for Children's Reading Development
Under the patronage of Sheikha Hessa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani
She has adopted and supported this project to a very large extent
This is a major project aimed at developing children's reading skills and writing stories to enhance their abilities.
Different cultures specifically related to reading
There are many programs, of course
Now we have recently moved.
And start rearranging some activities.
and designed and developed in a way that suits the nature of Katara's visitors.
We definitely wish you the best of luck, hopefully through this center.
The one who encompasses within his folds very important ideas
Of course, we greatly appreciate your warm hospitality.
The most important thing is that the more we deal with children, the more we discover that our children are
Today's children are not yesterday's children; their childhood is not ours.
They need us to give more attention, focus and time.
Give him enough listening to his interest and his imagination
I communicate with him mentally.
They work in a way that their approach towards the children is like a hotel that provides accommodation.
It's a bank that provides him with money.
It's about a child missing someone to listen to these thoughts, to this imagination.
We really lived it These past few days have been a rollercoaster. They transferred us to twenty, thirty different places.
Through this exhibition
We wish good luck, God willing, to the projects that have been awarded prizes.
And thank you for joining us, Mr. Abdullah Al-Jameeli, Director of the Cultural Centre for Childhood. We wish you every success, God willing.
So these projects can actually be realized and exist in reality rather than remaining a mere dream.
Welcome our viewers! The Cultural Centre for Childhood concluded its evening event on Monday at the Diplomatic Club.
National Exhibition of Dreams of Generations under the slogan Dreams of Generations are the Facts of the Nation's Tomorrow
Organized to mark the Nation's National Day, the event saw the participation of over seventy children from across Qatar.
Our audience witnessed a variety of events and diverse competitions.
Innovative projects for children.
On behalf of our viewers, we are delighted to welcome Abdullah Al-Jameeli, the Director of the Cultural Centre for Childhood. Welcome and good morning to you.
Good morning, our dear sister. Welcome!
At the outset, I would like to thank you for making time for the Center.
To talk about this distinctive exhibition is a real pleasure.
We are also delighted to have you here through the program, so that we can cover as many of the events taking place during this exhibition as possible.
This National Exhibition of Dreamscapes
In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful Of course, this exhibit.
Contribution of the Cultural Center for Childhood.
National Day Celebrations
And he had a very distinctive style. He had a very important touch with every child.
Aiming at empowering children
He lives with a dream.
And with the project
This project or dream
In children's dreams, anything is possible.
Its fields are wide, we have defined them within the framework, which is a 20 to 30 km radius.
and other key areas of the Qatar National Vision 2030
So we began training the children in four stages.
How brainstorming tools and mechanisms expand the child's thinking sphere
What do you exactly mean by this sentence?
They are the facts of the nation of tomorrow.
meaning what our children dream of today
This project is growing with this project.
So this was indeed an interpretation of the vision that the children would start living from this day onwards.
I have a big dream
If it's an environmental domain, or a field related to health and human development, among others.
serving the nation's interest
I expect that we would when we know there are children present somewhere.
or in a certain exhibition
Is all of this a mere figment of my imagination?
The exhibition featured VIP guests.
Honoured guests are the children's role models, whom they look up to and learn from.
Yesterday's fall came two or three weeks ago
And it also won several awards across the Arab World.
There was a table showcasing their projects.
Yes, the pictures are indeed evidence of what you're saying, Mr. Abdullah.
This is a collection of photos from the exhibition and various events.
This is also the owner of the last project's owner of the forest.
Innovative or creative
This is one of the children's innovations, Masha'Allah. It's a very beautiful idea that we can expand upon for the viewers.
And we'll talk about it a bit. What's this subject all about? The coloured ball.
So about four or five projects came up on the subject, one of them being the coloured ball.
The Smart Stadium
This ball, if it goes out of the field.
It varies, its color changes.
We will be back, I expect, in future matches hopefully.
So what does all this dreaming mean?
It also relates to what he's interested in.
And I expect that, especially when there are officials involved, they will take into consideration these small projects from small minds.
But we do not know if these projects actually serve us. The President of the Football Union here in Qatar,
My opinion about the idea of the colored ball
Is it love for the idea?
Sure, the cost of his visit is worth it, and he reviewed the projects related to the ball.
<strong>Roadside Stop</strong> <br>These projects are being built in real time.
Grand exhibition at the moment and adopted these projects.
The audience also voted for a wide range of projects presented by our children.
And our dear friends, what projects can we say have received a lot of attention and votes?
Of course we have our own evaluation method in the Evaluation Committee. It has a main evaluation technique.
These projects are the ones that won the awards. The first, the second and the third.
He was from the jungle and won the first prize.
He had very detailed information about the project, and the project was ready to begin.
Of course, alongside the administrative aspect, there are many other managerial aspects needed.
She went into a lot of very detailed information and also distributed the visitors' brochure, as if it were ready for her project.
These are definitely the images we're currently witnessing.
This is a collection Yes, this is also a collection of many projects I've worked on
Perhaps they feel that way because they're not sitting around watching movies or cartoons.
Nor has she already linked herself with them, although some of them have been adopted by institutions.
For example, we give names to the projects. What are these projects?
This surplus, how can it be exploited at home? How is the collection and return process organized?
47 students
Qatar University celebrated the graduation of two hundred and forty-seven students from its thirty-third cohort yesterday.
His Excellency Dr. Khalid bin Mohammed Al Attiyah, Minister of State for International Cooperation
A large number of parents and teaching staff
The university celebrates the graduation of seven hundred and seventeen students today.
Of course, we thank our colleague Salman Al-Mujtahid. We will stay in the same artistic atmosphere. We will have a dear guest with us today.
The text translates to: > From the family of the artist Abdul Hamid Al-Shorshany in the series *Tasanyef*.
Who confirmed his presence through many works, including the series Hearts for Rent.
They tired themselves out trying to prove themselves in the art scene.
Especially since the world of art knows no favors.
which means
Hello and welcome, Fig! Good morning, and I'd like to greet the viewers with a good morning, too.
On the contrary, the show is genuinely lit with an amazing cast.
We will see something very simple from one of your works, and we can start a conversation with you.
You're laughing at me.
Get the fake one and bring me the real one.
Soul and body.
The besht is available.
How can I return the Beshte hat?
She ground her father's bones in her belly. May his soul rest in peace.
I am a member of a five-person committee.
The Higher Committee of the Conference
I do not agree with you.
I have no objection.
If this is a quick snippet, a simple paragraph from the series Tasneef, then we'll be watching season 2.
We ask about your participation this year in Part II.
Can you tell us a bit about your roles in "Tasneef", which is an anthology series with a different story in every episode?
What's your contribution about?
Of course, after what happened.
It has been times that era has seen.
Merat is also famous for its mountain.
Ecstasy, often celebrated by poets throughout time.
When history stands as a witness, enduring in the memory of cities.
and refers to the prestige of its past
which is located 170 miles north of the capital, Riyadh
It is said his lineage goes back to 'Amr ibn Humaarah at-Taymi
Her distinguishing features were her monuments, the sweetness of her water and the freshness of her air.
Sung about by poets, enchanted by her beauty, her fame is linked to her mountain, Al-Jabal Al-Kamil, The Perfect Mountain.
It is said: a pool as dark as the *Kemيت*.
Of course, Madinat Marrât is a prominent ancient city.
The advent of Islam preceded this.
There were old things whose history was unknown, such as the well of Khalid ibn al-Walid.
The situation we are currently in.
The great Sahabi Khalid ibn al-Walid may Allah be pleased with him ordered the digging of this well during the Ridda Wars.
It remained until the present day.
"A guarantee me 'Akameet', and I'll guarantee you many returns."
When you see a quantity, you see it as a multiple.
Of course, another notable monument is the Ghadir Kumayt.
The spring of sweet water that has quenched our thirst over the years
Which was enough for the city for an entire year
From the beginning of the rainy season until the next rainy season.
This artwork's creation date is also unknown.
There is also the Bride's Valley.
Jabal Kamit is one of the landmarks of the city of Marrât.
This mountain has inspired many proverbs, poems and songs.
From all the regions of the Kingdom
One of its most prominent artifacts is the Bir al-Walid
For he descended at Marrat during the Wars of Ridge and was heading towards Al-Yamamah.
He encamped there and ordered his men to dig this well.
The water of which people still draw today for both drinking and ritual ablutions.
Yāqūt al-Ḥamawī mentioned in his *Muʿjam al-Buldān* that Khalid passed by Marrat.
It is an old mud house that has been renovated to its original form.
It features several sections showcasing the architectural character and heritage of the region, as well as its historical sites.
As the poet said, "When we reached the waters of Majan."
A deep pool, not a shallow puddle
Professor Ayman, there's also, mashallah, collaboration between the family, the child's guardian and the center.
I expect there are various ways in which he can stay up to date with you.
To the management of the training process in general.
That means from the moment we get the intern, the student, or the child, it's "ta'ifar".
This file will contain all his personal data.
Even his monthly degrees of Taqyeem (evaluation) will be cloudy. So, for example, us.
A cozy residence is the Egol program's ultimate delight.
Every four lectures, there is a temptation.
Through a username and password, the guardian can
We give it to him so that he can access
Yes, he sees the extent of his progress since he first joined the center to the present day.
Yes, we have several different models that we will monitor.
We have a little girl.
With Professor Ibrahim, it will be our pleasure. He'll be right here shortly.
We will see several different models, if only we had more space.
But we brought a sample of a girl's.
There will be more live tests ahead.
We ask her questions in mathematics and other subjects.
We'll take a short break and be right back with you. Stay tuned to see this clever little girl. Join us!
The artist now faces a savvy audience.
‏Any action taken from the first two rings three saw the work was not done just for show.
He won't tire himself out. There are 20,000 other series for him to watch.
That's twenty thousand episodes, that's correct.
Follow the Sunnah. Some people say no, one should focus on a single occupation.
He who puts the second works in can see them.
Sure, it tra
He says he only watches TV during Ramadan.
Of course, we welcome you, Abdulaziz Al-Shalshani, our esteemed and precious guest.
Do you have a message for your beloved audience? Of course, for the fans that adore you, I'm one of them, definitely.
I address you all.
I tell them: Every year you're doing better and better!
True, we don't go out much. We don't go out a lot. We don't act like them, of course I've mentioned the reasons.
The future is better.
Inshallah, we wish you success in your endeavours this year.
Inshallah we will have another meeting to discuss these plays.
It's all interconnected.
And fashion shows have started to attract many attendees, with enthusiasts awaiting the latest models.
We welcome you, our beloved viewers, through the morning of Doha, and we are with you on air.
Today we are definitely talking about the Skills Development Center and a group of students who have enrolled there.
This center offers a vast array of diverse sciences.
Sure, they focus on developing various skills.
And also may their minds be working at 100% amen.
Professors Nesma and Ayman Khojla, the latter of whom is the Executive Director of the Skills Development Center.
Hello and good morning.
Welcome!
And with us is the lovely Amna. Good morning, Amna.
Good morning
How old are you, my love?
Seven graded seven.
Mā shāʼ Allāh. We wish you every success.
What do you offer our sons and daughters?
It has been explained to Professor Ayman and Nesma. It was specifically designed as a program to benefit our children.
It is a mental math program called *<b>Mind Math</b>*.
Through the fingers and through the Apacs
To reach some specific goals, we tried to clarify a simple part of them.
I felt, Professor Ibrahim, that there really is a difference. The student, as soon as they enter, in the first two days...
And after he's done with you, maybe three or four months.
If he studies at public schools, private schools, or even independent ones.
Initially, the program is proceeding scientifically in certain ways.
Having completed the first level of the program
The one who explains where the abilities, which the child has lost or needs development in, are located.
It has reached a certain limit , or any developments that have occurred with the child .
We are moving forward scientifically, following a scientific program.
It's not just some methods or mechanisms that are routinely applied.
Yes scientifically in an organized manner
Before the start of the program and after taking this course or the levels it entails.
Professor Ibrahim is currently with us, as you can see, viewers. Amna is one of the students who have joined this center.
We loved the idea of doing this live to demonstrate to our viewers the importance of this device.
I have no objection to wearing the jacket.
Here's a quick snippet from an upcoming season 2 of the series *Tasniif*.
But since we saw this excerpt from the first season of Tasniif
Can you tell us a bit about your roles in "Tasneef", which is an anthology series with a different story in every episode?
The year will focus on him being the one in charge.
Ghafl Fazl
which incited her while she was giving opportunities
Twelve lectures on various topics.
Of course, there's a ringleader, there's an old man of the ring, there's a ring baker.
It means "various rings".
Professor Ghanim Al-Sulaiti from Qatar
From Qatar we have artists
A lot of artists don't follow me now. Of course, we have female artists from Bahrain like Zahrat Arafat and Ibtesam Abdullah.
We have it.
Faisal Rashid and Mohamed Adel
Of course, Tara.
It's thanks to Tara that the youth got a chance to shine.
Few projects are done in Qatar this year. You only have two.
Qatar Television also produces dramatic works. We can say it in English.
Gatar TV is the executive producer.
Qatar TV doesn't hold back, of course. But there's only one production a year, and all of Qatar's actors are eager to work.
And this is why.
It's required to have one series and all of Qatar's artists want to work on it.
So even if one gets a scene, they say "Alhamdulillah" (thank God)
All praise be to Allah in all situations.
Okay, let's go back to your beginnings.
I extend my heartfelt gratitude to him.
I consult him about several things.
Of course, the artist Abdul Aziz Jasim, from *Hukm Al-Bashar* to *A Day in the Life* to *After the Divide* to *Yes or No*.
In his plays, we started working with him as a theatre, and Abdulaziz Jasem was the first executive producer we worked with, both in theatre and television.
It is He who has created us, taught us, and made us.
Of course, Mr. Ghanem followed up on Fayez's two thousand touch requests.
Because frankly, it has given us, as young people, many opportunities.
They have thirty to thirty-two jobs per year.
So we have two jobs a year, thank you very much Tara.
A thrilling feeling, of course the same thing produced by Tara Art Production.
The series director is Mr. Munir Al-Zoubi.
We're back, viewers. Today we're discussing reflexology.
Hand massage by the palm.
This treatment has indeed been practiced since ancient times.
We brought a guest with us.
The examination method is as follows:
Periodically swelling aches
You feel inside the hand. Sometimes you feel a sandy sensation, like shattered veins inside the hand.
Reach out your hand.
Of course, my friend here is a bit on edge.
You feel a little stressed.
On the left
Of course, dear viewers, I am now examining the left side of his body.
To be in the picture.
No health problem appears. Now that we know the headache, we know the dizziness that comes to him.
There's pain here.
It doesn't matter.
What's the problem? What's the exact problem here?
The pockets here are ear pockets.
Oil Joe, you have a sinus operation or a problem before.
I had surgery a long time ago.
Veal or something.
His weight increases without eating
Okay your left shoulder
This is nerve-wracking, having to endure high tension.
I walked barefoot by the sea ten years ago.
Sure, we know that walking by the seashore is expected to have a calming effect.
Not only the sea is an uneven floor.
Negative energies can
He might also be amazed at your discovering these things through massage.
Definitely, the children are the most important people.
Children, subḥānallahi, for the mother, focus with me.
Tired of milk and cereal for breakfast.
Her child met her and automatically she put him in the child seat.
Sugar in Arabic
Simple pressure Subḥānallāh
You will notice the child relaxing after a few seconds. He will talk to you a little bit about the pain here.
Then suddenly, subhanAllah, you see the gases being released.
What discoveries have you made, Professor Abdulaziz?
Just less than the second problems now joints and bones, headaches, thyroid and obesity.
The second thing is regarding period pain or menstrual cramps.
Focus on the rock or the stone . As you press here , you're giving orders . Subhan Allah , for lower back pain and menstrual problems .
In seconds, it will disappear, God willing.
The pregnant woman
Facilitates her delivery.
Here or here, of course, or who knows.
If they tell her that, swear to God, in the seventh month there's a chance you could give birth, or in the ninth.
Only on sand.
It means walking on sand is fine, but don't walk on rocks.
Breaking one's fast with seven dates is most excellent.
And if the fresh dates yield plenty, hopefully, that will be enough.
I seek refuge in God from the cursed Satan. This discovery is from the Quran, of course.
God could not make this fresh date come to her, yet He is able to do so.
O Allah, all praise is due to You, and I seek refuge in Allah from the word "I".
Bring rocks Bring small pebbles
The bed is weak in the legs, for instance, a woman in labor came and held the iron of the bed.
Even in private hospitals, you see an East Asian woman.
Right now, inshallah, it's usually done in East Asia.
My phone's with you, no need.
Only the mobile
Cooperating with each other is advice that I give to every creature hearing me now.
Be keen on charity and take care of others. You were created to worship Allah.
To serve people is the first thing. Secondly, I am not a cleric or a sheikh; I am an ordinary human being.
May Allah bless Professor Abdulaziz. Thank you very much for this pleasant interview. Thanks also to our guest who joined us.
May you be granted a thousand well-beings. Good luck, God willing.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al Thani, the Director of the Public Health Department at the Supreme Council of Health, will share the details.
Good morning, sheikh.
Let's start with an overview of these events.
The truth is, it's a healthy step towards Qatar.
It is a key component of the National Strategy for Obesity Prevention.
Four out of the ten fattest countries in the world are Gulf states.
We have started in the Supreme Council of Health, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education and other entities, a strategy to combat obesity.
Fearing its further spread soon FUL FUL
One of the programs to protect against obesity is Healthy Steps Towards Qatar.
‏They organize this contest together so it becomes an international competition.
Of course, the program lasts six weeks.
Every week is different from the following one.
To educate seventh and eighth grade students on the importance of health at this age.
Because they are the first to realize their dreams by themselves.
In the first week, as you recall, it was about your favorite fruit.
Week 2 Walking
One must walk, of course. The more one walks, the more points one earns.
It's a map of Qatar. The more points you collect, the more your school advances. Your school takes steps forward with each step you take.
There would be a nice competition among the students.
The third week, he drinks plain water. He drinks carbonated water.
He's used to drinking unnecessary fizzy water. Every time he's thirsty, he reaches for a fizzy drink. Don't drink water, he says.
Then we have week 4: Your favourite sport
Some of them like the games at school.
We are looking for a sports game that he loves.
To force him to really exercise.
The boy is eating a healthy meal.
His family knows they have to take care of their son's diet and feed him healthy meals.
Island Academy is a co-ed academy for boys and girls.
Of course, if this sample is successful, God willing, we will expand the experience in the coming years.
Of course, the students are thrilled. I don't know what their feeling is exactly, whether it's that our activity is more fun.
We enjoyed ourselves more with more games and our colleagues.
The girls say our skin has improved, acne has lessened.
True true exactly it becomes conscious
Parents know about their children.
And their colleagues in the second rows say: "How are you doing?," meaning they learn from them, their colleagues and their brothers.
And, praise be to God, many schools are already enthusiastic about participating next year. Sign ups are open now.
inshallah
Of course, the official sponsor of this event was QTel.
We had an Aspire Zone that hosted sports competitions for students and raised awareness.
On the dining table means
So, thanks be to God, several parties are involved, some of which I have mentioned and others I may have missed.
But praise be to God, everyone participated with what they could.
Some of the brothers were organizing Saturday competitions.
So it had variety.
We tried several types and included as many people as possible.
They are the generation of the future.
Until this experience is shared and spread as much as possible nationwide
So, this is the first time you're setting up, and there are a few things that need adjusting.
And now, thank God, it has spread with satisfactory results.
Insha'Allah, we will publish it, as some people are demanding to know why they weren't included.
You'll get to eating healthy eventually, no problem.
So, at this age, he will start achieving what he wants by the time he's twenty or twenty-five.
You mentioned a list of titles, each week there was a title.
If we return, we will try to make today's segment about the conclusion of the events.
And if we look back, we had more than one hosting in our program.
We go back, we reiterate, and we return every week, conveying the information that we want the students to receive.
Inshallah, my dear sister. The first week, let's start with your favourite fruit.
Of course, fruits in general have many benefits per serving.
What is the use of fruits that contain vitamin C?
So he himself starts to figure out what he likes in fruits. Not all fruits are his enemies, you know.
It could be allergic to one or two types, but why not the others?
Week 2 Walking People think walking is only for little old ladies, why do they walk?
‏When I grow up, I'll walk.
On the contrary, you should walk because it soothes the mind and the brain.
Relieving an individual's psyche leads to mental clarity and enhanced focus.
You used to make them walk for the students.
Not all of them are required to walk either at school or at home.
They score their points through classroom schools.
Because it's not like, every day, you know.
This was an event where people held a parade. The girls' school held a parade.
We want them to be creative, to have innovative ideas.
The spirit of competition and the teachers coming up with new ideas. We don't want to give them ideas, we want them to come up with their own.
So everyone had their skills in this regard.
Of course, during the third week, we made sure to keep him hydrated by having him drink water continuously. We encouraged him to drink lots of water so he wouldn't get thirsty and crave carbonated drinks.
Of course, in the fourth week your favourite sport is...
So, if we can reach his favorite sport and support him in it, we will.
He's sports-crazy.
Their love of the sport comes from the fact that he actually plays it. He's engaging in sports without even realizing it.
As we previously mentioned we will be discussing the Qatar Multiple Sclerosis Society
Let me welcome our guest today, who has graced our studio with his presence.
Welcome!
Welcome with us in this program
And many of us may not have heard of this disease.
Let's dive right into the topic, as the Egyptians say.
It is a chronic disease.
It affects the human nervous system.
Intervals occur between twenty and forty years of age.
There is also no cure for this disease so far, and there is no known reason for the disease or its contraction.
It usually affects the active segment of society, which is the youthful demographic.
Treatments used for cancer patients keep evil diseases like that away from you.
The disease is an inflammation of the nerves in the brain and spinal cord.
It is the central nervous system in the human body.
The body detects a nearby object in motion.
A neuron is a neuronal cell.
Cover the electrical wire with this sleeve.
White blood cells are the first white blood cells that kill or dissolve the insulating layer.
This results in the interruption, weakness or disorder of the nerve signal.
May God keep you safe from distant paralysis.
So far, with the development of medicine and its advancements, Professor Abdulaziz, we still have not found a solution for this disease.
Okay, besides the solution, we want to know how it comes to us.
One must also be cautious about this.
The direct cause is the nature of life, the nature of food. Circulations of the life.
What exactly is the direct cause that makes a human being susceptible to this disease?
All that currently exists are theories.
Even by marriage.
They are trying to solve the health problems that human faces.
Yes Yes
All these topics might spark some controversy within the community.
So far we don't know its causes.
The age group that can contract this disease is neuropathy.
of both sexes
Of course, the disease starts to quiet down with the person after reaching forty.
But so far we have not found a cure for this disease.
Does this prove that there really are many people in the Gulf, the Arab world, or even just in Qatar?
In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, statistics indicate there are twenty five thousand cases.
And so does Qatar.
I personally know of three to four very clearly diagnosed cases from just last week.
Currently, we have one hundred and twenty-five patients registered in the files.
And many people, upon being diagnosed, seek treatments in other countries.
Yes, Professor Abdulaziz. There are indeed some effects on individuals who have suffered from this disease.
Are there some signs that would indicate to the people around me, or even to myself, that I am suffering from multiple sclerosis?
And it seemed that this virus, for instance, was going to get rid of
Let's be honest, it's not a virus.
Because it's a disease of the nerves which control the whole body.
It's just a bit like giving a reason for a certain place's reputation, you know, the nature of the food, the nature of the place itself.
