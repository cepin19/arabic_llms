Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? (Mark 9:33-37; Luke 9:46-48)
At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
And Jesus called a little child to Him, and set him in the midst of them,
He said, "I tell you the truth, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
The one who humbles himself and becomes like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
The one who accepts a small child because of my name accepts me.
But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung around his neck, and he was thrown into the sea.
Oh woe to the world for the things that lead people into sin! It is these very things that must come, but woe to the human who brings about the things that lead people into sin!
And if your hand or your foot makes you sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter into life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and go to hell.
"If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away; it is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye, than with two eyes to be cast into hell. Mark the Lost Sheep (Luke 15:3-7)."
Beware, do not despise these little ones. I tell you, their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.
There are ancient texts in which this verse is found: Behold, I, the Son of Man, have come to save the lost.
What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one goes missing, wouldn't he leave the ninety-nine in the mountains and go look for the one lost sheep?
I tell you the truth, the one who finds it will be happier than the other ninety-nine who didn't lose it.
Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. (John 13:1)
If your brother errs, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.
But if he will not listen to you, take with you one or two more, that every word may be established by the mouths of two or three witnesses.
If he doesn't want to listen to their advice, tell the church. And if he doesn't want to listen to the church, treat him like an unbeliever or a tax collector.
'The truth I tell you: That which you tie on Earth shall be bound in Heaven, and that which you loose on Earth shall be loosed in Heaven.'
Once again, I tell you: If two of you agree on earth concerning anything that they may ask, it shall be done for them by My Father in heaven.
"Whenever two or three gather in my name, I am among them." A servant who does not forgive is like a master who does not forget.
At that time Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?"
Jesus said: "I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven."
That is why the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his slaves.
He brought a liver to calculate them, brought them someone to ask for money without calculation.
As Njmash decided, سيدو was ordered to sell his wife, his children and all his possessions to retrieve his money.
The servant fell before him on his knees and said: "My lord, my lord, please be patient and I will sort everything out for you!"
And forgive him his debts, O Sidou, Seppo and Samho.
The servant went out and found another servant who also owed him some money. He demanded: "Pay me the money you owe me!"
My brother, the other guest fell on his riders and begged: "Have patience with me, I will save you."
And he didn't love it and left, and they put him in jail until he had paid off his debt.
The other servants, who had been watching, became very worried and informed their master that everything had been stolen.
That time, his master said: "O evil servant! I have forgiven you that loan, for the sake of the hardship you faced because of it."
"And you have no right to show mercy to your servant friend, any more than I showed mercy to you?"
Sidou and Salemo will keep the prison official busy until he forgives their friend's debt.
Thus shall My Father in heaven also do with you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother.
Marriage and Divorce (Mark 10:1-12)
Jesus finished saying all these things, and left Galilee. He went into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
And many people followed Him, and He healed them all.
Came to him the Pharisees, and tempted him, saying, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?
Tell them: "Didn't you read that the One who created them initially created them as female and male?"
# Ephesians 1:27; 2:24; 5:31; 1 Corinthians 6:16 And he said: "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they shall be one flesh."
«Imala houma ma âadouch thnin, âama beddoun wahed. Hadaka alâach alli yajmaâallah ma yafracouch al-insân.»
*Tasa* **24**:*1-4* The Pharisees came to Jesus and tested him, saying, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?""
Jesus said to them, "Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, permitted you to divorce your wives; but from the beginning it was not so."
And I tell you: anyone who divorces his wife for any reason other than her unchastity and marries another commits adultery."
The students said: "If this is how the man treats his wife, it would be better for him not to marry."
And he said to them: «Not everyone can accept this message, but only those to whom it is given.
Not everyone can get married right after their mother gives birth to them, some people have had things done to them that make it impossible to marry, and others simply do not want to marry because of the Kingdom of Heaven. Anyone who can accept this, let them accept it." Jesus blesses the children (Mark 10:13–16; Luke 18:15–17)
And children were brought to Jesus that he should put his hands on them and pray. The disciples rebuked those who brought them.
But Jesus said, "Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of heaven."
And He laid His hands on him and departed from there. Mark 10:17-31, Luke 18:18-30
And they said: "Teacher, what good deeds must we do to have eternal life?"
Jesus said, "Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only One who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments."
# Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20 They answered, "We have indeed heard and understood that the Lord said, 'You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness,
# Honor your father and your mother, and you shall love your neighbor as yourself.**
The boy said: "I can do all of this, what's missing?"
Jesus said, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me!"
The boy heard this and felt sad inside. He owned many things.
And Jesus said to his disciples, "Verily I say unto you, It is hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven."
And again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."
When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, "Who then can be saved?"
But Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
At that time Peter answered and said, "We have left all and followed You; what then shall we have?"
Jesus said to them: "Verily I say unto you, In the regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
Whoever leaves behind their home, or siblings, or parents, or children, or land, for the sake of My Name, will receive a hundredfold in return, and inherit eternal life.
"Many people at the beginning will be at the end, and the people at the end will be at the beginning."
Like the servants of the grapevine
The Kingdom of Heaven is like a master of a house who got up early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
They struck a deal with the servants for a silver platter during the day and sent them for the tongue of the grapevine.
And he left with the nine. Hey, he saw other groups of people standing idle in the market.
And he said to them: "You go to the vineyard and I will give you your wages. So they went."
And he went out again about noontide, and at evening tithing. And he did so the third day.
And he rose about the fifth hour of the evening, and found others standing. And he said to them, "Why do you stand here idle all day?"
Caloulou: "Not a single one of you cried out for us to work." He told them: "You too, go work in the grape arbour."
Evening snacks, the grapevine's steward said to he who was heedless of the servants: Summon the servants and hasten them. Begin with the two last ones, until you reach the governor.
And those who began working with the five in the evening, each of them received a silver coin.
And when the guests arrived, they all thought they would receive more than the others, but each one of them only found a simple silver coin.
And when they finish, help them out with the grape molasses.
They said: "These two only worked for an hour, and you saved them just like we did after working the whole day in the scorching heat!"
And one of them answered: "My friend, I have not wronged you. Did we not agree on a silver coin?
Take your right and go. I loved to give the other this, as much as I give you.
"Hey, why can't I do what I want with my money? Are you jealous because I'm generous, or what?"
And Jesus said: "The other two shall go forth, and the one shall be left. And the one shall be taken, and the other left." Jesus tells for the third time of His death and resurrection. (Mark 10:32–34; Luke 18:31–34)
And Jesus, as he walked before them, went up to Jerusalem, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem;
We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed into the hands of the chief priests and the scribes, who will condemn Him to death.
And they will deliver me up to the Gentiles to mock and scourge and crucify; and the third day I shall rise again. (Mark 10:34-35)
And Mubaida brought her son, Zubdi, along with her children. She prostrated herself before him and made a request.
And Jesus said unto her, What wouldest thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.
And Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you ask. Can you drink the cup that I drink, or be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?"
He told them: «You may drink from my cup, but it's not for me to decide who sits on my right or left. My father prepared these places for the guests.»
When the other ten heard this, they were indignant at the two brothers.
But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.
But among you it shall not be so. Whosoever would be great among you must be your minister;
Let him who loves the world be a slave to all.
"For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many." Jesus heals two blind men (Mark 10:46-52, Luke 18:35-43)
And when Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him.
And two blind men sitting by the road side, when they heard that it was Jesus, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David!
O Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!
And Jesus stopped and said to them, "What do you want me to do for you?"
Caloulou: "Oh, master, we'd love to go back and have a look!"
And Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes, saying unto them, Be of good comfort, be whole. And immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem (Mark 11:1–11; Luke 19:28–40; John 12:12–19)
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, near the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples ahead.
And he said to them, "Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a colt tied, on which no one yet has sat. Loosen it and bring it here."
And if anyone says anything to you, say: "The Lord needs them." And immediately he will send them.
This thing happened so that what the Prophet said would come to pass:
# Isaiah 62:11; Zechariah 9:9 Tell the daughter of Zion: "See, your King comes to you, humble and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey."
The two disciples did as Jesus had ordered them.
And they brought the colt to Jesus, and threw their garments on it; and he sat upon it.
Most people spread their cloaks on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
*Psalm 118:26; Luke 2:14; Matthew 21:15; 23:39* *Hosanna to the Son of David!* *Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!* *Hosanna in the highest!*
And when Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred, saying: «Who is this?»
And the people said, "This is Jesus, the Prophet from Nazareth of Galilee." Jesus cleared the temple courts, driving out all who bought and sold there. He overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold doves. He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' but you have made it a den of robbers." When the chief priests and the scribes heard it, they kept looking for a way to kill him, for they feared him, because the whole crowd was astonished at his teaching. But when evening came, he went out of the city.
And Jesus entered the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;
# Isaiah 56:7; 7:11 And I will bring them to My holy mountain, And make them joyful in My house of prayer. For My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations.
And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.
And the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, "Hosanna to the Son of David!"
Psalm 8:2 And the children said unto him, Of whom speakest thou? Jesus said unto them, Of such is the kingdom of God.
And He left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and He lodged there. Now
When He returned to the city in the morning, Jesus was hungry.
And he saw a vine by the roadside, and he cut it down. There was only the stem left, and he said to it: "You will never bear fruit again!" And the vine withered away.
The students were amazed and wondered: "Why has the vine withered so quickly?"
And Jesus answered them, "Assuredly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also, if you say to this mountain, 'Be removed and be cast into the sea,' it shall be done.
"Whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours." The authority of Jesus (Mark 11:27-33; Luke 20:1-8)
And when He had entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to Him as He was teaching, and said, "By what authority are You doing these things? Who gave You this authority?"
Jesus answered them: "I will also ask you one question, and if you tell me the answer, then I will tell you by what authority I do these things.
Where does John's baptism come from? From heaven or from men?" They discussed it among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'"
But if we say, 'Of humans,' we fear the humans, because we know that John is not a prophet."
They answered Jesus, «We do not know.» And Jesus said to them, «Nor do I tell you by what authority I do these things.» So the two sons of Zebedee are like two men who came to the vineyard to work.
What do you think? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said: "My son, go and work in the vineyard today."
Oh, come on, answer him: "I'm not going." But then he felt remorse and went.
And they said the same thing to Louldo's other son. "We're leaving, sir!" But he didn't move.
«Who are the sons who do the will of my Father in heaven?» The elders answered, «The first.» Jesus said to them, «Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God ahead of you.
"John came, a righteous man and a prophet, and they didn't believe him. But the tax collectors and prostitutes believed him. Even after he performed that sign, they still refused to believe in him." It's like the proverb about the vineyard workers: "(Mark 12:1-12; Luke 20:9-19)"
Hear another parable: A man planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a pit for the winepress, and built a watchtower. He leased it to some farmers and went away on a journey.
And as the time for the grapes to ripen drew near, he sent his servants to the vintners to receive his share of the harvest.
They beat the five servants, killed one, and stoned another.
And the grapevine's steward sent the servants again, even more numerous than the first time. They did the same thing to them as before.
He kept them at a distance and said: "My sons are capable."
When the five saw the child, they said to each other: "This is the one who is to inherit! Let's kill him and take his inheritance!"
They seized him, dragged him outdoors from the grape arbor and killed him.
«What will those of you do with the Thursday market, when the master of the vineyard arrives?»
The Jewish elders said: "He is killing the wicked and giving the vineyard to other vinedressers who will give him the fruit in its season."
*Psalm* 118:22*-*23; *Acts* 4:11; *1 Pet.* 2:7 Jesus said to them: 'Have you never read in the *Scriptures*: The very stone which the builders rejected, *That* was the one chosen by God Himself; It is wonderful in our eyes.'
That's why I tell you: The Kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit."
# 21:44 Ancient texts have this verse: Behold, I, the Son of Man, have come to save the lost.
And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard these parables, they understood that He was speaking about them.
As they tried to seize him, they feared the people, for they held him as a prophet.
Just like the feast of the king. (Luke 14:15-24)
And again Jesus spoke to them in parables, saying:
The Kingdom of Heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son.
And the servants were sent to call the guests who had been invited to the wedding feast, but they wouldn't come.
And he sent other servants, saying: "Tell those who are invited, 'Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fatted cattle are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the marriage feast!'"
Ama Homa didn't plan the evening ahead and went their separate ways; one went to his garden, the other to his shop.
And others took his servants, mistreated them, and killed them.
The king cheated, sent his soldiers' gear and killed those damn criminals. He burned down their city.
His servants said to him: "The guests invited are not worthy of a banquet like this.
Let's hit the streets and invite as many people as we can to the wedding party!
And the servants went out into the roads and called everyone they saw, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.
When the king came to see the guests, he saw a man who was not wearing a robe. They said:
How did you get in here without your wedding attire on? The man fell silent.
At that time the king said to his servants: "Bind his hands and his feet, and cast him into the darkness outside; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
Many are called, but few are chosen." (Mark 12:13–17; Luke 20:20–26)
At that time the Pharisees went and plotted how to entrap Jesus in speech.
The students sent their belongings with some Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know you are honest and teach the way of God truthfully, indifferent to anyone's status. You don't play favourites."
They said: "What's your opinion? Should we pay taxes to Caesar or not?"
But Jesus outwitted them, and said, "You hypocrites! Why do you test Me?
«Bring us the money for the taxes!» So they brought him a purse of silver.
Jesus said to them, "Whose image and inscription is this?"
They said: "Caesar's things!" He told them: "Then give Caesar what is Caesar's and God what is God's!"
And they wondered at him, and he saith unto them: Perplexing is the question which ye
On that day the Sadducees came to Jesus, who say there is no resurrection after death. They put a question to him.
Deuteronomy 25:5 They said, 'Teacher, Moses wrote for us: "If a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow. The brother shall consummate the marriage and fulfill the duty of a brother-in-law to his sister-in-law, and the first son she bears shall carry on the brother's name, so that his inheritance will remain in the family.'
And there we were, seven siblings in total. The first brother married but died childless, and his wife was taken by his brother.
The same happened to the second, the third, up to the seventh brother.
And all of them have passed away, the woman has died.
On that Day of Resurrection, she'll be no one's wife, for she has married them all."
Jesus answered them: "You are mistaken, because you do not understand either the Scriptures or the power of God."
On the Day of Judgment, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, and they will be like the angels in Heaven.
As if you were the living dead on the Day of Judgment. Haven't you read what God has told you:
# Hosanna in the highest! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord. He is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead but of the living."
And when the scribe heard this, he was amazed that he had answered so well, and said to him, "You are right in saying this: 'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.' And the second is this, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these."
When the Pharisees heard that the Sadducees were silenced, they gathered together.
And one of them, a scholar of Islamic law, asked a question to test him:
"Teacher, what is the greatest commandment in the Law?"
Deuteronomy 6:5 Jesus answered, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind."
This is the first and greatest commandment.
# Leviticus 19:18; Matthew 19:19; Galatians 5:14; Romans 13:9; James 2:8; The second commandment is like it, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'
The whole Law and the Prophets depend on these two commandments.\" Christ and David (Mark 12:35-37; Luke 20:41-44)
When the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question:
"What do you think of Christ? Whose son is He?" They answered, "The son of David!"
He said to them: "How then did David in the Spirit call Him 'Lord', saying,
Psalm 110:1; Acts 2:34-35; Hebrews 1:13; 10:13 My Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet."
«If David calls him "Our Lord", then who is his son?»
And not a single one could answer. From that day on, no one dared to ask any questions.
Jesus denounces the scribes' teaching. (Mark 12:38-40; Luke 11:37-52; 20:45-47)
And Jesus said to the people and to His disciples:
The book of the Jews and the Pharisees sits on Moses' seat.
Do as you are told and follow their instructions carefully. Do not mimic their actions, for they are hypocrites who say one thing and do another.
They put a heavy burden on people's shoulders, while they themselves won't even touch it with a finger.
They do everything so that people can see them. They grow in their hats and lengthen their three-piece suits.
They love to sit in the first rows during soirées and the front seats at gatherings.
People love to greet them in the markets, shouting: "Ya Ma'aleens".
But you don't let anyone call you: "Masters", because you are all brothers and you have one Master.
Do not say "Good" to anyone on earth, for there is only one Good, and that is in heaven.
Do not let anyone call you 'my masters', for you have one Master, and that is Christ.
Let your elder serve you
He who humbles himself is exalted, and he who exalts himself is debased.
O you hypocritical Pharisees! You are like whitewashed tombs, which appear beautiful on the outside, but inside are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness. So you also outwardly appear righteous to people, but inside you are filled with hypocrisy and lawlessness.
# 23:14 Ancient texts contain this verse: Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You devise ways to cheat widows out of their property, and as a show you make long prayers. For this reason you will receive harsh judgment.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you traverse sea and land to make a single proselyte, and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves!
Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but he that sweareth by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!
Anna is more valuable, you fools and blind men? Gold, or the temple that makes the gold sacred?
And they say: "He who swears by the altar is bound by no oath, but he who swears by the gift on the altar, he is bound by his oath."
Anna is the one who is more precious, oh blind man? The offering, or the altar that receives the offering, which is holy?
He who swears by the altar, swears by the gift on it and by all that's above it!
And he who swears by the temple, swears both by it and by Him who dwells within it.
And whoever swears by the heaven, swears both by the Throne and by Him Who is seated upon it.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You pay tithes of mint and anise and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faith. These you ought to have done, without leaving the others undone.
Those who lead the blind! You filter out a mosquito yet swallow a camel.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you cleanse the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside they are full of extortion and excess.
O you Pharisees, you blind men! First clean the inside of the cup and the dish, so that the outside also may become clean.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness.
And you too, you appear righteous on the outside, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.
O you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous,
And you say: "Jinn were among those with our ancestors, so we did not participate in the killing of the prophets."
Behold, you are witnesses against yourselves that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
Emala intoma wafula mizaan mit-Ta'jeddikum.
O children of Lfa'i, how will you escape the verdict of the torment of Jahannam?
That is why I send you prophets and wise men and teachers. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and others you will flog in your synagogues and chase from town to town.
Surely the blood of all the prophets, shed from the foundation of the world, ^4:8,11:4,1:1,24:21 from the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar, ^ will come to rest on this generation.
"Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all these things be accomplished." Jesus' love for Jerusalem (Luke 13:34-35)
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often have I longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!
Hey, may your house remain in ruins.
Behold, I tell you, I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom."
Jesus foretells the destruction of the Temple (Mark 13:1-2; Luke 21:5-6)
Jesus went out from the temple. And as He was walking away, His disciples came up to Him, pointing out the structures of the temple.
He told them, "Do you see all these buildings? I tell you the truth, not one stone will be left on another; every one of them will be thrown down." The catastrophe and the persecution. (Mark 13:3-13, Luke 21:7-19)
When He was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying: "Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of Your coming and of the end of the age?"
Jesus answered them: "Take heed, and beware of every kind of greed; for a man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions."
A lot of people will come in my name, saying, "I am the Messiah!" and they will mislead many.
And when you hear of wars and conflicts, near and far, do not be troubled. It must happen, but it is not the end.
And nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
This is but the beginning of the pangs of birth.
That is the time when they will take you away to kill you, and the peoples of the whole world will hate you because of My name.
And back then many people would start to lose their faith, betray and hate each other.
And they will produce many false prophets and will mislead many people.
And the majority of people will no longer have love, because evil will increase.
Whoever proves to the other is right will be the one to get paid.
And the good news about the Kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a witness to all nations. Then the end will come." The Great Tribulation. (Mark 13:14-23, Luke 21:20-24)
# Daniel 9:27, 11:31, 12:11 "When you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place" (let the reader understand).
At that time, let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
And let the one on the roof stay up there, so that he doesn't bring down the things in his house.
And let the one in the courtyard not return to grab his coat.
Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants at the breast!
Ask your Lord that you may escape, during a day other than one of rain or Sabbath.
At that time there would be great congestion, not like it is now at the beginning of the world.
And if God did not skimp on those past days, then He would not have saved any human being. But He did skimp on them because He chose certain people.
For in those days there will be such a time of stress as has not been from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, nor ever shall be. And as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.
Rahou bas yahrilou ba'sha nass kif al-Masih ad-Dajjal wa anbiya' kadhibin, ya'milou hajjat 'azima wa 'ajayib bash yaghaltou biha, hatta an-nas al-muktarin, in kane momkin.
I told you so.
So if they say to you, 'Behold, he is in the wilderness!' do not go out; or, 'Behold, he is in the inner rooms!' do not believe it.
Behold, I am like lightning, which flashes and shines from the east to the west. So will the Son of Man be in His day.
Where the carcass is, there the vultures will gather." (Mark 13:24–27; Luke 21:25–28)
# Isaiah 8:12, Isaiah 13:10, Ezekiel 32:7, Joel 2:10–11, Zephaniah 1:15 In that day shall the moon be confounded, and the sun shall be ashamed, when the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem. The stars of heaven shall wince, and the heavens shall be troubled at his presence.
At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
And He will send His angels and will gather His elect from the four winds, from the farthest end of the earth to the farthest end of heaven. (Mark 13:28-31; Luke 21:29-33)
Learn from the vine: when its branches turn lush and verdant, summer is nigh.
And you keep witnessing these things happening, know that I'm soon to arrive.
I tell you the truth: this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no means pass away. Be on the alert, for you do not know when the appointed time will come. (Mark 13:32-37, Luke 17:26-30, 12:39-40)
But today and at this hour not one person knows them, not even the angels in heaven or the Son, only the Father knows them.
Just as it happened in the days of Noah, so will it be in the days of the coming of the Son of Man.
And lo, the people were eating, drinking and marrying, as was the custom in the days before the flood, until Noah entered the ark.
And they were not thinking of anything, until the floods came and took them all away. So will it be at the coming of the Son of Man.
That time they would have two men in the watchtower, one leaves, one stays.
Three women are sitting at the millstone grinding wheat. One rocks it back and forth, while the other remains still.
Wake up, for you know not the day your Lord is coming.
As they knew this, the master of the house would have known when the thieves would strike, and he could have stayed awake and prevented the theft.
That is why you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect." (Luke 12:41-48)
Who is the trusted servant who knows how to behave, who is in charge and has everything under control, so as to give them their food on time?
Health, so the servant may return to his master and find that he has served him well.
He's telling you the truth: he's going to eat up all of his properties.
But if this servant is wicked and says to himself, "My master is delayed,"
He began to beat the other servants and eat and drink with the drunkards.
Sidou Bashi is coming back on a day that's not in his mind and at an hour he doesn't know.
To chop them up and serve 'em to the hypocrites on their way. Where will the weeping and the moaning be then?"
Like the maidens
And the kingdom of heaven is like unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were clueless, and five knew what to do.
When the children shook their lanterns, they didn't shake the oil with them.
Those who know how to behave took their olive oil lamps and lit them.
And as the groom grew weary, everyone was overcome by sleep and dozed off.
At midnight they heard a shout: "The groom is here! Make way for him!"
Hey, all the girls have lit their lighthouses.
The ignorant ones said to those who know how to act: "Give us some of your oil, because our lamps are about to go out."
Those who know how to behave answer: "It may not be enough for you and for us. Go to the ones selling oil and buy what you need."
When they were about to go shopping, the groom arrived. The guests entered the house with him and the door was closed.
And the girls kept their distance, increasing it even more, and said to the groom, “My lord, my lord, we have knocked on the door!”
And he answered them: "Verily, I know you not."
Behold, a certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return. And
The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who wanted to go on a journey, so he called his servants and gave them his money.
He gave to each one according to his ability. To one he gave five bags of gold, to another two bags, and to another one bag. Then he left.
The one who took the five bags walked swiftly and traded them, and behold, he gained five more bags.
And whoever takes up two swords, will profit by two more.
He who took the purse went and dug in the ground and hid his master's money.
And after a long time, the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them.
And he who had received the five purses came and brought five more, saying: "Master, you gave me five purses, and I have gained five more."
They said: "Wake up, O faithful and righteous servant! You were faithful over a little, now I will put you in charge of much. Enter into your master's joy!"
And so the second servant went and dug up the two talents, and said, "Master, you gave me two talents; behold, I have gained two more talents besides them."
They said: "Wake up, O faithful servant, the righteous! You were faithful in a little, now I will put you in charge of much: Enter the joy of your Master!"
And he took a moneybag and said: "My lord, I know thou art a hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not scattered;"
"My brother, I was scared, so I ran and buried your money bag in the ground. Here's your money."
Ama Saidou answered: "O wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown, and gather where I have not winnowed;
You should have put my money in the bank, and we would have taken it back with the interest.
And he said to his servants, Take from him the talent, and give it to him which hath ten talents.
For those who have, it shall be given and they will have an abundance. But those who have nothing, will lose even what they have.
"And the useless servant, cast him out into the darkness; there men will weep and gnash their teeth." The Day of Judgment.
When I, the Son of Man, come in my glory, accompanied by all the angels, I will sit upon my glorious throne.
# Psalm 34:17 When the righteous cry for help, the LORD hears, And delivers them out of all their troubles.
And we shall place the sheep on my right, and the goats on my left.
And behold, I say unto you, my right hand shall be given unto you: I, even I, will place your kingdom, founded from the dawn of creation, upon you.
It occurred to me: you fed me when I was hungry, you gave me drink when I was thirsty, you took me in when I was a stranger.
"I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was bound and you came to me."
At that time the righteous will answer him, "Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?
When did we see you a stranger and welcome you? Or naked, and clothe you?
"When have we seen you ill or confined, and went to visit you?"
And King Anna said to them: "Every time you have done that thing with one of these my little brothers, you have done it to me!"
And I say to those on my left: "Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels."
I was hungry and you did not feed me, I was thirsty and you did not give me drink.
"And I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me."
And they will answer: "Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty, a stranger or naked, ill or in prison, and did not serve You?"
And I'd answer them: "You're right every single time. You never did that with any of my little brothers. Not once."
"And they shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life eternal."
The Jews are trying to kill Jesus (Mark 14:1-2; Luke 22:1-2; John 11:45-53)
When Jesus had finished saying all these things, He said to His disciples:
"You know that in two days it will be Passover, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified."
And the scribes and the elders of the people assembled in the court of the high priest, named Caiaphas;
And they consulted together how they might put Jesus to death.
As they said: "He won't run the risk during the Feast, or there might be a riot and Jesus will be lost in the crowd." A woman pours perfume on Jesus (Mark 14:3-9; John 12:1-8).
At that time, when Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper,
The girl was very mean; she poured her expensive perfume on his head while he was eating.
When the students saw her, they whispered: "Why such extravagance?"
This perfume could have been sold for a fortune and the money given to the poor!
But Jesus, knowing what they were thinking, said, "Why do you worry about that? She has done a beautiful thing for me.
The poor will always be with you, but I won't always be.
And if she has perfumed my body, she is preparing me for the funeral.
I tell you the truth: wherever the gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her." The Betrayal of Judas (Mark 14:10-11, Luke 22:3-6)
At that time there was a man named Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples, who went to the chief priests
# Isaiah 21:32; Zechariah 11:12 And he said unto them, What will ye give me? And they bound him thirty pieces of silver.
And he began to be sorrowful and very heavy, and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. (Mark 14:12-21, Luke 22:7-23, John 13:21-30)
On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and said, "Where would you have us prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
He told them, "There is one among you whom you know, saying to him, 'The Master says: My time is near; I shall celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your home.'"
And the disciples did as Jesus had commanded them, and they prepared the Passover meal.
And in the evening, Jesus sat down to eat with the twelve disciples.
And while they were eating, Jesus said: "I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me."
And they were very sad, and one by one they started saying: "O Lord, is it indeed I?"
Tell them: "Whoever puts their hand in the dish with me is the one who will betray me."
Psalm 41:9 Behold, I have sinned; yet I am a man of unfailing strength, and I know that You are the Holy One, O You who are exalted among the sons of men! **The man who has You as his refuge will never falter.**
They said to Judas, who was also called Iscariot: &quot;Is it you, Master?&quot;. Jesus answered, &quot;You have said it.&quot; The Lord's Supper (Mark 14:22-26; Luke 22:15-20; 1 Corinthians 11:23-25)
And when He had taken the five loaves and the two fish, He looked up to heaven, blessed and broke the bread, and gave it to the disciples to set before the multitude. "Take, eat," He said, "this is My body."
And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said unto them, Drink ye all of it;
This is my blood, the blood of the covenant which is shed for many, for the forgiveness of sins.
We tell you: We won't drink that grape juice anymore, not until the day comes when we can drink the new one with you, in Papa's Kingdom.**
And they sang a hymn, and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus saith unto Peter, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren. And he saith unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death. And Jesus saith unto him, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.
Sure, here is the translation: *Jesus said to them: "You will all become deserters; each man to his own, and you will leave me alone this night. It is written in the book of Psalms: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'**.*
"But after I have risen from the dead, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."
Peter said: "Even if everyone else abandons you, I will never leave you."
Jesus said: "I tell you the truth, tonight, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times."
Peter said, "Even if I have to die with You, I will never deny You!" And all the other disciples said the same. Jesus prays in Gethsemane (Mark 14:32–42; Luke 22:39–46)
And Jesus and his disciples went to a place called Gethsemane; and he said to them, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.
And Peter and the two sons of Zebedee laid hold of him, and began to be sorrowful and very troubled.
At that time he told them: «My soul is very sad, even unto death. tarry here, and watch.»
And he said to them, "Bring it here to me, and having taken the cup and given thanks, he said, "Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not my will, but yours be done."
And he came back and found them asleep. He said to Peter, "Simon, are you asleep? Could you not keep watch with me even for one hour?
"Stay awake and pray, so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
And again he prayed, saying, "Father, if this cup cannot pass away from me unless I drink it, Your will be done, not mine."
And he came back and found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy with sleep.
But he left them again , and for the third time went and prayed , saying the same words .
And he came to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners."
Let's go! The one who betrays me is at hand.» (Mark 14:43-50; Luke 22:47-53; John 18:3-12)
While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve disciples, arrived, leading a crowd of men armed with swords and clubs. They were sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
And the family patriarch gave them a sign, saying: "The one I am going to kiss, that's the one! Seize him!"
And they came up and laid hold of Jesus,
Jesus said, "Friend, do what you came for." At that moment, they came and seized Jesus.
And one of them, named Caiaphas, drew his sword and struck the high priest's slave, cutting off his ear.
At that time Jesus said: "Put your sword back in its place; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword."
Oh brother, it's not stuck in my head that I can't ask Dad for more than twelve armies of angels?
"But how can the scriptures say such a thing without it actually happening?"
And Jesus said to the people, "Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me as though I were a robber? Every day I sat teaching in the Temple, and you did not seize Me.
And he said, «What you are about to do, do quickly.» Then the men seized him and arrested him. It was some time after the sop, and night was falling. They did not enter the precincts, lest they should be defiled and unable to eat the Passover. So they went to a place called the Pavement, which in Hebrew is Gabbatha. Meanwhile, Jesus stood before the governor; and the governor questioned him, saying, «Are you the King of the Jews?» Jesus said, «You say so.» And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he said nothing. Then Pilate said to him, «Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?» But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge, so that the governor was greatly amazed.
And the band of soldiers, having seized Jesus, led Him away to Caiaphas, who was the high priest that year. The chief priests, the elders, and the scribes were assembled in his palace.
Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest's house. He entered in and sat with the guards to see what would happen.
And the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were seeking false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death,
But some people testified falsely, and after them two witnesses came forward
They said, "This man said, 'I can destroy the Temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"
And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked, **'Have you no answer? What is it these men testify against you?**'
But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest said to Him, "I adjure You, by the living God, tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God."
Jesus said: "You have said it. Nevertheless, I tell you, hereafter you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven."
The top priest Debshew cut in: “He’s an infidel! Do we still need witnesses? You just heard him uttering blasphemy.”
What did they sentence him to?** «Death!»
And they spat upon Him, and smote Him with the palms of their hands. And some began to slap Him.
And they said: "Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?" And Peter said: "I know not what thou sayest." And immediately the cock crew. Mark 14:66-72, Luke 22:56-62, John 18:15-18, 25-27
At that time Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant-girl came to him and said, "You also were with Jesus the Galilean."
He shrugged in front of all of them and said: «I don't understand what you mean.»
When he went out through the outer gate, another servant girl saw him and said to those standing around, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth!"
And Peter denied it again with an oath: «I do not know the man!»
A little while later, those standing there said to Peter, "Surely you are also one of them; your accent gives you away!"
At that moment he started swearing and crossing his arms: «I don't know this man.». Suddenly, the big guy spoke up,
And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.
Jesus before Pilate (Mark 15:1; Luke 23:1–2; John 18:28–32)
In the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people plotted against Jesus to put him to death.
They seized him and ill-treated him, and delivered him up to Pilate the governor. (Acts 1:18-19)
And when Judas, who betrayed Him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he repented; and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
And he said: "I have committed a sin, for I have shed the blood of a man without guilt." And they said: "We are not concerned with that. That's your own affair."
And he cast the money into the treasury, and departed. And he went his way, and hanged himself.
And the chief priests, having received the pieces of silver, said, "It is not lawful to put them into the temple treasury, being blood money."
They didn't agree and bought the potters' field to bury the Phoenicians in it.
That's why that very sania is still known as the Blood Fountain today.
# Zechariah 11:12-13; Jeremiah 32:6-15, 18:2-3 And behold, I will raise up evil against my sheep, and I will let them devour the fruit of their own
And they began to accuse Him, saying, "We found this man perverting our nation, forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar, and saying Himself
And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.
When the chief priests and the elders accused him, he said nothing.
And Pilate said: "Don't you hear the many things they are testifying against you?"
And he answered them never a word; so that the governor marvelled greatly. The sentence of Jesus to death (Mark 15:6-15; Luke 23:13-25; John 18:39-19:16)
And every holiday the governor would let the people have one of the marble columns they desired.
At that time they had a prisoner whose name was Barabbas.
When they had assembled, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release for you: Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?"
It was out of jealousy that they gave it to him.
Moreover, while Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message, saying, "Have nothing to do with that innocent man. I have suffered greatly today in a dream because of him."
The chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas to be released and Jesus to be killed.
The governor asked them again, "But who do you want me to release for you?" And they shouted, "Barabbas!"
Pilate saith unto them, What shall I then do with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.
He asked: «Why? What harm have they done?» But the crowd shouted all the louder, «Crucify them!»
When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, and that a riot was developing, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood. Do with him as you wish."
And everyone answered: «Our blood and our children's blood is demanded!»
And they released for them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered Him to be crucified. The soldiers mocked Him, and after having twisted a crown of thorns, they put it on His head, and arrayed Him in a purple garment. They came up to Him and said, "Hail, King of the Jews!" and they struck Him with their hands.
And the soldiers, after they had mocked Jesus, took Him away to the Praetorium and gathered the whole cohort before Him.
And they tried to dress him up in a red outfit.
And they made a crown of thorns, placed it on his head, put a reed in his hand, and began to bow down before him, mocking, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
They spat on him, twisted the reed and hit him over the head with it.
And after they had mocked Him, they took the robe off Him and put His own clothes back on Him. Then they led Him away to crucify Him. (Mark 15:21-32, Luke 23:26-43, John 19:17-27)
And when they were leaving the city, they met a man from Cyrene named Simon, whom they compelled to carry the cross of Jesus.
When they reached a place called Golgotha, which means 'Place of the Skull',
They gave him a drink mixed with something called al-Mur to taste, but he didn't like the drink.
Psalm 22:18 They divide my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots.
And they sat and kept watching him, going about it.
They placed the charge against him on his head in a placard which read: 'This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.'
They crucified two criminals with him, one on his right and one on his left.
# Psalms 22:7-8; 109:25 Those passing by derided him, wagging their heads, saying,
"If you are the Son of God, save yourself and come down from the cross."
And the chief priests and the scribes and the elders mocked Him, saying,
Other people He has saved; let Him now save Himself, if He is the King of Israel!
Mao trusted in God and said: “I am the Son of God”. Let God save him if He is pleased with him.
And the criminals who were crucified with Him reviled Him, each one saying, "You are the Christ? Save Yourself and us!" But the other answered and rebuked them, saying, "Do you not even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation? And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this Man has done nothing wrong. And He said to Jesus, "Lord, remember me when You come into Your kingdom." Then Jesus said to him, "Assuredly, I say to you, today you will be with Me in Paradise." (Mark 15:33–41; Luke 23:44–49; John 19:28–30)
And a darkness came over the whole land at noontide, and continued dark for the space of three hours.
Psalm 22:1: My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
And some of those who were standing there said: «This man is calling Elijah!»
Psalm 69:21 They put gall in my food, And in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
Others said, «Wait, let's see if Elijah will come and save him!»
And Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.
And the veil of the Temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. And the earth quaked, and the rocks were split.
And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose.
And they exited the tombs after Jesus' resurrection, and went into the holy city and appeared to many people.
When the chief priest and the officers saw him, and the things that happened, namely, the earthquake, and the things that took place, they were extremely afraid, and said, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
And there were many women looking on from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him.
And Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee, who were preparing spices to anoint the body of Jesus. (Mark 15:42-47, Luke 23:50-56, John 19:38-42)
And behold, a rich man named Joseph, from Arimathea, who was also a disciple of Jesus, came.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. When Pilate ordered that it be given to him,
And Joseph took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
And they buried him in a new tomb which they had hewn out of the rock; and a large stone was laid against the entrance of the grave, and Jesus departed.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.
And in the morning, which is called the morning after the Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together to Pilate.
And they said: "O our master! We remember how that impostor said, while he was still alive, 'I shall rise after three days'."
That's why I ordered the tomb to be watched until the third day, so that His disciples don't come and steal His body and tell the people: "He has risen from the dead!", thereby further deluding the populace!"
Pilate said to them, "You have a guard; go and make it as secure as you can."
They didn't move it, they placed the candle on the room's threshold and stationed guards by the grave.
The Resurrection of Jesus (Mark 16:1-8; Luke 24:1-12; John 20:1-10)
And when Sunday came, and it was morning, they went to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.
Oh my brother, a huge earthquake occurred. An angel from my Lord descended from the sky, sat on the stone.
And the thunderclouds were shaped like lightning, and their ash was white as snow.
Turned the guards pale with fear, like the dead.
But the angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are seeking Jesus who was crucified."
He's not here, he got up and left just like he said. Go and check the spot where he was sitting.
And hasten to tell His disciples, 'He has risen from the dead, and behold, He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see Him.' Behold, I have told you."
They ran away from the grave, afraid and very happy. They ran towards the students.
And when He had said these things, He showed them His hands
Be not afraid, go and tell my brethren to go into Galilee, and there shall they see me. And the soldiers said...
When the women returned, some soldiers who had gone with them entered the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
And the chief priests and the elders assembled in the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas; and they consulted together, and gave the soldiers a large sum of money,
And they said: "Tell the people, 'His disciples came at night and stole Him away while we were sleeping.' "
When the governor hears the news, we'll appease him and get you out of this mess."
And the soldiers took the money as they were instructed. And this story has been spread among the Jews to this very day. Jesus appeared to His disciples (Mark 16:14–18, Luke 24:36–49, John 20:19–23, Acts 1:6–8).
And straightway the disciples went away to the mountains, to the place which Jesus had appointed.
And the Wise Men fell down and worshipped Him. But some of them went their way, and straightway told all the things unto Herod.
And Jesus came and said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
And teach them to do the thing which I have commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even unto the end of the age.
John the Baptist (Matthew 3:1–12, Luke 3:1–18, John 1:19–28)
This is the beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Behold, I send my messenger, who shall prepare my way;
A voice cries out: "In the wilderness prepare the way of the LORD; make straight in the desert a highway for our God."
John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
And the people of the region of Judea, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, came out to him, and being baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessed their sins.
John's clothing was made of camel hair, with a leather belt. He ate locusts and wild honey.
He was preaching and saying: "Behold, the One stronger than I is coming. We are not worthy to stoop down and untie the thongs of His sandals."
"Anna has baptized you with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit." Jesus' Baptism and Temptation (Matthew 3:13–17; Luke 3:21–22)
At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
And when he came up out of the water, he saw the heavens opening, and the Holy Spirit descending upon him like a dove.
Psalm 2:7; Isaiah 42:1. A voice said: "You are my son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased." (Matthew 4:1-11; Luke 4:1-13)
And the Holy Spirit descended upon Him in bodily form like a dove.

And when Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.
Jesus said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
And their nets broke at the same time, and they followed him.
And after he had walked a little farther, he saw James and John, the sons of Zebedee, preparing their nets.
And at that very hour He cured many who had diseases, and plagues, and evil spirits; and He gave sight to many who were blind. And He answered and said to them, "Let John the Baptist come, and he may seek an answer from you as to whether you are the Expected One, or whether he should look for another." Now the men who had been sent off in the boat, having found Jesus, and being led by Him, followed Him.
And Jesus and His disciples left and went into Capernaum. Now on the Sabbath He entered the synagogue and began to teach.
The attendees were amazed by his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, not like the scribes of the Jews.
And a man possessed with a devil was in

Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness. (Luke 4:42-44)
And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.
Simon walked and he had a little boy with him looking for a place to stay.
When they found him, they said: "Everybody's been looking for you!"
He told them: "Let's go to the nearby cities, so that I can preach there too, because that is why I came."
And he walked in the synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every infirmity among the people.

(Matthew 8:1-4, Luke 5:12-16)
And one leper approached and begged him, saying, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."

And he went about preaching, saying, "The kingdom of God is at hand," and healing everywhere. And the Lord, when He had healed all who were sick, said to Simon, "Go and tell no one the things God has done for you." So he went about and told all the things Jesus had done. And Jesus could no longer openly enter a city, but was outside in desolate places, and they came to Him from every direction.
Jesus Heals a Paralytic Man (Matthew 9:1–8; Luke 5:17–26)
And after a few days Jesus returned to Capernaum, and the news that He was in the house spread about.
Many people gathered so that there was no room left for anyone standing in front of the door. He began to tell them about the Word of God.
They brought in a paralyzed man on a stretcher, carried by four men.
But they could not get near Him because of the crowd. So they removed the roof above Him, and after digging an opening, they lowered the cot on which the paralytic was lying.
When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
And some of the scribes of the Jews who were present, when they heard these words, began to reason within themselves:
"Does this guy speak like that? He's committing blasphemy! Only God can forgive sins."
And Jesus knew what they were thinking in their heart, and He said to them, "Why do you reason about this in your hearts?
Is it easier to tell the paralytic: "Your sins are forgiven", or to say: "Rise, pick up your mat and walk"?
As such, you will know that I, the Son of Man, have authority on earth to forgive sins." Then He said to the paralytic,
Arise! Shake the down, and away to thy dwelling.

And Jesus went out again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted unto him: and he taught them.
And when he was walking, he saw Louay, the son of Halfa, sitting at the tax office desk and said to him: «Follow me!» So he got up and followed him.

Jesus heard them and answered, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have come to call not the righteous but sinners." The Debate over Fasting (Matthew 9:14-17, Luke 5:33-39)
John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came to Jesus and asked him, "Why is it that John's disciples and the Pharisees' disciples fast, but your disciples do not fast?"
Tell them: "How can the guests not fast when the groom is among them? As long as the groom is present, they cannot refrain from eating."
The groom will come on a distant day, That's the day they will fast.
There's no mending old clothes with a new piece of cloth; the new piece would only shrink and eat away at the old one, making the tear even bigger.

And Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples, as they went, plucked the ears of corn.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look, why are your disciples doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?"
Tell them: "Haven't you read what David and those with him did when they were hungry?

The man with the withered hand was healed on the Sabbath. (Matthew 12:9–14, Luke 6:6–11)
And Jesus entered the synagogue again, and there was a man there who had a withered hand.
They started monitoring him to see if that guy would recover on Saturday. They wanted to be able to accuse him.
He told the man with the stiff hand: "Stand up in the middle!"
And Mabaadel asked them: "Is it halal to do good or evil on a Saturday? To save a soul or to take a life?" But they remained silent.
Jesus looked at them intently and said, "With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God."
The Pharisees went out of the Sanhedrin, and at once they took counsel with the Herodians against him to put him to death.
Jesus and His disciples walked by the Sea of Galilee, and a large crowd from Galilee and Judea followed Him.
And Jerusalem and Adom, and the regions beyond the Jordan, and many from the vicinity of Tyre and Sidon, who had come to hear of the great deeds which he had done.

And Judas Iscariot, who was about to betray Him. Beelzebul and Jesus (Matthew 12:22-32; Luke 11:14-23; 12:10)
And Jesus went to a house. The people again gathered together, so that He and His disciples could not even eat.
And when his relatives heard about it, they came to take charge of him, for people were saying, "He has gone out of his mind."
And the book of the Jews who came down from Jerusalem said: "Behold, he is possessed by Beelzebul, the prince of demons; and he casts out demons by the prince of demons!"
Jesus said to them in parables, "How can Satan cast out Satan?

And if the house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
