The genealogy of Jesus Christ (Luke 3:23-38)
This is the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham:
Abraham begat Isaac. Isaac begat Jacob. Jacob begat Judah and his brothers.
And Judah begat Pharez and Zerah of Tamar; and Pharez begat Hesron; and Hesron begat Aram.
And Aram was the father of Minchamin. Minchamin was the father of Salmon. Salmon was the father of Boaz.
And Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab; and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse.
Jesse begat David the king. And David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Uriah.
Solomon begot Rehoboam. Rehoboam begot Abijah. Abijah begot Asa.
Asa begat Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat begat Joram. And Joram begat Uzziah.
Azariah begat Jotham. Jotham begat Ahaz. Ahaz begat Hezekiah.
Hezekiah fathered Manasseh. Manasseh fathered Amon. Amon fathered Josiah.
Josiah took Jehoahaz, his brothers, and those who had remained in Judah and Jerusalem as captives to Babylon.
And after the expiration of their exile in Babylon, Jeconiah had Shealtiel as a son. And Shealtiel had Zerubbabel as a son.
Zerubbabel begat Abiud. Abiud begat Eliakim. And Eliakim begat Azor.
Azor became the father of Zadok. Zadok became the father of Achim. Achim became the father of Eliud.
Eliud begat Eleazar. Eleazar begat Matthan. Matthan begat Jacob.
Jacob was the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
Here is the translation: So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations. The birth of Jesus Christ (Luke 2:1-7)
# The Birth of Jesus Christ When Mary, his mother, was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.
My brother, Youssef, her fiancé, decided to stay away from her without exposing her, because he was a man who feared God.
Joseph, son of David, fear not to take Mary as your wife. She is with child by the Holy Spirit.
"You shall bring forth a child, you shall name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."
And all this happened so that the words spoken by God through the prophet would come true, as he said:
# Isa 7:14 Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel.
When Joseph awoke from his sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him, and went to his wife.
He did not know her until she had given birth to a son, and they called him Jesus.
Gian of the Wise
When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of King Herod, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
And they said, "Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
The chief priests and scribes of the Jews were gathered together, and they sought out all the means to find the place where Christ was born.
Answer: "In Bethlehem, in the land of Judea, because this is what was written by the prophet in the book:"
# Micah 5:2 "But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times."
Herod summoned the wise men privately and learned from them the time the star appeared.
And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, "Go and search for the child. When you find him, come and tell me, so that I too may go and worship him."
After hearing the king's words, they departed. And as they were on their way, behold, the star that they had seen in the east went before them until it came and stood over the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, they were very happy.
They entered the house and found the child with Mary's mother. Then they bowed down and worshiped him, opened their treasures, and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
# The Flight into Egypt And the child's father and mother were warned by God in a dream not to return to Herod, so they took another road and went back to their country. They fled to Egypt.
Get up! Take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.
My brother, Yusuf got up, picked up the child, and left with his mother in the middle of the night for Egypt.
# Matthew 2:17; Exodus 4:22 And he remained there until the death of Herod, that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled: "Out of Egypt I called my son." The slaughter of the infants in Bethlehem
When Herod saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, he became furious, and he gave orders to kill all the children in and around Bethlehem who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had learned from the wise men.
Brother, what the prophet Jeremiah said has come to pass.
# Mt 2:18 "A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and loud lamenting, Rachel weeping for her children; she refused to be consoled, because they are no more." Return from Egypt to Nazareth
When Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
# **English Translation:** And they said: "Get up! Rock the baby, cry and return to the land of Israel, for those who wanted to kill him are dead."
My brother got up, shook the child and his mother, and returned to the land of Israel.
As Herod Archelaus heard that he was appointed king of Judea in place of his father Herod, he feared to go there. Then God warned him in a dream, and he went to live in the region of Galilee.
And he went to a city called Nazareth and lived there, so that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled, saying, "He shall be called a Nazarene."
Gospel according to John the Baptist (Mark 1:1-8; Luke 3:1-18; John 1:19-28)
John the Baptist came to the wilderness of Judea, proclaiming.
"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!"
# Isaiah 40:3 A voice of one calling: "In the wilderness prepare the way for the Lord; make straight in the desert a highway for our God."
John was clothed in camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
People came from Jerusalem, all Judea, and the regions around the Jordan.
They confess their sins and are baptized in the Jordan River.
"When the Pharisees and the teachers of the law saw his baptism, they said to themselves, 'This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.' But when the crowds came out to be baptized, he said to them, 'You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?'"
Do things that show you are capable.
What you should not say in your hearts is: "We are the children of Abraham." I tell you, God is capable of making these stones into children of Abraham.
The axe is already placed on the tree's veins; the tree that doesn't bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
Anna na3madkom bil maa bach atoubou, w ama li bach yji baadi rahou akwa menni, w ana ma nestahlech bach n7iyello sandalo. Houwa bach ya3madkom bil rou7 el qoudous w bil nar.
"He shakes the sheaves of wheat in his hand and spreads the harvest in the hall, gathering the wheat into the storehouse, but the straw, he burns with an unquenchable fire." John baptizes Jesus (Mark 1:9-11; Luke 3:21-22)
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.
John said to him, "I need to be baptized by you, so why have you come to me?"
Jesus answered him, "Let it be so now, for it is proper for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then he consented.
When Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. At that moment, the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him.
"And a voice from heaven said, 'This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.'"
# **Temptation of Jesus** ## Mark 1:12-13 12 At once
And the Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
My brother fasted for forty days and forty nights until he got hungry.
"He rebuked him, saying, 'If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread.'"
# No. 8:3 Jesus answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"
They shook the Bliss of the holy city, and stood at the edge of the temple's roof.
# And they said: "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written in the book: 'He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you carefully; they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'"
# Matthew 6:16 Jesus replied, "It is written, 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'"
He raised his gaze to a distant mountain peak, where he placed all the kingdoms of the world and the glory they held.
They said, "We will give you all of this, if you descend upon your knees and bow down to me."
# Deuteronomy 6:13; Mark 8:33 Jesus answered him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'"
# The Temptation of Jesus And leaving him, Satan departed. And behold, angels came and ministered to him. Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, and saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel." (Mark 1:14-15; Luke 4:14-15)
As Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew to Galilee.
He left Nazareth, went and settled in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali,
"That the vision may be fulfilled which was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah,"
# Isaiah 9:1-2 The land of Naphtali and the land of Zebulun, toward the sea, across the Jordan, Galilee of the nations!
The people who dwell in darkness have seen a great light, and for those who live in the land of the shadow of death, light has dawned.
"And when Jesus began to preach, he said, 'Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.' Jesus called his first disciples (Mark 1:16-20; Luke 5:1-11)."
Jesus was walking by the shore of the Sea of Galilee, when he saw two brothers, Simon, who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.

As he was walking along, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John, in the boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and he called them.
In time, they left them in the boat and followed him. Jesus was teaching, preaching, and healing the sick. (Luke 6:17-19)
Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.
He spread his fame throughout Syria. He brought patients with all sorts of diseases and ailments, those possessed by demons, epileptics, and the paralyzed, and he healed them.
Many people followed him from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan.
The Sermon on the Mount (Luke 6:20-23)
Jesus went up the mountain and sat down, and his disciples came to him at that time.
He began to teach them, saying:
"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
Cheers to the mourners! May they find solace.
Health to the good people! They are the ones who will inherit the earth.
Health to those who are hungry and thirsty for truth! They will be satisfied.
Health to those who will be pitied! They are destined for pity.
May they be blessed with good health, those with pure hearts! They are the face of God, so they shall see.
Health to those who reconcile people! They are God's children, so they should be called.
May they be blessed who suffer for the sake of righteousness! For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Cheers to you when people shame you, torment you, and say all those hurtful words that break my heart!
Rejoice and leap for joy, for your reward is great in heaven. For this is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you. Salt and Light (Mark 9:50; Luke 14:34-35)
You are the salt of the earth, but if salt loses its taste, how will its flavor be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men.
You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
There is no one who lights a lamp and covers it with a bowl; rather, they put it on a stand, and it gives light to all who are in the house.
"Let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven." The Law.
I have not come to abolish the law and the prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
# The Faithful Message I tell you the truth: Heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear. Until everything is accomplished.
He who does not obey one of these least commandments and teaches others to do so, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who practices and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
"Truly I tell you, unless you surpass the righteousness of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven." Hypocrisy.
# Ex 20:13; Deut 5:17; 16:18 "You have heard what was said to your ancestors: 'Do not murder; and whoever murders will be subject to judgment.'
He who cheats his brother must be judged by the court, he who calls his brother a fool must be judged by the council of the Jews, and he who calls his brother a beast must go to hell.
Leave your offering there before the altar and go first to be reconciled with your brother, and then come and present your offering.
# **Matthew 5:23-24** > "So then, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift."
If someone complains about you, make amends with them as soon as possible before you end up in court, so they don't complain to the judge, and the judge speaks to the police officer, and you end up in jail.
You're not leaving until you pay the last penny. Adultery.
# Exod. 20:14; Deut. 5:18 "You have heard what was said to your ancestors: 'Do not commit adultery.'
He who looks at a woman and desires her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your eye makes you sin, pluck it out and throw it away; it is better to lose one part of your body than to have your entire body thrown into hell.

# No. 19:12; Num. 30:2; Deut. 23:21 "You have also heard what was said to your ancestors, 'Do not break your vow and swear falsely using the Lord's name.'
I swear I will tell you not to swear at all, not even by the sky because it is the throne of God.
# Isaiah 66:1; Acts 7:49; Psalm 48:2 Neither in heaven nor on earth, for there is no place for his feet, nor in Jerusalem, for there is no city for the great King.
# Don't swear on your head, because you can't even repay a single white or black hair.
Speak your words as yes or no, and anything extra to this is from the evil one." Revenge (Luke 6:29-30)
# Matthew 5:38: "You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an
Do not repay evil with evil. Instead, if someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other to them as well.
If someone wants to fight with you just to take your grade, let him take your burnous too.
If one forces you to go with them for a kilometer, go with them for two.

What's the reward you deserve if you love those who love you? Isn't it those who collect taxes who should do this on their own?
What else could they have done to you if you didn't give in to them? Don't you think that those who don't fear God could do such a thing with their own hands?
You need to be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.
Charity.
Be careful not to do good deeds in front of people just to be seen; otherwise, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.
When you give charity to someone, do not announce it with trumpets like the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, so that people may praise them. But I tell you the truth: they have received their reward.
As for you, when you give charity, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
Give your charity in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
# Prayer and Hypocrisy But when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly, I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
As for you, when you pray, go into your inner room, close your door, and pray to your Father who is unseen. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
Don't waste your time repeating meaningless words like other nations who think that God will listen to them just because they talk a lot.
# Don't be like them, because your father knows what you need before you even ask.
Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
Let your kingdom come to us, let your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Each day, we are given our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
Our Lord, do not subject us to the test, and save us from the evil.
If you forgive people their trespasses, your Father in heaven will also forgive you your trespasses.

As for you, when you fast, comb your hair and wash your face,
"Let your fasting not be seen by people, but by your Father who sees what is done in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you." (Luke 12:33-34)
# **English Translation:** Do not store up treasures for yourselves on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
Store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
"For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." Noor al-Badaan (Luke 11:34-36)
The eye is the lighthouse of the body. Therefore, if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light.
But if your eye is unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!

Don't worry about your lives, what you will eat or drink, or about your bodies and what you will wear. Isn't life more than food, and the body more than clothes?
Look at the birds of the sky, they do not sow, nor reap, nor gather into barns, yet your Father in heaven feeds them. Are you not much better than they?
Who among you is thinking of adding an extra hour to their life?
Why do you worry about clothes? Look at the pumpkin flower, see how it grows: it doesn't get tired and it doesn't spin.
As Anna said: Not even King Solomon in all his glory was dressed like one of these!
If God dresses the cannabis like this, how much more will He dress you who have weak faith!
That's why you should not worry and say: What shall we eat? Or what shall we drink? Or what shall we wear?
People who lack faith seek all these things, but your Father in heaven knows what you need.
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.
That's why you shouldn't worry about tomorrow, because tomorrow is the day he will worry about himself. Each day has enough troubles of its own.
Do not judge, and you will not be judged.
Don't judge others lest you be judged.
The judgment you pass on others will be passed upon you, and the measure you deal with will be dealt with you.

Would they ask for a fish and give him a snake?

Treat others the way you want them to treat you. That is what the law and the prophets have taught us.

No one pours new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the new wine will burst the skins, the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. No, new wine must be poured into new wineskins. (Mark 5:21-43; Luke 8:40-56)
When Jesus was speaking to them, one of the Jewish leaders came up, knelt down before him, and said, "My daughter has just died. Please come and place your hand on her so that she will live."
And Jesus arose and followed him, with his disciples.
She had been bleeding from her nose for two years, then she came to me and touched the end of my staff.
"She thought to herself, 'If only we had taken his advice, we would have been healed.'"
Jesus' house and his disciples said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace." And the woman was healed at once.
When Jesus arrived at the house of the Jewish leader and saw the crowd playing flutes and people making a commotion,
He said, "Move away! The girl is not dead, she's just unconscious."
When the people left, he grabbed the girl by her hand, and she stood up.
The news of this thing was published in all those areas. Jesus heals two blind men.
As Jesus passed by, two blind men followed him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When he entered the house, the two blind men came to him. Jesus asked them, "What do you want me to do for you?" They answered, "Lord, we want to see!"
"Then Jesus touched their eyes and said, 'According to your faith, let it be done to you.'"
Their eyes were opened. And Jesus charged them, saying, "See that no one knows!"
Jesus healed a leper. They left and spread the news throughout the region.
When the two blind men were going out, a group brought him a mute possessed by a demon.
Jesus threw out the demon and the man was silent. Then the people were amazed and said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!"
As the Pharisees said, "It is by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that he drives out demons." Jesus felt compassion for them.
Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.
When people saw this, they felt sorry for them, as they were worried and tired like sheep without a shepherd.
He said to his disciples: "The crop is abundant, but the harvesters are few."
"So ask the master of the harvest to send his servants to his fields."
The twelve apostles (Mark 3:13-19; Luke 6:12-16)
And he called the twelve disciples to him and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every sickness.
Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;
Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the tax collector, James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus.
Simon, who is zealous for his country, and Judas Iscariot, who is about to betray Jesus. Jesus sends out the twelve apostles (Mark 6:7-13; Luke 9:1-6).
Jesus sent out these twelve, instructing them: "Do not go to any of the Gentile regions, and do not enter any of the Samaritan towns.
Go and gather the scattered sheep of the house of Israel.
You are going to proclaim and say that the kingdom of heaven is near.
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those with leprosy, and cast out demons. You received freely, give freely.
Don't carry gold, silver, or copper in your belts.
No bag, no two dresses, no sandals, nor a stick, because the servant deserves what he ate.
# **English Translation:** And whichever city or village you enter, inquire about the most worthy person there, so that you may enter their home and stay with them until you depart.
As you enter the house, greet the people inside.
If those people in the house deserve it, let your greetings reach them; but if they don't deserve it, your greetings will come back to you.
If anyone does not welcome you or listen to your words, shake the dust off your feet as you leave that house or town.
They will deliver you up to be tried and beaten in synagogues and flogged in public places, and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, to bear testimony before them and the Gentiles. But when they deliver you up, do not be anxious how you are to speak or what you are to say; for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour; for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit. And brother will deliver brother to death, and the father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death. And you will be hated by all for my name's sake. But the one who endures to the end will be saved.

# You bow to rulers and kings for my sake, so that you may testify before them and before other nations.
When they hand you over, don't think about how to speak or what to say; at that moment, your words will fail you.
It's up to you; you're the ones talking, but your dad's way of talking is better than yours.
The brother will hand over his sibling to death, the father his son, and the children will seek out their parents and kill them.
Everyone will hate you because of my name. But those who prove themselves will be rewarded.
When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next; for truly, I say to you, you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
The pupil is not greater than his teacher, and the servant is not greater than his master.
It is enough for the student to be like his teacher and the servant like his master. If the master is called Beelzebul, how will they describe the household?" Fear of the Lord (Luke 12:2-7)
Don't be afraid of them. Nothing hidden will remain undiscovered, and nothing concealed will remain unknown.
What I tell you in the dark, speak in the light. What is whispered in your ears, shout it from the housetops.
# Fear the Eternal Punishment Do not fear when they harm your bodies, for they cannot kill your spirit. But fear the moment when He has the power to destroy both your soul and body in Hell.

"For whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels." Jesus and the World (Luke 12:51-53; 14:26-27)
We don't come here to bring peace to the land, we come to bring a sword, not peace.
I came to tell them apart: the boy and his father, the girl and her mother, the daughter-in-law and her mother-in-law.
Enemies are man's dearest wishes.
He who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. And he who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
He who does not bear his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
"Whoever wins his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it." The reward (Mark 9:36-41)
He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me.
He who accepts a prophet for the sake of being a prophet, does so in order to receive the reward of a prophet. And he who accepts a righteous man for the sake of his righteousness, does so to gain the reward of a righteous man.
"He doesn't even give one of these kids a glass of cold water because he's a student, I tell you, his salary is not wasted."
Disciples of John the Baptist (Luke 7:18-35)
When Jesus had finished instructing the twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities.
John heard about the works of Christ while he was in prison, so he sent word to his disciples.
They said: "Are you the one who's coming, or should we wait for someone else?"
Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John what you have seen and heard."
# Isaiah 35:5-6; 61:1; Luke 4:18-19 The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor.
Cheers to those who don't doubt!
When John's disciples had gone away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
What did you go out to see? To see a man wearing expensive clothes? Those who wear expensive clothes are in the palaces of kings!
What did you come out to see? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you: greater than a prophet.
# Matthew 3:1; Mark 1:2 "Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You."
"Truly, I tell you, among those born of women, there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he."
Since the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you want to believe it, it's Elijah who's going to come.
He who has ears, let him listen!
What do we call this generation? They're like kids in the market, calling out to each other:
I'm sorry, but I'm not familiar with the language of your input. Could you please provide me with the original text and its language?
John is neither eating nor drinking, and you say: "He has a demon."
I came as a man, eating and drinking, and you said, "Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!" But wisdom is proved right by her deeds." The towns that did not repent (Luke 10:13-15)
Jesus began to reproach the cities where most of his miracles were done, because they did not repent.
"Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works done in your midst had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes."
As Anna told you: the state of Tyre and Sidon will be better than yours on the Day of Judgment.
# The Woes of Chorazin and Bethsaida But you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to heaven? You will go down to Hades! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
"So I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom on that day than for you." Jesus rejoices. (Luke 10:21-22)
Jesus spoke at that time and said, "We praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children."
Yes indeed, my father, that was your will.
Papa gave me everything. No one knew the son was the father, and no one knew the father was the son, and everyone chose the son to show him off.
You all are tired and your burden is heavy, and I will relieve you.
Mock my cuff and learn from me, I am kind and my heart is humble, and you will find comfort in your souls.
"My way of carrying my load is not steady, and my burden is light."
Saturday (Mark 2:23-28; Luke 6:1-5)
Jesus was going through the grain fields on his way on the Sabbath, and his disciples began to pick heads of grain, hull them, and eat the grains.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, "Look, your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath."
# I Sam. 21:1-6; II Sam. 24:9 Jesus said to them, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him?"
How did he enter the house of God and eat the bread of the Eucharist, which was not lawful for him and those with him to consume, but was lawful for the priests to eat?
# Numbers 28:9-10 "How is it that the priests in the temple break the Sabbath commandment on the Sabbath day, yet no one blames them?"
There is one here greater than the temple.
# John 6:6; Matt 9:13 If you had known what this verse means: "I desire mercy, not sacrifice," you would not have condemned the innocent.
"And he said to them, 'Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to kill?' But they were silent. And he looked around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, and said to the man, 'Stretch out your hand.' He stretched it out, and his hand was restored." (Mark 3:1-6; Luke 6:6-11)
Jesus walked away from that place and entered their synagogue.
The man had a paralyzed hand. Then they asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?" so that they might accuse him.
Jesus said to them, "If one of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
Man has so much more value than an animal! That's why it's permissible to do good deeds on Saturday.
And then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand!" The man stretched it out, and it was restored, just like his other hand.
The Pharisees went out and plotted against Jesus, scheming how they might kill him. Jesus is the servant chosen by God.
Jesus knew what had happened, and he left that place. Many people followed him, and he healed them all.
Let them be ordered not to tell anyone about it.
This thing happened so that what the prophet Isaiah said would come true:
# Isaiah 42:1-4 "Behold my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit upon him, he shall bring forth justice to the nations."
He doesn't bark or make a sound, not even a soul on the streets hears his voice.
A reed that is bent does not break, and a wick that smokes does not go out. Until he lets right prevail.
And the people had hope in his name. Jesus and Beelzebul (Mark 3:20-30; Luke 11:14-23; 12:10).
At that time, he brought a blind man and a mute possessed by a demon to him. And Jesus healed him, and he began to speak and see.
And the whole crowd was amazed and said, "Could this be the Son of David?"
# The Gospel According to Mark 3:22 But the Pharisees, when they heard it, said, "This man does not cast out demons except by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand."
If the devil casts out the devil, he is divided against himself; then how will his kingdom stand?
If Anna casts out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.
But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
A man cannot enter the house of a strong man and take his belongings unless he first overpowers him and then takes the things from his house.
He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not unite with me is dividing.
That's why I tell you, all the sins and disbelief of people can be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come." The Tree and its Fruit (Luke 6:43-45)
Either make the tree beautiful and its fruit abundant and beautiful. Or let the tree be poor and its fruit be poor. The tree is known by its fruit.
# Sons of Vipers, how can you speak nicely when you are evil? The tongue speaks of what is in the heart.
A fine man brings forth fine things from his fine treasure within, and a wretched man brings forth wretched things from his wretched heart.
They will be held accountable for every empty word they utter on the Day of Reckoning.
"Your words make you seem innocent, yet your words condemn you." The Pharisees asked for a sign. (Mark 8:11-12; Luke 11:29-32)
"At that time, a group of writers from the Jews and the Pharisees said to Jesus, 'Teacher, we want you to show us a miracle.'"
A man replied, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
# Matthew 12:40 For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
# Matthew 12:41: The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now one greater than Jonah is here.
# I Kings 10:1-10; II Chronicles 9:1-12 The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here! The return of the unclean spirit (Luke 11:24-26)
When the cursed spirit leaves a person, it wanders to places without water, seeking comfort, but finds none.
That time says: "So that I can return to my home that I left." And he returns to find it empty, swept, and organized.
"Jesus' mother and brothers (Mark 3:31-35; Luke 8:19-21) came; standing outside, they sent someone to call him. A crowd was sitting around him; and they said to him, 'Your mother and your brothers are outside, asking for you.' And he replied, 'Who are my mother and my brothers?' And looking at those who sat around him, he said, 'Here are my mother and my brothers! Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.'"
While Jesus was still speaking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.
There is one who said, "Your mother and your siblings are waiting outside, they want to talk to you."
"Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?"
He stretched out his hand over his disciples and said: "Behold, my mother and my brothers."
The way whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and my sister and my mother.
A farmer went out to sow his seed. As
Jesus went out to the lake at daybreak and stood by the shore.
A lot of people gathered around him, until he got into a small boat, and everyone stood on the shore.
The farmer went out to sow. And he told them many things in parables:
When he was sowing, some seeds fell on the path, and the birds came and ate them.
Another seed fell on rocky ground, with little soil, but it grew over time because the soil was not too deep.
When the sun rose, it scorched and withered her because she had no veins.
Another seed fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it.
Another seed fell on good soil and produced a crop, one that yielded a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty.
"Those with ears to hear, let them listen!" Why does Jesus speak in parables? (Mark 4:10-12; Luke 8:9-10)
"At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and said to him, 'Why do you speak to them in parables?'"
You who have followed me will know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but they will not.
He who has a way, will find more and acquire abundance. But for those who have nothing, even the little they possess will be taken away.
That's why I speak to them in parables, because they look without seeing and listen without understanding.
# Isa 6:9-10; Mark 8:18; John 12:39-41; Acts 28:26-27 "Be ever hearing, but never understanding; be ever seeing, but never perceiving."
This people's hearts have dried up, they've closed their ears and shut their eyes, so they won't see with their own eyes, won't hear with their own ears, won't understand with their hearts, and they come back to me so I can heal them.
Keep your eyes healthy so you can see, and your ears so you can hear.
"Truly I tell you: Many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it." Interpretation of the Parable of the Sower (Mark 4:13-20; Luke 8:11-15)
Listen up, what does the saying about the farmer mean?
When anyone hears the word about the kingdom of God and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what is sown in the heart; this is what is sown along the path.
But as for that in the good soil, they are those who, hearing the word, embrace it with a generous and good heart, and bear fruit through perseverance.
He has no veins in his body, he'll just wait a bit, and when the time comes for hardship or persecution because of the word, he'll fall.
What you sow among thorns, that is what hears the word, but the cares of this world and the love of riches choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
"But what you sow in the thorny soil, are those who hear the word and immediately receive it with joy, but they have no root in themselves, and so endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they fall away. And others sow among the thorns; these are they that hear the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it proves unfruitful." Like the darnel.
"And he said to them, 'The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.' "
When the people were asleep, his enemy came and sowed weeds all over the wheat and left.
When the seed sprouted and grew into wheat, it also brought forth tares.
The servants of the landowner came and said to him, "Master, you sowed good seed in your field, so where did the weeds come from?"
"He told them, 'One of my enemies did this.' The servants replied, 'So, do you want us to go and gather the weeds?'"
"As he said: 'No, don't uproot the wheat while you gather the darnel.'"
"Let both the wheat and tares grow together until the harvest. And at that time I will tell the reapers, Gather the tares first, and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn."» Like the mustard seed and leaven (Mark 4:30-32; Luke 13:18-19)
The Kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field.
She was the smallest of all the seedlings, but when she grew, she became the largest of all the greenery, and became a tree, to the extent that the birds of the sky come and nest in it.
"The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour until all the dough was leavened."
This is what Jesus said to the people in parables. And he did not speak to them without using a parable.
# Mt 7:13 This thing was so that what the prophet said would come to pass: "So that my mouth would speak in parables, and I would declare things hidden since the creation of the world." Explanation of the parable of the tares
At that time, Jesus left the people and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the tares."
Answer them: "It is the Son of Man who sowed the good seed."
The seed is the world; and the good seed are the children of the kingdom, but the tares are the children of the wicked one.
The enemy who sows them is Satan, and the harvest is the end of time, and the reapers are the angels.
Just as the darnel is gathered and burned in the fire, so will it be at the end of time.
Anna, the Son of Man, will send my angels, and they will gather the corrupt ones and those who do evil in my kingdom.
They will throw them into the midst of the fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth for many years.
The righteous, at that time, will shine like the sun in their kingdom. Let those with ears hear! Like a treasure, a diamond, and a net.
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid; then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.
The kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls.
He found a precious gold piece, sold everything he had, and bought it.
The kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea and gathered together many kinds of fish.
When it was full, the fishermen took it to the shore, sat down, and put the beautiful fish in boxes, and threw away the bad ones.
Thus it will happen at the end of time: the angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous.
They throw them into the fire, and the one who will cry is the one who will be left with the losses of the past years." New and old.
Jesus said to his disciples, "Do you understand all these things?" They said to him, "Yes, we do."
"He said to them, 'That is why every scribe who has been instructed regarding the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.'"
When Jesus had finished this parable, he went away from that place.
"And he began to teach in their synagogues, and was praised by all. They were amazed and said, 'Where did this man get these insights and these miraculous powers?'"
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary? And aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
"Are we not supposed to have all the girls' sisters here? So where did this man get all this stuff?"
They complained about him. Then Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house."
He did not perform many miracles there because they did not believe in him.
# The Death of John the Baptist (Mark 6:14-29; Luke 9:7-9)
At that time, when King Herod heard about Jesus,
"He said to his servants, 'John the Baptist has risen from the dead, and that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.'"
John was arrested and bound, and put in prison because of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother.
Because of John, they said, "It is forbidden for you to take her."
They wanted to kill him, but they feared the people, because they regarded John as a prophet.
When it was Herod's birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced at the party and pleased Herod.
That's why he promised her and swore to give her anything she asks for.
"As his mother's command, she said to Herod, 'Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter!'"
The king was sad, but he ordered that her wish be granted, because of the oath he had sworn and the guests.
John's head was cut off, and his body was left in prison.
They brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, oh my, she fainted in her mother's arms.
The disciples of John came and shook his body, and buried it. They went and told Jesus. Jesus fed five thousand men. (Mark 6:30-44; Luke 9:10-17; John 6:1-14)
As Jesus heard this, he departed from there in a boat and went to a lonely place by himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns.
As the boat docked, he saw many people; he took pity on them and healed their sick.
In the evening, his disciples came to him and said, "The day is almost over, and this place is deserted. Send the people away so that they can go to the villages and buy themselves something to eat."
Jesus said, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat."
They said: "We have only five loaves and two fish."
Jesus said, "Bring them here to me."
And he commanded the people to sit on the grass, and he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves, and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
They all ate and were satisfied. They shook their full bellies, overflowing with leftovers.
The people who ate were about five thousand men, apart from the women and children. Jesus walked on water (Mark 6:45-52; John 6:15-21).
# Mission Accomplished And then he ordered his students to get into the boat and row to the opposite side of the lake, so that he could send people over.
And when the people had been dismissed, he went up into the mountain apart to pray. And when evening was come, he was there alone.
By the time then, the boat was too far from the shore and the waves were too strong for it, because the wind was against it.
And early in the morning he came walking towards them on the lake.
The disciples were afraid when they saw him walking on the water and said, "It's a ghost!" They began to cry out in fear.
"But Jesus spoke to them at once. He said, 'Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.' "
"Lord, if it is you," Peter replied, "command me to come to you on the water."
Jesus said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat, walked on the water and came to Jesus.
As the scout faced the strong wind, he became afraid, started to drown, and cried out, "Lord, save me!"
At that moment, Jesus stretched out his hand, took hold of him, and said, "You of little faith, why did you doubt?"
They set sail, and the wind died down.
They bowed down to him in the boat and said, "Truly you are the Son of God!" Jesus healed many who were sick with various diseases. (Mark 6:53-56)
Jesus and his disciples went to the region of Gennesaret.
When the people of that country heard about Jesus, they spread the news of him throughout the entire region and brought all the sick people to him.
They asked him to let them just touch the fringe of his cloak, and all those who touched it were healed.
The traditions of the fathers (Mark 7:1-13)
The Pharisees and scribes of the Jews came to Jesus from Jerusalem, and said:
# Why don't your students respect the elders' customs? They don't wash their hands before eating.
Answer them: "Why don't you obey God's commandment and hold on tightly to your traditions?"
# Exod 20:12; Deut 5:16; Exod 21:17; Lev 20:9 The Lord said: "Honor your father and your mother, as I have commanded you, so that your days may be long, and that it may go well with you in the land that the Lord your God is giving you."
"But when you say, 'I've been helping my father or mother with what I have, and now I've given it all to God; they don't have to be grateful to me.'"
If you declare that the word of God is invalid according to your traditions,
Ye hypocrites, as Isaiah has foretold, so shall it be said of you:
# Isaiah 29:13 This people honors me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
"Their worship is in vain; they teach but the rules of men." What defiles a person? (Mark 7:14-23)
Jesus called to the people and said to them, "Hear and understand."
"It's not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but it's what comes out of the mouth that defiles them."
"His disciples came to him and asked, 'Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this teaching?'"
Answer them: "Every tree that my father did not plant in the sky will be uprooted."
Keep away from them! They are blind, leading the blind. If a blind man leads another blind man, they will both fall into a pit.
They said to him, "Explain this parable to us."
Jesus said, "How is it that you still do not understand?"
Bro, why is it that everything that goes into the mouth ends up in the belly, and then comes out of the body?
As the need to speak out comes from the heart, it is this that defiles a person.
What comes from the heart are evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, and unbelief.
These are the things that defile a person. But eating with unwashed hands does not defile them." The faith of the Canaanite woman. (Mark 7:24-30)
Jesus left that place and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
"A woman from Canaan came to him from that region and cried out, 'Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is suffering terribly from a demon.'"
He didn't answer her with a single word. His students came and begged him, saying: "Give her what she wants and let her leave us alone; she's following us and shouting!"
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
"As she arrived and dismounted in front of him, she said, 'My lord, help me!'"
"It's not right to take the bread meant for the boys and throw it to the dogs."
She said: "Yes, indeed, sir! Even dogs eat the scraps that fall from their master's table."
Jesus answered her, "Woman, you have great faith! Let it be done for you as you wish." And at that moment, her daughter was healed. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus walked away and passed by the shore of the Sea of Galilee, then went up the mountain and sat down there.
Many people came from Java, bringing with them the paralyzed, the sick, the blind, the mute, and many others. They placed them before his feet, and he healed them.
And the people were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled walking, the lame healed, and the blind seeing. They glorified the God of Israel. Jesus fed four thousand men. (Mark 8:1-10)
Jesus called to his disciples and said to them, "The people have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."
"And the disciples said, 'Where could we get enough bread in this desolate place to feed these people?'"
Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" They replied, "Seven loaves and a few small fish."
Jesus commanded the people to sit on the ground.
# Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes And he took the seven loaves and the fish, gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
They ate until they were full, and they took the remaining seven large baskets, which were filled to the brim.
They were four thousand men, not counting the women and children.
And after he had sent the people away, he went up into the boat and traveled to the region of Magdala.
The signs of the times (Mark 8:11-13; Luke 12:54-56)
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus, and they asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
"And Jesus answered them, 'You know how to discern the face of the sky, but you cannot discern the signs of the times.'"
In the morning, you say: "It's going to rain today, because the sky is dark red." You know how to interpret the sky's appearance, but you cannot explain the signs of the times.
A wicked and adulterous generation looks for a miracle, but no miracle will happen to it except the miracle of Jonah." And he left them and departed. The yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees (Mark 8:14-21)
The students arrived at the opposite shore, forgetting to bring the bread with them.
Jesus said to them, "Watch out and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The pupils discussed among themselves and said, "That's because we don't have any bread."
"But Jesus knew this and said, 'You of little faith, why do you argue among yourselves and say, 'We have no bread'?"
Dude, haven't you understood yet? Don't you remember the five loaves that were distributed among the five thousand, and how many large baskets were left over?
There are the seven loaves for the four thousand. How many large baskets did you fill?
How can you not understand that I am not talking about bread? Be aware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!
That time they understood what he told them to beware of the teaching of the Pharisees and the Sadducees, it is not the leaven of bread. Peter bears witness that Jesus is the Christ (Mark 8:27-30; Luke 9:18-21).
When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
Answer: "Some say you are John the Baptist, others say you are Elijah, and still others say you are Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
"He said to them, «Who do you say I am?»"
Answer, Simon Peter: "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus said, "Greetings to you, Simon son of Jonah! It is not flesh and blood that has revealed this to you, but my Father in heaven."
I say to you, you are Peter, which means a large rock, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
You shall be given the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
At that time, he instructed his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. Jesus spoke for the first time about his death and resurrection (Mark 8:31; 9:1; Luke 9:22-27).
Jesus began to teach his disciples that it was necessary for him to go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests, and scribes of the Jews, and to be killed, and on the third day to rise.
Peter shook Jesus and began to rebuke him, saying, "Never, Lord! This cannot happen to you!"
"But Jesus turned and said to Peter, 'Get behind me, Satan! You are a hindrance to me. You are not setting your mind on the things of God, but the things of men.'"
At that time, Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone wants to follow me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me."
He who wants to end his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for my sake will gain it.
What is the point of a man if he gains the whole world but loses his life? Or what is the thing that a man would sacrifice his life for?
I am the Son of Man, coming in the glory of my Father with his angels, and then I will repay everyone for what they have done.
They speak the truth: there are some standing here who will not die before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
Jesus reveals his spirit to his disciples (Mark 9:2-13; Luke 9:28-36)
And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
And he turned before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothing became white as light.
Behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Jesus.
"Lord, it is good for us to be here; if you wish, I will put up three shelters here: one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah."
As he was still speaking, a bright cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love; listen to him!"
Upon hearing this, the students fell to their knees and were terrified.
Arise, be not afraid.
When they opened their eyes, they saw only Jesus alone.
When they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus ordered them, "Tell no one about the vision until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead."
The disciples asked him, "But why does the book of the Jews say that Elijah must come first?"
Answer them: "Indeed, Elijah is coming, and he will set all things right."
"But I tell you, Elijah has indeed come, and they did to him whatever they pleased, as it is written of him. So also the Son of Man will certainly suffer at their hands."
At that time, the disciples understood what he was telling them about John the Baptist. Jesus healed a boy possessed by a demon. (Mark 9:14-29; Luke 9:37-43)
When Jesus and his disciples came to the people, a man approached and fell on his knees before Jesus, saying:
Oh Lord, have mercy on my child. He suffers greatly and is always falling into fire and water.
"And I brought it to your students, but they couldn't heal it."
Jesus answered, "O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to me!"
Jesus cast out the demon, and it came out of him, and the boy was healed at once.
They came to Jesus privately and said, "Why couldn't we drive it out?"
They said to him, "Because of your little faith! Truly, I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
# 17:21 There are ancient texts that contain this verse: "This type only comes out by prayer and fasting." Jesus speaks again of his death and resurrection (Mark 9:30-32; Luke 9:43-45).
When the disciples were gathered in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men."
"They will kill me, and on the third day I will rise." Don't worry too much. Jesus pays the temple tax.
# The Translation When they had come to Capernaum, those who collected the two-drachma tax came to Peter and said to him, "Does your teacher not pay the tax?"
Answer: "Yes, indeed." And when he arrived home, Jesus spoke first and said, "Tell me, Simon, from whom do the kings of the earth collect taxes and duties? From their own sons or from foreigners?"
Peter said, "I am from Bethsaida." Jesus replied, "You are right, the sons of the land are free."
"But we don't want to cause them any trouble, so go to the lake and cast your line. Reel in the first fish you catch, and when you open its mouth, you'll find a silver coin, enough to pay my taxes and yours. Take it and pay our taxes."
