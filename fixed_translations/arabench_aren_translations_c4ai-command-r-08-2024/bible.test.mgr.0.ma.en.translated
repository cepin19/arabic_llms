The eleventh chapter of the Kingdom of Heaven?
"And they brought the children to him, and said, 'Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me.'" Luke 22:24
He called Jesus to one of the newborns and placed him in their midst.
"Verily, I say unto you: Except ye become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven."
He who humbles himself like this child, is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
Anyone who welcomes someone like Walid is essentially welcoming me.
He who falls into sin, one of these little ones who believe in me, it would be better for him to have a millstone tied around his neck and be thrown into the depths of the sea.
Alas, the people of this world suffer because of the sins they commit! It is inevitable that these things happen, but woe betide those who cause them!
Unless your hand or your leg gets you into sin, cut them off and throw them at yourself, for it is better for you to enter eternal life with one hand or one leg, than to have two hands or two legs and be thrown into eternal fire. When?
If not, your eye will cause you to fall into sin; pluck it out and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. Matthew 5:29 the afflicted lamb.
Don't you dare hurt any of these children, for I tell you: their angels in the heavens are always with their father in heaven.
"The Son of Man came to save the afflicted." #18:11 This verse is missing from many ancient manuscripts.
Do you think that if someone has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, he won't leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go searching for the one that went astray?
I tell you the truth: if he finds it, he will be happier than he was with the ninety-six that he couldn't cash.
"Even the one up there in the sky doesn't want any of these little ones to be lost." The wolf, who is guilty.
# **Translation:** "Except for your brother's sin against you, go to him and argue with him, but only between the two of you. If he listens to you, you will have gained your brother. Luke."
Unless he wants to listen, you have one or two with you so that every word is confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
If he doesn't want to listen to them, tell the people of the church. If he still doesn't listen, consider him like someone who worships idols or a tax collector.
I tell you the truth: Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. Matthew 16:19; John 20:23
We say to you again: if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask for, it will be granted to them by Him who is in heaven.
"Wherever two or three are gathered in my name, I am there among them." The example of the servant who does not forgive.
"Peter came to Jesus and asked him, 'Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?'" Luke
Jesus said to him, "Not seven times, but seventy times seven."
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his slaves.
When he started settling accounts with them, they brought him someone who owed him millions of silver dirhams.
He had no other choice but to let his master sell him, his wife, his children, and all his possessions to repay the debt he owed.
The servant bowed to him and said: "Be patient with me, my master, and I will return everything I owe you."
His master was kind to him, set him free, and forgave him his debts.
When that slave left, he found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred silver dirhams. He grabbed him and hanged him, saying, "Return what I asked for!"
His owner fell at his feet, begging him and said: "Be patient with me, and I will repay you for what I owe you."
He refused, so he took him, threw him in jail, and made him pay back what he owed.
When the slaves saw what happened to their companions, they were deeply saddened and went to inform their master about everything that had taken place.
He shouted at him, his master said to him: "You, this worthless slave! I forgave you that entire debt just because I felt sorry for you."
Why didn't you show mercy to your servant as I showed mercy to you?
A woman is worried, and she sends him to prison so they can torture him until he pays back what he owes.
"That's the way he will do it to you from above unless each of you sincerely forgives his brother."
Chapter 19: Jesus Teaches about Divorce
Jesus finished these words, and left Galilee, and went into the borders of Judaea beyond Jordan.
They followed him in great numbers, and he healed them.
# **Translation:** And the Pharisees came near and asked him, testing him, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
He answers them, saying: "Have you not read in the Book of God that He created man from the dust, a male and a female?"
He said: "This is why the man will leave his father and mother and will unite with his wife, and the two will become one."
They won't be two anymore but one. What God has united, no man can separate.
# Mark 10:3 The Pharisees asked him, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?"
Jesus answered them, "Because of your hardness of heart, Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so."
I am telling you: whoever divorces his wife for any reason other than marital unfaithfulness, and marries another, commits adultery." Matthew 5:32; 1 Corinthians 7:10,11.
"The students said to him, 'If this is the case with men and women, then it would be better for him not to get married at all.'"
Jesus answered them, "Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been granted by God."
There are people born of women who are unable to marry, and there are those whom people have rejected as such. And there are those who do not marry because of the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can understand this, let them understand it." Jesus blesses the little children.
They brought some small children for him to place his hands on them and pray with them, and he scolded the students for bringing them.
Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.
He put his hands on them and walked away. The young man who was dressed like that.
"A young man came to him and asked, 'Master, what good work can I do to have eternal life?'"
Jesus answered him, "Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only One who is good. If you want to enter eternal life, keep the commandments."
He asked him, "What are the commandments?" Jesus replied, "Do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness."
Take care of your back and your mother, and treat those close to you as you want to be treated.
The young man said to him, "I've done all these recommendations, so what else do I need to do?"
"Jesus answered him, 'If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me!'"
However, when the young man heard these words, he left feeling sad, as it was too much of a burden for him.
Jesus said to his disciples, "Verily, I say unto you, it is harder for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."
We keep telling you: it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is relying on wealth to enter the Kingdom of God!
The students were amazed and said, "Then who can be saved?"
People cannot do this, but God can do all things.
"And Peter answered him, 'Behold, we have left everything and followed you; what then will there be for us?'"
Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
# Last Will and Testament And whoever has given away anything, be it their brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, father, mother, children, or their lands, in my name, will have what they gave away returned to them a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life with God.
"For many are called, but few are chosen." Matthew 20:16; Luke 13:30
Chapter Twenty The example of servants in the grape vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a man who was the owner of a vineyard. He went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
He gave them a dinar for the day and sent them to his gardens.
He left his Saudi employer that morning and found other workers standing in the market without employment.
They're going to get what they deserve once I finish my gardens.
They left. And he ignored me again this morning, and then again at three in the afternoon, and hired two more workers.
He went out again around five in the afternoon, and found two other servants standing there. He said to them, "Why are you standing here all day idle?"
They answered him: "No one has ever worked for us." He said to them: "Well, go ahead and wait until I finish my work in my garden."
When evening came, the owner of the garden said to his steward, "Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired until you get to the first."
They came at five o'clock, those he disliked, and gave each of them a dinar.
When the acrobats arrived, they were told they would be paid extra, but in the end, they only received one dinar each.
When they were paid, they started complaining about the owner of the mall.
Those others only worked for an hour and you paid them, while we stayed working the whole day in the sun.
He answered the king's guard, one of them, and said to him: "I didn't wrong you, my friend. Didn't we agree on one dirham?"
# **Translation:** Iwa, take what's yours and go away! And this one who came last, I wanted to treat him just like you.
"Isn't it my right to spend my money as I please? Or are you envious because I'm generous?"
"But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first." Matthew 19:30; Mark 10:31; Luke 13:30 Jesus prophesied for the third time about his death and resurrection.
As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he set apart the twelve disciples and said to them on the way,
# Heading Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and someone will deliver the Son of Man to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. And they will condemn him to death
"They will hand him over to those who do not know God, who will mock him, beat him, and crucify him, but on the third day he will be raised from the death." Mary, mother of James and John, asked Jesus for her sons.
# The Healing of the Canaanite Woman's Daughter Then came the daughter of the Canaanite woman from those borders, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.
# The Translation And Solomon asked her, "What do you wish for?" She replied, "Command that my children sit together, one on your right and the other on your left in your kingdom."
He answered Jesus, "You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink from the cup I am about to drink from?" They said to him, "We can."
They said to me: "Indeed, you will drink it, but the glass on my right and on my left is not mine to give; it will only be given to those who have prepared their own cups."
When the ten disciples heard these words, they became very troubled for Jacob and his brother John.
Jesus called them together and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. Luke
# **Translation:** And this should not be among you. Whoever wants to be great among you, let him become your servant. When?
He who wishes to be first among you must be your servant.
"That's how man was born; he didn't come to be served by people, but to serve and sacrifice his life for many people." Jesus, healing the two blind men.
As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed Jesus.
There were two blind men sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they began to shout, "Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!"
Although people scolded them to keep quiet, they shouted even more and kept saying, "Have mercy on us, master, son of David!"
Jesus stood up and called out to them, saying, "What do you want me to do for you?"
They replied: "We want our eyes to be opened, my lord!"
Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes; immediately they received their sight and followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem, chapter twenty-one.
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,
Go to the roundabout in front of you; you will find a donkey tied up there with a mule. Untie them and bring them to me.
If anyone tells you anything, just say: "The Lord needs them, and He will gather them quickly."
All this happened so that the prophet's words would come true, when he said:
Tell the daughter of Zion, "Behold, your king is coming to you, humble, and mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey."
The disciples went in pairs and did what Jesus had commanded them to do.
They brought the donkey and the colt, placed their garments on them, and Jesus mounted them.
Spread out, a large group of people laid out their belongings on the road, while others cut branches from trees and laid them down as well, creating a path.
# 21:9 Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest heaven!
As they entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and the people asked, "Who is this?"
"And the crowds of people answered, 'This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.' Jesus was driving out the buyers and sellers from the temple."
Jesus entered the temple and drove out all who were buying and selling in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves.
They said to me, "It is written in God's book that this place shall be called the House of Prayer, but you have turned it into a den of thieves!"
Behold, at the Temple, people who were blind and lame came to him, and he healed them.
The chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the scribes were greatly disturbed when they saw the miracles that Jesus was doing. And when they heard the children shouting in the temple courts, "Hosanna to the Son of David!"
They said to him, "Do you hear what these children are saying?" Jesus said to them, "Yes, have you never read, 'From the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise'?"
And after leaving them, he went out of the city to Bethany and spent the night there. Jesus curses the fig tree.
In the morning, when he was returning to the city, he got hungry.
And he saw a fig tree in the way; and he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, "Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever." And presently the fig tree withered away.
When the students saw what had happened, they were amazed and said, "How did the vine wither so quickly?"
# Jesus Answers Them Jesus answered them, saying, "Truly, I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what I have done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and thrown into the sea,' it will happen. Whatever you say will come to pass."
"Ask in prayer, with faith, whatever you need, and you will receive it." Who gave Jesus the authority?
When Jesus was teaching in the temple, the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders came to him and asked, "By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered them, "I will ask you one question; if you answer me, then I will tell you by what authority I do these things:
"From where did John's baptism come? From heaven or from men?'' And they reasoned with themselves, saying, ``If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say to us, 'Why did you not then believe him?'
"Otherwise, they'll say it came from the people, we fear the people because they think of us as a prophet."
They answered Jesus and said to him, "We do not know him." And he said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things." The parable of the two sons.
"A man had two sons, and he went to the first one and said, 'Go, my son, and work today in my vineyard.'"
His son answered him and said: "I don't want to." But he regretted it later and went anyway.
And the wolf went to the second boy and said to him the same as he said to the first, and he answered: "Yes, sir!" But he didn't go.
"And who among these two did Murad's father choose?" They said, "The first one." Then Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
"That is why John came, to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and the prostitutes did believe him. And even after you saw all this, you did not repent and believe him." Luke 3:12; 7:29-30. The parable of the vineyard and the vinedressers.
They heard another example: There was a man who had a piece of land, he planted a vineyard, built a wall around it, dug a wine press, and constructed a tower. Then he leased it to some gardeners and went away.
When it was time to harvest the grapes, he sent his slaves to the gardeners to collect his yield.
The gardeners rose up, captured the slaves, beat one of them, killed another, and stoned another to death.
He sent more slaves than the previous ones, and the gardeners treated them the same way they did with the others.
In the end, he sent his son and said: "They will respect my son."
They said among themselves: "This is the one who will inherit! Let's kill him and take his inheritance!"
They grabbed him, dragged him out, and took him to the vineyard's edge, where they killed him.
"Yes, the owner of the grape garden has arrived, what should he tell those gardeners to do?"
Those wicked ones will surely meet a bad end, and the vineyard will be given to other gardeners who will yield the harvest in due time.
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the scriptures: 'The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes'?"
I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit.
"Anyone who falls on this rock will have their limbs crushed, and anyone the rock falls on will be pulverized."
When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they realized that he was talking about them.
They started to figure out how to capture him, but they were afraid of the crowds of people because they considered him a prophet.
Chapter Twenty-One: Wedding Procession Examples
Jesus spoke to the crowd again, saying:
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son.
The master sent his slaves to call the displayed ones, but they didn't want to come.
They sent more slaves and said to them: "Tell those who are invited: 'I have prepared the wedding and slaughtered the fat oxen and calves, and everything is ready, so come to the wedding!'
They didn't stay there, some went back to their fields, others went to sell and buy.
Two other exhibitors seized their slaves, insulted them, and killed them.
The king was worried and sent his army, who destroyed those rebels and burned their city.
He says to his slaves: the wedding is here, but those we offered it to don't deserve it.
Eva, let's go now to where the roads meet and invite everyone we find to the wedding.
The slaves went out to the streets and gathered everyone they found, the good people and the bad, until the wedding house was filled with guests.
As the king entered to greet the guests, he noticed a man who was not dressed for the wedding.
He said to him, "How did you, my friend, even get in here without wearing your wedding clothes?" The man remained silent because he had nothing to say.
The king said to the servants, "Bind his hands and feet, and throw him out into the outer darkness; there people will weep and gnash their teeth." When?
They are many who are exposed, but those you choose are few." The tax relief for the emperor.
And the Pharisees went away and immediately held a consultation to plot against Jesus, as to how they might trap him in his speech.
The Pharisees and Herodians sent their disciples to Jesus with this question: "Teacher, we know that you are sincere and teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't swayed by others' opinions, for you pay no attention to who they are.
Eva, tell us what has come up for you? Is it okay to pay taxes to Caesar or not?
Jesus perceived their hypocrisy and said to them, "Why do you test me, you hypocrites?"
Show me the money you pay your taxes with! And they gave him a dinar.
Their souls: "Whose picture and signature are on these bills?"
Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and give to God what is God's.
They were amazed when they heard this, and they left him and went away. The question about the sending of the dead.
# The Message of the Sadducees Some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to
# **Translation:** "My Lord, Moses said: 'If a man dies and leaves no children, his brother must marry his wife and father children in his brother's name.'"
We had seven brothers, the eldest got married and passed away, and since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother to marry her.
Thus it happened to the second, the third, all the way to the seventh.
In the end, after they all died, the woman died too.
"So, who among these seven will be the husband of this woman on the Day of Judgment? For they all were her husbands."
Jesus answered them, "You are mistaken, for you do not know the scriptures or the power of God."
On the day of resurrection, people will not be married nor will they be given in marriage, but they will be like angels in heaven.
As for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what God has said to you:
I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living."
And when the crowds heard him, they were amazed at his teaching. The great commandment.
When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.
One of them, a scholar of the law, asked Jesus to test him and said:
"Sir, what is the most important commandment in the religion?"
Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.
This is the first and the most important will.
Treat others as you want to be treated yourself.
"It is on these two commandments that the whole Law and the Prophets hang." Luke 10:25-28, Jesus and the Prophet David.
When the Pharisees gathered together, Jesus asked them a question:
"What do you say about the Christ? Whose son is he?" And they said to him, "The son of David!"
He tempts them: "So how did David, through the revelation of the Spirit of God, receive a call from his Lord when He said:
The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."
"So David calls the Messiah his Lord, how can the Messiah be his son?"
No one could utter a single word in response, and not a single person dared to ask him any more questions from that day onwards.
Chapter twenty-three, Jesus warns his disciples to beware of the scribes and the Pharisees.
Jesus spoke to the crowds of people and to his disciples,
"The scholars of the law and the Pharisees have the right to interpret Moses' law."
# **Translation:** "Well, do everything they tell you and follow their instructions, but don't imitate their actions because they don't practice what they preach."
They bundle up heavy loads, burdensome and difficult to carry, and place them on the shoulders of others. Yet, they don't even lift a finger to help move them along.
They do things just for show, widening their gang tattoos on their arms and foreheads, and lengthening their djellabas.
They like to be in the best seats at parties and the front rows in the houses of prayer.
People in the market greet them and call out: "Hey, sir!"
Don't let anyone make you cry: we're all brothers with one master.
What you call no one in this world Father, for you have one Father, the heavenly Father.
Don't let anyone cry over you: Oh, teacher, because you have only one teacher, and that is Christ.
The eldest among you, especially, should be your servant. When?
He who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted. Luke 14:11; 18:14.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. You yourselves do not enter, and you prevent others from entering.
But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows' houses, and for a pretense you make long prayers. Therefore you will receive greater condemnation. # 23:14 This verse is missing from many of the ancient manuscripts.
Alas for you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! For you travel across sea and land to make a single proselyte, and when he becomes a convert, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves!
Woe to you, blind officials! You say that whoever swears by the House of God, their oath is not accepted, but he who swears by the gold of the House of God must fulfill his oath.
Ah, these fools and blind ones! Is it not gold that makes the House of God sacred, rather than the House of God making gold sacred?
They also say: "An oath sworn on the slaughterhouse is not acceptable, but one sworn on the gift above it, must be fulfilled."
Oh, you blind ones! Why is it so? Is it the sacrifice, or the slaughterhouse that makes the sacrifice sacred?
He who swears by the slaughterhouse is swearing by it and by all that is above it.
He who swears by the House of God, swears by it and by God who resides within.
"But I say to you, make no oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God, or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King." Matthew 5:34
Alas for you, you scholars of the law and you Pharisees, hypocrites! You strain out the gnat but swallow the camel. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former.
Oh, you blind officials! You strain out gnats but swallow camels.
Alas for you, teachers of the law and you Pharisees, hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.
Oh, you blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the dish, so that the outside may become clean as well.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead people's bones and all uncleanness. Your deeds.
"This is how you appear to others: outwardly you seem devout, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and sin."
Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous,
They say: If we had lived in the time of our ancestors, we would not have participated in the killing of the prophets.
You bear witness against yourselves that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
Let's continue and complete what your ancestors have started.
Oh, you snakes, you cunning vipers! How do you plan to escape the torment of Hell? When?
They will send to you the prophets, the wise, and the scholars of the law. Some of them you will kill, and some of them you will crucify, and you will flog them in your synagogues and pursue them from town to town.
Upon you shall fall the punishment for every innocent, pure blood that has been shed on earth, from the blood of Abel, who was righteous, to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
Show me, let me tell you the truth: all this punishment will fall on this generation!" Jesus' love for Jerusalem.
Jerusalem, Jerusalem! You who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you. How often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing.
Your home will remain a ruin for you.
I am, and I say to you: you will no longer see me from now on until you say: «Congratulations to the one who is coming in the name of the Lord».
Chapter twenty-four, Jesus predicts the temple will be destroyed.
Jesus went out and made his way to the temple. His disciples came to him, showing him the temple buildings.
Jesus said to them, "Do you see all these things? Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down." Signs of the end times.
When Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, his disciples came to him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of your coming, and of the end of the age?"
Jesus answered them, saying, "Beware lest any man deceive you."
When many people will come and take my name, saying, "I am the Christ!" and they will deceive many.
You'll hear about the war and the news of war, but don't be scared! Because all of this is bound to happen, but it won't be the end of times.
# Matthew 24:7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.
This is all just the beginning of the pain.
The clock is ticking, and they will hand you over to those who will torture and kill you. The people of the world will all hate you because of my name. When?
It's about time that many people return to their faith, sell each other out, and hate each other.
Many false prophets arise and mislead many people.
Love grows cold for many people because of the multitude of sins.
But he who remained steadfast until the end, he was a brave one. When?
And you will preach the gospel of the kingdom of God to the whole world, and it will be a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come." The great tribulation.
When you see the abomination of desolation in the holy place, as spoken of by the prophet Daniel - he who reads, let him understand!
The rooster crows, and in the Jewish lands, they flee to the mountains.
He who stays on the roof doesn't come down to get what's in his reach. Luke.
He who was in the field shall not return to take his clothes.
Alas for pregnant women and those who are breastfeeding during those days.
Let's go so that your escape isn't in winter or on a Saturday.
# The Vision I would sacrifice time itself for you to avert a great disaster, one that has never occurred before since God created the world, and will never happen again. The vision.
If God had not shown mercy those days, not a single human would have survived, but because of those whom God chose those days, mercy was shown.
It's almost time for someone to tell you: here comes the Messiah, or he's already here! Don't believe it!
When people arise who lie and claim to be Christ, and others who claim to be prophets, performing signs and wonders to deceive, if they can, even those who have been chosen by God.
Yes, I've taught you that before.
# The Gospel of Luke They said to you: "He is in the desert!" Do not go out, or "He is in the inner rooms!" Do not believe them.
As lightning comes from the east and shines forth in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather." Luke 17:37 The coming of the Son of Man.
3:15; Revelation 6:12; 3:15; Revelation 6:13 "After the distress of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken."
Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen. Revelation.
And He will send His angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. The parable of the vine.
# Summer is Coming And learn from this example of the grapevine: when its branches become ripe and turn green, and its leaves start to appear, you know that summer is near.
We'll know when it's complete; when you see all these things happening, know that he's close, right at the doors.
I tell you the truth: this generation won't wake up until all these things happen.
The way to heaven and earth has been shown to us, but my words will never be forgotten. The day and the hour which are unknown.
"But that day and that hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father."
As it was in the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
In the days before the flood, people were eating, drinking, marrying, and giving in marriage until the day Noah entered the ark.
And they did not know what would happen, until the flood came and took them all. So shall the coming of the Son of Man be.
The clock will be two in the field, he will take one and the other will remain.
Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and the other left.
You better stay awake, for you do not know at what time your Lord will come.
You should know that if the owner of the house knew what time the thief would come at night, he would stay awake and not let him steal his house. Luke.
Be there until the end, for the son of man will come at a time you least expect it." The example of the faithful servant.
Who is the faithful and wise servant whom his master put in charge of his household staff to give them their allowance at the proper time?
Sa'adat hadak al-abd alladhi fi al-waqt fa-ashi ghayji sayyiduhu ghayalaqahu kayyudhir al-khidmah allati wassahu 'alayha.
I tell you the truth: he's going to cost you everything you own.
If that slave was ugly and said to himself: My master will be delayed in returning.
He seemed to be beating his slave companions and eating and drinking with the smokers.
Gigi said to that servant one day when he didn't expect it and at a time he didn't know.
He will be severely punished and placed with the hypocrites. Then where will be the crying and the gnashing of teeth?
Chapter Twenty-Five The Example of the Ten Virgins
# The Parable of the Ten Virgins Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. Those who were foolish took their lamps but did not take any oil with them. But the wise ones took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
They were five of them, the clever ones, and five others, the wise ones.
They shook those five stingy misers and their lanterns without taking any extra oil with them.
The five wise virgins took their lamps and oil in the flasks.
When the groom got delayed, all the single women started dancing until they fell asleep.
At the dead of night, you hear a loud voice shouting: "Here comes the groom, come out and meet him!"
They woke up all the spinsters, and found their lanterns.
**Input:** وݣالو البهلات للعاقلات: عطيونا شوية من الزيت ديالكم حيت القنادل ديالنا قربو يطفاو. **English translation:** The foolish ones said to the wise ones: Give us some of your oil, because our lamps are about to go out.
The sensible ones among them answered them and said: "It might not be enough for us and you, go buy it from those who sell it."
As they were going to buy oil, the groom arrived, and they entered with him those who were present to the wedding place, and the door was locked.
And then the bachelors returned to the others and said: Oh sir, oh sir, help us! Luke
The groom replied: "Actually, I don't know you."
Ewa, sahraw on hadchi, hit ma ktarfo la nhar wala saa [alli ghijji fiha wald el insaan]. The last part of this ayah is missing from many old manuscripts.
The kingdom of heaven is like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted them with his money. Parable of the bags of gold. Luke
He gave five bags of money to one, two to another, and one bag to the third, each according to his ability. And he went on his journey.
That guy who got five stacks of cash started buying and selling with it, and made a profit of five more stacks.
That guy who won two prizes also won two more prizes.
That guy who took one bag, he went and dug a hole in the ground and buried the bag his master gave him.
After a long period of time, the master of those slaves returned and settled accounts with them.
He came to him with the five dirhams he had and paid with another five dirhams, and said: "Sir, didn't you give me five dirhams? Here, take these other five dirhams that I won as a bonus."
He said to him, "I have nothing to ask of you, for you are a good and trustworthy slave! You were honest with me in little things, and now I will entrust you with much more. So come, rejoice with your master."
And then, he came with two tickets, and he said: "Hey sir, you gave me two tickets, so here, take these two extra ones that I won."
He said to him, "My lady, I have nothing to ask of you, you are a good and faithful servant! You were faithful to me with little, and now I will entrust you with much. Come, rejoice with your master."
After that, that man who had a single bundle came to him and said: "Sir, I know that you are a tough man, reaping what you haven't sown and gathering what you haven't known."
I was afraid, so I buried your bundle in the ground, and here is your fortune.
He answered him, saying: "You are an ugly and ungrateful slave! So, you finally realized that I reap what I didn't sow and gather what I didn't grow?"
You should have invested my money with the money traders, so that when I return, I can take it back with its profit.
Shadow him and add this bundle to the one with ten bundles he has.
He who has will be given more, and he who has not will have what he has taken away. When?
"This worthless servant should be thrown outside into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth." Matthew 8:12; 22:13; Luke 13:28 The son of man will judge the nations.
When man was born into his glory, with all the angels, then he sat on the throne of his glory. When?
And all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate people one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
Lead the sheep to his right hand and the goats to his left.
"And the king said to those on his right hand, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.'
When I was hungry, you gave me food, I was thirsty, you gave me drink, and I was a stranger, you welcomed me.
I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.
The clock will answer those who did what God wanted and will say: "My Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you? Or thirsty and give you drink?"
When did we see you as a stranger and welcome you? Or naked and clothed you?
When have we ever seen you sick or in prison and came to visit you?
The king will answer them and say: "I tell you the truth: every time you did this to one of my younger brothers, you did it to me!"
Stay away from those on his left: the accursed ones destined for the everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil and his angels.
When I was hungry, you did not feed me, and when I was thirsty, you did not give me a drink.
I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and imprisoned and you did not come to me.
At that hour, they will be answered and told: "My Lord! When did we ever see you hungry or thirsty, a stranger or naked, sick or in prison, and not assist you?"
The king will answer them and say: "I tell you the truth: since you didn't do this for those who are less fortunate, you didn't do it for me either."
"These will go to eternal punishment, but those who have done what God wills will go to eternal life."
Chapter twenty-six, the Jews consulted to kill Jesus.
When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples,
They know that Easter is only two days away, and the Son of Man will be betrayed into the hands of men to be crucified.
We sacrifice our time, as the leaders of the religious men and the elders of the people gather in the house of Caiaphas, the chief priest.
They consulted with one another to seize Jesus by trickery and kill him.
But they said, "We won't do this on the feast day, so that there won't be a riot among the people." The woman who poured perfume on Jesus
When Jesus was in the house of Simon the Leper in Bethany,
The woman had an expensive perfume bottle, and she spilled it all over his head while he was sitting next to the food table. Ouch!
When her students saw what she had done, they were not pleased and said, "Why this waste?"
"Since this scent could be sold for a high price, and its proceeds could be distributed to the poor."
Jesus, knowing what they were planning to do to her, said to them, "Why are you harassing this woman? She has done nothing but good to me."
The poor you will always have with you, but I will not always be with you.
She stole this scent from my personal belongings; she stole it to prepare me for my burial.
I tell you the truth: wherever this good news is proclaimed in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be told, in memory of her." Judas the traitor agreed to hand over Jesus.
I sold you for a moment, one of the ignorant students whom you named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests of the religious leaders,
He said to them, "What will you give me if I hand him over to you?" They agreed to give him thirty pieces of silver.
Since that time, Judas has been looking for an opportunity to hand over Jesus. The Passover supper with the disciples.
On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"
Go to the city to see so-and-so and tell him, "My master says: 'My time is near. I am coming to spend Passover with you and my disciples.'"
The disciples did as Jesus had instructed them and prepared the Passover meal.
As the evening meal approached, Jesus sat at the table to eat with the twelve disciples.
While they were having dinner, he said to them, "I will tell you the truth: one of you will hand me over."
The students were very sad and each of them began to ask: "Is it me, sir?"
He answered them, saying, "The one who has his hand in the dish with me, he is the one who will betray me!"
A man is born to die as it is written for him in the book of God, but woe to that man who delivers the child to death, it would have been better for him if the child had not been born.
"And he [Judas] motioned to them, saying, 'Whom I kiss, that is he. Take him.' So when he came, he went immediately and said to Jesus, 'Greetings, Rabbi!' and kissed him. Jesus said to him, 'Friend, do what you came to do.' Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and arrested him." "The Lord's Supper"
As they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed God, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is my body."
And after God, the cup was passed around, and they thanked God. He said, "Drink from it, all of you."
This is my blood, the blood of the covenant that will wash away the sins of many people so that they may be forgiven.
I say to you: from this day forward, I will not drink this grape juice again until the day comes when I can drink it with you anew in the kingdom of my father.
And after, they praised God and went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus predicted that Peter would deny him.
Jesus said to them, "This very night all of you will disown me, for it is written: 'The shepherd will be struck, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'
But after I have been raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you into Galilee." Matthew
"And Peter answered him, 'Even if everyone else doubts you, I will never doubt you!'"
Jesus said to him, "Truly, I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
Peter answered him, "Even though I know I might die with you, I will never forsake you!" And all the disciples said the same. Jesus was praying in the Garden of Gethsemane.
Jesus took his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and said to them, "Sit here while I go and pray over there!"
And after that, he took Peter and the sons of Zebedee with him, and he began to feel sorrow and distress.
My soul is very sad, even unto death; remain here and keep watch with me!
# Prayer for Forgiveness Give me some time, and I'll kneel and start praying, saying: "Oh Father! If it's possible after this trial, not as I want, but as You want."
"Then he returned to the disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, 'So, you could not even stay awake with me for one hour?'"
Stay awake and pray so that you don't fall into temptation, for the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak."
He walked for the second time, prayed, and said: "Oh Father! If it cannot be for this trial to pass me by without my experiencing it, then let Your will be done."
He returned and found them dozing, as sleep had overcome them.
He left them again and walked away, praying for the third time and repeating the same words.
"From now on, he went to his disciples and said to them, 'Are you still asleep and at rest! Behold, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of sinners.'
Let's go! That's the one who's going to hand it to me. Jesus, I'm getting pulled.
And while Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. He was accompanied by a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
That man who surrendered gave them a sign and said, "The man we're going to kiss is him, grab him!"
"And behold, two of them were going that very day to a
"And Jesus said to him, 'Why have you come to me, friend?' Then they came near to Jesus and seized him."
A disciple of those who were with Jesus put his hand into his pocket, drew out his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back in its place. For all who draw the sword will die by the sword."
Do you think I can't call my dad right now and have him send over more than a dozen squads of angelic soldiers?
"But how can the words in God's book come true and show that this is the way it should be?"
"Then Jesus said to the crowds, 'Did you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me like you would a robber? Day after day I was with you in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me.' Luke"
However, all this happened so that what was written in the prophets might be fulfilled." Then the disciples all left him and fled. Jesus before the court of the Jews.
They took Jesus to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
Peter followed him at a distance, right to the courtyard of the high priest, where he went in and sat with the servants to see what would happen.
The religious leaders and the chief priests were looking for false testimony against Jesus so that they could put him to death.
However, nothing was found, even though many false witnesses came forward. In the end, two witnesses testified.
They say: "This man said: 'I can destroy the House of God, but you, build it!'" John
"The high priest stood up and asked Jesus, 'Will you not answer anything these men are testifying against you?'"
Jesus remained silent, and the high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us: Are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
"Jesus answered him, 'You have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Power and coming on the clouds of heaven!'"
At that hour, the chief of the clerics gathered his belongings and said, "This is blasphemy! We no longer need witnesses, for you have all heard his words of infidelity."
"So what do you think about him?" they asked. "He deserves to die!" they replied.
They were punching him in the face and some of them slapped him.
"Come on, prophesy to us, O Christ, who hit you?" Peter was ashamed of Jesus.
Peter was outside, in the courtyard of the house, when a servant girl came to him and said, "Even you were with Jesus of Galilee!"
"I deny it in front of all of you, and I say: 'I don't know what you're talking about!'"
And then, he walked towards the entrance of the house, and another servant saw him and said to those who were there, "This one was also with Jesus of Nazareth!"
I deny it again, I swear, and say: "I do not know this man!"
Certainly, here is the translation: And then those who were standing there approached and said to Peter, "Surely you are one of them, for your speech gives you away!"
He started cursing and swearing, saying, "I don't even know this guy!" At that moment, the rooster crowed.
Peter thought about the words Jesus had said to him, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." He went outside and wept bitterly.
Chapter Twenty-Seven
In the early morning, the religious leaders and the elders of the people all agreed to put Jesus to death.
They bound him, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate, the governor. Judas Iscariot hanged himself.
When the cock crowed, and he saw Judas, who had betrayed him, he regretted it and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
They said to me, "I've done wrong because I greeted someone who had no fault." They replied, "That's not our concern, sort it out yourself."
Judah threw the silver coins into the temple treasury and then went away and hanged himself.
The heads of the religious men took the silver and said: "It is not lawful to put it in the treasury of God's house, for it is the price of human blood."
They agreed to buy an acre of the potter's field and turn it into an orchard for the foreigners.
They call this piece of land the "Field of Blood" to this day.
They paid thirty pieces of silver, the price that some of the Israelites had agreed upon,
"And with that wish, he bought the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me.' Jesus stood before Pilate, the governor."
Jesus stood before the governor, who asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" Jesus replied, "You have said so."
When the heads of the religious leaders and elders accused him, he did not answer them at all.
Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear how many charges they bring against you?"
Jesus did not answer him with even a single word, and this greatly astonished the governor.
The governor had a custom, every Easter he would release one of the prisoners whom the people desired.
They had a rooster, and at one o'clock the famous prisoner, whose name was Joshua Barabbas, was released.
When the people had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Whom do you want me to release for you, Jesus Barabbas or Jesus called Christ?"
When Pilate knew that they had handed Jesus over out of envy,
# Pilate's Wife's Warning As Pilate sat on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him: "Have nothing to do with that righteous man. I suffered greatly in a dream today because of him."
The religious leaders, elders, and chiefs incited the crowds to ask Pilate to release Barabbas and kill Jesus.
# **English Translation:** Pilate addressed them, asking, "Which of these two do you want me to release to you?" They answered, "Barabbas."
Pilate said to them, "What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all said, "Crucify him!"
They said to him, "What evil has he done?" But they increased in their defiance and said, "Crucify him!"
When Pilate saw that it was getting him nowhere, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood; see to it yourselves."
The entire people answered him, saying, "Let his blood be on us and on our children!"
They released Barabbas to them at once, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified. The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium); and they called together the whole cohort.
The governor's soldiers led Jesus to the governor's palace, and they gathered the entire cohort of soldiers around him.
He was dressed in a red cloak.
They plaited a crown of thorns and put it on his head, placed a reed in his right hand, and knelt before him, mocking him and saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
They swarmed him, took the cane, and hit him on the head with it.
After they had mocked him, they removed his cloak and dressed him in his own clothes, and led him away to be crucified. Jesus was crucified.
As they were taking him out of the city, they met a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they compelled him to carry the cross of Jesus.
They arrived at the place I called Golgotha, which means the place of the skull.
They gave him wine mixed with a herb called "al-mar," but he refused to drink it after tasting it.
They crucified him and divided his possessions among themselves after they strummed the oud for him.
Stay in the garden, then the guards over him.
"And there was a written notice above him, which read: 'This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.'"
At that hour, they crucified him with two thieves, one on his right and the other on his left.
People passing by would mock him, turning their heads in disdain.
"They said, 'If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from the temple and rebuild it in three days.' But he replied, 'It is also written: Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'"
The heads of the religious leaders, scholars of the law, and the elders were also laughing at him and saying:
He survived, but he couldn't save his own head! Unless he is the King of Israel, he should come down from the cross now, and then we might believe in him!
Yaak, he's relying on God! Well, let him be free now if he wants to, since he said: "I am God's son!"
Even the thieves who were crucified with him reviled him in the same way. The death of Jesus.
And darkness fell upon the land, from noon until three in the afternoon.
And about three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
They heard him and some of those who were standing there said, "He's calling for Elijah."
One of them ran and grabbed a piece of cloth, dipped it in vinegar, soaked it in a reed, and offered it to him to drink.
They say to the others, "Let's wait and see if Elijah will come to save him!"
Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and died.
The raw foundations of God's house are two, from top to bottom. The earth shakes and splits the rock.
The graves become sweeter and many people are lured by those sanctified by death.
They emerged from the graves after Jesus had followed them from death, entered the Holy City of Jerusalem, and appeared to many people.
When the captain of the guard and the soldiers who were with him saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified and exclaimed, "Surely this man was the Son of God!"
Many women had followed Jesus from Galilee, and they were there when he was crucified. They stood at a distance, watching. (Luke)
Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee's sons. The tomb of Jesus.
In the evening, a man named Joseph came, dressed in a robe, a disciple of Jesus.
The man entered and approached Governor Pilate, requesting that he be given the body of Jesus. At that moment, Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
And God wrapped Joseph's body in two pure shrouds.
He placed her in the new tomb he had carved in the rock, and then rolled a large stone across the entrance. He walked away.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven,
"And on the next day, which followed the day of preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate,"
He said to him, "You remind me, my lord, of that liar when he was alive, claiming that after three days he would be sent back." When?
Let's give the order to keep the guard at the tomb until the third day, so that his students don't come at night to steal it and tell the people: "He has returned from the dead!" This last lie will be even worse than the first one.
Pilate said to them, "You have a guard; go, make the grave secure as best you can."
They went to the room of the grave and lit a candle, then they kept watch over it.
Chapter Twenty-Eight: Jesus Emerges from Death.
On the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.
And suddenly, a powerful earthquake occurred; the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, came, and disturbed the stone that was at the entrance of the tomb, and sat on it.
He was slender like lightning and his clothes were white as snow.
The sheep thundered with fear and lay still, like the dead.
But the angel said to the women, both of them, "Do not be afraid! I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified,
Our path doesn't lead here, since he followed from death as he said. Come and see the spot where he was placed.
"Hurry and tell his disciples that he has been raised from the dead, and he will meet you in Galilee. That's where you will see him. So, there you have it. I've told you."
The women emerged from the grave, scared but overjoyed, and ran to bring the news to their students.
He met them unexpectedly, and Jesus said to them, "Peace be upon you!" They came up to him, took hold of his feet, and bowed down to him.
Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid! Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; they will find me there." The guards reported what had happened.
When the women were leaving, some of the guards of the tomb went to the city and informed the leaders of the religious men about everything that had happened.
They gathered with the elders and consulted about this matter, bribing the soldiers with a lot of money.
They said to them, "Say that the students came at night and stole it while we were asleep."
"Otherwise, the governor will spread the news. We'll convince him; nothing bad will happen to you."
# The Legend of the Money and the Shepherds And the shepherds took the money as they were instructed, and that's how the story spread among the Jews until this day. Jesus sent his disciples on a mission.
The disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
And those who saw him prostrated before him, but some of them complained.
Jesus drew near and spoke to them, saying, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
# Matthew 28:19 Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
Teach them to do their best to follow what I have instructed you about, and I will be with you for all the days, until the end of time.
Chapter one: John the Baptist prepares the way for Jesus.
This is the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
As it is written in the Book of the Prophet Isaiah:
I heard a voice in the desert saying: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way."
John came to the wilderness, baptizing people and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. He prepared the way for the Lord, and led his people on their journey.
# The Baptism of Jesus And people went out to him from the whole region of Judea and all the people of Jerusalem, and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins.
John the Baptist wore clothes made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
He was telling the people, "Someone is coming after me who is stronger than me, and I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the strap of his sandals."
I baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.' John baptized Jesus
Jesus of Nazareth, who was from Galilee, was baptized in the Jordan River by John.
The hour when he emerged from the water, his face radiant, and the spirit of God descended upon him like a dove.
And a voice came from heaven, saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." Matthew 3:17, 12:18; Mark 9:7; Luke 3:22 Satan tempted Jesus.
I sacrifice my time, and the Spirit of God, Jesus, went out into the wilderness.
# The Gospel of Luke 4:13 And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season. And the angels came and ministered unto him. Now Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee.
After John was put in prison, Jesus went to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.
"The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel." Mark 3:2 Jesus chose the first of his disciples.
As Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
They were Simon, whom he named Peter, and his brother Andrew; James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
They left their window and followed him at that hour.
He hailed them and saw that it was Jesus, and John who was with him.
# Mark 1:16-19 And Jesus, seeing a man sitting by the tax booth, said to him, “Follow me.” And he got up and followed him. And when he was in the house, Jesus said to him, “See, I make you a fisher of men.” And they went out and saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth, and they said to him, “Follow me.” And he got up and followed him.
# **English Translation:** And they went to Capernaum. And immediately on the Sabbath day he entered the synagogue and began to teach.
People were amazed by his teachings, for he instructed them as if he possessed authority, not like the scholars of the religious law. When
There was a man living in the mosque, possessed by a jinn, he started to scream.
He said: "What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!"
Jesus stood up and rebuked the evil spirit, saying, "Be quiet and come out of him!"
The jinn knocked the man to the ground and started rolling around, and the man shouted with all his might, and the jinn came out of him.
People were amazed and started whispering among themselves, "What is this? This is a new kind of teaching, using authority, even madness obeys his commands!"
# Mark 1:28 The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout all the region of Galilee. Jesus was healing Simon's mother-in-law and many others.
Jesus went out with James and John from the house of prayer, and they were walking to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Naseeba was lying in bed with a fever, and they informed Jesus about her.
He approached her, took her hand, and she stood up. The warmth dissipated, and they were left alone.
Last evening, when the sun had set, they brought to Jesus all who were sick and those who were possessed by demons.
All the people of the city had gathered by the door.
Jesus healed many who were sick with various diseases; he also cast out many demons, and he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was. Jesus was teaching.
Jesus got up early in the morning, while it was still dark, and departed and went out to a lonely place, and there he prayed.
Simon and those with him began to search for him.
When they found him, they said to him, "Everyone is looking for you!"
Come with me to the neighboring towns, so that I may proclaim the message there also; for that is what I came out to do.
And he went about preaching the good news and driving out demons in their villages. Matthew 4:23; 9:35 Jesus healed a man from Magdala.
# **English Translation:** A man named Magdiel came to Jesus, fell on his knees before him, and pleaded, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."
He embraced him, extended his hand, touched him, and said, "I wanted to, so be pure!"
At that hour, the pigs fled from him, and Tahir turned away.
Jesus sternly warned him and sent him away at once, saying, "See that you say nothing to anyone."
Be careful not to tell anyone anything! But go and show yourself to the religious man and do what Moses instructed for your purification, so that it may serve as evidence for them.
But that man went out and started telling everyone about all the things that had happened to Wa'id. From then on, Jesus could not openly enter a town, but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.
Chapter Two Jesus heals a paralytic
And after a few days, Jesus returned to Capernaum, and it was heard that he was at home.
A large crowd gathered, leaving no space even in front of the door. He began teaching them the word of God.
They brought him a paralyzed man, carried by four men.
They couldn't get close to him due to the crowd, so they removed the roof above the spot where he was sitting, made an opening, and pulled out the mattress where the paralyzed man was sleeping.
And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "My child, your sins are forgiven!"
They were sitting, and some religious scholars said to themselves:
Why is this man speaking like this, and uttering words of blasphemy? Who can forgive sins other than Allah alone?
Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Why do you discuss because of your lack of faith?"
It's not that easy, they say to the paralyzed person: Your sins are forgiven, but they don't say: Get up, shake off your blanket, and go?
"But you should know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." He said to the paralytic,
"You say: Get up, pick up your bedding, and go home!"
The man stood up, shook his mat, and walked out in front of everyone. They were all amazed and gave glory to God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!" Jesus chose Matthew.
Jesus returned to the Sea of Galilee, and a crowd gathered around him, and he began to teach them.
When Matthew saw a man named Levi, who was sitting at the tax office, he said to him, "Follow me." And he got up and followed him.
While Jesus was eating in Levi's house, many tax collectors and sinners sat and ate with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.
When the Pharisees saw that Jesus was eating with sinners and tax collectors, they said to his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
He heard them and said to them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners." They asked him about fasting.
The disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting. They came and said to Jesus, "Why do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"
"Can the guests of the wedding fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast."
They will reach the age when one of them will be chosen as the bridegroom, and on that day they will fast.
Even one doesn't patch old clothes with a piece of new fabric, because if they do that, the new patch will catch and the tear will only get bigger.
No one pours new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the new wine will burst the skins, the wine will run out, and the wineskins will be ruined. No, new wine must be poured into new wineskins. Jesus was teaching about the Sabbath.
Keep the Sabbath day holy # 2:23, which is the day of rest and worship for the Jews.
The Pharisees came and said to him, "Look! Why do your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?" Jesus passed through the fields of grain, and as they made their way, his disciples began to pluck the heads of grain.
Jesus replied to them, "Have you never read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him?"
"How did he enter the House of God, and eat the bread that was offered to God, which no one else was supposed to eat except the priests alone, and he even gave some to the men who were with him?"
He said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
"Where man was born, God was born too, even on the Sabbath."
Chapter three: Jesus healed on the Sabbath.
Jesus entered the synagogue again, and a man was there who had a paralyzed hand.
The Pharisees watched Jesus closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath, so that they might find an accusation against him.
Jesus said to the man with the paralyzed hand, "Stand up and come forward!"
"What is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?" But they remained silent.
# The Miracle of Jesus Angry and compassionate, he looked at them, and he was deeply saddened by their hardness of heart. He said to the man, "Stretch out your hand!" He stretched it out, and it was restored to normal.
The Pharisees then went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus. And a large crowd was following him.
Jesus went out with his disciples by the Sea of Galilee, and a great multitude followed him from Galilee and Judea.
And from Jerusalem and Edom, and from the other side of the Jordan, and from the region of Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude came to him, hearing all that he was doing.
The students prepared a boat for him so that people would not crowd around him, Mark.
When he healed many of them, all the sick people started crowding around him to touch him.
And those possessed by demons, when they saw Jesus, fell down before him and cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone who he was. Jesus chose the twelve apostles.
He went up the mountain and called out to the men he had chosen, and they came to him.
He chose twelve, whom he named apostles, that they might be with him and that he might send them forth to preach.
They have the power to unleash madness.
And these are his disciples: Simon, whom Jesus named Peter,
Jacob, son of Zebedee, and his brother John, whom Jesus named Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder,
Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot.
Judas Iscariot, who will betray Jesus. Jesus and Beelzebub.
And afterward Jesus went to a house. The crowd gathered again, so that he and his disciples could not even eat.
When Jesus' family heard about it, they went to take him, for they said, "He is out of his mind."
# Mark 3:22 The scribes from Jerusalem said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul! And by the prince of demons he casts out demons."
Jesus called to the religious scholars and spoke to them in parables, saying, "How can Satan drive out Satan?"
No kingdom divided and its people warring against each other can remain stable.
If a family starts to divide and they begin to backbite each other, that family will never be stable.
