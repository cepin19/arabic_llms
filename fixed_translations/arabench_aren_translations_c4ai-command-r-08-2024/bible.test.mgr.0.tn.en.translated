Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? (Mark 9:33-37; Luke 9:46-48)
At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Jesus called a young boy and stood him among them.
"Verily, I say unto you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
He who humbles himself and becomes like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
He who accepts a little boy like that, because my name accepts me.
He who is a stumbling block for one of these little ones who believe in him, it would be better for him if a large millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the heart of the sea.
Alas, the world is full of temptations that lead people astray! These things are inevitable, but woe betide the person who brings about the temptations that cause others to sin!
If your hand or leg makes you commit sins, cut it off and throw it away, for it is better to enter eternal life maimed or crippled than to be cast into eternal fire with your hands and legs intact.
If your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away; it is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell. The Lost Lamb (Luke 15:3-7)
Be careful not to underestimate any of these boys. I tell you, their angels in heaven are always watching my father's face in heaven.
# 18:11 There are ancient texts with this verse: "Behold, I am the Son of Man, come to seek and to save the lost."
What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and loses one of them, doesn't he leave the ninety-nine in the mountains and go search for the lost sheep?
He will rejoice over it more than over the ninety-nine who never strayed.
"For I say unto you, that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven." (Luke 17:3)
If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother.
If he refuses to listen to you, take one or two others along, so that every word may be confirmed by two or three witnesses.
If he doesn't want to listen to them, tell the church, and if he doesn't want to listen to the church, consider him an unbeliever and an outcast.
You have the keys: whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
# Matthew 18:19 Again I say to you, that if two of you agree on earth about anything that they may ask, it shall be done for them by My Father who is in heaven.
"Wherever two or three gather in my name, I am there among them." Like a servant who does not forgive.
"At that time, Peter came to Jesus and asked, 'Lord, how many times shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?'"
Jesus said: "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wants to settle accounts with his servants.
Liver, he's being held accountable for every little thing; they brought someone to question him about money, no holds barred.
As he finished, his master ordered that he and his wife, children, and all their possessions be sold to pay off his debts.
My man fell on his knees and said, "My lord, my lord, just be patient and I'll pay you back for everything!"
# **Arabic to English Translation:** # My master mocked him, forgave him, and waived his debt.
The servant seemed to be leaving when he encountered another servant like him and asked him for some money. Then he strangled him and said, "Pay me the money you owe me!"
My brother fell on his knees and begged, saying, "Just wait for me, I'll pay you soon."
He didn't like it and left, and they put him in jail until he paid off his debt.
The servants discovered what had happened to the others, they were very worried and went to inform their master about everything.
That time, he called his servant and said: "You wicked slave! I have forgiven you that entire debt, because you pleaded with me."
"And you, you have no right to show mercy to your servant, your friend, when I showed mercy to you?"
Cheat for your master, and hand him over to the prison warden until he pays off his entire debt.
Thus, my father in heaven will do to each one of you if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.
Marriage and Divorce (Mark 10:1-12)
As Jesus finished speaking, he left the region of Galilee and went to the region of Judea, crossing the Jordan.
Many people followed him, and the one who came after healed them.
A group of Pharisees came and tested him by asking, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?"
Answer them: "Dude, didn't you read that the one who created them in the first place created them as female and male."
# Gen 1:27; 2:24; Eph 5:31; 1 Cor 6:16 He said, "That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh."
They are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.
# Matthew 24:1-4 The Pharisees asked him, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?"
Jesus said to them, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But from the beginning it was not so."
"And I tell you: any man who divorces his wife for any reason other than adultery and marries another woman is committing adultery."
The students said: "If this is how a man treats his wife, it might be better for him not to get married at all."
As he told them, "Not everyone will accept these words, but those whom God allows to accept them will."
There are those who cannot marry because they were born that way, and there are those who, because of what people have done to them, are unable to marry. And there are those who do not want to marry for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let whoever can do so." Jesus blesses the little children. (Mark 10:13-16; Luke 18:15-17)
They brought young children to Jesus, so that he might touch them and pray over them. But the disciples rebuked those who brought them.
Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.
And he stretched out his hand and walked away from that place. The rich young man (Mark 10:17-31; Luke 18:18-30)
One man asked him, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?"
Jesus said: "Why do you ask me about what is good? Isn't there only one who is good? If you want to enter eternal life, obey the commandments."
# Leviticus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20 They asked: "What are the commandments?" Jesus said: "You shall not kill, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness."
# 19:18 Honor your father and your mother, and you shall love your neighbor as yourself.
The boy said: "I can do all these things, what else am I missing?"
Jesus said: "If you wish to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me!"
The boy heard that and walked away sadly because he had lost many things.
"Jesus said to his disciples, 'Truly I tell you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.'"
"And again, I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God."
The students, upon hearing this, were greatly surprised and asked, "But then, who can pay for it?"
As Jesus looked at them, he said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
At that time, Peter said, "We have left everything and followed you; what then will we have?"
Jesus said to them, "Verily, I say unto you, when I, the Son of Man, sit on my glorious throne in the other world, you also who have followed me will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
Whosoever leaves their homes, with no siblings, no father, no mother, no children, and no land for my sake, will receive a hundredfold and inherit eternal life.
"Many people will end up where they started, and those who started at the end will end up at the beginning."
As servants of Sāniyat al-Anab, we are humble and dedicated.
The kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
Understand with the servants on a silver coin per day and send them to the grape vineyard.
He left with the nine, and then he saw another group of people standing idle in the market.
They said to them, "You too, go to the grape vineyard, and I will give you whatever is right, so they went."
He went out again around noon, and again at three in the afternoon, and did the same thing.
He came out around five in the evening and found some other people sitting there. He asked them, "Why are you sitting here idle all day?"
They said to him, "No one called us to work." He told them, "Then go and work in the grape orchard."
In the evening, the master of the vineyard said to the one who was busy with the servants: "Call the servants and pay them, start with the last ones until you reach the first."
They came, the group that started working with the five in the evening, and each of them received a silver penny.
When the governors arrived, they thought they would take more than the others, but each of them received a silver piastre.
When they finish, help the grape owner.
They said: "These two worked for only one hour, and you paid them the same as us who worked the entire day in this heat!"
My friend, I did not wrong you. Didn't we agree on a silver coin?
Take your right and go. I wanted to give the other one like I give you.
"Dude, I should be able to spend my money however I want, right? Or are you jealous because I'm generous?"
Jesus said, "The last shall be first, and the first shall be last." Jesus foretells his death and resurrection for the third time (Mark 10:32-34; Luke 18:31-34).
As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, two disciples came to him privately and said, "Lord, we want you to do for us whatever we ask."
Hanna, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law of the Jews, and they will condemn him to death.
"And they will deliver me to the Gentiles, and they will mock me and scourge me and crucify me, and on the third day I will rise again." This is what the mother of James and John requested (Mark 10:35-45).
# The Sacrifice of Jato Jato and her children came with buttered cake, knelt before him and asked for a favor.
Jesus said to her, "What do you wish for?" She replied, "Command that these two sons of mine sit, one at your right hand and the other at your left, in your kingdom."
Jesus replied, "You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup I am about to drink?" They answered, "We can."
They said to them: "You will drink from my cup, but I will not decide who sits at my right and left. It is my father who has prepared people for those places."
When the other ten disciples heard of this, they became indignant with the two brothers.
Jesus called them and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who are great exercise authority over them."
You must not have that thing among yourselves. But whoever wishes to be great among you must be your servant.
Whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave.
"For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." Jesus Heals Two Blind Men (Mark 10:46-52; Luke 18:35-43)
As Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him.
There were two blind men sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they shouted, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"
My brothers, the people shouted at them to be quiet. But they shouted even louder: "Our master, son of David, have mercy on us!"
Jesus stood up and called out to them, saying, "What do you want me to do for you?"
They said: "My lord, we wish to return and see!"
Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes; and immediately they received their sight, and followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem (Mark 11:1-11; Luke 19:28-40; John 12:12-19)
As they approached Jerusalem, and had reached the village of Bethphage, near the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,
"Go to the village that is facing you, there you will find a tied-up animal with a colt beside it, untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone tells you anything, respond with: "The Lord will provide for their needs." And then He will turn back time.
This thing happened so that the prophet's words would come true:
# Isa 62:11; Zech 9:9 Shout to Zion: "Your king is coming to you! He is righteous and victorious, humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey."
The two disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them.
They brought the donkey and the colt, placed their cloaks on them, and Jesus mounted.
Most people spread their mats on the road, and others cut sticks from trees and placed them on the path.
# Psalm 118:26; Luke 2:14; Matthew 21:15; 23:39 The people who went before him and those who followed shouted: Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!
As Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, "Who is this?"
And the people said, "This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee." Jesus drives out the traders from the temple. (Mark 11:15-19; Luke 19:45-48; John 2:13-22)
Jesus entered the temple of God and drove out all who were buying and selling in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves.
# Isa 56:7; 7:11 He said to them, "It is written in the book of the prophets, 'And they will all be taught by God'. Everyone who listens to my Father and learns from him comes to me. But you refuse to come to me to have life.
The blind and the lame came to the temple, and he healed them.
The chief priests and the scribes of the Jews were indignant when they saw the wonders that Jesus was doing, and how the little children were shouting in the temple: "Hosanna to the Son of David!"
# Mt 8:2 And they said to him, "Do you hear what these men are saying?" Jesus said to them, "Yes, have you never read, 'Out of the mouths of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise'?"
And he left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there. Jesus curses the fig tree (Mark 11:12-14, 20-24)
When he returned to the city in the morning, Jesus was hungry.
He saw a vine by the roadside, brother, and thought it was useless, as it had no fruit. He said to it, "You will never bear fruit again!" And the vine withered away.
The students were amazed at what had happened and asked, "Why did the vine wither at that time?"
# The Gospel of Jesus Christ And Jesus answered them, "Truly, I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and thrown into the sea,' it will happen.
"Whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours." The authority of Jesus. (Mark 11:27-33; Luke 20:1-8)
As Jesus entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching and said, "By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?"
Jesus answered them, "I will ask you one question; and if you answer me, then I will tell you by what authority I do these things:
"From where did the baptism of John come? From heaven or from men?" And they reasoned among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'
"But if we say, 'He is a man,' we are afraid of the people, for they all believe that John was a prophet."
They answered Jesus, "We don't know." And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things." Like the two sons.
"What do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, "My son, go and work today in the vineyard."
Brother, answer your son: "I'm not going." But later he regretted it and went.
He walked to his other son and said the same thing he told his first son, but he replied, "I'm going, sir!" However, he didn't go.
"And who is the one that does what his father wants?," they said to him. The scribes said, "The first one." Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
"Behold, a farmer went out to plant vines. He planted them, put a hedge around them, dug a pit for the winepress, and built a tower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and went on a journey. At the time of harvest, he sent a servant to the farmers to collect his share of the produce. But they seized him, beat him, and sent him away empty-handed. He sent another servant to them; they struck him on the head and treated him shamefully. He sent another, and they killed him; and so with many others, beating some and killing some. He had one left to send, a beloved son. He sent him last of all to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.' But those farmers said to one another, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.' So they seized him, killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard. What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy those farmers, and give the vineyard to others." (Mark 12:1-12; Luke 20:9-19)
Listen to one more story: There was a man who planted a vineyard, surrounded it with a wall, built a wine press, installed a watchtower, and then leased it to five tenants and traveled to another country.
As the time for the grapes to ripen approached, he sent his servants to the tenants to have them send him the produce.
They seized his five servants and beat one of them, killed another, and stoned another with stones.
The servants were sent back by the master of the vineyard, this time in greater numbers than the first time, but they were treated the same way.
"He separated them and said about his son, 'These are my children.'"
When the five of them saw the boy, they said to each other, "He's the one who will inherit! Let's kill him and take his inheritance!"
They seized him, dragged him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
"What will the owner of the vineyard do with those five of them?"
They said to him, the elders of the Jews: "So that he kills them like this, the wicked ones, and gives the vineyard to five others who will give him the grape harvest on time."
# Psalm 118:22-23; Acts 4:11; 1 Peter 2:7 Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?"
That's why I tell you: the kingdom of God is like a seed that grows and bears fruit for a people who will produce its harvest.
# 21:44 There are ancient texts that contain this verse: "Behold, I am the Son of Man, come to seek and to save the lost."
When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they realized that he was talking about them.
As they tried to capture him, they feared the people, because they considered him a prophet.
As the king's feast (Luke 14:15-24)
Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying:
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son.
The servants were sent to call those invited to the wedding vigil, but they did not come.
# Invitation to the Wedding Feast And he sent out other servants, saying, "Tell those who are invited, 'Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fat cattle are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding feast!'"
They didn't plan for the night and went their separate ways; one went to his farm, and another to his shop.
The others seized his servants and humiliated them, then killed them.
The king conspired, sent his soldiers, killed those criminals, and burned down their city.
The guests are gathered, but those invited are unworthy.
Let's go out to the streets and invite as many people as you can to the wedding party.
The servants went out onto the road and brought in all the good and bad people, and so the wedding house was filled with guests.
As the king came to see the guests, he noticed a man who was not wearing the proper attire. So, he said,
How did you get in here without your wedding attire? Then the man fell silent.
Bind him hand and foot, and cast him out into outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
"Many are called, but few are chosen." Paying taxes to the emperor (Mark 12:13-17; Luke 20:20-26)
At that time, the Pharisees went away and plotted together how they might entrap Jesus in speech.
"His disciples sent with the Herodians, saying, 'Teacher, we know that you are genuine and that you teach the way of God in accordance with truth, and favor no one for you pay no attention to anyone's status.' "
Tell us: What do you think? I mean, is it okay to pay taxes to the emperor or not?
"Jesus, aware of their malice, said to them, 'Why do you test me, you hypocrites?'"
Show me the money for the taxes!» So he gave him a silver piastre.
Jesus said to them, "Whose image and inscription is this?"
They said, "Render unto Caesar!" But he told them, "Yes, give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and to God what belongs to God!"
And they were amazed when they heard that saying. Then they left Him and went away. The resurrection of the dead. (Mark 12:18-27; Luke 20:27-40)
"On that day, the Pharisees came to Jesus, who say there is no resurrection after death, and they asked him a question."
# Gen. 25:5 They said, "Teacher, Moses said, 'If a man dies and has no son, his brother must marry the widow and father a child who will carry on the brother's name.'
There were seven brothers among us, and the eldest got married but died without having children, so his wife was taken by his brother.
The same thing happened to the second, third, and even up to the seventh one.
The woman died, and they all grew distant.
She will be a wretched woman on the Day of Judgment, for she married them all.
Answer them, Jesus said: "You are mistaken, because you have not understood the Scriptures nor the power of God."
On the Day of Judgment, they will neither marry nor be married, but they will be like the angels in heaven.
You are like the dead rising for the Day of Judgment. Haven't you read what God has told you?
# Mark 12:27 She is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living."
When the people heard these words, they were amazed at his teaching. The greatest commandment (Mark 12:28-34; Luke 10:25-28)
When the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.
One of them, a scholar of Islamic law, was asked a question to test him:
"Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?"
# Deuteronomy 6:5 Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.
This is the first and greatest testament.
# Matthew 19:18; Mark 19:19; Galatians 5:14; Romans 13:9; James 2:8; Love your neighbor as yourself.
"The whole Law and the prophets are based on these two commandments." Jesus and David (Mark 12:35-37; Luke 20:41-44)
When the Pharisees were gathered together with one another, Jesus asked them a question:
"What do you think about Christ? Whose son is he?" They said, "The son of David!"
He said to them, "How could David call him 'Lord' when he said,
# Psalm 110:1; Acts 2:34-35; Hebrews 1:13; 10:13 The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool."
"If David called him 'our Lord', then how could his son be?"
No one could answer him with a single word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him any questions.
Jesus warns against the scribes of the Jews and the Pharisees (Mark 12:38-40; Luke 11:37-52; 20:45-47)
Jesus said to the people and his disciples:
The book is the possession of the Jews and the Pharisees, sitting on the seat of Moses,
Do as you're told and keep everything they say to you in mind. But don't do as they do, because they say one thing and do another.
They put a heavy burden on people's shoulders, but they won't touch it with even a finger.
They do everything just to be seen by others, they grow in their turbans and extend the hems of their clothes.
They love to sit in the front rows at soirées and in the front seats at gatherings.
People love to greet them in the markets and call out, "Hey, teachers!"
You don't let anyone call you "teachers," because you are all brothers and have one teacher.
# Matthew 23:9 Do not call anyone on earth your father; for One is your Father, who is in heaven.
Do not let anyone tell you, "My lords," because you have only one Lord, which is Christ.
Let your leader serve you.
He who becomes arrogant will fall, but he who is humble will be exalted.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to.
# 23:14 There are ancient texts that contain this verse: Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You devour widows' houses, and for a pretense you make long prayers; therefore you will receive greater condemnation.
Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You traverse sea and land to make a single convert, and when he becomes a disciple, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves!
Alas, you blind sheikhs! You say, "He who swears by the Temple is not bound by his oath, but he who swears by the Temple's gold is bound by his oath."
# The Parable of the Temple and the Gold Anna, which has more value, O fools and blind ones? The gold, or the temple that made the gold sacred?
"You shall not use the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain."
Anna huwa l-i ghandu qima aktar, ja ummin? L-qurban jew il-midebha li jirrid il-qurban muqaddas?
He who swears by the altar, swears by it and by all that is upon it!
He who swears by the temple is swearing by it and by what dwells within.
He who swears by the sky, swears by the throne and by Allah who sits upon it.
Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faith. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others.
You lead the people, you blind ones! You strain out a gnat and swallow a camel.
Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.
You blind Pharisee, first wash the inside of the cup and the dish, so that the outside may become clean too.
Alas for you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness.
You, too, appear to people as righteous from the outside, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.
Ye offspring of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. But the things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man. For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: these are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not the man.
We might say, "We were there in the time of our ancestors, but we did not participate in the killing of the prophets."
Here you are, bear witness against yourselves, you offspring of those who killed the prophets.
You guys have lost your ancestors' balance.
Ye sons of snakes, how do you plan to escape the sentence of Hell's torment?
That's why I send you prophets, wise men, and scriptures; some of them you kill and crucify, some you flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town.
# Matthew 4:8; Hebrews 11:4; Zechariah 1:1; 2 Chronicles 24:21 "So that all the blood of innocent lives shed on the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar, may come upon you."
They will all come to this generation: the losers! Jesus' love for Jerusalem (Luke 13:34-35)
# Matthew 23:37 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing.
Hey, your darkness is upon you, may it leave you in ruins.
I say to you: you will not see me again until the time comes when you say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!"
Jesus foretells the fall of the temple (Mark 13:1-2; Luke 21:5-6)
Jesus left the temple. As he was walking away, his disciples came to him and showed him the buildings of the temple.
"My brother told them, 'Look at all this: I'm telling you the truth, not one stone here will be left on another; everything will be torn down.' Catastrophe and persecution (Mark 13:3-13; Luke 21:7-19)"
When he was sitting on Mount of Olives, his disciples came to him privately and asked, "Tell us, when will these things happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?"
Jesus answered them, "Be on your guard against men; they will hand you over to the local councils and flog you in their synagogues.
My way will be used by many people who will come in my name, saying, "I am the Christ!" and they will deceive many.
When you hear about wars nearby and wars in distant lands, do not be afraid. This is something that must happen, but it is not the end.
The way of the people will be to come against people, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
This is all just the beginning of the sorrows of childbirth.
They will take you at that time to torment you and kill you. All the nations will hate you because of my name.
At that time, many people stopped believing and started betraying and hating each other.
There will be many false prophets and they will lead many astray.
Most people will no longer have love, because evil will increase.
He who proves to others will pay the price.
"And the gospel of the kingdom of God will be preached in all the world as a witness to all nations, and then the end will come." The Great Tribulation (Mark 13:14-23; Luke 21:20-24)

As he was walking along, a man ran up, knelt down before him, and asked him, "Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
"Jesus said, 'My friend, do the thing I came here for.' At that moment, they came and laid hands on Jesus and arrested him."

How then can the sacred books be fulfilled, which say that this thing must happen?»
Jesus said to the people, "My brothers, do you consider me a criminal and come at me with swords and clubs? Every day I sat teaching in the temple, and you did not arrest me."
"All these things happened so that what was written by the prophets might be fulfilled." At that time, the disciples left him and ran away. Jesus was brought to the Jewish council (Mark 14:53-65; Luke 22:54-55, 63-71; John 18:13-14, 19-24).
They seized Jesus, mocked him, and took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest's house. There he went inside with the other servants to see the outcome.
The chief priests and all the Sanhedrin were seeking false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.
They couldn't find a way, even though many people came forward and testified falsely. Later, two witnesses were presented.
They said: "This man said, 'I can destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"
"The chief priest stood up and said, 'Are you not going to answer? Do you not hear what these men are saying against you?'"
Jesus remained silent. Then the high priest stood up and said, "I adjure you by the living God: Are you the Messiah, the Son of God?"
Jesus said, "You have said it. But I tell you: from this day forward, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the power of God and coming on the clouds of heaven!"

And they said, "Prophesy to us, Christ! Who hit you?" Peter denied Jesus. (Mark 14:66-72; Luke 22:56-62; John 18:15-18, 25-27)
Peter was sitting outside in the middle of the courtyard when a servant girl came up to him and said, "You were also with Jesus of Galilee!"
"He stood there in front of them all and said, 'I don't understand what you mean.'"
When he went out to the outer gate, another servant girl saw him and said to those there, "This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth."
Peter denied Jesus again, swearing, "I don't know this man!"
Push off a bit, the people who were present said to Peter: "You are one of them too, because your speech gives you away!"
That's when he started swearing and crossing his arms: "I don't know that man." At that moment, the rooster crowed,
Peter remembered Jesus' words: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." He went outside and wept bitterly.
Jesus before Pilate (Mark 15:1; Luke 23:1-2; John 18:28-32)
In the morning, the chief priests and the elders of the people conspired to put Jesus to death.
They seized him, bound his hands, and handed him over to Pilate, the governor. The death of Judas. (Acts 1:18-19)
When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
"I told them, 'I've committed a sin by selling the blood of an innocent man.' They said, 'We don't care. Sort it out yourself.'"
He threw the silver into the structure and left, then hanged himself.
The chief priests mocked, saying, "It is not lawful to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money."
They couldn't agree, so they bought the potter's field to make it a cemetery for the Brainians to be buried in.
That's why they call this place "Sania Ad-Dam" to this day.
# Zechariah 11:12-13; Jeremiah 32:6-15; 18:2-3 And just as the prophet Jeremiah said, "They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price at which they priced him whom some of the sons of Israel priced,
"And they gave him money to buy a potter's field. Just as the Lord commanded me." Pilate asked Jesus (Mark 15:2-5; Luke 23:3-5; John 18:33-38).
Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus said to him, "You have said so."
When the chief priests and elders accused him, he did not answer at all.
"And Pilate said, 'Do you not hear how many charges they bring against you?' "
But he did not answer even one question, and the governor was greatly amazed. So Pilate again asked him, saying, "Do You not answer? See how many things
At every festival, the governor would release one of the prisoners whom the people loved.
There was a well-known prisoner among them at that time called Barabbas.
"And when they were assembled, Pilate said, 'Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?'"
For that reason, he knew they had handed him over out of jealousy.
# The Trial of Jesus At that time, when Pilate was sitting in the court, his wife sent a message to him, saying, "Have nothing to do with that righteous man; for last night I suffered greatly in a dream because of him."
The chief priests and elders persuaded the people to ask for Barabbas and to kill Jesus.
"The governor asked them again, 'Which of the two do you want me to release for you?' And they answered, 'Barabbas!'"
Pilate said to them, "What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all said, "Crucify Him!"
He said, "Why? What evil has he done?" But they kept shouting louder, "Crucify him!"
"So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, 'I am innocent of this man's blood; see to it yourselves.' "
All the people answered: "We and our children are wanted for blood!"
They led him away to be crucified, and handed him over to Pilate. The soldiers made fun of Jesus (Mark 15:16-20; John 19:2-3).
And they brought Jesus to the governor's palace. The whole detachment of soldiers gathered around him there.
Let's try to dress him up in a red outfit.
They placed a crown of thorns on his head, put a reed in his hand, and knelt before him, mocking him and saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
They spat on him, struck him with the reed, and hit him on the head with it.
And after they mocked him, we tried to put on the red robe, and they dressed him in his clothes and shook him to stiffen him. Jesus on the cross (Mark 15:21-32; Luke 23:26-43; John 19:17-27).
As they were going out of the city, they met a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they compelled him to carry the cross of Jesus.
When they arrived at a place called Golgotha, which means the place of the skull.
They gave him mixed liquor, something they call "al-mar", but when he tasted it, he didn't want to drink it.
# And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots.
They kept looking for him, going back and forth.
They placed the accusation on his head on a plaque that read: "This is Jesus, King of the Jews."
They crucified him with two criminals, one on his right and one on his left.
# Psalm 22:7-8; 109:25 All who see me mock me; they hurl insults, shaking their heads:
"If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross now and save yourself. Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."
The chief priests, scribes of the Jews, and elders were also mocking him, saying:
He saves others, but he cannot save himself! He is the king of Israel; let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him.
Mao trusted in God and said, "I am the Son of God." Let God save him if He is pleased with him.
And the criminals who were crucified with him also reviled him with the same words. Jesus died. (Mark 15:33-41; Luke 23:44-49; John 19:28-30)
And by midday, darkness fell upon the whole world, lasting until the evening's three o'clock.
# Mark 15:34 And at three o'clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
There were some who, upon hearing him, said, "This man is calling on Elijah!"
# He ‏69‏:21 Then one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, put it on a reed, and offered it to him to drink.
Wait, let's see if Elijah will come and save him!
Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.
The veil of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. The earth shook, and the rocks split.
The graves were opened, and many of the saints who had fallen asleep arose.
They came out of the tombs after Jesus had risen, went into the holy city, and appeared to many people.
When the captain of the guard who was with Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, he was terrified and said, "Surely this man was the Son of God!"
There were many women there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee and had been helping him.
And among them was Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee's children. They buried Jesus. (Mark 15:42-47; Luke 23:50-56; John 19:38-42)
In the evening, a rich man named Joseph from the region of Rama arrived, and he too was one of Jesus' disciples.
Pilate was approached, and he was asked for Jesus' body. So, Pilate ordered that it be given.
Joseph shook Jesus' body and wrapped it in a clean shroud.
They were buried in a new grave they dug for themselves in the rock, and he placed a large stone at the entrance of the tomb and left.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting opposite the tomb. The guards were at the tomb.
And from early morning, the chief priests and the elders and the scribes and the whole council, after binding Jesus, led Him away and delivered Him to Pilate.
He was reminded: "Remember, our master, how that impostor said, while he was still alive, 'I shall rise after three days.'
"That's why I ordered them to guard the tomb for three days, so that his disciples don't go and steal his body and tell the people, 'He has risen from the dead,' and thus lead people astray, causing even more confusion than before!"
Pilate told them, "You have a guard; go and make arrangements as you wish."
They went and sealed the room with wax, and soldiers were posted to guard the tomb.
# The Resurrection of Jesus (Mark 16:1-8; Luke 24:1-12; John 20:1-10)
And when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene and Mary the other took respite to see the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.
Brother, a huge earthquake happened, an angel from God descended from the sky and came, and then stood above the room.
The lightning flashed and its trail was as white as snow.
The guards trembled in fear of him, they turned like the dead.
# Translation: As the angel said to the women: "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified."
He's not here; he left just as he said he would. Come and see the spot where he was standing.
Go quickly and tell his disciples, "He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him." Now I have told you.
They went to the grave quickly, filled with fear and great joy, and they ran to the students.
In Thineya, Jesus appeared to them and said, "Peace be with you." Then they came forward, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
"My friends, Jesus said to them, 'Do not be afraid! Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.' That's what the soldiers said."
When the women were walking, some soldiers returned to the city and reported to the chief priests about everything that had happened.
The chief priests and elders gathered together, consulted, and gave a large sum of money to the soldiers.
They said, "Tell the people, 'His disciples came at night and stole him while we were asleep.'"
"As soon as the governor hears the news, we'll appease him and get you out of this mess."
And the soldiers took the money and did as they were told. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. Jesus appeared to his disciples (Mark 16:14-18; Luke 24:36-49; John 20:19-23; Acts 1:6-8).
And the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain, where Jesus had told them to go.
The scouts bowed to Jesus, but some of them doubted.
Jesus came and said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
Teach them to do as I have commanded you, and I will always be with you, until the end of time.
John the Baptist (Matthew 3:1-12; Luke 3:1-18; John 1:19-28)
This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Thus it is written in the book of the prophet Isaiah: "Behold, I send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way."
# Isaiah 40:3 "A voice cries out, 'In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.' "
John the Baptist came to the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
And people from all over Judea, and also from Jerusalem, were going out to him, and were baptized by him in the Jordan River, as they confessed their sins.
John's clothing was made of camel's hair, and he had a leather belt around his waist. His diet consisted of locusts and wild honey.
He was preaching and saying: "He who is mightier than I is coming after me; I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals."
"Anna 'amda'tukum bil-ma', amma huwa bash ya'madukum bil-ruh il-quddus." Jesus was baptized and tempted by the devil. (Matthew 3:13-17; Luke 3:21-22)
At that time, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.

After John was put in prison, Jesus went to Galilee, preaching the gospel of God.
"The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel!"
When Jesus was walking by the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
They left their window and followed him.
After that, he walked a little further and saw James and John, the sons of Zebedee, in the boat mending their nets.
By the time they called out to their father, he had already left them with the servants in the boat and followed Jesus. Jesus cast out an unclean spirit (Luke 4:31-37).
Jesus went on from there and came into Capernaum. And on the Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue.
The attendees remained amazed by his teaching, for he instructed them with an authority unlike that of the Jewish scholars.
There was a man in the compound, his soul was cursed.
"What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Brother, did you come here to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!"
"My friend, Jesus commanded him, saying, 'Be quiet! Come out of him!'"
The accursed spirit convulsed the man, shouted loudly, and left him.
Everyone remained amazed and started asking each other, "What is this? A new teaching with authority! Even the unfortunate souls obey him!"
And at that time, the news about Jesus spread throughout the whole region of Galilee. Simon's mother-in-law was healed (Matthew 8:14-17; Luke 4:38-41).
As soon as Jesus and his disciples left the synagogue, they went to the house of Simon and Andrew, along with James and John.
Wansiba Siman was lying in bed, feeling feverish, and at that moment, they called upon Jesus.
Scramble her, grab her hand, pull her up, and at the same time, the heat hit her, and she started working on them.
In the evening, when the sun set, people brought their sick to me, and I exorcised the demons from them all.
And all the people of Jerusalem gathered together at the gate.
He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. But he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus went on his way to Galilee. (Luke 4:42-44)
Jesus rose early in the morning, while it was still dark, and departed and went to a secluded place, and there He prayed.
Simon went on his way, and they searched for him.
When they found him, they said, "Everyone has been looking for you!"
He said, "Let's go to the nearby cities so that we can preach there, for I have come for this purpose."
And he went about preaching in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and casting out devils. And a certain man named Aeneas, who had kept his bed for eight years, was sick of the palsy. Jesus healed him, saying unto him, Aeneas, arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately. (Matthew 8:1-4; Luke 5:12-16)
A leper came to beg from him, and kneeling down he cried out, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."
"My brother, Jesus had mercy on him, reached out, touched him, and said, 'I do love you; be healed!' "
As soon as Jesus spoke, leprosy left him and he was healed.
Jesus was ordered to move on and was warned.
# 13:49; 14:2-32 They said, "Be careful, don't tell anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifice that Moses commanded as a testimony to them, for your healing."
As he went and began to proclaim and spread the news, Jesus could no longer openly enter a town in that region, but stayed out in the open countryside. People would come to him from everywhere.
Jesus heals a paralyzed man (Matthew 9:1-8; Luke 5:17-26)
And after a few days, Jesus returned to the region of Capernaum, and the news about him spread throughout the house.
A lot of people gathered until there was no more space left, not even a spot for anyone in front of the door. And he started telling them about the word of God.
He brought a paralyzed man carried by four men.
They couldn't get near him because of the large crowd. So they dug through the roof of the house where Jesus was and lowered the mat the paralyzed man was lying on.
When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, "Child, your sins are forgiven."
They were a group of scribes from among the people, a faction of the Jews, who began to think in their hearts,
"Does this man-like creature speak like that? He's blaspheming! Who, other than God alone, can forgive sins?"
Jesus perceived their discussions, and said to them, "Why do you think about these things in your hearts?"
Is it easier to tell a paralyzed person, "Your sins are forgiven," or to say, "Get up! Shake off your bed and walk."
"Just so you know, I, the Son of Man, have authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he said to the paralyzed man, "Get up, take your mat and go home."
Get up: shake your bedding and go home.
He got up, took his mat, and walked out in front of everyone, leaving them all amazed and praising God. They said, "We have never seen anything like this before!" Jesus called Levi. (Matthew 9:9-13; Luke 5:27-32)
Jesus went out again by the sea; the whole crowd gathered around him, and he taught them.
When he was walking, he saw a young man from the neighborhood sitting at the tax office and said, "Follow me!" So he got up and followed him.
When Jesus was dining at Levi's house, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat with him and his disciples. And a large crowd was following him.
When the scribes and Pharisees saw that Jesus was eating with the tax collectors and sinners, they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
Jesus heard this and replied, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners." The debate on fasting (Matthew 9:14-17; Luke 5:33-39)
The disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting. Then some people came and asked Jesus, "Why do the disciples of John and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not?"
Answer them: "How can the wedding guests fast when the groom is still among them? As long as the groom is there, they cannot fast."
When the days come, the groom will be far away from them, and during that time, they will fast.
There is no one who patches old clothes with a piece of new cloth, for the new piece will shrink and wear away from the old, and the tear will be made worse.
There is no one who puts new wine into old wineskins. For the new wine would burst the skins, and its contents would be lost. No, new wine must be put into fresh wineskins. The conversation on the Sabbath (Matthew 12:1-8; Luke 6:1-5)
Jesus went through the grainfields on a Sabbath, and his disciples began to pick some heads of grain as they went along.
"The Pharisees said to Jesus, 'Look, why do your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?'"
Answer them: "Dude, I didn't read it. What did David do when they needed him and were hungry?"
# 1 Chronicles 21:1-6; 2 Samuel 8:17 "How did he enter the house of God when Abiathar, the chief priest, was there? He ate the showbread, which only the priests were allowed to eat, and also gave some to his companions?"
# The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
"Anna, the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
The man with the withered hand was healed. (Matthew 12:9-14; Luke 6:6-11)
Jesus entered the synagogue again, and a man with a withered hand was there.
Let's watch and see if he can heal that man on Saturday or not. So they can accuse him.
My brother told the man with the stiff hand: "Get up and stand in the middle!"
And the man said to them, "Is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the Sabbath, to save a life or to kill?" But they were silent.
Jesus looked at them, feeling distressed and deeply saddened by their hardness of heart. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand!" He stretched it out and his hand was completely restored.
They went out from the council, and immediately began to conspire with the supporters of Herod to put him to death.
Jesus and his disciples walked along the shore of the lake, and a great crowd followed him from the region of Galilee and Judea.
Jerusalem, Edom, and the regions beyond the Jordan, as well as a great number of people from the towns around Tyre and Sidon, had heard of all that he did and came to him.
Jesus told his disciples to prepare a boat for him, ready for his use, so that the crowd would not crush him.
Because of him, many people were healed, but now every sick person comes to him to be touched.
The accursed spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him and cried out, "You are the Son of God!"
He commanded them strictly not to spread the news about him. These twelve he sent out with the following instructions: "Matthew 10:1-4; Luke 6:12-16"
Jesus went up the mountain and called to those he wanted to follow him, and they came.
He chose twelve companions to be with him and called them messengers to send them forth and give glad tidings.
They have the power to release the demons.
Simon, whom he named Peter
James and John, the sons of Zebedee, whom he named Boanerges, which means "sons of thunder."
Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot.
# Matthew 12:22-32 Then they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and
Jesus went to a house, and again the crowd gathered so that Jesus and his disciples could not even eat.
When his relatives heard, they came to take him away because people said, "He has lost his mind."
The Jews who came down from Jerusalem said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul, and by the prince of demons he casts out demons!"
Jesus said to them, "How can Satan drive out Satan?"
If a kingdom is divided against itself, it cannot stand.
If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
