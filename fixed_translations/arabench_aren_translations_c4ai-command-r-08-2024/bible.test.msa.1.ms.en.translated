The greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
At that time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Then who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Jesus called a little child to him and placed him among them.
"Verily, I say unto you, except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven."
Whoever humbles themselves like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
And one such child in my name welcomes me.
It is better for one to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea than to cause one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble.
Woe to the world because of the stumbling blocks! For stumbling blocks must come, but woe to that man by whom the stumbling block comes!
If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter life crippled or lame, than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.
If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. It is just like a lost sheep.
Look, do not despise any of these little ones, for I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.
For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost.
What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them wanders away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off?
So I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.
Thus it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish. If your brother sins against you...
If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have won your brother back.
If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector. Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
If they refuse to listen to you, tell it to the church; and if they refuse to listen even to the church, treat them as you would a Gentile or a tax-collector.
I tell you the truth, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
Because where two or three are gathered in my name, I am there among them.' Like the servant who does not forgive.
Then Peter came to him and said, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times?"
Jesus said to him, "I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven."
Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
When he began the reckoning, one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him.
He was unable to pay his master, so he, his wife, his children, and all his possessions were to be sold to repay the debt.
Pride of the slave and he bowed to him, saying: "Master, wait for me, I will pay them all."
Have mercy, sir, on that servant, release him, and forgive his debt.
When that servant had left, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred dinars. He grabbed him by the throat and said, "Pay me what you owe me!"
Pride is the slave's companion, who stands by his side and asks, "Give me time, and I shall repay them all."
He did not respond but went on and cast him into prison until he should pay the debt.
When his companions, the servants, saw what had happened, they were deeply saddened. They came and told their master everything that had occurred.
# **English Translation:** Then his master summoned him and said to him, "Wicked servant, I forgave you all that debt because you begged me.
Should you not have mercy on your fellow servant, just as I had mercy on you?
And his master was angry with him and handed him over to the tormentors until he had paid back everything he owed.
"For this is how your heavenly Father will treat you, unless you each forgive your brother from your heart."
Marriage and divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea to the other side of the Jordan.
A great crowd followed him, and he healed them there.
# Matthew 19:3 The Pharisees came to Jesus, testing him and asking, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
He answered and said to them, "Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female?"
He said, "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh."
They are no longer two but one flesh. Let not man put asunder what God has joined together.
They said to him, "Why then did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce and she is put away?"
He said to them, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of the hardness of your hearts. But from the beginning it was not so."
I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
His disciples said, "If such is the case with a man and a woman, it is better not to marry!"
He said to them, "Not everyone accepts this word, but only those to whom it has been granted."
For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother's womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone who can accept this, accept it." Jesus blessed the children.
Then children were brought to him that he might lay his hands on them and pray. The disciples rebuked them.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
He placed his hands on them and departed from there. The rich young man.
"But one came up and said to him, 'Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?'"
He said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. But if you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments."
He asked him, "Which commandments?" Jesus replied, "You shall not kill. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not bear false witness."
Honor your father and your mother, and love your neighbor as yourself.
The young man said to him, "I have memorized all these since my youth. What else do I need?"
Jesus said to him, "If you wish to be perfect, go and sell your possessions and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come and follow me."
When the young man heard this, he went away sad, for he had great wealth.
Jesus said to his disciples, "I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven."
It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God!
When his disciples heard this, they were utterly astonished and asked, "Then who can be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
Then Peter answered and said to him, "Behold, we have left all and followed you. What then shall we have?"
Jesus said to them, "Truly, I tell you, in the renewal, when the Son of Man sits on his throne of glory, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
He who leaves houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields for my name's sake, will receive a hundredfold and inherit eternal life.
Many that are first shall be last, and the last shall be first.
As workers in the vineyard
The kingdom of heaven is like a householder who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
We agreed with the workers on one dinar per day, and sent them to our vineyard.
Then he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace.
"He said to them, 'You go and do the same.' So they went."
He also went out and prayed at the sixth and ninth hours, and did the same.
Then, about the eleventh hour, he went out and found others standing around doing nothing. He asked them, "Why have you been standing here all day idle?"
They said to him, "Because no one has hired us." He said to them, "You go also into the vineyard, and you shall receive whatever is right."
In the evening the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, "Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first."
The owners of the eleventh hour came and took a dinar, a dinar.
When the first group arrived, they thought they would get more. So, they also received one dinar each.
While they were taking the bread, they grumbled against the homeowner.
"They said, 'These others worked only one hour, and yet you have made them equal to us, who bore the burden of the day and the scorching heat!'"
He answered one of them and said, "Friend, I have not wronged you. Did we not agree on a wage for a dinar?"
Take what is yours and go, for I wish to give this last one the same as you.
What's to stop me from doing as I please with what's mine? Is your eye evil because I am good?
Thus, the last will be first and the first will be last, for many are called but few are chosen." Jesus foretells his death and resurrection.
As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, on the road, and said to them,
"Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn Him to death
"They will mock him and spit on him; they will flog him and kill him. On the third day he will rise again." The request of Zebedee's sons
Then the mother of Zebedee's sons came to Jesus with her sons, and kneeling down, asked a favor of him.
He asked her, "What is it you want?" She said to him, "Grant that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right hand and the other at your left, in your kingdom."
Jesus replied, "You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?" They answered, "We can."
"You will indeed both drink from my cup, and be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized. But to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
When the ten heard about it, they were indignant with the two brothers.
Jesus called them together and said, "You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them."
Let him not be so among you. But whoever desires to be great among you, let him be your servant.
Whoever among you wants to be first must be your servant.
"For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." Healing of the Two Blind Men in Jericho
As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him.
"And two blind men sitting by the roadside, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, 'Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!'"
The crowd rebuked them, telling them to be quiet, but they only shouted louder, saying, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
Jesus stood still and called them, saying, "What do you want me to do for you?"
They said to him, "Master, let our eyes be opened!"
Jesus had compassion and touched their eyes; and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.
Entrance to Jerusalem
As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples
"Go to the village ahead of you; there you will find a donkey tied by the side of the road, with a colt by her. Untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone says anything to you, tell them, "The Lord needs them." And immediately, he will send them.
It was so that what was spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled:
"Say to the daughter of Zion, 'Behold, your king comes to you, humble, and mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.'"
The two disciples went and did as Jesus had commanded them.
They brought the she-donkey and the colt, and placed their garments on them, then they sat on them.
The majority spread their garments on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
"And the crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed were shouting, 'Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest heaven!'."
When he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, "Who is this?"
The crowds replied, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Cleansing of the Temple
Jesus entered the temple of God and drove out all who were selling and buying in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling doves.
"It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer.' But you have made it a den of thieves!"
And his uncles and cripples came to him in the temple, and he healed them.
When the chief priests and scribes saw the wonders that he was doing, and the children shouting in the temple, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" they became indignant.
They said to him, "Do you hear what these [children] are saying?" Jesus said to them, "Yes! Have you never read, 'Out of the mouths of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise'?"
Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and spent the night there. The fig tree withered.
And in the morning, as he returned to the city, he was hungry.
He noticed a fig tree by the road, and went to it, but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, “May you never bear fruit again!” And the fig tree withered at once.
When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. They asked, "How did the fig tree wither instantly?"
Jesus answered and said to them, "Truly, I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and thrown into the sea,' it will happen."
"Whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours." The question about Jesus' authority.
When he entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people approached him as he was teaching. They asked, "By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority?"
Jesus replied, asking them, "I too will ask you one thing: if you tell me about it, I will also tell you by what authority I do these things."
"The baptism of John: was it from heaven, or from men?'' So they reasoned in their hearts, saying, ''If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'
If we say, "from among the people, we fear the people, for John is like a prophet to all."
They answered Jesus, and said, "We do not know." And he said unto them, "Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things. Like the two sons"
What do you think? A man had two sons and went to the first and said, "Son, go and work today in my vineyard."
He replied, saying: "What I want." But he regretted it eventually and left.
He went to the second and said the same. And he answered and said, "Behold, here I am, sir." And he did not go.
"Which of the two did the will of the father?" They said to him, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Truly, I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him; but tax collectors and prostitutes did. Yet even when you saw this, you did not later repent and believe in him. The parable of the tenants.
Listen to another parable: A certain man planted a vineyard, fenced it in, dug a pit for the winepress, built a tower, and rented it out to tenants. Then he went on a journey.
When the time for the fruit had arrived, he sent his servants to the vinedressers to receive his fruit.
The stewards took his servants, beat some, killed some, and stoned some.
Then he sent other servants, more than the first ones, but they also treated them in the same way.
At last he sent his son to them, saying, "They respect my son!"
The stewards, when they saw the son, said to one another, "This is the heir! Come, let us kill him and take his inheritance!"
They took him, led him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
"So when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vinedressers?"
They said to him, "Those wicked tenants will be miserably destroyed, and the vineyard given to others who will give the fruits in their seasons."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?"
The kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation that will produce its fruit.
"If anyone falls on this stone it will crush him; and if it falls on anyone, it will grind him to pieces!"
When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they realized he was talking about them.
They sought to seize him, but they feared the crowds, for they regarded him as a prophet.
Just like the wedding of the king's son.
Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying:
"The kingdom of heaven is like a king who gave a wedding feast for his son,"
He sent his servants to invite the invited to the wedding, but they did not want to come.
He sent out other slaves, saying, "Tell those who are invited, 'Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fattened cattle have been slaughtered, and everything is ready; come to the wedding feast!
But they neglected and went on, one to his field, another to his business.
The rest seized his servants, reviled them, and killed them.
When the king heard this, he was furious. He sent his soldiers and destroyed those murderers, burning their city to the ground.
Then he said to his servants, "The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy."
Go to the crossroads, and invite everyone you find to the wedding feast.
Those slaves went out to the roads and gathered together all they found, both evil and good. And the wedding hall was filled with guests.
When the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.
"And he said to him, 'Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment?' And he was speechless."
The king then said to the servants, "Bind his feet and hands, take him and throw him into the outer darkness. That is where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
Because many are called but few are chosen». Pay tribute to Caesar
Then the Pharisees went and plotted how they might entrap him in speech.
"So they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, 'Teacher, we know that you are genuine and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't swayed by others' opinions, because you pay no attention to who they are.' "
"So tell us: What do you think? Is it lawful to pay the emperor's tax, yes or no?"
Jesus knew their evil thoughts and said, "Why do you test me, you hypocrites?"
Show me the treatment of the jizya payers." So they presented him with a dinar.
"He said to them, 'Whose image and inscription are these?'"
They said to him, "Render to Caesar." So he said to them, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's."
When they heard this, they were amazed and left, wondering about the resurrection of the dead.
On that day, the Sadducees came to him, who say there is no resurrection, and they questioned him.
"Teacher, Moses said, 'If a man dies and has no sons, his brother must marry the widow and father a child to carry on his brother's name.'"
There were seven brothers among us, and the first one got married but died. Since he had no offspring, he left his wife to his brother.
And the second and third to the seventh.
In the end, the woman also died.
In the resurrection whose wife will she be? For she was the wife of all seven of them!"
Jesus answered and said to them, "How foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Do you not understand these things? Do you not see that it is not about the letter of the law, but about the power of God?"
For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.
As for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God, the one who said,
I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living."
When the crowds heard it, they were astonished at his teaching. The greatest commandment.
The Pharisees, when they heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, gathered together.
"And one of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question, testing Him."
"Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?"
Jesus said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind."
This is the first and greatest commandment.
Love your neighbor as yourself.
Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
While the Pharisees were gathered, Jesus asked them,
"He said to them, 'What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?' They said to him, 'The son of David.'"
He said to them, "How can David then in the Spirit call him 'Lord'?
The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."
If David calls him 'Lord', how can he be his son?
No one could answer him with a word. From that day on, no one dared to ask him again.
# Warning Against the Scribes and the Pharisees
Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples:
"The scribes and Pharisees sit on Moses' seat."
# Matthew 23:3 Do whatever they tell you, but do not do as they do, for they do not practice what they preach.
They tie up heavy loads, cumbersome to bear, and put them on people's shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them.
And all their works they do for the sake of being seen by men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments.
They love the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts.
Greetings in the markets, and people call out to them, "My lord, my lord!"
And you, do not call anyone on earth your father; for One is your Father, He who is in heaven. Your Master is one, the Christ; and you are all brothers.
Do not call anyone on earth your father, for you have one Father, and he is in heaven.
Do not call anyone your teacher, for you have one Teacher, the Christ.
The greatest among you shall be your servant.
He that exalteth himself shall be humbled; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted. Woes to the scribes and Pharisees.
Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows' houses, and for a pretense you make long prayers. Therefore you will receive greater condemnation.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel around the sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves.
Woe to you, blind guides! You say, 'Whoever swears by the temple is bound by nothing, but whoever swears by the gold of the temple is bound by the oath.'
O fools and blind men! Which is greater, the gold or the temple that sanctifies the gold?
# Translation: If anyone swears by the altar, it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the offering that lies on it, he is bound by his oath.
Oh ye fools and blind men! Which is greater, the gift, or the altar that makes the gift sacred?
He who swears by the altar, swears by it and by everything on it.
And whoever swears by the temple swears by both it and the one who dwells in it.
And whoever swears by the heavens has sworn by the throne of Allah and by Him who is upon it.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faith. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others.
Oh, blind leaders! Who strain out the gnat and swallow the camel.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of extortion and intemperance.
Oh blind Pharisee! Clean the inside of the cup and the dish, so that the outside may also become clean.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead people's bones and all uncleanness.
Thus you also outwardly appear righteous to people, but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous,
You say, "If only we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have shared in the blood of the prophets."
You bear witness against yourselves that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
Fill up your fathers' measure.
Oh ye vipers, offspring of vipers! How can you escape the judgment of hell?
Therefore, I send you prophets and wise men and scribes; some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will flog in your synagogues and persecute from town to town.
Truly I tell you, all this will come upon this generation: from the blood of Abel to Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary.
I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly be held responsible for it! Jesus mourns over Jerusalem.
Jerusalem, Jerusalem! You killer of prophets and stoner of those sent to you, how often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing!
Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.
"For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!'."
Signs of the End Times
Then Jesus went out and departed from the temple, and His disciples came to show Him the buildings of the temple.
Jesus said to them, "Do you not see all these things? Truly I tell you, not one stone will be left here upon another; all will be thrown down."
As he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, "Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of your coming, and of the end of the age?"
Jesus answered and said to them, "Be on your guard! Let no one lead you astray."
Many will come in my name, saying, "I am the Christ," and they will deceive many.
You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled; for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in places.
But these are all the beginnings of sorrows.
Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake.
Then many will fall away, betray one another, and hate one another.
Many false prophets will arise and mislead many.
And because of the abundance of wickedness, the love of many will grow cold.
He who endures to the end will be saved.
Wickers proclaim the gospel throughout the whole world, a testimony to all nations. Then the end will come.
"So when you see the 'abomination of desolation,' spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing where it ought not (let the reader understand),"
Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
He who is on the roof, let him not come down to take anything from his house.
He who is in the field, let him not return to his house to take his clothes.
Woe to those who are with child and to those who give suck in those days!
They arrived so that your escape would not be in winter or on a Sabbath.
# Revelation 16:18 For then there will be great distress, unequalled from the beginning of the world until now—and never to be equalled again.
Even if those days were not shortened, no flesh would be saved. But for the sake of the elect, those days will be shortened.
Then if anyone says to you, "Look, the Christ is here!" or "There he is!" do not believe it.
# The Translation For there shall arise false christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.
Behold, I have told you beforehand.
If they say to you, "He is in the wilderness!" do not go out. "He is in the inner rooms!" do not believe them.
For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
For wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.
At that time, after the distress of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.
And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven. And then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.
He will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.
From the fig tree, learn this proverb: when its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near.
Thus you too, when you see all these things, know that he is near, at the very gates.
I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all this has happened.
# Heaven and Earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away. Ever-readiness.
"But concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only."
As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be also in the days of the Son of Man.
For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark,
"They did not know until the flood came and took them all; so will be the coming of the Son of Man."
Then there will be two in the field, one will be taken and one left.
Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and the other left.
Stay awake, for you do not know when your Lord will come.
Know this: if the homeowner knew in which watch of the night the thief would come, he would be vigilant and not allow his house to be broken into.
Therefore be you also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh. Faithful and wise servant.
Who then is that faithful and wise servant, whom his master made ruler over his household, to give them food in due season?
Blessed is that servant whom his master finds doing thus!
I tell you the truth, he will put him in charge of all he owns.
If that wicked slave in his heart says, "My master is delaying his arrival."
He began to beat his fellow servants and got drunk and started eating and drinking with the drunkards.
The master of that slave will come on a day he does not expect and at an hour he does not know.
He will cut it into pieces and give his share to the hypocrites. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Ten virgins like us
"Then the kingdom of heaven shall be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom."
Five of them were wise, and five were foolish.
The ignorant women took their lamps but did not take oil with them.
The wise ones took oil in their flasks with their lamps.
As the groom delayed, they all dozed off and fell asleep.
At midnight there was a shout: 'Here comes the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!'
All those virgins got up and trimmed their lamps.
The foolish women said to the wise ones, "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out."
The wise women answered, saying: "Perhaps it is not enough for us, but go to the sellers and buy for yourselves."
As they were on their way to buy [the things], the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast; and the door was shut.
Finally, the rest of the virgins also came, saying: "Master, master, open for us!"
"Truly I tell you, I do not know you."
# Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour when the Son of Man is coming. The Parable of the Talents
"It is like a man going on a journey, who called his own slaves and entrusted his possessions to them."
He gave five talents to one, two to another, and one to a third, each according to his ability. And he went away.
The one who received the five talents went and traded with them, and gained five more talents.
Thus, the one who received the two talents gained two more.
As for the one who received the talent, he went away, dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master's silver.
After a long time, the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them.
The man who had received the five talents brought in five more. "Sir," he said, "you entrusted me with five talents. See, I have gained five more."
"His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'"
Here is the translation: Then the one who had received the two talents came forward and said, "Master, you entrusted me with two talents. See, I have gained two more."
"His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful in a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.'"
He then came too, the one who had received the one talent, and said, "Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not winnow.
I feared, and did go, and hid your weight in the earth. Behold, it is yours.
"His master answered and said to him, 'You wicked and lazy servant! You knew that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter seed,"
You should have invested my money with the money changers, so when I returned I would have received more.
Take the talent away from him, and give it to the one who has the ten talents.
For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.
The worthless servant, throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. The sheep and the goats...
"And when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory."
All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
The sheep he will set on his right, the goats on his left.
"Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.'"
I was hungry and you gave me food. I was thirsty and you gave me drink. I was a stranger and you invited me in.
Naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came unto me.
The righteous will answer him, saying, "Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink?"
"And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you?"
"When did we ever see you sick or imprisoned and come to you?"
The king answered and said to them, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.'
"He will also say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels."
# Matthew 25:42-43 For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink.
I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and imprisoned and you did not visit me.
"Then they also will answer, saying, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to You?'"
"Truly I tell you," he replied, "whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me."
"Then there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth
Conspiracy to kill Jesus
When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he told his disciples,
"You know that in two days it will be Passover, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to be crucified."
Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people assembled at the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,
They consulted together to seize Jesus by trickery and kill him.
They said, "Not on the festival, lest there be an uproar among the people." Perfume was poured on Jesus.
While Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the Leper,
A woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, and she poured it on his head as he reclined at the table.
When his disciples saw this, they were indignant. "Why this waste?" they asked.
He could have sold this fine wine for much more and given the proceeds to the poor.
Jesus knew and said to them, "Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a good work for me."
The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have me.
For she hath done this in anticipation of my burial.
Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her." Judas' betrayal.
Then one of the Twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests
He said, "What will you give me that I should deliver him to you?" They said, "We will give you thirty pieces of silver."
From that time on, he sought an opportunity to deliver him up. The Passover supper with the disciples.
On the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?"
"Go to the town and find that man. Tell him, 'The teacher says: My time is near. I will keep the Passover with my disciples at your place.'"
The disciples did as Jesus commanded and prepared the Passover.
As evening came, he took the Twelve aside.
"I tell you the truth; one of you will betray me."
They were greatly distressed and began to say to him one after another, "Surely not I, Lord?"
"The one who dips his hand with me in the dish, he is the one who will betray me!"
The Son of Man is going as it is written about him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born!
Judas, the betrayer, replied, "Is it me, sir?" He answered, "You said it." Then they ate the Lord's Supper.
And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to the disciples, saying, "Take, eat; this is my body."
He took the cup, gave thanks, and said, "Drink from it, all of you."
# Matthew 26:28 For this is my blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.
I say to you, from now on I will not drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom."
They went to the Mount of Olives. Jesus foretells Peter's denial.
Then Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad."
But I will go ahead of you to Galilee."
Peter answered and said to him, "Even if everyone else doubts you, I will never doubt."
Jesus said to him, "Truly, I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
Peter said to him, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you." And all the disciples likewise declared. In Gethsemane.
Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the disciples, "Sit here while I go and pray over there."
Then he took with him Peter and the sons of Zebedee, and he began to be grieved and very heavy.
He said to them, "My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death. Wait here, and keep watch with me."
He went a little further and fell on his face, praying, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."
He then came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, "So, could you not watch with me for one hour?"
Stay awake and pray so that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."
And going a second time, he prayed, saying, "O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me except I drink it, thy will be done."
Then he came and found them sleeping again, for their eyes were heavy.
Then he left them and went away, and prayed a third time, saying the same words once more.
"Then he came to his disciples and said to them, 'Now sleep and rest! Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.' "
Let's go! Behold, the one who betrays me is at hand!" The arrest of Jesus.
As he was speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived, accompanied by a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and elders of the people.
"And the one who betrayed him gave them a sign, saying: 'The one I greet is the one. Seize him!'"
At that moment, Judas approached Jesus and said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
Jesus said to him, "Friend, why have you come?" Then they came forward and laid hands on Jesus, and seized him.
And one of those who were with Jesus reached for his sword, drew it, and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back in its place, for all who draw the sword will die by the sword."
Do you think I cannot now ask my father to provide me with more than twelve legions of angels?
How can you finish the books: "This is how it should be"?
At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, "Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as though I were a robber? Day after day I sat teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest me."
And this has all come to pass, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.' Then all the disciples left him and fled. Before the council of the Jews
And those who seized Jesus led him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had assembled.
Peter followed him at a distance, right to the high priest's courtyard. He went inside and sat with the guards, waiting to see how it would all end.
The chief priests, the elders, and the entire council were seeking false testimony against Jesus so that they might put him to death,
They found nothing. Though many false witnesses came forward, they found nothing. But finally two false witnesses stepped forward.
"And they said, 'He said, "I am able to destroy the temple of God, and in three days rebuild it."' "
The high priest stood up and said, "Are you not going to answer? What is it that these men are testifying against you?"
Jesus remained silent. Then the high priest stood up and said, "I put you under oath by the living God: Tell us, are you the Messiah, the Son of God?"
Jesus said to him, "You have said so. I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven."
The high priest then tore his clothes and said, "He has blasphemed! Why do we need any more witnesses? You have all heard his blasphemy!"
"What do you see?" they replied, saying, "He is worthy of death."
Then they spat in his face and punched him; others slapped him.
"They said, 'Prophesy to us, Christ! Who hit you?'" "Peter's Denial"
Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him and said, "You were with Jesus of Galilee!"
"He denied it in front of everyone, saying, 'I don't know what you are talking about!'"
Then, when he went out to the porch, another woman saw him and said to those who were there, "And this man was with Jesus of Nazareth!"
He likewise denied it, swearing: "I do not know the man!"
And soon afterwards, the guard came and said to Peter, "Surely you are one of them, for your language gives you away!"
Then he began to curse and swear, saying, "I do not know the man!" And immediately the rooster crowed.
Peter then remembered the words that Jesus had spoken to him: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." So he went outside and wept bitterly.
Judas hanged himself.
In the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people made their plans against Jesus to put him to death.
Bind him and lead him away, and deliver him to Pontius Pilate, the governor.
When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders.
"Saying, 'I have sinned by delivering innocent blood.' They replied, 'What is that to us? See to it yourself!'"
He threw the silver into the temple and left, then went away and hanged himself.
The chief priests took the silver coins and said, "It is not lawful to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money."
They consulted together and bought the potter's field as a burial place for foreigners.
This field has been called the "Field of Blood" ever since.
Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying: "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value."
"And they gave him the field of the potter, as the Lord commanded me." Before Pilate.
Jesus stood before the governor. And the governor asked him, saying, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus said to him, "You have said so."
While the chief priests and elders were accusing him, he made no answer.
"But Pilate said to him, 'Do you not hear how many charges they bring against you?'"
He did not answer him, not even a single word, which amazed the governor greatly.
The governor was accustomed to releasing one prisoner of the people's choice on the feast day.
They had at that time a famous prisoner named Barabbas.
"While Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message: 'Have nothing to
He knew it was out of envy that they had handed him over.
While he was sitting on the throne, his wife sent word to him, saying, "Have nothing to do with that righteous man, because I have suffered greatly today in a dream because of him."
The chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus.
The governor answered and said to them, "Which of the two do you want me to release to you?" They said, "Barabbas!"
Pilate said to them, "Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all said, "Let him be crucified!"
The governor asked, "What evil has he done?" But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood; see to it yourselves."
"And all the people answered, 'His blood be on us and on our children.'"
Then he released Barabbas to them. And having scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified. The soldiers mocked him.
So the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the governor's headquarters, and the whole cohort gathered around him.
They stripped him and dressed him in a crimson robe.
They plaited a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and placed a reed in his right hand. And they knelt before him and mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
They spat on him, took the reed and struck him on the head.
And when they had mocked him, they took the purple robe off him, and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him. Crucifixion.
As they led him out, they came upon a man from Cyrene, Simon by name. They forced this man to carry his cross.
When they arrived at a place called Golgotha, which means "the place of the skull."
Give him vinegar mixed with bitterness to drink. When he tasted it, he refused to drink.
When they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among them by casting lots; thus was fulfilled the scripture, "They divided my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots."
They sat there guarding him.
"And above his head they placed the written charge against him: 'This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.'"
Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
The passersby were reviling him, shaking their heads.
"They were saying, 'You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!'"
And the chief priests also, mocking with the scribes and elders, said:
"He saves others, but he cannot save himself! If he is the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him!"
He said, «I trust in God; let him deliver me now if he will, for he said, 'I am the Son of God!'»
And so the two others, who were crucified with him, also reviled him with the same words. [He] died.
And from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.
And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" which means, "My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?"
Among those who stood by and heard it, some said, "He's calling Elijah."
At once, one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed, and gave Him a drink.
But the rest said, "Let be. We would like to see if Elijah will come to save him!"
Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and gave up his spirit.
The veil of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. The earth shook, and the rocks split.
The graves opened, and many of the bodies of the sleeping saints arose.
They came out of the tombs after his resurrection, entered the holy city, and appeared to many.
The soldiers, including the centurion, who were keeping watch over Jesus, became terrified when they saw the earthquake and everything that had happened. They said, "Certainly this man was the Son of God!"
There were also many women looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him.
And among them was Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. The burial.
In the evening, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came; he too had been a disciple of Jesus.
Then Pilate went and said to Jesus, "What is your body?" And he commanded that the body be given.
Then Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
He placed him in his new tomb that he had cut out of the rock, then rolled a large stone across the entrance of the tomb and departed.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there, facing the tomb. The guards were at the tomb.
Tomorrow, after the preparations were made, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate.
"Sir, we remember how that deceiver said, while he was still alive: 'After three days I will rise.' "
# Mark 16:1-7 (New International Version) So Peter and John ran toward the tomb. The two were running together, but John outran Peter
Pilate said to them, "You have guards. Go and arrest him as you know how."
They went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone.
Resurrection
And after the Sabbath, at the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.
And when a great earthquake occurred, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled away the stone from the door, and sat upon it.
He appeared like lightning, and his clothes were as white as snow.
From fear, the guards trembled and became as dead.
The two women were approached by an angel, who said to them, "Do not be afraid; I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified."
He is not here; for He is risen, as He said! Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
Go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you."
They came out of the tomb quickly, trembling and filled with awe, and ran to tell his disciples.
As they were going to tell the disciples, suddenly Jesus met them and said, "Greetings!" Then they came to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me." The guards' words.
As they were going, behold, some men of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
Let the elders be assembled, and let them consult together, and give unto the soldiers a great sum of money.
"Say that his disciples came at night and stole him while we were asleep."
"If he hears of it from the governor, we will plead with him and put your minds at ease."
They took the silver and did as they were instructed; and this saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continues until this day. Jesus appeared to the disciples.
And the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had directed them.
When they saw him, they bowed down to him, but some of them doubted.
Jesus came forward and spoke to them, saying, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
Teach them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age." Amen.

As it is written in the Prophets: "Behold, I send My messenger before your face, who shall prepare your way before you."
A voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.'
John was baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
All the people of Judea and Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
John had his clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist. His diet consisted of locusts and wild honey.
He was preaching, saying, "After me comes one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals."

In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
And immediately, as he was coming up from the water, he saw the heavens torn open and the Spirit, like a dove, descending upon him.
And a voice from heaven said, "You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased."
And at once the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.
He was in the wilderness for forty days, being tempted by the devil. He was with the wild beasts, and the angels ministered to him. Calling the first disciples.

"The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel."
As he was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
Jesus said to them, "Come, follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
At once, they left their nets and followed him.
Then he went a little further and saw James, the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were in the boat mending their nets.
He called them at once. So they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men, and went after him. An unclean spirit came out of a man.

They were astonished at his teaching, for he spoke with authority.
There was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,
"Ah! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!"
Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent, and come out of him!"
And the unclean spirit convulsed him, and with a loud cry came out of him.
They were all amazed and began to discuss with each other and said, "What is this? What new teaching is this? He even gives orders to unclean spirits and they obey him!"
# Matthew 8:16-17 And the news about him spread throughout all that region. He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out demons; and he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.
When they had left the synagogue, they went directly to the house of Simon and Andrew, along with James and John.
So they told him about her.
He took her by the hand and helped her up, and at that very moment the fever left her and she waited on them.
When evening had come, when the sun set, all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him.

He said to them, "Let us go to the nearby towns, so that I may preach there also; for this was why I came out."
He was preaching in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and casting out demons. Healing a leper.
So he came to him, imploring him, and kneeling down to him, saying, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."
Jesus was moved with compassion, and stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, "I will; be thou clean."
And immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.
He rebuked him and sent him away immediately.
He said to him, "See, do not tell anyone, but go and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."
He went out and began to proclaim and announce the good news widely, so that he could no longer enter a town openly; but he was out in deserted places, and they were coming to him from everywhere.

And when they could not come near Him because of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where He was. So when they had broken through, they let down the bed on which the paralytic was lying.
"When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, 'Son, your sins are forgiven.'"
There were some scribes sitting there, thinking to themselves:
"Why does he speak in blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
"At once Jesus, aware that they were discussing this among themselves, said to them, 'Why do you raise such questions in your hearts?'"
"Which is easier to say to the paralyzed man: 'Your sins are forgiven,' or 'Get up, take your mat and walk'?"
"But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins," he said to the paralytic,
"To you I say: Get up, take your mat, and go to your house!"
He immediately rose and followed him, and left everything behind. The whole crowd were astonished and praised God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!" The calling of Levi.
Then he went out to the sea again. The whole crowd came to him, and he taught them.

While he was reclining at table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners were at table with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.
The scribes and the Pharisees, when they saw him eating with the tax collectors and sinners, said to his disciples, "Why does he eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"
When Jesus heard this, he said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." The question about fasting.

Jesus said to them, "Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast."

They were watching him to see if he would heal on the Sabbath, so that they could bring charges against him.
He said to the man with the withered hand, "Stand up here in front of us!"
Then he said to them, "Is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the Sabbath, to save life or to kill?" But they were silent.
He looked around at them angrily, saddened by their hardness of heart, and said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was restored.
The Pharisees went out immediately and conspired with the Herodians against him, how to destroy him. The crowds followed Jesus.
Jesus departed with his disciples to the sea, and a great multitude followed him from Galilee and Judea.
And from Jerusalem, and from Edom, and from beyond Jordan. Many from Tyre and Sidon, having heard what he was doing, came to him.

The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, "He is possessed by Beelzebul! And by the prince of demons he drives out demons."
