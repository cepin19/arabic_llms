I'm telling you things you don't want to understand, Saleh.
Any problems, Saleh? Open your mind, look inside, look at the world around you, see what people are doing, see what the world is doing.
If my uncle's brother
He doesn't want to develop himself and improve those around him.
# Translation: Oh Saleh, don't be stubborn.
No, no, no, no, I don't care about you.
You walk on the road.
They just pass by, two discarded ones.
You're dead, you stinker.
Do you eat or not?
No eating.
They agreed, humans.
Realge, I have no idea where he's living.
I wanted to be with him.
This is our chance, our cars are old and their models are embarrassing.
Try, try, you try with him in a bit, please.
These are common and well-known matters.
The bull is the only one without a personality.
By God, he's afraid.
I'm the one who's getting on your nerves, Mom.
The budget is in his hands.
What is this project that he is managing?
# Government's Grand Project
Beneath it and what is revealed.
I have the right to take.
You are in one ministry and she is in another.
Oh my, what are you doing? You forgot!
A day in the garage.
I mean, me.
I consider myself a contributor with them.
Nothing happens, I can't get anything out for the project, wow!
What's it to me?
I'm a contributor too.
We should all take it.
Government Project
He's a smart one, your son, this bull.
I understand him well.
Goodness comes to you, but you kick it away.
This is a government project.
This is your chance.
Your tires are as smooth as glass.
Tray of goodness is in front of you.
Take your bite and shove it in your mouth.
Ariel had a secret stash.
I heard it with my own ears.
They say government projects are notorious.
One third was sucked out.
Salum was born.
I'm heading to Souq Waqif.
The fan is eighteen riyals.
Put it in the budget.
Eighty riyals each, a hundred of them.
They said we didn't do anything.
Do you want to go with him?
*Seek refuge from Satan.*
I feel like his head is getting a little bit bigger.
Inshallah, my Lord.
Ahwah is the head of the committee, and everything is under his control.
The most important thing is not to forget us.
We are your neighbors.
We have to be together.
This government's project is an opportunity.
Sure, Ali.
We can't afford to lose you.
You don't have to tell us, Ali.
"And hopefully, everyone who will be part of the project team."
This is definitely a given.
Last night, I and the boys were sitting and chatting.
We're on your side.
As project committee members, we are reassured.
We are apprehensive about Saleh, the head of this committee.
They say that
I'm glad to tell you, Ali.
Let the gang know.
"Indeed, by God, Abu Fahd."
May God bring you good. But you didn't tell me.
Then don't forget, Sa'ud.
No, no.
God willing, things will go as smoothly as possible.
Let him agree to this excuse, it is valid.
No problem.
I don't know if I should go to the beach or not.
Could be.
Alright, since you're with us in the department, it means you're contributing to the project.
Let's keep this between us, most importantly.
Stir the rice and meat casserole in front of you.
I need to eat.
Heni o afia.
Are you okay?
If you keep daydreaming like this, you'll get nowhere.
We'll never finish.
We'll never finish at this rate.
If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
We help each other.
How can we claim our share?
"Really, that's possible?"
What should I write about?
Then, it's not just us who will get it.
Everyone who contributed to the project is demanding their rights.
Why not?
Don't be afraid, Saleh.
We set the budget.
I bought the piece of land today and registered it under my name.
Find it after.
He tells you he won't buy it.
Where the hell did you get this information from?
I am connected to you today.
He tells me to call my brother's phone, pick up.
I told him good.
Your brother has reached the destination quickly.
Do you see the second earth?
The shoes I bought for her yesterday are too small.
They agreed to sell it.
Call him and tell him that if he wants it, I'll register it under his name.
He wants to go alone.
Our right.
We consider ourselves contributors alongside him.
Even if we're not contributors.
I'll eat the biggest bite by myself.
Don't belittle your brother's rights and your mother's rights with you.
I came to ask you.
We are also contributors to the project, and we have the right to demand our rights.
Tell her, tell her.
Aho, it's true, yesterday Sultan came and when I asked him, he refused.
I just didn't let him.
You're mistaken if you don't allocate an amount for their project.
Phase one.
You are no less than anyone else.
Committee members who are with him.
I hear him chatting with them on the phone.
We brought our brothers and their friends.
I know that this government's project is a dead end.
We don't want a lump sum and leave.
**Capital investment**
If my brother Sultan wants to attend the meetings with us, he can.
The members of the committee
Budget of the project
Just that's needed.
You did not fall short.
Hello, may God keep you safe.
Brother-in-law.
Do you like Tra?
We are being served by him in the project.
Let's remember each other.
We distributed the tasks fairly.
You, Saleh.
I have bricks, blocks, and concrete by my side.
The rest are electrical and water, leave them to me.
Hey, guys!
Decide your share.
By God, I
I sometimes say I'll take a lump sum.
Sometimes I say
Let it be a ratio.
It's okay, Saleh. It's okay.
Take whatever you want and however you want it.
Most important.
I'm still here, too.
Icon f hadhi al-asbuu.
Everyone should decide on the amount they desire.
For instance,
He hanged himself after a few days.
He wants a thousand more after his mother.
Why, I mean, come on.
What do you think?
I'm with you.
Even after the shareholders.
You'd better get to work and loot, it's none of your business.
You have orphans' inheritance.
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, enlarge the budget, enlarge it!
You're a big eater, mashallah.
What the hell is this?
What is this? This is not your father's drink.
# Sultan
Oh Sultan, my brother.
He is considered a contributor after all.
This is the last name.
Shuaib, how many names did your friend put down?
Izid, Izid, names he says, they will deceive them.
Okay, should I put it in the percentage group or the fixed amount group?
Don't put it with the beggars.
You put a good amount, put it for him, put twenty thousand.
Hey man.
Even here, in this note, they wrote it.
I am one of the lads from our neighborhood.
This is all, Saud's list has exceeded Abdulaziz's.
All of it will be allocated to the first-stage budget.
Jackie like this, you don't feel it.
Hey, here's the list that mom sent me.
You call every two hours and add people as you please.
May God grant her a long life, haha.
My dear child.
She's sick, poor, and helpless.
She came back empty-handed.
Oh God, may he guide you, I'll kill you for this, this is the last one.
Grow it well.
Hey, this moment is enough for you.
How much do I need for rent, food, and hospital expenses?
Eighty-one thousand and eighty riyals.
You're a real pain in the neck, you sow.
You're the only one, but your yacht is expensive.
God guide you, put her name on the list.
Husseina, oh Husseina, daughter of Ahlal.
Why are you paying for it out of your own pocket?
Reassure him and tell him that from the second stage onwards, there's nothing left.
88,000 AI
Boy, they're going to give her a new liver.
Tell him, tell him, ask him to give me more after two thousand, I'll buy gifts for the girls.
I tell you two thousand.
1000 riyals for me
Ayesha Hussain, daughter of Ahlam.
I can ruin your reputation with your friends.
Dad, please.
I'm really busy.
I'll talk to you later.
They increased the number of people eating from the tray.
The infrastructure can withstand.
Don't forget about me now.
Write the number you want.
He's back, I don't know.
You and your conscience.
I am the chairman of the board of directors.
You deserve the million.
They're deciding tomorrow when the project starts.
They are downloading the payments now, God willing, for us, the first batch.
How much?
Give it to us all at once or in installments.
Why her, specifically? More than us?
In a round, suck it up, just stay quiet now, the committee is coming, they'll be here soon.
Oh my God, he said, "Oh my God." Oh my God, he told you to shut up, so shut up.
You really have no shame and no imagination.
If I hear so much as a peep out of any of you.
Cut his tongue out.
Wow, the group is taking forever.
You know, this is also money, not just like that.
Before, it was beautiful.
Fifty million
I'm not thirsty for the oil of the generation, a little.
In the end, you are the boss.
We don't want any trouble.
We adopt the budget.
Through your talk about the project, Professor Saleh, we notice that it is a vital and important one as well.
May God protect you, it's not just for this generation.
Yes, yes.
Tomorrow, the first phase of the project will be inaugurated.
We would like to thank you for your presence and congratulate you.
And I welcome you.
On this occasion
United Nations
Where do you want us to put the project?
We're where, then?
I have no idea where we are.
What's this all about?
They're not seeing the officials speak, and the people are applauding them.
We are at the official opening. What's wrong with you?
We're in the project now, so what are you talking about?
We are in the project.
It's raining heavily, and my sweat is mixing with the rain.
This shack, I don't know why they put it here.
What's your business in the corner?
This shack, may God save you, has terrible infrastructure.
The grand opening of the world's beaches.
What's wrong with you, for the third millennium?
By God, I have no idea what you're saying.
Aye, Alhamdulillah, age is an ugly thing.
Man, I wish I knew why they took me away.
He just needs to park his car.
I was surprised, Haley.
But when she told me.
No one has sent me anything.
I saw it with my own eyes; it had a huge farm.
Alhamdulillah, are you comfortable?
You're welcome, babe, while you're comfortably at home.
Why do you want to cause trouble? No, dad, don't let anyone mess with your mind, my lady, Sheikhah Manirah.
# My Brothers, My Strength Oh, Munira, be grateful for having brothers like Rashid, Saad, and Faqer.
They fear for your share and invest it for you.
I have a good friend, my partner, Hessa.
Our brothers don't give her any of her father's share of the inheritance.
We don't know anything about that.
This is a legitimate right.
This is a matter of trust; you don't trust us.
I don't know how.
I didn't like my brother Rashid's words.
# Entangled and tangled with these injections they give me every three months.
Okay, this is mine.
He keeps telling me.
You don't trust us.
Chatting about inheritance and money always leads to clarity.
I'm not comfortable with you being my father anymore.
You know what you're doing to people.
I'm sorry, but I don't
I can't believe she's a millionaire heiress.
Absurd brothers.
Money will destroy the world.
The truth is the truth, and this is the law of God.
So what?
We're building the company.
We invest in land, real estate, and money.
No problems, no headache.
She says she was walking towards the ground in the desert.
That's way too much for her.
Let's not get into the details of the story.
What's the story?
Your sister started to dig.
This is the story.
She's up to something.
We'll give her the money.
Falcon, a gift from you.
We need to find a solution, Rashid.
There's something on my mind.
What is this?
My share of my father's inheritance.
Those who donate to me every three months.
Everything is known.
Forty thousand, nothing has changed.
They're crazy to invest their money like that.
I see nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.
Why not me?
"It doesn't require much thought."
They said, "We'll add more to make you happy and quiet down."
Straighten up your words, straighten them all up.
They're all dripping it to me drop by drop.
I see their women.
We have a wide range of sets, available in various shapes and colors.
I am forbidden to live even half of their lives.
They begrudge me the fruits of my father's labor.
If you speak.
This is your right.
Legally and religiously.
I feel like they are cheating me and pulling the wool over my eyes.
I'm not comfortable with their methods anymore.
By God, mother, who knows what's happening in this world.
They humiliated me, they tormented me, oh mother.
They don't know that there is an account and a reckoning.
"Indeed, Allah will recompense them for consuming unlawful wealth."
Bear it, my mother, and bring up the courts for them.
They're breeding, I swear to God.
Do we have many people, or is it because of our population size?
That's why I tell you, my dear mother.
Slow down a bit.
Every single one of them has a building that looks like a skyscraper.
I want nothing but what is rightfully mine.
Father, build a mosque for my son before I die.
I want to donate to these poor people.
Okay, Mom, I'm safe.
Be silly in Tangier, my dear mother.
I won't even mention the courts to them.
I am not doing anything wrong.
Do you know why?
In these times
She deserves it.
Yay asks the accountant.
Who are you asking, the accountant?
Reply to them.
I am, I mean, God bless you, I mean, I came for your sister.
The door you came in through.
Don't frown.
Open the door you just barged through.
No, no.
No Falcon
Saad is forbidden.
# Recipe: Manousheh with Za'atar
You are entitled to your share of the company and properties; we have no objection.
Seven hundred thousand
She has always been quiet.
"That's definitely her rotten husband."
Or else your sister is kind.
A jinn is sitting among them.
Legal and well-defined share.
I'll take the six hundred thousand, or sixty thousand be damned.
It's a shame on them.
Expect anything, Manira.
Abouy Company
Eight apartment buildings.
Unoccupied lands and houses.
Tell me seven hundred thousand only.
I expect a concession.
No, Munira.
Bear it, they narrate stories about you and expect you to give in. Bear it, I've already told you.
You have every right, dad, to know everything about the lands and the money; it's not up to them.
The company only.
You are a partner with them.
Now they're kicking you out of the company.
I tell you, no one can stop me.
Look at what.
Your father's company is
Are you not seeing how annoying it is?
I tell you, let me go in.
Huda, there's no need.
He has his mother's papers.
Yay, if he keeps talking like that, I'll cut his tongue out.
We're sorry.
My brothers Saad and Fahed, I'll bring them to my office and explain it to them; they don't know what's going on.
Come on in, guys!
Take a look at Nasser, what's he drinking?
Welcome, please come in. May God bless you.
What is it?
They're making up a story.
He discovers how old she is.
He discovers it has four hundred thousand, not forty.
Come on, let's calculate it together.
96 months
I'll give it a 360-degree spin.
Eleven million five hundred twenty thousand
"It's fine. No big deal."
Hit his head on the ceiling.
Thank him by telling him.
These are our funds.
All the young people are like this, what they inherited.
Welcome, oh God, to whoever comes. Forgive me, forgive me. The company is yours; only good things have happened.
We're ready.
Samir, the accountant, is present.
Mall of e shay yabih al-akh Nasser yatal'a 'alayh.
You got it, the whole company is at your disposal.
I want to take a shower, take your time, don't worry about anything.
You're impeccable.
No problem.
Trap taken.
Spin through all the files.
She should have more than ten million.
"Don't even mention it."
Do you say she's pitiful?
Her father left.
Four apartment buildings.
I thought they had three plots of land.
Every land is bigger than the other.
"We put our trust in God against them, oh father."
It's a shame what they are doing.
I do not threaten them.
I can't do much, oh Salman's moon.
I have no choice but to take them to court.
I'll translate these two pages for you.
The case was postponed.
Bear it, my father, O Nasser.
They bring up the topic of court.
You're right, you left your bed and the doctor is looking for you.
Arise, O people, in safety and well-being.
My soul, arise and walk.
Heal me, O Lord, and cure the sick among the Muslims.
He didn't tell me.
Excuse me.
Oh, I remember you, I recognize you, I recognize you.
Yes yes yes yes
Regarding what, brother?
No worries, you're welcome.
I'm dying right now that he found out about the millions.
"Hopefully, this Abdullah they sent will be able to do it."
He is a friend of Rashid, a righteous man.
Do you know him, it's been years.
Do you believe me, Munira?
Even Abdullah advised me on this.
Stick with them.
Beware lest you lead them astray.
Try to take as much as you can from them.
Do you know what Abdullah is saying?
We don't live up to seventy or eighty years.
Our courts are biased towards people who live for at least two hundred years.
May peace be upon Umm Salmin, may God have mercy on her.
She used to say, may God have mercy on her.
Our population has reached four hundred thousand.
The case takes ten years and more.
We need to be heard so we can go to court.
This is it.
Hey, man, you're with them.
May God bless you, God willing.
You're an old friend from my school days.
The riches of this world are not worth a thing.
I'm doing well, thank you.
You, by the grace of God, come from a well-known and large family.
Offspring of origin.
Ava ya Rashid, we are buddies.
Go with a smile.
If you don't speak, I'll speak right now.
Come on, come on, no more nonsense. These aren't friends, they're not friends.
Are you getting up now, or what?
# Jewelry Set for 190,000 I bought a jewelry set for 190,000 from the jewelry exhibition.
Where did she get that from?
They spend their money on their women.
They are depriving their sister of her rightful share.
You still have hope, Nasser.
You and your arguments with you.
Yesterday when I called him at the mosque.
Let me be as I told you.
Sons of Arabs, and they are well-known.
Yes, why not?
I still say so.
"Oh Allah, make this gathering blessed with these radiant faces."
"O Allah, enlighten our hearts with what is beneficial for our religion and our worldly affairs."
Listen up, you.
Do you have another topic besides my sister's inheritance issue?
He is scolded.
Go away, don't cry, my dear.
I don't care about you.
I've been begging and pleading with you for months, but you just won't listen.
I don't care about you.
Tomorrow morning, I'm going to court.
I'm empty, I'm empty.
Hello, hello.
Don't worry about her.
I'm going to court tomorrow.
The day after tomorrow
Let's give you a chance to see what you can do.
Goodbye.
I won't let it go without a fight.
If I hear them, I'll get upset.
Come on, let's see what they decide.
I'll be busy tomorrow, Saad.
You're planning to take us to court and file a complaint.
She told me to postpone it until tomorrow and go to her.
What is this?
May your tongue be sound and healthy.
Why did you say that to me?
You want to go to court and sue us.
# You Get Your Share of the Inheritance
She said.
Your world has become sweet.
Your world is exceptional.
Why me, I told you the day after tomorrow.
When you arrive, park your car in the courthouse parking lot.
I see a safety device.
Go to the eighth floor.
This role includes judges.
There are no lawyers in the country.
You'll definitely need them.
Are you mocking us here?
We want her to sue us in court.
My soul is in court.
Sonoluminescent
I expect us to concede.
"It's fine."
The way is soft and gentle.
The way is soft and gentle.
We walk, my brother.
I forgot to give my sister Munira something important.
This is the Al Raya newspaper of today.
There is a good article in it.
Apparently, only a writer, a doctor.
I want to see it as a gift from you.
Let him get out of the situation he's living in.
Oh my God, it's forbidden.
Four sons he has, a house like a human being's he doesn't.
He's not to blame, he's just putting up with those around him and those beneath him.
The poor adventurer in this project.
I never expected Abu Walid to go into business.
Eat, eat, the merchant's children, the new one, Bou Walid.
Habibah, my love, shall I put something for you?
No, please, please, please.
Okay, come on, get up, move, I'll get you some fruits, fruits.
Mom, I want the game that Hamoud has.
Hani wa afiyah. Hani wa afiyah.
Mama Walid, wake up and make some sweets for your uncle.
Congratulations on the project, Abu Walid. You deserve it.
We've got an excellent accountant for the quarter.
# English Translation: Thank you, thank you, dad.
Dad, now that we're big traders, I want you to build me a room of my own.
Joe Shatalab doesn't have any capitalist ambitions.
Inshallah, I'll get you a big BlackBerry.
Let's not get into your demands.
Our situation is like that of normal people.
Instead of this miserable life we're living.
Before anything else, let's pay off the debts we owe, and then we'll see what happens.
Wow, you look really happy, Abu Waleed!
He started eating more than before.
A merchant, who can match him?
My merchant father lives.
Blessings of the project.
Leave some for the friends.
Your Lord is indeed the Repeller, and He may save you.
I met one of them who is Japanese.
# My Place at the Table He took my place at the table and gave me a catalog as a gift.
Dry one from the quarter.
Oh, come on, give me a break.
Multipurpose halls
Always like this.
# Gaming Halls, These Are for Computers
Tap on cinema.
Suddenly, a sports field, wow!
This is magic.
They were impressed and agreed right away.
I borrowed a bit from the bank, a bit from my wife's family, a bit from my own, and I sold a piece of land I had, praise be to God.
You are the chair of the committee and it has been approved.
John ordered the shipment from the factory, and the ministry approved it.
Along the factory, the email.
I'm calling you, Lynn.
There's thyme.
There's nothing, I swear, I'm sitting in Ali's office waiting.
My secretary called me, my brother.
He traveled ten days ago.
You're on your own luck.
Zain, my application is now complete.
The committee has approved it.
Why should it be me? I mean, what do you expect from me? What's going to happen?
I am the full manager.
Why don't you go to him to sign it for you so we can finish this?
He said there's nothing in his hand.
"Is it that all the employees are like this?"
Every one of them is wearing their keffiyeh in a different way, as if they were saying "Look at me, the captain of the ship."
Count your blessings.
By God, my brother, I was reviewing them, and I was anxious.
Inshallah, I'm done.
This is Bu Fahd; you never know when he comes to work or when he doesn't. He does as he pleases.
What can I do, my dear?
And then, the money just slipped away.
I absolutely must finish this transaction quickly; I don't know what to do.
By God, I'm afraid the manager will ask about you.
He says he's sick. He says anything.
I'm also waiting for Abu Fahd.
Okay, so if you're the secretary and you say this, what's the solution then?
Give me your number.
No, he is not the secretary. Sit down, sit down. No, he is not the secretary. What's wrong with you?
# Don't call, you scared the group, they thought it was the secretary.
Leen, we're waiting for Abu Fahd right now.
Papa blues, my money is gone, I'm crazy, I prayed.
These are free. These are also free.
Hold on, hold on, guys!
Silence, silence, oh silence, silence.
Okay, the man told you to be quiet, shut up!
Bu Fahad has to go to the airport now.
How did it show up?
Come on, come on, come on, let's hurry, let's get to the car, come on!
This is a snow problem.
May God help you.
Wait for Abu Fahd.
My dear, don't blame your father.
He's just not right at all.
If the goods are received.
He's wasting his money.
I need it now.
Ah, where are you now?
What's wrong with you, Shador?
There is something in front of you.
My brother called me at midnight, waking me up from my sleep.
Dude, I told you.
I told you so.
My talent is unique.
Dad, I know, but it's not possible.
The attendance starts next week at the university.
If I don't register with them and they don't accept me, then I'll have to wait for the next semester.
Dad, three months are wasted on me.
I mean, come on, Bouj, look at me, I'm not falling short.
Here's the translation: I return them every day, I return them every day.
Wait for Abu Fahd, wait for Abu Fahd.
I'm just sitting at home doing nothing.
Dude, you don't understand.
You only call during lunch hour.
Hey, this is the fourth time you've called me.
Dude, don't you understand?
I know you need the money.
God willing, this week, Bou-Fahad will sign the paperwork.
They pay him the first time.
My God, I don't know what to tell you, my sister.
I was startled from my sleep.
As the night stretches on, he walks and talks to himself.
If Bu-Fahad falls.
May God protect us.
Because of this.
This week, it's necessary for Bou-Fahad to sign the deal.
Abu Fahd, this is the worst kind of deal to sign the transaction.
# Workout Schedule ## Monday
We travel once a year.
Neglecting the interests of the people.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, how are you?
Better now.
I've been told two stories.
You pull me, attract me, this wonderful heat.
What else is there?
I heard that I should go for a check-up.
# Treatment Request [Your name]
I'll show you what I can do with these employees.
The deadline is almost up.
Give me the phone. Give the phone.
I have secretary Bu Fahd.
I wanted to tell you that I love you.
I hate Bu Fahd. God willing, I will definitely go to work.
Call me as soon as you arrive.
Come right away.
I'm with you.
Dude, you've never been like this before.
Now I'm talking to you.
You're staring at my phone.
I said it's a sin.
At least so I can feel something.
If you balance
I'll take you back to your department.
Fifteen cartons of prints.
Fifteen cartons of printing paper.
He breaks my heart, I swear.
The manager is punishing.
Come with us.
I heard about the factory, you.
He will lose a large sum if he doesn't complete the transaction today or if they don't sign it for him.
If the manager leaves and turns around.
Hello, humans.
If the manager asks about him.
I'm not afraid, we'll handle it, just let him go, it's a shame.
Bu Walid
I'm leaving, but wait for my call, God willing.
Hey, humans!
May God help him.
Hold on, folks, hold on, folks, hold on.
I have no idea, I'll just go to the office, pick up a few things, and leave.
Wait for Abu Fahd.
No one move.
Don't sit down.
Look at Abu Fahd.
Let's go to school.
Wait for Abu Fahd.
Wait for Abu Fahd.
Look at Abu Fahd.
Let's go inside the Oz of Pakistan.
Door to door.

We're crawling towards you here, and millions [more are coming].
Call the hospital ASAP.
Speak not of the hospital.
Wait for Abu Fahd.
I've spent my entire life as a correspondent, from those days until now.
By God, long life to you, Abu Saeed.
How are you, kid?
They burned it forty years ago.
I am a correspondent.
Dizziness, damn it!
I'm dripping with sweat, no air conditioning back then.
Do you think riding a bicycle was easy back then?
There is a yellow stamp.
By God, you've tired us out, O Bu Sa'id.
Wretched, may your father be wretched.
What can you do, son of Adam?
Abu Saeed
Oh my, please forgive us, the manager has arrived, we're off to wrap up our business, as he says.
The manager has arrived, sweetie. Let's go!
Congratulations, Bousaid.
They say your son Khalid started working.
How do you want it from me?
I hope so, God willing.
Pigeon repellent.
I told you, God willing, when the last of my children graduates, I'll retire.
Graduated and started working.
Alhamdulillah, finally I'm going to finish my business.
I delivered the message to the best of my ability.
Alhamdulillah, we did our best. Alhamdulillah.
Change the gear, Abu Saeed.
You deserve it.
You're welcome, my friend, Abu Abdulaziz.
You're welcome, my friend, Abu Abdulaziz.
Hi, hi.
We did our part.
They will continue the journey.
**خ**
After all this time and all the hard work.
It's all just one mess after another.
You need to rest, Abu Saeed.
He invited me out after leaving your place.
On the occasion of retirement.
A cup of coffee and a cigarette, oh my.
I'll finish you off, you bastard.
You're in a hurry for the funnel cake, Abu Saeed, huh?
No problem.
Alkhanfroush is ready.
Yay, yay, God willing, from my eyes, goodbye.
Oh my, the khonafroosh is ready, waiting for me!
I'll finish all the paperwork for you, God willing.
Your chance, don't blow it today.
The manager told me he's traveling.
I just don't feel like it.
I don't even feel like moving.
Send Zain.
You're officially free now.
God bless you.
Now finally, I can focus on resting.
You've been great, Abu Abdulaziz. Goodbye.
Park for me, father.
There is no work.
You're not in a relationship with him, are you?
Open your eyes for me, please.

Thank you, thank you. Goodbye.

My yacht, I can't.
I'm on my own with this paperwork; I sent my dad to get it done for me.
Zohra will be upset.
Alright, mom.
My dad quit his job.
May God be with him now, poor thing.
He's been working a lot, let him rest now.
Let him rest.
He said, "Make me some khanfaroosh."
I did it and prepared it.
I've been waiting.
Fear God in this old man, have mercy on him, have mercy on his age.
It's your turn now.
He'll eat it tomorrow.
The poor guy just wants to rest.
You've embarrassed this old man.
That's him who came back.
Wahoo, I'm tired.
Don't torment me with their matter.
Don't make me beg them.
I was going to take the paperwork to the bank on my way to work.
He's threatening and if anyone is late, watch out!
No problem, dear.
Rely on your work.
"Sure, on my word and by these small eyes of yours. The Chinese dish, okay, goodbye."

This is it, every day they're sending you to a different place.

Shame on you, your breath stinks.
There is something in my nose.

I'm at the branch near the market, dad.
Go away.
I'm not going to the branch in the market again, they keep telling me it's not there, I'm sure.
Inshallah, God willing, farewell.
I've got a sunstroke.
Shh, the sun is setting.
I entered our neighbors' house.
Did the maid recognize me?
She asked me, "What's wrong?"
"May God guide you."
La la la, I can't become a snake oil salesman, oh Saeed.
Mom, where's Dad now?
I am the lion.
This is not what you say to any bank.
They told him the papers were incomplete.
Take a taxi.
Mom, we had a meeting with the manager.
My dad, how is he now, I hope he's doing well.
I melted a little, my head is spinning.
Here I am telling you, in front of him.
Let your father rest.
Poor you, oh Saeed.
They must adhere to the working hours; otherwise, reports will be written about their actions and consequences will follow.
Hey, how are you?
Yeah, my friend.
Can you say I'm retired and not retired?
How do you mean?
Those first years.
It's our fate to suffer.
Your sons are men.
We are obliged to help them.
Poor things, they keep telling me.
By God, you don't know what you're talking about.
Young men without fathers can't get their affairs in order.
He returned to his job, and the difference was noticeable.
You'll have a job that allows you to leave, meaning you can take off.
May Allah reward you with goodness.
Hey, watch out, I just want the coffee behind you.
Where are you, Abu Saeed?
I'll do it with integrity for my son Saeed.
I'm here at this ministry, having some coffee.
I'll take the lands, may God give us strength.
Goodbye.
Mom, what's wrong? Okay, I'll see you later. Bye.
You better watch out.
Here's my warning to you.
I heard you telling Saeed.
Your father is sick.
I don't care about you.
You're welcome to complain to your dad if you're not satisfied.
I don't see him silent.
What is speaking?
You humiliated him, you made him feel worthless. Fear God for this man's sake.
You woke me up with your shouting; it reached me over there. What's going on?
Dad, you were a government employee, and you know what an inventory means.
Ha ha ha ha ha, I write this first.
Now seriously, what are they doing?
Dad, tomorrow is the last day to submit applications for loans at the Development Bank.
La la la, who says?
Alright, dad.
I'll tell you two words and you'll believe it.
He tells you he has an inventory committee.
I'm sorry,
Wow, how are you?
Run, my soul, run and get his paperwork done.
There's nothing. There's nothing. There's nothing.
He came back from outside, and there was silence.
He doesn't answer me when I talk to him.
There's neither shame nor modesty.
They can't blame your father for taking a stand against you.
If that suits you like this.
May God reward you with goodness, you didn't fall short.
He should have called you.
Why does he keep calling his bed?
Dear and precious, oh father.
You've always been there for us, and we appreciate it.
Wipe it on me.
Let me handle it.
Alright, dad.
My dear and honored.
# خنفروش ## خنفروش
Well done, thank you.
I'm sorry, I
May Allah reward you with goodness.
We've decided from this day forward.
We can handle our transactions ourselves.
You've done a great job, my friend. May God reward you with goodness. Praise be to God.
Sure, I'll be happy to help. Here's the translation: "Please, and I beg you, father."
Consider it the last one.
I can't let it happen.
Call me now.
I'm not going to the minister, dad, I'm not going to him.
Will the minister be upset with you?
I'll be upset if you go, you must go after I kiss you. No, no, no, this can't be, I won't let you do this, not even to the minister.
I don't know what to say, dad. I don't want to upset you.
No, don't tell me, and I won't tell you.
You are welcome, consider it done and ready.
Hey, on your way, when you're done with your business, come by, Saeed, my brother.
"And may God protect you, my son."
Consider it the last deal, I'll finish it for you.
I'll do as you command, father.
Your son had to sign this paper.
I'll bring it tomorrow.
Honestly, I advise you to get it today.
If the transaction is not entered for them.
You'll wait for me after two months.
La la la, until now, I'll make him sign it and then I'll reply.
La la la, it's not needed.
Call him, let him come in two minutes.
I dedicate it solely to you.
Do you not know Saeed?
I'm on leave.
I only go to Morocco.
He has none and a quarter.
I ask one, where are you?
Tell me, I am with Saeed.
I can't wait for my shift to end.
Alright, dad.
Throw your papers away yourself.
John sent his children.
You don't have any children, do you?
I feel something, my uncle.
My pleasure, sir.
You did not fall short.
There's no hope.
I will leave you.
Go to the nursing home.
I don't want to tell them where I'm going.
What do you tell them, Abu Saeed?
I'm writing something else for them.
Alhamdulillah.
He got out of prison yesterday.
No, by God, my sister.
We're done with this chit-chat.
He told me, "You and I, let's not speak on the radio, or else we'll be on TV."
What got me into this mess was just some nonsense.
Oh God, may he find guidance and reform, God willing.
Oh my sisters, farewell, may God protect you.
Here's the translation: Is this the prison shower?
I was traveling yesterday.
My sister, what can I tell you?
Call once in this program, this is the mills guy they call him.
I've been talking to the man, my brother.
Khalid Jassim is here.
Enough with the nonsense!
Listen up, my sister's husband's people at work.
My sister is talking about the government.
Weep, oh oil, your money.
Mother, mother, what has happened to this boy?
Not a single one of his friends.
They were happy with him and kept telling him, "Do this and do that."
They all disowned him.
He returned, may God guide him.
I'm on my way, my dear siblings, let me go, I have cooking to do.
Welcome.
Come here, dad.
Come, sit down.
Enough of this nonsense, my son.
By God, dad, I'm tired and sick.
She's in the hospital, knocked out.
You don't deserve this, Mom.
I really don't want that to happen to you.
Dad, I didn't tell you.
What's wrong, mom?
He kept screaming.
I won't let you go.
Dad, this time I got away with it.
Here you go. "Here I am telling you."
Oh, my dear mother, no worries!
Forget about it.
Enough of this nonsense.
Okay, why did the manager get fired, poor guy?
It's a sin, after all these years, you come today and tell me you're done with me.
Do you understand what I'm saying, Saleh?
Enough of this nonsense.
Give us just one.
Come here, Saleh.
You're a human; these things shouldn't bother you.
You, praise be to God, are a follower of public affairs and you criticize.
It's not easy.
We've just crossed out a few ones.
You are one of them.
You're not the one meant.
See you later, goodbye.
Brother, how are you?
I hope Uncle Abu Munira doesn't find out.
Tonight, father, the wind of Amsher blows upon you.
Where is it coming from?
If you ask me.
Tell him to get to work.
They told you they'd fire him if not for...
I asked my mom, and she said that he works there.
I have to.
You must enter.
This is what we do with it now.
I got involved with her daughter and him.
I'll do as you wish.
I'll give him a two-week extension.
He'll be sorry if he doesn't work. I'll pull his ears off and take him to court. I'll make him divorce her.
Have a coffee now, you.
You're acting like a fly buzzing around, there must be something on your mind.
Mom, honestly.
I want to go out.
What are you up to?
I know you want to go.
Your heart craves coffee.
I want to chat and ramble.
Go away, you're disgusting, go to sleep!
Tomorrow morning, go look for a job.
God willing, I'll get up early in the morning.
Mom, I told you I'd stop, I swear I've left that habit behind.
Alright, I swear.
Mom, I'm feeling a bit uncomfortable.
I don't want to mention that nonsense.
You're deaf.
Let's cut the old nonsense.
Where are you, man? Looks like you've been put on mute. Give us one of those old-school tunes, man!
We've heard enough, enough of this nonsense. We've heard.
Enough of this nonsense.
Enough of this nonsense.
Salih is present.
Saleh is resting.
Let's hope my son hasn't done anything wrong without my knowledge.
We're just saying that Jafna Saleh is present in the coffee shop.
What did he say to you?
Oh, Mom, fix it, please.
They were people present.
You're Nadia.
I won't waste your time with me.
If I see one of them at the door, I'll chew his leg off.
But I can't blame you.
The blame is on him for not setting any boundaries for you.
My son, my bread and my hands, I know you very well.
You're like a cigarette butt.
Do I speak or do I not speak? Should I say it or should I not? I should say, enough is enough, or I should not say, enough is enough.
Here you go. "Here I am telling you."
I am broadcasting on the radio.
Or else, Saleh, enough with the nonsense.
Professor Saleh, you are a man with a very high sense of patriotism.
I'm afraid we can't disturb you.
But what can we do?
Come on, forgive us.
Hello Saleh, how are you?
Are you kidding? You're dear to us.
No, by God.
Bro, I tell you every day, enough with the nonsense.
Bro, you're a brave man, you're not afraid of anything.
If you surrender once, say it outright.
I am Allah, may you be protected, that's enough.
I don't need this, just leave me alone, enough of your nonsense.
Come on, man, he's begging you, just one more time for his sake.
Wow, man!
Your Highness, the most important thing now is...
Regarding the job.
The job is the other way around; you deserve it. You are a national treasure and dear to us.
We were calling you to inform you.
John exposed you in front of everyone.
Are you serious?
Everywhere I go, they tell me there are no vacancies.
Poor souls, they wish to employ me, but there are no jobs available.
Now, how are you going to support the household with your mother?
Don't forget about it too.
Four kids have it.
God is generous.
Never give up, my love.
Keep hope alive.
I won't stop.
I have to go and look for a job for you.
Because my father won't cause us any trouble.
I swear, Manira, I'm willing to do anything for you.
I'll stop, I say, enough of this nonsense.
Enough with the nonsense.
You know what he's up to these days.
I told you so.
You just can't help it, Abu Fahd. May God guide you.
Do you not listen?
I'll go myself and tell the minister about the disasters he's causing.
Ashbīẓan al-wazīr
He definitely understands it this way.
You're right.
This is it.
What cannot be ignored.
You know, it's just a rumor that you're going to be replaced, and it's quite strong.
I'm looking for a way to spend time on it.
I don't want anyone to think I'm involved in this matter.
Your idea is right.
What are you thinking about?
The way I remove Sultan from your path.
Are you hearing about Saleh Saleh? Enough with the nonsense.
May God protect you; this is from our neighborhood.
Beneath him lies.
You've deprived us, brother Saleh, of your voice.
No, Saleh.
I am one of your biggest followers.
He's doing well, Alhamdulillah, he doesn't need it anymore.
Inshallah soon.
He'll come back, and you'll hear his voice, and you'll be delighted.
Bo Fahd asks about you himself.
Come on, tell me, Saleh.
Why did you stop?
By God, I've got some problems, psychological and health issues, a bit of everything.
You just want the truth.
You are considered a fighter.
I haven't heard that from you in ages.
God, God, God, I beg you, Saleh, please.
Once, just this once, for my sake.
I want to hear it from your mouth.
Saleh says it's done.
No way, guys, it's tough, man, it's honestly tough.
What's wrong with you, man?
> Real, I beg you.
`Abdurrahman, I've cut off.`
Then you didn't tell me you were looking for a job.
Alright, this is your chance.
Let the man hear you and be pleased with you. The next day, go to his office and ask for the job.
I don't understand you.
I'm doing this for your own good.
Do you know what I mean?
Alright, that's enough. We don't want any more. Go home.
No, no, no, no, no, that's enough, we don't want it.
Okay, man, shh, shh, shh, shh, just hold on, man, let's talk this through.
Enough, we don't want any more here.
Okay, okay.
Okay, now if I were to go back, of course, I would be cut off, just like last time.
For example, what does Bu Bu Bu BuFahad like to listen to? He loves listening.
# She's single, which means she's got a lot of problems, a lot of issues, and a lot of drama.
What's the best thing to listen to, or what does he like, for example protests, I don't know, you tell me.
According to the signed contract.
Be mindful of your responsibilities.

"Screw the job, then."
Don't interrupt me.
Why did the employee do that?
Where is the seventh, seventh?
Don't interrupt me.
Seventhly, Your Excellency, the Minister.
Why the employee?
When the ministry moved into its new headquarters
I bought my brother's cars.
Hey guys, enough with the nonsense.
I'm so glad you're back, and with your voice! Please don't leave us hanging like that again.
Hey, people who mean a lot to me, it's been a while.
Or I'll just cut it off, honestly.
Mom, you said it's over, stop already.
You're the one who stopped him.
Hey, my girl.
This is what they call enough nonsense, I'll expose him on the radio.
I heard it from someone else, they told me.
I suspect that someone in the ministry is leaking information to him.
It's so stuffy in here right now.
The weather turned foul.
The minister is ready to serve.
I don't care.
When all the time belongs to the ministry, may God protect you.
I overheard him, Your Highness.
Oh my god, I said it just for you.
He didn't give me a chance, man.
You never called me.
Abdurrahman told me to go and do my job.
You never called me.
By God, you're so pitiful, Saleh.
You really break my heart.
I am Secretary to Mr. Fawaz.
I know the whole story.
They exploited you; they had a specific goal they wanted to achieve.
Unfortunately, they delivered it to him.
Do you know who's behind this whole thing?
Abdurrahman, son of Farijkum.
Ah, he's the one who planned all of this.
Bo Fahad, it's impossible to employ you.
One day, you'll do to him what happened to Sultan.
Madam is famous for you.
It's impossible for anyone to distract you.
I'll take you to court to get a divorce.
I've found the solution.
We are the best community in the world right now.
Flawless
We don't have it.
We never have any flaws.
We are comfortable.
What is this intermediary?
Even if one person knows you and tells you to take the role.
Because it's a system.
He takes his rights more than a stranger.
We do not rely on strangers.
We don't have it.
# Effort is your work, we don't have flaws, we have flaws.
Or else one of the elders.
He'll keep you at home.
There is nothing like that here.
Best regards,
Saleh Rashid Saad Rashid Al-Bahahiri
Famous for Saleh, no more nonsense.
I don't want dinner.
I was running, then I looked down and my shirt ripped.
I see a new dress, it's beautiful, I envy you.
He saw a boy wearing the new shirt that we just bought together from Villaggio.
I'll pull his beard, cut it off, and set sail.
This is good, don't mess it up.
I swear on my honor.
You, O judge, when you saw the boy and how handsome he was, you became jealous of him.
It's not up to him.
Why are you tearing Walid's shirt?
He's wearing a new t-shirt, it's making you jealous, you're so annoyed, tell your dad to buy you one too.
How do you see yourself?
Why are you tearing Walid's shirt?
I'll tell you.
Don't make me carry you, I'll stick you to the wall.
I say, my brother Sultan.
Why don't you punch him like that and smash his face, huh?
# You're acting like a little kid, this is not for you, it's not suitable for your age.
This is a child, this is a child.
Oh my child.
Or else, he'll get a proper beating and a good telling-off from his family and friends.
We won't leave.
The price of your words, Sultan, and all the nonsense.
Take me to school, I'm a child, I'm a child.
You've always been arrogant.
Raise your children justly.
If you're not up to the task of raising a child and not capable enough.
I'm still respecting myself.
I don't want to make a mistake and embarrass him in front of his wife.
Brothers, how are you?
By God, if you ever enter Adoul's place and mess with his son again, I'll do something to him.
He has no one to blame but himself.
I'm wasting my time with you.
Respect yourself, go back.
Let's go to her, I'm dying to see her.
I don't respond to them.
Ah, where have you gone, old times?
Pure intentions.
Oh God, with forgiveness and well-being.
My brother, I can't find anything better than this.
La la la, this is the biggest thing.
Drop everything in your hand and come quickly.
The calamity that befell us.
Hey dad, just tell me what's going on exactly.
Mr. Ahmed, I'm sorry, but there's an issue at home and I need to leave.
# **English Translation:** # Tight pants are gone.
This is the act of a bitter person, whose heart is diseased, filled with hatred and malice.
This is the power of his command.
Oh boy, where can he cut all these clothes?
My new clothes, I didn't get to enjoy them, I didn't even wear them. May God hold them accountable.
I have to show him.
Sit down, I'm telling you.
If I go there at that time, Baya will say, "Oh, a child!" and act accordingly.
Hey, so what's the plan?
You are my dear Walid, do you know how to ride a bicycle?
I know.
Walid, my love.
I say
Just tell me.
Where did he put the scissors, mom?
There is something under the bed.
They destroyed it; may God destroy their livelihood.
I see it in him.
I am not silent about it.
This guy is crazy, out of his mind.
Most importantly, right now.
I won't change.
I'll promote the computer thing, I will.
Bravery is not leaving.
Our son Adil broke their computer, and we didn't know.
My Nady, my Nady, let's see if he did it or not.
Leave the nonsense, Cheetahs.
Run, run, go around your block, go and make someone else laugh.
I say, Adoul.
# Joke's on You, Tigers!
Welcome.
Calm hearts' time
Pure intentions.
# في ياهل In the child
I'm the one who goes out to find my friends.
Laugh at someone else, my Sultan.
He falsely accused me.
# Safety Scissors
Respect yourself, you.
Hello, Abdulrahman, come here quickly, dad!
Blame your brothers Fahd and Sultan.
Dad, they argue like this every day.
I have no idea.
A meeting like this one.
We should make her sit down.
Let's discuss our actions.
The deeds of those who came before us.
We will become.
We learn from our mistakes.
We learn.
Are you here for the peace meeting, you silly one?
As big as a camel.
Do you have children?
He understands nothing.
His role model is his father. No father to you.
His role model is his father.
You, my king.
And you, Fahd.
I am your elder brother.
Because of me.
I pay the computer's price in one go.
Okay, now when you reached out to him
We've made up.
I just can't take it anymore, I give up.
Stay away from Abdulrahman's chatter; once he starts talking, he won't stop.
Okay, where are you going?
I swear I won't let him go.
You made the tea yesterday.
Look up, don't be scared.
If you're a real hero, open the door. I'm telling you, open the door.
You didn't say that Abdulrahman resolved some of your issues.
I swear to God, I'm going to enter his room and break it to pieces.
Your brother, this one.
It's not normal.
Your brother is not normal.
Now bring it here, my tea, please.
Fahd has his head on his head.
Shush, shush, just be quiet, kids. They're acting up, they have no shame.
You little kids, just stop it, dad's had enough.
Oh man, I'll show you, I'll definitely show you, I swear I'll show you.
Do it, do it, oh my dear, do it with the biggest one.
Mom's blood.
My heart is racing with this screaming.
Oh my God.
Let us be.
By God, it's shameful.
I am with you and serving your interests.
I won't let them down.
They will reconcile at night.
I never had time, mother.
He must do it.
Well done, he deserves praise.
Hajiya Fasih
But, oh mother.
May God guide you.
You should calm yourselves down.
I am either your son or a log for the fire.
May goodness be with us, oh Lord, what's happening?
No problem, Abdulrahman.
I wanted you to be my aid, but you became a pharaoh.
You, my wise father, may God guide you.
Two behind each other.
Spread out, spread out.
You're embarrassing us! May God guide you!
Our neighbor Saad is coming up to you and laughing at us.
Your Honor, the officer wants us, wants us, and we keep telling him.
Stay away from him, the officer ordered.
They all three of them were deleted.
Please.
Bro, don't come to me, and you too, don't come to me.
The officer banned it, trust me, I saw them from above.
I heard the officer banned him.
I'm above, meaning far away.
My brother speaks the truth, he's right about him.
Please sign here to confirm that your children will not repeat this again.
Thank you, thank you.
Welcome, my brother, welcome. Please come in.
The officer banned it. How do you expect them to move? Believe me, I'm sure.
Listen to me.
I didn't want to say this in front of them.
This is Abdulrahman, their older brother.
Assistant Ministry Undersecretary
The second is their middle brother, a director of an authority.
Soul, take two Panadol and rest.
The officer banned the pendulum.
Do you have two Panadol tablets here?
Oh oh, may God protect me from the enemy.
"May God protect me from the enemy."
My God, protect me from the enemy, they are playing games with me.
Wow, wow, wow, what's all this talk about?
Hey, who can get from there to here?
This is an old hand, just like his father; he made a flat tire yesterday and now he's throwing it away.
Do you really believe that?
He appears to be well-mannered, respectful, and polite.
He says, "This is the daughter of the poor."
Even if
Now he's following you.
He never takes his eyes off you.
I hope you are well.
Oh, I don't care, and until the opportunity arises.
Why did you look at me when you passed by?
Coincidence, I suppose.
You turn and she turns at the same time.
No, but definitely there's something.
I notice you when I pass by.
I feel like she's enjoying herself from the inside, there's happiness and joy in her.
Dude, go tell her to give me a pen.
Take my notebook.
Do you believe it, I don't even know her name.
Romantic to an excessive degree.
You're living in the 21st century, man.
By God, it looks like you're completely doomed.
Do you want the truth?
How long have we been sitting here?
No, go ahead.
From today onwards, I'm fully dedicated to you.
Enough now, you need to rest a little.
We have an outdoor shoot today, after yesterday's indoor one.
We're doomed, by God, brother, the horses. Tell the secretary, I said, no more press interviews, no TV, and no more contracts either.
Let me have some time for the family, okay?
May God be with you.
Even when you're busy.
First thing on my mind.
I have the owner's number, I'll call him today.
I'm late for what?
They bought the villa and moved in a few days ago.
Cave in the series and acting.
Um Abdul Aziz says they are poor people, just making ends meet.
Their share, we have no share in it.
Good morning, uncle. May God bless your morning.
Is everything okay?
Dad, this car keeps bugging us every other day.
The battery is your father.
It's not a problem, don't worry. I have the tire and I'll fix it for you right now, God willing.
May Allah reward you with goodness.
We're ready, we're ready, my uncle.
Hello.
Sah kalam Walid.
I'll find a place near your houses tomorrow and stay there so I can visit you every day.
Be loyal to us, what do you have, what do you want?
Give up, dad.
Please, go ahead.
Are you kidding, Waleed?
Rashed Abdullah
The same name
He returned, father, be patient.
Have you believed or not?
I was so happy when I found out that Rashid Abdullah, the actor I love, turned out to be Yaarna.
Everyone praises him.
They say he is humble and kind.
"The tongue before the house, yes indeed."
I'm just taking a photo with him.
Because my colleagues at work will believe me.
I can't believe our house is right next to Rashid Abdullah's house.
Say it, say it so he'll believe it.
Search the world.
What we see on TV.
I hope to see him.
Our vine has grown, thank God, oh Lord, thank God.
They want to sail with the jib, right? I have it.
I'm here, I'm ready, but guys, take it easy on me. I'm still not used to it, I haven't quite gotten the hang of it yet.
The news has reached you.
I swear, he didn't fall short; may God reward him a thousand times over.
Hello.
They confirmed that some employees are being transferred to the new branch of the ministry in Adkhan.
They said he had returned from.
I didn't catch the names.
No, but I heard that and it's definite.
I don't know him, his name is with them.
My name is Ana.
We still don't know exactly who we're transferring.
I, I, where am I, and where, where am I going? If it's God's will, may you be spared, it's beyond my power.
Dad, can you do it or not? This is a job.
The committee is still studying the matter.
But if she chooses you.
Blessings have visited us, father of Waleed.
Well done, well done, O Abu Ali.
I'm sorry, brother Rashid, it's about the furniture.
We're neighbors today.
He considered it.
This is your good nature, Abu Walid.
May Allah reward you with goodness, brother Rashid.
I've heard so much about your kindness.
May love endure.
Enough, my daughter.
I'm ready to walk an extra mile with you until you find the most beautiful and affordable furniture that suits you.
He returned, to be honest, the furniture is really old.
We need to change it.
Inshallah.
Oh sister, I told you this before.
If you need anything, just let me know.
Treat me like your sister.
"May my eyes never see your arrogance."
Where did you go, my love?
Yesterday you called me and forgot my name.
Lala, my love, I don't want to tire you out.
No more.
Good bye, I'll call you later.
Honestly, I was talking to her.
These people are not of our kind.
We're all rich, where are we and where are they?
Mom, don't worry about it.
What's it to you, mom?
Wait for me just a sec.
I'll give you the signal when to propose to her for me.
I told you.
Ma, don't worry about it.
You come to me and say, "Propose to me."
I've set the dinner in the living room.
If I want to have dinner.
Now I'll let the driver take her to the university, God willing.
And then, we agreed that we are family.
I bought a car.
Soon, God willing.
I called to thank her.
Yes, they are kind and love goodness.
I swear, you're absolutely right, Dad.
Even if our parents don't do that.
My name is definitely with them.
Are you sure?
Oh no, what a mess! All these troubles are falling upon us.
I have no idea what to do now, my head is spinning with this news. I don't know how to react.
Run, run, run, run, run, run! I hope everything is okay. Thank you, may God reward you with goodness. May God reward you with goodness.
What's going on, Abu Ali?
The committee met today.
# List of Names for Transfer to Ad-Dukhan
My name is Wiyam.
Fine, he called the manager to remove your name.
I doubt there's any use, ya Ali. I doubt there's any use.
He said there's no hope for it.
The great artist
Consider your name once it's on the list.
Thanks, you didn't fall short, my man Abu Salim.
Return, please.
I wish to take a picture with you so I can show it to the kids.
Oh, my children, don't cry now.
May God keep them for you, God willing.
Could you provide a picture of an artist?
At your service, may God protect you.
Please, go ahead.
"Don't mention it, don't mention it, I'm ready."
You and those dear to you.
Say it a day or two earlier, it's better.
Oh my god, oh my god, mom, get ready!
Get ready, get ready, for what right?
What's wrong with you, you're crazy.
She said she didn't mind.
Come here, mother.
Come on, go to them.
Enough, my son, really.
They don't feel like we're poor people, just making ends meet.
You need to dress up.
Where do I get the clothes to dress up?
You've gotten me into trouble with those people.
What do you have on display, jewelry? I've never seen you like this before.
It's my right.
Hag Ali's right.
Um Ali is looking for a bride for her son Ali.
I want some nice clothes and a few pieces of jewelry.
They want to show off and prove that they are decent people with a good life.
Oh my, Mashallah!
I'm up for it.
Well done, she's my lady, she's grown tall and turned blue.
Māšāllāh, I have to say.
Queen, Mashallah, you are a queen.
You still need to prepare.
He says his father should come to meet her father.
I'm definitely not going in these clothes.
They looked at me like that in my new outfit.
Hey, mom, go easy on the lady's stuff.
# Shopping Haul Am Walid, you didn't hold back; you gave me your stuff. Go easy on them, a little at a time.
AI AI
We have to become like them too, man.
Why didn't his mother go to propose for him?
Just those women.
Now I have to go see the guys.
May God keep you safe, as you see.
"Just the abaya left, please. May God protect you."
Good people never fall short.
They didn't hold back, we stayed in the abaya.
I'll come and take it from you to complete the period.
Everyone has eyes on you.
I can't just leave my brother Rashid like this, should I carry him in my bisht?
Come here first, man.
This place needs to be shut down.
Aha, it's Istanbul for me.
I'll scorch your garment a bit, but take a look.
May God protect you.
The left hand inside the bisht.
Threatened, threatened like this.
Attitude is like this from the bottom.
Allah, Allah.
Wow!
Walk, walk, heavy, you want a bit of heaviness.
Oh, my Lord.
Like this, you'll become a millionaire.
May God give you a few seconds.
The left has fallen like this, the right this color.
Do you know Aisha, my friend?
Aisha, what's wrong with her?
Do you know, I miss you so much.
"You're saying this because you're my best friend and we don't want to part ways."
I'll tell my brother to propose to you.
Tell her to tell her boyfriend not to say anything to her brother, lest she embarrass herself.
I see the letters are piling up for you these days. A few days ago, Suad said she wanted you for her uncle, and today it's for her brother.
They want to take my beloved.
I was sitting and browsing.
We all know the relationship between us.
They don't know, we're just colleagues.
Alright then.
They need to know tomorrow.
Why did Walid refuse?
I am screaming.
You reject my son Walid.
The actor is more honorable than you, you hypocrites.
However, you guys
Do you intend to live forever?
I don't understand your roles.
Serve the people.
You're picking on people.
You wear the clothes of acting in life before God and his creation.
The coat I wore in the TV show.
I or you guys.
You wore accessories, gold, and jewelry.
I portrayed a role.
I am getting married.
What a view!
One walks in front of his wife.
He put his shemagh on like this, sideways.
Do not turn right or left.
Dude, remind me of that Abirvigkom you were talking about who's with you in the office.
Come with him, a son and a daughter.
He returned, why is he walking like that?
As they say.
May God help him, oh my dear.
Walk straight ahead, don't stop.
Poor guy, he has no personality at all.
He laughs, feeling joyful.
Sure, let's dress casually.
No, no, no, like this it's not nice, and you're just sitting there.
His attitude is like this: walking while standing, get up, stand up, stand up.
I beg you, Thursday, I beg you.
What are you doing, going to the city?
Come here, I need to talk to you.
Where are you going? Sit with us for a while.
I'm a mess because of my wife.
You seem to be okay with this.
Oh, Thursday.
Turn off the TV, and if a female presenter appears,
I'm afraid you'll cause me trouble.
By God, at work.
I'm sitting here, God, sitting with Salim, my colleague from work.
Haji
# **English Translation:** Blocked the line. U+U
I slammed the phone, I'm not going to cause you any trouble at home.
Now you're saying you didn't leave any of your friends out, except for me, who was sitting with you guys all along.
Let's go, come on, now, now, maybe it will arrive, God help me with the package.
She kicks you out.
You're not the first one to get divorced.
La la la no, no, I can't, man.
I torment my mother in her grave.
My mother recommended it to me.
She said to me, "Don't divorce me."
La la la, I can't, it's impossible.
I'm looking for something you
La la la ha ha ha stay, stay
You're completely not okay at all.
I'm not going with you.
Tell me, I want to understand, what's going on?
La la la, mom, I mean, I won't allow you to say such things.
Sālim is particularly one of the best youths we have in this area.
He keeps telling you to let go.
He kept telling me to let go, to just let it go. I became a bull, I released it. Come on, what's the big deal?
You're a real piece of work, mate.
Leave me alone, please, for God's sake.
Oh, my dear, we were just chatting away, just the two of us. How sweet of us!
May God guide you.
The poor man pains the heart.
I'll give him the letter that came from the minister's office; it's important.
Give to whoever gives to you from Allah.
Hey, it's nothing, nothing at all.
Bring it, I'll take it to him.
We have a meeting tomorrow with the women's delegation that's coming.
Women's delegation
What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you? You're not asleep today, are you?
Hello, Salem.
I am your brother, Khamis.
No, by God, I'm talking to you sober, by God.
Hey, bro, B.
Strike my name off, bro, so I don't get banned.
How do you mean, we'll cross your name off?
The only one who can erase your name is His Excellency the Minister.
Bro, this is a meeting at the ministry.
Official meeting.
I need a story.
Suleiman, Suleiman, Suleiman
Tell the truth.
I was talking to her, and you were hiding behind the tank.
I'm safe, I'm safe, I'm safe, I swear I'm safe.
As long as you're arguing with Salim.
Do you mean it or what?
I am Ali.
Mo 'alaa ani ya khamas.
Are you telling the truth now?
No, not casual wear.
She suspects me, brother, that I'm talking to a girl.
"What a life, man!"
He who delivers the message, Salim, please call.
He who entrusts you so you can donate.
Hey, it's me who told you to call.
Mind your own business.
I don't interfere in what doesn't concern me, or else I'll know how to deal with you too.
I'll file a complaint against you.
Hey, it's you.
How do you live with someone like that, with such a long tongue?
Let's start the meeting now.
Long live your majesty, Hassan will call Thursday.
Okay, let's discuss the real estate budget first.
You're welcome.
"Hope he finds it, really."
I tell you, the moment he saw the women, he got scared.
I've been looking all over for you, and here you are, hiding.
Come on, come on, the group is waiting for you in the meeting room.
I can't stay with the women.
Oh Thursday, how do you know your wife is doing?
I'm afraid you'll call.
Bro, do you really think I'm lying? Come on, man, you don't understand anything.
I'll be back home with Iron Man and Michelle.
Your wife won't call until this hour.
Of course, as a large company, you...
This project that your company is implementing for our ministry.
I am one of the biggest projects in the history of the ministry.
Hey guys, why is the table shaking?
Long live your majesty, it's not this table, it's me.
Go ahead, reply.
Who's with me?
I am a Syrian student.
Telephone for you.
Hold on, hold on, I'm telling you.
He actually fainted because he was scared to go home.
Oh my brother!
He said, "My sister told me that if you continue with this job involving women, I won't enter the house."
I submitted a letter to the ministry so they would transfer them from our department.
He exactly said to me that the minister agreed to transfer him, so he did what you wanted. What else do you want?
Dude, his wife, what is she?
These are crazy.
Hey, Thursday, who am I gonna talk to?
I tell you, you're not sane.
Now what are you going to do, your wife and kids are coming tomorrow.
I have no idea what to do.
You fulfilled her request, so why aren't you allowed to go back home and see your children?
She wants to confirm it officially.
Okay, give her the papers.
Okay, this is what I did, I sent her brother, gave him the paper.
She needs to see the minister's signature and verify it.
God willing, you agree if you consent. God willing, tonight we might go back home.
My choice, and this is the minister's signature.
What happened?
Tomorrow, I start working in the new department.
From tomorrow, it's office and work, different from what was there before.
"Which way is this department, may God protect you?"
May God keep you safe, and here is the minister's visa.
Nothing, absolutely nothing. That's on your right hand side.
Yes, indeed, God bless.
Welcome, your office is ready.
"Yes, Saad, Abdul Qadir, and Mashallah, it means a big office, indeed."
Goodbye.
How do you request a transfer?
Bro, the whole department is full of women.
Madam, please.
No one else can make that decision again except the minister himself.
You have to stay until the minister returns.
Dude, agree with your colleagues.
Call them by men's names so your wife doesn't recognize them.
I also gave you two extra days off for the new employee.
The new female employee, that's who you mean, the new male employee.
I've been working with the minister for a few days, and they pay me one riyal a day.
Are you serious?
He looks funny, like a real mercenary surrounded by five women, he's a real antique.
They just say his wife is jealous of him, it's insane jealousy.
**O blind cave!**
Poor fellow, he's just making do.
We respected his request and remained silent when his wife called.
Hey Abdulkadir, are you there in the office?
This is not something I'd spare on you; it's worth your while, take a look.
My son called and said my wife is coming to the office.
What are you doing?
Right, first door.
This is the Welfare Office.
"With the five of us, women."
Hi, five female employees.
He is present, I've contacted him, he is persistent.
I'm not into these antics.
This is my wife, she's jealous of me.
'Cause I'm sweet.
Now, may God guide you, Sultan.
We just want to know where we stand.
My uncle, what happened was that my brother Falcon and I were at the bank yesterday.
Take a look at the project from this perspective.
Hello.
My brother, I have an important meeting at work.
Come on, go to the kitchen quickly, come on!
Now I'm dressed, I'm going out.
You should've been in the kitchen.
We don't have women, we don't obey men, let's go!
If you anger God, the scorpion's sting is enough.
Here's the translation: Is this rain gear necessary? Look, look.
Take a look, my friend.
# Subject: Aisha's Message Aisha asks you to call the secretary and inform him to notify the staff.
He tells them that Amira postponed today's meeting to tomorrow.
God willing, all will be well.
They issue these orders.
Alas, we're doomed if we don't follow through.
They should know you are a senior manager.
# **Vision, Connections, and Responsibilities**
They all see her as just a servant.
I've never seen people despise women as much as they do.
"These people are still living in the past."
Come here, don't go to work, go to the kitchen and make us some tea.
Where are the servants?
She's been lost for a week now.
Even the maids were not spared from their insults.
They have the right to get fed up.
May God help you.
The bank's comments are straightforward.
Green tea.
My uncle, what does he mean?
Originally, the villa complex had no charm without a garden.
Okay, the garden now.
My sister, before I go, I want to hear your opinion about something.
My beloved Fatoum, I have to go to work late.
Okay, come on, tell me what's on your mind.
Do you really mean it, or should I leave?
Play it at school.
Returned, the committee of the Women's Union.
I was chosen by the school to play with them on the team.
You're crazy.
Now you're telling me you're going to the national team.
Do you know, if you were to tell your brothers and uncles this, what they would do to you?
You only blame yourself.
This is our warning to you.
"My God, what are you saying? I pass by her, I greet her. I haven't seen you in ages, my dear."
"Goddamn it, it's been ages since I've seen you."
Have they married him off yet?
May God guide you.
Who would take someone who's neither educated nor has a degree and knows nothing? May God guide you.
La la la, it's not a shame that he's uneducated.
Then this is Thursday, the son of scorpions.
He was bitten, I held him.
No, we won't take just one of them, we want someone of a higher caliber.
The scorpion is like him.
May God help you.
What can I do, Aisha?
The minister has traveled, and all transactions are redirected to me.
Say that Mustafa, the head of the Resources Department, wants to see you tomorrow.
The guests of the ministry arrived today.
The program is with you.
I am now free to focus on you, Aisha.
Hey Mary
Okay, let's go, I'm coming, I'm coming now, come on.
What can I say, Aisha?
These troubles, where do they come from, if not from these brothers?
I have no idea what's going on.
My darling, you need cold compresses so your face doesn't swell up.
I warned her and told her not to say anything to them.
They should've beaten her and given her a good hiding.
You know, if I had told them, it would have been hated.
John has been bothering me for a long time.
Do you play soccer?
Next time, snap their necks.
Do you know who is talking to you?
Scorpion oud.
# The Great
I didn't hit Sultan, he hit me.
Oh, the power of words.
I chose Economics and Political Science.
I chose graphic design because it's in high demand these days.
Architectural geometry
It's your turn.
You took your chance.
Greed is not good, my son.
Tamer is the Scorpion.
Smash it, break it, break her teeth, and knock out her front teeth.
Lead me to her.
Come here, it's right here, come over.
Are you going on missions?
I'm studying architectural engineering.
Take your time.
In order to confirm.
Sultan and Saqr, I spoke to them.
They have no objection to marrying you to Amina.
What do you want?
We don't deserve a Thursday like this.
I'll arrange the meeting with them and let you know, God willing.
Nomination as part of the delegation.
I can't understand you.
Give yourself a chance until tomorrow.
I'm telling you the truth.
They are very interested in you.
You're dripping from above.
He's right.
My brothers, and I know them.
It's impossible they'll agree.
I'm surprised by them.
Your car installments are on my salary.
I'm the one who provides for the household.
No, I won't go with you, you said you'd travel with me.
We're getting her married this week.
What do you say, you guys?
Thursday the idiot who doesn't even have a high school diploma.
Marry him and travel with him.
Let's go, science, God willing.
By God, it's a shame what they're doing.
If you refuse, they'll slaughter her.
Dad, I've told you so many times.
Why don't you go?
I'll see you tomorrow, God willing.
No worries, I'm a scorpion, born of scorpions.
Even if it's just a little bit, it's okay.
I don't want to marry Thursday.
Oh, go to the kitchen!
Put them in the living room.
Tonight, Real Madrid and Barcelona are playing.
God willing, they won't beat us in Valencia.
I'm talking to you from reliable sources.
Loyal and dedicated to her work.
What do you think about what just happened?
I think you mean: "Let's do it again."
We have to attend, whether we like it or not.
Welcome back to your desks.
Thank you, long may she live.
طال عم مم رج
Good morning.
The minister's pursuit.
May God keep her safe and grant her a long life, as long as she is with us.
Please, go ahead. Please, go ahead.
Good evening, Mr. Minister.
Yes, may you live long.
I washed the t-shirts.
Pour the coffee, Captain Emad.
And I'll kill two birds with one stone.
We're traveling to China after tomorrow, we'll play a match over there.
Hey Captain Nasib, let me introduce you to my sister, Maryam.
Where are you going, uncle? I want to go to Umm Al-Aish.
You are a donkey.
I don't know my elbow from my arse, so I want to marry a minister's daughter.
Inshallah, give him my regards.
"At your service, auntie."
Go and leave this one, and start a new one.
Connections of the representatives.
Do you believe it? Just a moment ago, Mashael called me.
Vertical lines again.
It's a shame about Noor's role; it's absolutely not suitable for Mashael.
Nouf is a girl who is sixteen years old.
Twenties of Al-Mutawa.
Okay, why don't you take Mary's role?
Suits them better.
Thirty two Novembers
Let's get rid of this nuisance they've put in place for us in the committee.
This is a problem, I'm sure he won't keep quiet.
He will stop for us at the number one.
He talks to you about art, family values, meaningful art, and content, the meaning of which I don't know.
This is one of those that he put for us in the committee.
The minister is the one who formed the committee.
I, you, and Hamed can influence him, but here you go.
La la la, impossible.
There's actually nothing to prove that it's mine or Al-Hamid's.
Even if he goes to the Ministry of Economy and asks.
After he finds our names.
May God protect you from harm. The company is registered under the name of Hamed's wife.
I'm not worried about this aspect.
Then make sure who the head of the committee is, not me.
The final decisive word is mine.
# Welcome, welcome, everything is fine.
Tony called them and agreed on everything.
Hello.
Peace be upon you. Hello Professor Rashid, please come in.
You know that this meeting is dedicated to deciding on the approval of the series "Rape of Conscience."
Wahoo, produced by the Institute of Modern Touches for the Arts.
Sweet, Strange, Bold, Action Series
I am with Hamed.
Honestly, the series has a really great story.
I'm with you, Hamed.
The part of the text that should be translated is not entirely clear, but here is a possible translation: "What I liked even more was when the mother took the gun and killed her neighbor."
She tried to put the gun in the car, but she dropped it.
You don't know that this car gave birth to an action movie when the police searched it.
I picked him up from school.
He kicked the cartoon with his leg.
John gives him that powerful shot, and the cartoon flies away, entering through the mother's room window.
Here's the surprise!
Wow, this is the moment, this moment, and the cartoon is running into the mother's room.
It's beautiful that a local company has reached this level of work.
We need to encourage them and take them by the hand.
Oh, brother Rashid, we haven't heard your opinion.
You've left no stone unturned, brother Rashid.
With all due respect to your opinions and impressions of the series called Rape of the Conscience,
Rape of the values of humanity.
# Surprising and Silly Surprises
A man and a half in every episode.
Let's leave the text for the episode that comes after.
"Maktoub" series without social awareness.
The message lacks a meaningful purpose to elevate society.
Tears are pouring, so you have to cry along with the scenes.
Rashed, please.
You stated your opinion, Ali expressed his, I shared mine. Now let Professor Rashid also share his view.
It's clear from the silence.
I sense an agreement between you two.
I have arranged the matters.
There are people who understand it as their field of expertise, and there are others who have no relation to the subject.
I reject this series.
I'm afraid he'll get us into trouble and cause us problems.
Stay away from him.
What can he do, he can't do anything.
I keep my word.
John, give me the money and tell me it's from mom, Samira.
I have no idea what's going on.
I can't believe it, Nasser.
Ah, the new series I told you we'd be doing soon.
He who I know raped their daughter.
I'm overwhelmed by all the goodness between us.
First of all, this beautiful ring on your hand, of course.
I tell you how.
In the name of Hamed's wife who sent you the ring.
My husband, of course, was responsible for sorting out the issues and making things right.
He has a 5% share of the work.
Sweet role.
Tony's examples are like that. I haven't seen the series about Amani's rape. It was really good.
By the way
This is rape. Oh my God, what kind of rape?
Rape of dreams.
Why are all the names so similar?
There were mostly girls in the series last year, for example.
You'll find the series has more than eight girls and ten after that.
Dorge momzun
How many torches do we have?
Oh, oh, your luck has changed; what else do you want?
Hello Omar.
I don't care, I don't care.
Syrian, my love, I have to go to work. Mary, what's going on?
# **English Translation:** Wait a minute and go.
He says he wants to see me for an urgent and important matter.
I have to go, man.
I know that Rashid went and met the minister.
He says he spent half an hour with him.
They said they'll get you into trouble.
I tell you, he complained about us, and you say it's fine.
What happened now is that the minister's office called me, saying that the minister wants to speak to me.
I fear that the minister will believe him.
I meet the minister.
Real Yani wants to convey his perspective on the series.
No more.
This is true, your highness.
First of all, I, the minister's assistant, would like to clarify something, which is not in my nature to do, as I am speaking about a fellow artist who is not present.
May God keep you safe, Rashid, and everyone knows this is his distinctive feature.
He bears a grudge against everyone around him.
All material interest.
He's specialized, though.
May God protect you, it doesn't mean that everyone who comes can give their opinion on technical matters.
Especially television works.
TV series Rape of Conscience, God bless you, that we are working on.
A massive bold action.
At the Gulf level, God bless you, we'll have a media scoop.
# The Horrific Spread
You guys are the experts in this field and know it better than I do.
Shart ajwaf, musalsal ibyaḍ al-wiyy.
He raises our name above.
However, what the journalist Abdulhamid wrote, listen, listen, listen.
Indeed, one of the actors commented,
The series contains immoral invitations.
He laments the decline in moral and artistic taste in the work.
By God, this is bold speech and a strong criticism.
Your people are getting beaten up if the journalist Abdulhamid is behind them.
If their words reach the authorities.
These guys are smart; they know how to sort things out.
The following gang.
We want to create a private website for us.
We put all the company's activities in it.
I asked you what the company's name was.
From today onwards, you are the media advisor.
The series "Rape of Conscience," produced under the supervision of Mercury Art Production Company,
Quantum leap in Arabic drama.
For the noble thoughts and values it embodies.
It's a series aimed at developing society.
The journalist Abdulhamid himself, whom I criticized a few days ago.
He turned a full 180 degrees.
How could Abdulhamid allow himself to look like this?
The journalist Abdulhamid and his ilk.
Rest assured, Professor Hamed.
He asked me what I thought of the series. I told him the series is a huge hit across the Arab world.
May God hear you.
# Series Alert! My artistic sense tells me our series is going to be a hit!
That's where we don't know where his whereabouts are.
He puts his bag down and leaves.
# **The Beginning of Our Courage**
You always do this, bringing up things in these series that we've never seen or heard of in our lives.
"The writing on the wall is clear from its title."
Frankly, all your authors are kids.
It'll be fine either way.
Your series is boring, boring.
What do you guys think?
It looks like he's going to cry a lot, dad.
We're just basing our standards on those stupid TV shows.
"Not everyone can understand it and get it right away."
In subtle threads and dimensions, it requires focus to grasp what this piece aims to convey.
This work, by the way, is political.
It's a shame to expose him to people.
What's wrong with you guys?
They look like they've been poisoned.
Yesterday evening, Ali and I were at Souk Waqif.
We're sitting in a coffee shop.
He didn't give me a chance.
# Proposal for a New Policy What do you think about this topic, Nasser? If His Excellency, the Minister, gets upset, it will be a big problem.
Within a week, he'll have all of us locked down at home.
God and the series is just right, what's the deal? Everyone who saw it says it's a failure.
I hear that Rashid is planning to go there.
He's definitely telling him, "I told you this series is a flop, a failure, and has no action."
You're in deep trouble, my friends.
Leave it to me.
I'm sorry, but
Listen to me, Eli.
From now on, I don't want any posts on your page to criticize the series.
Eili, please.
I saw the topic a few days ago, there was no criticism of the work, just insults.
Please don't make me upset with you.
Weave against him.
I was just a chance, one day.
I would never tolerate such talk.
I haven't received a single message thanking me for the series, to be honest.
Wow, what a success beyond compare!
Goodbye.
Brother Rashid, please allow me.
Do I believe you or the newspapers?
Rape of Conscience: The Peak of Television Productions
Long live your majesty, this is a journalist we have an agreement with.
Listen to the second newspaper, what are they writing?
They agree with the people to read, read on the readers' page.
My heart stopped.
They're almost telling me.
Hey dad, you're so lucky, the minister is pleased with you!
By God, the truth is, Nasser.
Get ready for the rape of conscience, part two.
No, my brother, this one wouldn't let go.
First and last series I write.
I'm done with my job, dad. It's better for me to work in the scrap yard than to do this job.
Part two after this mess.
First, second, third, and fourth.
What's wrong with you guys? Don't you want to benefit?
Yanni, one of the guys, is hanging out in his place.
This is where we are.
The wizard said
Onwards and upwards.
We wish to offer our congratulations on this merger.
Praise be to God for the success.
Doubters, enemies of success.
I am surprised.
How can a terrible and failed show win an award?
These are just specialists.
They'll see something we can't see, for sure, when they get the awards.
Get ready for the second season of the series.
Inshallah, long life.
They called him a sorcerer, a sorcerer indeed.
Reminding you of the rape of conscience, part two.
I saw you standing with the minister at the beginning of the ceremony.
After the TV festivals, we agreed, so to speak.
Listen to him telling them to get ready, there's still a second part.
The same thing.
Dirty hands are taken to the banks to be cleaned and come out clean.
These low-quality, weak, despicable, and worthless series I watch.
Let them enter Gulf and Arab festivals.
They clean it up, give it awards, and turn it into prestigious series in people's eyes. They sanitize it.
It's reasonable, why isn't it reasonable?
As long as the arbitration committees themselves are the ones producing the series.
Hello.
Peace be upon you and God's mercy. Praise be to God that you have arrived.
We do have a contract with them, but they want to lower the price.
Come to the office.
We're at the little bakery, or are you selling flatbread and bread?
We are one of the largest bakery companies in the world.
I ain't gonna drop a single dollar.
They want it or we cancel the contract.
Enough with the contract we signed yesterday.
In cooperation with the European company.
Key KBP DVB-T
What you see.
A big job worker, a job worker like no other.
For the first time, I'm launching a product that will be the first of its kind in the world.
I brought him, he's not the biggest roti baker in the world.
I'm telling you.
How are you doing today?
I'll break your arm, or you can go to the kitchen and spend an hour looking for a knife to cut with, and sometimes you might even cut your hand.
Suwa roti, this is sesame bread.
I'll put the cheese down and close the lid.
This is my shirt, this is my pants.
You're kidding, the roti is a bag. How else could it be?
Abu Nasser and the bug, how do you get rid of it?
"Then when I go to work, I'll tell my friend, 'I'm breaking my fast at six.'"
Dough, hospitals, Jabal an-Nur. Why didn't she go there yesterday?
I know I'm asking you why she didn't go yesterday.
The story, your highness, is that the bakers and supervisors who oversee the baking process...
Reply again to the bakers.
Your Honor, that's what happened.
Why are you shouting at him like that?
I'm fed up with all this nonsense about football and no football, it's messing up my work.
Do you know if your son likes football?
What's wrong with him taking a few employees from the company to play with?
You have four hundred employees in the company here, so what do I take from that?
These ten are considered the key players.
They put him on top, with four reserves and two administrators, but what did he take? Seventeen on him.
Media spokesperson for the team.
I caused this whole mess because of these messages.
I can manage for now, even though I'm not the starter, although the fans, the crowd, consider me the most important player on the field, the number 12 player.
Let him enjoy it, let them run ahead of him, and he'll be delighted.
We are people who have signed contracts with them.
Now, it's the day he told you he wanted to play soccer, and you were so excited for him.
I hear and obey your command.
We didn't do anything.
Now, just because he brought in a few employees and made them perform in front of him, watching and entertaining himself with them, he starts to ruin the mood.
He told me not to hire employees.
Even if some of your friends need employees, don't lend them too many, it's not a good idea.
# Important Bakers
Oh no, God guide you, why take the important bakers after they're gone?
Second time, if you hire employees, let me know.
No, no, I don't agree with this deal. Let Hamdi discuss it with me.
Hamdi is in the hospital.
Why isn't anyone here for you, Your Highness?
I finished my shift and as I was leaving, I got into my car.
Listen to Nasser Allah, may he live long, calling out.
I stepped on it.
The goalkeeper told me we can't find our player and we have an important match tonight.
We arrived at the stadium. Find us a goalkeeper, quick!
What do you mean, you're wearing a goalkeeper's outfit?
I've never played soccer nor held a ball.
This is a situation.
What cannot be ignored.
You're next on the list, and we'll find you a job to keep you busy. Come on, no more wasting time, no more football, no nonsense.
Let me tell you.
Dad, you want me to disband the team and cancel it properly.
Yes, indeed.
Sure, dad, God willing, just say the word, I'm asking you.
It's forbidden, so get out of the team and ruin the final match.
La la la in hadi wayah haq al-wald.
Have you understood?
Zayn, congratulations on the win!
Professor Nasser, congratulations on winning the cup!
We wanted to know how you planned for the win.
I make sure the team is ready, both mentally, physically, and psychologically, and, praise be to God, the coach has been great.
Inside the cave
Congratulations to all of you, and the party is just as I promised.
I say, your dad looks happy.
I'm afraid he's embarrassed and being polite.
Uncle Abu Nasser, first and foremost, and may peace be upon the Prophet, we want to congratulate you on the great victory of your team, the International Bakeries.
By this great victory
May God bless you. May God bless you. No, no, no.
Picture without a back, moment by moment, hold on a little.
No, not that.
I'm wearing an abaya.
Without a doubt, your care, great attention, and creative ideas played a significant role in this victory.
The coach's plan.
In the final, he played with a 5-5-3-2 formation.
As a large language model, I can assist with your translation request. Here is the text translated into English: And as a great athlete, you know that changing plans confuses players. Despite this, the Bakery team did not get confused and put on a fantastic performance.
The coach's plan.
# بو ناصر, as the top athlete at Al-Makhabeze Al-Dawliya, what advice do you have for the players?
Till the end of time.
Hello, hello.
Long live your life.
Welcome, everyone! Hamoud Sultan is with us.
Welcome, may God bless them; it's an honor to have them join us for dinner.
Dinner is ready.
May God bless you, Abu Abdulaziz.
The private sector's contribution is considered significant.
The Team Glows
I wish you could be us.
No one cares.
Bu Abdulaziz
Machine agent that we use in the factory.
Did you see how?
This is what you've always wanted to know.
I met him through football, and I hinted at it.
I told him, oh Abu Abdulaziz.
You've always been distant from love.
What's it to you?
The ball is in his arms, I can see it, it's only fifty centimeters away from me, I'm so close to it.
We haven't received Abu Nasser yet.
No, by God, he didn't come today either.
In a seminar on sports injuries, the platinum sponsor must be present.
I've seen nothing yet.
I saw the building behind the bakery that was supposed to be turned into a worker's residence.
Hello, I'm drowning in football.
# Before every match, as we have promised, we meet with one of the icons of sports and have a conversation.
This man is the inspiration for the bakery team with his great ideas.
How is the International Bakery team doing? We heard you are undergoing a comprehensive development process.
"I mean, all this sitting at desks and all this exhaustion."
A paltry sum, I mean, I'm putting in all this effort for just one million dollars.
No, dad, chill out a bit, chill out.
Heidi was your mistake, not mine, my brother Shahin.
My mistake.
What did I do wrong?
You just never told me that the players are in demand in the Gulf.
Prices in the Gulf reach astronomical levels.
The player is worth two hundred thousand.
They take it in the Gulf for three to four million dollars.
Understand me, Mr. Masoud, how?
Stable fax from me here.
I am a human being while I exist.
My father bought four new players for the team, on top of the new shipment with four more players.
This is the translation: "Wow, what is this? This is amazing! He puts Billy and Rinaldo in his stash."
# **Chapter 7** It says "eight thousand" on it.
# Match! Match! Dad, but this is a gift from God. You put it in a Turkish club, may God bless you.
They want it for 1.2 million in the UAE.
Why are you staring at me?
Okay, we can inspect the goods.
Surely ahead of you.
Quack, man.
All done.
La la la, I'll give you everything guaranteed.
Fat, Mashallah, this is good fat.
This is a pivot point. This is a fulcrum.
# Musculus constrictor pharyngis
This thirsty muscle is the most important thing for a player; if it breaks down, it's of no use anymore.
You did not fall short.
Let my driver take us to the club, the club, what did I say, the club.
What's the fuss about?
Come on, Hamdy, let's go.
Congratulations! Congratulations!
This is God, may he protect you, sprouts.
Yes, we bring them from the jungles of Africa. What can we do for them?
We feed them, we raise them, we train them, and then we destroy them on the fields.
I want it, I want it, dad, I want it. Do you have space in the car, or shall I carry you in the pick-up truck?
He hadn't seen them pressuring us like that before.
Lower the striker for me.
Cock-a-doodle-doo, the rooster crows, no one cares.
Lower the guns.
Cashew maca maca canelo lo lo lo this is supposed to be the one that should be released.
Our coach is a novice.
Inshallah on Mars.
No, Spain, God willing, on Mars.
I don't like the way he reads the match report.
This walks on a line.
The match has its own rules.
Inshallah, in two days.
What's wrong with you? Your voices are carrying.
Born in Spain, this program.
He just won't admit that the coach is a complete idiot who doesn't understand football.
Listen, listen, what's Mitsu saying? Go ahead.
He knows that the striker of the struggle, Seloulotikawaawa, was born in the penalty area, as Ahmed El-Teb said, and he knows where to center the ball.
No one is going to cause you trouble.
Stay away from me.
I know how to handle this coach.
Why did the team retreat? Why?
The current situation should make the coach of the International Bakery Center team think about changing the game plan halfway through the match.
The players aren't playing in their designated positions.
The player Takulamakakokolalawo, he is not in his natural position, he needs to be moved to where he always plays.
Coach's word is law.
Coconali Hupoway draws Malalo.
Inshallah, inshallah, inshallah.
La la la la la, what's going on in the stadium?
What's happening now shouldn't be happening between the team leader.
Head coach of the team
If there's anything, let's postpone it to after the match.
Now everyone is watching and everyone is seeing, the thing is in front of the camera.
The ball is in the net, a fourth goal for the Success team.
# He scores the fourth goal and he is the star of the match today.
This coach is stubborn.
He said, "That's it, Uncle Bonasser doesn't want you as a coach for his team."
What do you bring after that?
I'm watching the match on TV, you stay on the bench, and do as I say.
My son, don't do this to yourself, it's not good.
Now, tomorrow we have a match; how can we play without a coach?
What's your father doing?
Alright, Rashid.
What's wrong, my dear? You've made my heart sink. What's wrong? Tell me, what's wrong?
Divorce me, mother, divorce me.
Did you divorce her? How did you divorce her?
Mother, I don't know, mother, I don't know.
How can I divorce you? You've only been married for a month.
By God, mom, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.
I'll divorce you, and the road will be my witness.
Oh mother, oh!
Mom, I swear I don't know, he suddenly came in and said, "Get up, go to your family's house."
He said to me, "Why?" I told him, "Okay, divorce me." He said, "You are divorced."
I'm all by myself, and I really don't know what's going on.
A couple of newlyweds separate, what will people say about us?
I'm with you.
By God, what should I tell you?
I only found out he divorced her from you now.
Stay put for a minute, I'll be right there.
Her high morals.
Saturday Barcelona
In the eyes of Abdullah, there is a glimpse of wonder.
Yani returned with a tear on his cheek.
He says, "Oh mother, I left Barcelona, and he, he'll die for this team, he respects it so much."
Do you keep insulting him and hurting his feelings?
He said, "Mom, I left Barcelona." I wanted to tell him, "Alright, what do you want from it? Let it be, divorce her, I'll get you another one."
I tell him your daughter got divorced because she left Barcelona.
Are you serious? That's the reason you want to divorce her?
I don't care about you.
Is hurting feelings that easy?
A wife stabs her husband in the back.
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
The girl who doesn't respect world-class teams is not needed by us.
This time, she made fun of Messi.
Problems arise between couples, and it's only natural for us.
# Unit Allowance A
The girls are many, and my son wishes for a thousand of them.
Hey girl, listen to my advice.
Enough, I don't want to hear anything.
Please, I told you not to go in there. You see, I know him very well.
We told you not to go in.
Get mad at me now.
Don't worry, mom, don't think about it.
# Unit Allowance A
Why are you sad, then?
I can't help but think of her words.
Real Madrid is better than Barcelona.
Ready, my love.
Poor thing, what's wrong with her like this?
Hi, my name is Mona.
I married Shahr and got divorced.
I won't tell you the source, but why did you ask? You'll die laughing.
We're with you, we want what's best for you.
My mother, what interest could you have with someone like this who divorced his wife because of a football team?
The hairdresser knows them and told me the whole story. Mom, don't get me involved with him, and I don't want to get into trouble with someone like him.
You're just opening your ears to these hairdressers who don't know what they're doing.
Do you know what? Tell them I don't approve.
Let her ramble and say whatever she wants.
Good morning,
She said to her daughter, "Don't cut off your own livelihood, my dear."
If it's her livelihood, let it break.
If I do that, I'll cut off her livelihood and ours along with it.
This building here.
He never says no.
My God, that rotten driver with her endless stories and chatter!
Rumor, they hear it and spread it.
Don't worry about her.
Understand it and tell her not to close the door of opportunity that opens for us.
He knows how to convince her.
Are you serious? Do you really think that the guy divorced his wife because of Barcelona's defeat?
Leave the nonsense and don't act crazy.
I won't let this opportunity slip through my fingers.
She was the reason, and she had something or a flaw that made him divorce her.
Listen to me, girl, don't let go of Bou Borjain.
What's up with those two towers?
They were close to finding out they were twins.
# The Falcon of Burj Towers Thus, they named his father Shahin Abu Burjain.
May God give you life.
Oh, no, no, no, sweet thank you, maghsi.
I don't understand you, please speak up.
Your Highness, they have made the request and you have signed it. The money has already been disbursed.
Your Highness, you seem distracted, and it's evident that you have a lot on your plate. It's been a month since you've been like this.
That was the first wedding month, now it's a new wedding. Abdullah has divorced.
He was married before and got divorced.
I swear, this is the third wedding now.
That's his story, my brother; just give him a break.
Oh man, this generation is tough.

Congratulations, congratulations, my dear mother.
Mom, don't forget, your fur is on top of the bag.
# Flight Preparation To have it in your hand as you board the plane.
Did you arrive in London?
Hey dad, aren't you guys planning to go to London?
Hello, my dear mother.
Alright, that's enough.
She's coming with us and doing some shopping at the same time.
Malaysia, Malaysia
Malaysia, bring your fur with you.
Goodbye, Mom.
What's wrong with her now?
I have no idea.
This is right here, in front of your eyes. Ask her, I don't know what's going on.
Come here, dad. What's wrong? What's going on?
You were so nice to her, but she didn't give you a chance.
A girl from my family.
I'm here for your honeymoon, supposed to serve you with her eyes, hands, and feet.
"Could it be that I'm sitting here while you're pouring water?"
No, don't pick up the cup over there and pour for yourself.
She's not well-brought-up.
John said to her, "I was born when my mother was young, and she used to feed me water with her own hands."
What's wrong with her like this?
She looks very sad.
Who is this one with?
Hey, the girl's name is Mashael.
Poor thing, she got sick during her honeymoon.
I won't be surprised if I tell you a secret.
May God bless you, my aunt. You're welcome.
You're my aunt's favorite niece, so be nice to your aunts.
I have no idea where mom booked us.
Hello, mom.
Mom, where did you book us?
She wants to go with us there.
There is no power or might except with Allah.
Why did you do that at the airport? Why did you bring the kids?
What's going on between them?
Now you're asking me, how would I know what's going on between them?
I can't bear to be apart from you.
Where's Umniira then?
Ake is chatting with that crazy old man in her room.
Now she's telling us she's been calling him for two days, but his phone is switched off.
What I've caught so far.
We're waiting to see what's up.
He insisted that he was annoyed. The boy just came from outside, tired, and wanted to go inside and rest.
Mom, every day I tell her, "If you brought me an apple, peel it," but she doesn't peel it. Every day she annoys me.
Then you know I don't like apples with their skin.
I peel the apple.
Hello, I'm telling you.
You are divorced.
And once, if needed.
Go, my beloved.
My life, I love you.
Mom, oh Munira, what did he say?
What's wrong with you? You seem upset.
Call three times and say "I divorce you."
Shut up or I'll hurt you.
Mom, I don't know why he saw me at the disco in Spain and went to tell him.
He's really not making any sense.
That guy is a real joker.
I dance for her two, three dances.
Then, may he not live who dares to divorce my daughter; it's him, the bastard.
How can I let you go?
Come here, where are you going?
Where are you going? I'll cool my liver in that one who has no shame.
She has a tail like a peacock.
Adorned with gold, ruby, coral, and diamond.
Girls of other people are just toys for you and your son.
They don't have any mothers, let their heads burn.
They're a joke to you.
Let loose on them as you wish.
I don't drink tap water, fuck Barcelona, let her go, let her leave.

Paternal right.
He'd be mad to sell a piece of land like this.
# Mission Impossible Take it from my dad by force.
Your father, why did he sell it?
May God guide you, Abu Saqr. If he sets his mind on something, can anyone say no to him?
Leave it to God, my friend.
Hey, come on, come on, let's go, let's go.
Come on, come on!
I'm ready to advise you on your project.
Put your hand on it.
Fine, you didn't say last week that you were going to the office.
You gotta get your ass in gear if you want your project to move forward and grease the wheels.
# Bou Sakkar, the Old Millionaire
We don't eat anyone in this world, no one eats.
This is not a problem, my brother; we'll eat him and fill him up, and his belly will be full. The problem is how we'll get to him.
You need to know the key to Abu Sakkar's code so that the doors open for you.
I met him during the pilgrimage and greeted him several times.
You need to know that as long as you spray it, you'll get yourself out of trouble, but you need to recognize the right opportunity.
I'll tell you, the first thing the secretary said to me was that Abu Saqr is waiting for you for dinner.
I revved the engine and waited.
This is Bo Saqr, may God preserve him, he makes dinner every day.
Oh, man, it's so expensive!
Does Hal love the weekend with his crew?
Oh, how beautiful is this gathering at this farm late at night.
Your Highness, this is Bu Nasser from the car agency behind the complex. He is very wealthy.
Your Highness, I would like to get to know you.
Take the license.
My son was the one who got the license.
May God protect you, may He bless you.
Congratulations on your license, Falcon!
God bless you.
Brother Falcon, may you live long.
I beg you, don't refuse me. Just say yes.
Sure, here's the translation: Just say "yes," your highness.
A gift from me to him.
If you surrender, don't refuse me.
My affairs are going well.
I just met him and asked him what I needed.
You still don't wanna be a fool.
Hey, it's fine, mate.
Understand me, how did you do it? What did you do?
I was fortunate in my circumstances.
We were sitting at his place.
Good, his son, Falcon, got the license.
**Gift of the Falcon is mine.**
If on the car.
Achievable.
Come, come, let's go to him.
What happened?
I've been discharged from the hospital.
I had my tonsils removed.
He'll definitely cook dinner.
You deserve the well-being of the boy, O long-lived one.
Wages and good health. Wages and good health, God willing, may he not see any harm, God willing.
Let's meet at the rosary shop.
I suppose, God knows.
Oh my, we're forgetting, we're getting old.
He returned and said that the room next to ours had been occupied by your son, Shahin.
I said I'd visit you.
I bless you, Ab Salamah Shahin.
You're a good man, God bless you. Listen, your highness, you're not leaving until you've had dinner with us.
I'm not in the mood for it.
You just say yes, and it's done.

Mashallah, your father, there's no one who doesn't love him. You just point him out.
Oh my dear, people take loans from banks to start a company or a business.
I'm sitting in the assembly.
# Opening a Rental Business
Something new, this time.
This is a falcon; it's right in front of my eyes. He brought them to me yesterday and told me, "Simple, try them out."
You just took their agency yesterday.
Saw how?
And then they tell me, mother, all the traders love me. May God make His creatures love you, my lord.
Yes, Your Highness.
I'm on my way to the office right now.
I saw a new supermarket.
We're getting him ready.
I really liked it.
I don't know who I am.
Congratulations, congratulations, Uncle Soqer, congratulations.
May God bless you.
In the name of God, In the name of God.
What's he doing, coming in as a partner and taking it easy, all cool and relaxed?
You, you right now can say no.
Okay, what's going on?
What's he saying, then?
Shower with him.
You don't know who your father is.
Who doesn't know his father?
I told him I'm Qassim, his friend Abbas. He said you have something at the shop.
I have a bakery, thank God, I make a living from it.
LaLa, I don't like the name.
I noticed it.
No, my brother, the name is not nice.
That's a good name for Iranian bread.
I found it, grand prize.
Qasim, let's call it Grand Bread Bakery.
Wait for me a little.
Hello.
Hello, may peace and blessings be upon you, O long life.
Excellent, excellent. Is there anything missing? Do you need anything?
No, thank God, everything is fine.
I'm telling you, Ayad, this is a new employee of ours.
Your Highness, she just sent her car for repairs and came to take mine since she's a sales representative for an advertising company. I'm telling you, she can't do without a car.
You might still need your car.
No, I don't need the car today.
Oh well, let's go for it.
This is the age of science, knowledge, and study.
I'm with Dr. Rashid; one must arm themselves with knowledge, regardless of the topic.
Well done, Dr. Sami.
Your Highness.
Study and study again.
You're listening to us, dogs of books.
No lessons, no trade, no economy.
He has never read a book, not even a newspaper. He has never held a piece of paper in his entire life.
You all know who Falcon is today.
I didn't want to enter this field of business, but
Auntie Bu Nasser is right here, alive and well, standing right in front of you.
I have a story to tell.
Some people are just naturally inclined towards business; it's in their nature to love business.
You're absolutely right, Doctor.
May God willing, you'll return, Shahin, and see your brother.
God is generous, God willing.
It's not too late.
"Of course, this depends on upbringing."
You're welcome, Doctor.
Do you want the truth?
How did a falcon come to mean this easily hated trade and reach this great economic sense?
If there were a hundred billionaires in the world today, he would be one of them.
Do you know, O father of the falcon?
Falcon chose Knight for the market award.
Hello.
Hey Nasser, how are you?
I received a call from Mohammed, who informed me that Abu Nasser is admitted to the hospital.
# Rumors and Family Business "Did you ever tell me that you heard that Saqr, son of Abu Saqr, wants to take over the car dealership from his father?"
The agency flew away from you.
It's a greedy world indeed.
The father is the one who helped him enter the market.
He is the one who opened his eyes to the world of trade.
Frankly, the doctor says his condition is very difficult.
That's just not right.
Nothing is impossible.
Shocked, he returned, or was he supported? Not my business. I tell you, divorce her, divorce her, I mean divorce her.
Is this really happening in the 21st century?
And we meet again, dear viewers, with one of the noblemen of generosity and giving in this country.
A man who knew the path of justice for the needy and the deprived.
Of course, we have the founder and owner of the Falcon Charity Association.
Of course, if you speak to him, Your Highness, about this cooperative.
We all know your noble goals that you strive to achieve, of course, for the world and for everyone.
Without any hypocrisy, charity, or desire for fame, God forbid.
All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. Recently, we were able to deliver thirty sacrificial animals to our brothers in Africa.
We are also now, praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds, preparing to deliver.
Seven boxes of sweets for our children in Gaza.
Mashallah, may Allah bless you and increase your kind.
We left the house, my wife and I.
The lady takes half an hour to start her new project.
I'm waiting for her.
It's fine with me.
I really love spending time with you guys, I enjoy it a lot.
Provide me
All my life.
You seem to want to waste my time.
Stay away from problems.
Fine, bake it, bake it.
Come on, guys!
Is this really happening in the 21st century?
Is this really happening in the 21st century?
He who wants to dive, wants fatigue.
I want men.
Souq Waqif lives.
You deserve it. Congratulations. Congratulations.
May God bless you.
Māshāllāh, everyone loves you, Shahin. Love is from God.
I just want to say one thing, and when you say 'go ahead', I will.
On the occasion of the license, tomorrow my son Shahin will go to the agency and choose the best and most expensive car as a gift from me to him.
The breeze blows upon us from the depths of the valley.
Oh, my love, let the wind carry me back to my homeland.
Hi Fadi
Anoud, how are you?
No, no, no, no, no.
Now you're telling me the dress will be ready in a week, yesterday you sent me a message saying it will be ready in ten days. You're such a tease!
You want some crystal, he'll take a little more weight.
I hope I can chat with Al Anoud now and ignore you.
Why do we have so little light?
Don't be sad, the world is still here, don't be sad, Anooud.
What do you want now, Fadi? They're getting jealous of you.
Oh my, their words are so beautiful, I envy her. Our people are not like that, I envy you.
Make sure you don't forget about it.
My dress is ready.
Please, Fadi.
# Translation: "Thank you, my brother Fadi."
Hey, brother Fadi, I'll come by next week to pick up the dress. Bye, take care!
What can I do for you?
Send the dress to my house.
No, I didn't like it.
Masha'Allah, I went to Fadi's shop today, the work is top-notch, and the girls are coming and going.
Alhamdulillah, we were successful in this project.
What's happening now?
# My Uncle's Son, Bu Nasser
What's wrong with him?
Take a look at the envy.
We've never heard of a rich man in this bankrupt project; where does he get the money from?
She's wearing a black dress, sucking in her stomach.
When I first started in business.
Are you sure?
Listen to me, my friend.
God willing, you intend to let it go.
Seven in the morning.
I'll bring you breakfast.
Don't come in, I'm having breakfast.
I just wanted to talk to you about something.
I heard that you
I'm planning to dive into a business project.
I'm just wondering where I am and where all this is leading. May God guide you, my cousin.
Designing women's fashion I don't design anything, for example.
I am telling you a story.
I am a businessperson.
La la la, no, la la, but I.
I'm here if you need advice. I'm ready to help if you need my assistance.
# Original text: تسلم تسلم يا ولد العم تسلم # Translation: Thank you, thank you, my cousin, thank you.
Alright, forgive me, God, I'm leaving.
Please, go ahead, sir.
He said to me for the first time, "If you want a raise."
Come on, Fadi, arrange the store, it's crowded, I'll watch.
The shop is not enough.
I said you should take the shop next door. Go ahead, rely on God and take it.
I wish.
The shop next to you is a trader.
Is there anyone named Khalaf Sultan Al-Saifi other than your cousin Abu Nasser?
No, there isn't.
I'm here from the Ministry of Economy. I saw his name on a file with one of my friends, Essam. He's handling his papers.
Fashion design for women.
Sure.
I see the lease agreement and his name is written on it.
What's wrong with her? What's wrong with her? What's wrong with her?
What's wrong with her? What's wrong with her? What's wrong with her? She looks unwell.
My ailing heart, how heavy it feels.
The project was a success.
I said I'd ruin it for him.
This is an open market for all.
Shaikh Bu Nasser
Mind your own business.
My heart beats, they say, "Are you planning to start a business?"
Dad, I'm sorry.
Keep your needs to yourself and they will be fulfilled.
Go to hell, you and your stuff.
But it takes you to the limits.
Dad, everyone gets what is destined for them.
Reach out your hand to me.
"You're welcome, you're family."
La la la, Bou Saleh has gone too far.
Reach out and touch the pitbull.
Open to all
You are brothers.
I am my friend Ibrahim advised me.
Bring me a Lebanese designer.
I'm tired and ask me.
I know our women, they'll die for the Lebanese.
Madam, this is being returned to you. No, no, this is unique, there is nothing like it in all of Doha.
# Sweet Treats Oh my, what is this deliciousness? This lovely dessert and the piece they sell for thirty, forty thousand.
I saw him like that.
I heard about the cabinet I made last year when I brought the Lebanese carpenter.
# Wardrobe Design Madam, I will make you a wardrobe like no other in all of Doha.
You want to succeed.
What's exactly going on?
Why don't you know?
"A lot of customers is good."
Let's roll to a different spot, mate.
Ava, Ava, oh Fadi.
They play on their own at that time.
We lost, no.
We need to confront it.
We'll make our customers come back, whether they like it or not.
# Section 1 Okay, you're paying.
I'm not paying for this.
I'm ready to do anything.
I just need to make sure he doesn't beat me.
This is the dress you chose, it turned out to be sixty thousand riyals.
Absolutely no ties for those present in the text.
# This is my design, Mona
I put a crystal on it. There are only fifty of these crystals in the whole world. This is a very special crystal.
Certainly, there's no discount. Our prices are globally known and fixed.
No, definitely not. Who would do such a thing?
Second by second, madam, what is happening? What's going on?
Come on, Saad, come on!
They do this kind of thing.
Slaughter us, we don't have any customers left at all.
Heidi, my name is Harb, ya Bu Nasser.
We won't stay silent for them.
We must fight them back, just as they fight us, and respond to them.
Tomorrow I'll take a loan from the bank.
Light the war upon them and I will show you their true nature.
I'm not bringing it, Nasser.
Take a look at the ad.
Take a look at the ad I posted.
We are offering two evening dresses for free with every wedding dress.
He's got four evening dresses and four wedding dresses to go with them.
We're placing a quarter-page ad.
Jovi is taking up half a page.
What does he intend to do?
Do you believe me, Umm Nasser?
They haven't had a single customer in their store for six days.
I won't, and this afternoon, I'll make sure they don't open even once, they'll be shut tight.
If you hear that he's offering his place for sale.
I'll kill him, I'll kill him.
They can't even sit down, they're sitting outside.
Alright, finish your coffee and go see him.
Oh my god, guide her, I'm here and the food is over there, this is a problem.
You are an enemy to me, you have something.
This is God, may he protect you. No one intentionally sprayed the store with this smell.
These are chemical substances.
Are you sure someone farted in the store?
You are cousins, the older ones, not the younger ones, fighting like kids.
Oh, man, there's a horrible smell in the shop, is this okay?
I didn't spray, it's your smell.
# About Mistakes
You've signed an undertaking with the police.
Don't worry.
I'm all in this time.
I've got a hell of a plan ready.
No one can hold anything against me.
No, by God, everything is normal.
What is this that's confusing me?
I don't know what's going on, man. This is the fourth day in a row with no customers at the store.
Why did you make me show my face in the second store, oh my! May God guide you.
What did the doctor say to you?
I see the store is empty, not a single customer has entered.
I don't know, it's like he's under some kind of spell.
Women and girls don't come anywhere near the shop at all.
You claim you've cast a spell, turning designer Saad into a monster.
It's not far-fetched; don't rule anything out these days.
Magic exists, and that's another purchase.
Zayn, is he lying down or sitting up now?
Go on, enter, my brother, go on. I'm afraid the ceiling might collapse.
You lost, Sultan, you lost.
Mother did a great job.
Slaughtered the beast.
Calm yourself, my brother, don't ever upset him.
I have no idea what he did.
My love taught me, what I did to him, they say his friends started collecting money for him and paying off his debts.
The designer who has it.
I am Lebanese.
Did you tell him? Did you tell him?
Do you have any idea where he went?
Run, run, the stars are there, and these extras are doing their roles.
Call them again, maybe they have a good reason.
Hey, hey, Mr. Ahmed!
Hey, man, Ahmed, why are you sitting here and leaving the crazy guy shouting at me? What should I do? Where are the extras you said you'd get today?
Stay away from me, it's better for you. I called him and my head is killing me, I even asked Professor Abdullah.
First, don't shout because we are actors and we need to be relaxed. We have to focus on our roles. Secondly, the guy called me several times in front of you. Calm down.
Shh shh shh, what are you saying, Professor Abdullah?
Oh, Professor Abdullah, what should I do? This torn costume will ruin the scene, and it's all up to me now.
Come on, guys! Come on, my lovelies! Next one, next one!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Professor! We want to finish, but these extras are supposed to be filming the scene, and they're not even done yet!
Do you really want someone to scold you like this?
Do your job calmly and quietly, without shouting.
We've been shouting all morning, trying to focus.
I've found a solution for you.
What do you think? You manage yourself in Mashhad like this until God willing I bring you an actor who can play the role properly.
He's gonna act in just one scene.
This scene is the most important scene in the series.
Please include some images, if you don't mind.
I'm breaking it up today if you're not ready.
Let's go, guys! Come on!
Do you think a Filipino would be suitable?
You don't know Bo Walid, he's a real party animal, always up for a good time at the cabaret, and he's looking for a partner to join him, someone who's a regular at the cabaret.
My lord, we'll put a gutra on him, and it won't be noticeable.
# Translation: Alaa, are you serious? You just want to boil eggs like that? This is serious production. Respect people's feelings and intelligence, man.
You're putting everything on your shoulders, Ala'. Distribute the tasks and you'll feel relieved.
Give me a hint so I can think. Think with me, Reem. Maybe you remember someone from our friends like this.
Who am I?
Remember Ahmad, there's a guy in our neighborhood called Saud, he's from Aslatah.
Suad Akhnar, no one else.
Saud, say cans.
The hole says he wants a rich man with status, and you say cans.
My love, in the end, he's just a supporting actor, bringing in a rich guy with status and giving him all the attention.
A bit of makeup, O Rima, and wear a bisht and a clean thobe, and a fancy car.
God willing, it will be useful.
We'll get there, don't worry.
I guide them to their home.
Hello.
Happy New Year
Who's this?
Aye aye aye ahoo ahoo
Yes, thank you, dad. You're the best.
Now, how could I, mother, there's no other headscarf but this one that my uncle brought from his trip?
Dad, you only have that one dress to wear.
Dad, it's in the closet, under my clothes.
The gang is waiting for me at the door, mom.
God bless you, my dear father.
I'll see you today and they'll film you on TV.
Oh my god, they said they're going to put me on TV, saying I'm one of the big shots.
Sit down, you mutt.
Come here, you scumbag, I spit on you.
Spray spray
Haji, my mother!
Come quickly, I'm here, thank God, now.
Inshallah, my father.
I hope so, God willing, but they might give you some cash.
May God bless you, God willing.
Oh God, please pray for me.
I brought you, Saud, some cans. Saud, you got a laptop.
Hello.
Peace be upon you, and may God's mercy and blessings be upon you.
This is Abbud, Fatima Abbud's son.
Hello, hello.
Hello, Saud.
This is what will make the scene.
AI, inshallah, inshallah, it will do a good role. Calm down and act well so they give you a longer role. Okay?
Mom, how are you?
I am not that one who gets caught near the first corner.
Shame, shame, come here, my Saudi.
I started wearing glasses.
The slave has turned gray.
I never change, I regret nominating you.
The brother they brought in to play the role of Abu Abdulaziz.
Oh, to be reunited with you, my dear! Hello, hello, welcome, welcome!
# Our Exit, Professor Ghafel Fadel
The most important thing is that you don't fear the camera.
Brother, I fear none but my Lord.
Just relax and listen to his instructions, and tell him, "God willing."
Brother, brother, if you don't mind, you're going to play the role of a rich man from the cabaret, do you understand or not?
Come here, boy, come here, boy.
I am talking to you.
This is very light, the role needs a heavy hitter.
All things are acceptable to some people.
Ask me why I speak like this.
Dad, those girls are beautiful. Listen to me, I'll take you to the makeup room now, and I'll guide you to your role.
Shame, shame, shame.
Come here, please.
Let me introduce her to you.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
I swear, I was just about to come to you. Please, come in, come in.
My professor, the car you wanted for the scene is ready.
Saoud is cleaning everything, fixing everything.
I'll repeat it again, and the assistant director is here so he can hear you and make sure everything is okay.
Imagine yourself as the veteran trader.
You're saying "hi".
Hey, I'm telling you, be patient, be patient, don't rush. I didn't expect that from you, Abu Abdulaziz. You, Abu Abdulaziz, speak up!
Our rights.
Sweet and I know.
He should just brush his teeth.
He is cleaning and completing the full name: Bouabdellaziz Faleh Al-Marzouq. It's nice.
Sweet, keep going, keep going and consider.
I consider your daughter divorced.
Why did you divorce her?
Your daughter is divorced. She is beautiful, indeed beautiful.
You're doing great. Keep going and consider yourself not taken.
Why not say "Ptooey on you!"
You're like a flower, man. You're like a flower, and you've got it all together. May peace and blessings be upon the Prophet. He's as sweet as honey.
He is cleaning his teeth.
How are you? What's up?
# Scene: A group of people are preparing for a live performance. My lord, the homeowners are bothering us, and they want the living room. We need to jump over the scenes in the living room and then film the actions outside.
How do you mean they don't want to?
Yes, they want to, they want to, but it's been postponed a bit, they're filming a different scene, and we'll be next, God willing.
Let them bring you tea.
Hello.
Peace be upon you.
Good morning, may your days be blessed.
Hello there, which family are you from, boy?
I am Salim Bushou'i Al-Shou'i, at your service.
Well, the Sha'awi people are well-known, indeed.
You deserve it.
I'll be back after I put on my lipstick here.
Come on, my brother, those with weak noses, let's go.
I missed myself.
If anyone else had done it, they would have died laughing.
I'd like some.
Hello mom.
My mom is feeling unwell right now, I have to go to her as soon as possible, man.
You're about to leave like that, in your clothes?
I can't tell you my mom is sick and tired, she won't listen.
Listen, you can go like this, but when I call you, come back quickly.
I can't destroy the location, man.
Alright, alright, I'll find a taxi, man.
Taxi, are you crazy? If you look around here and wait for a year, you won't find a taxi.
Do you know, we've rented this car specifically for the scene?
Go and talk to her, she's standing there.
I swear, my brother, please, I wish you'd give me the keys. My mom is sick, I swear, give me the keys, give them to me.
The car.
I want a chair.
I'm ready, send a chair now, now, my good man.
I tell you, I tell you.
I told you my mom is sick, she's in the car, I need a wheelchair, please.
Where is Mered inside the car?
Oh, oh, my dear father, what's happening?
Keep quiet and think it over while you're silent.
Hello.
Nothing, but your aunt, my mother, is having an asthma attack. Let's go!
Let them make the bed.
Sure, here is the translation: "Okay, okay."
I'm not worried at all.
My God, what have you done?
Alhamdulillah, Ya Rashid.
They killed our son, Rashid.
You're welcome, come with me, Professor Rashid.
Please talk to him, Professor Rashid.
I'll take Professor Rashid and deal with him accordingly.
This is the trustworthy one among you.
I'll make sure the nurse stays with you and sees what you're drinking.
Please, Professor Rashid.
Permission.
Snow awaits two of us.
The problem is no one's giving us a face, Mom.
Sir Snow wants to sip some coffee cappuccino.
You're the first one, man, to take a picture of the security guard at the hospital with his Filipino girlfriend.
Who told you I refuse?
Not a single one is giving me any attention.
Philosophizing and not necessarily.
I don't have a certificate, I don't want your mom, what, I don't want your mom, go find your friends.
Bro, there's this girl at the hospital who I like.
You're not giving me a chance, look for someone else.
I can't, my heart is attached.
My brother, he's a doctor and he's in love. Can you believe I saw her?
I want to see Doctor Muhammad.
Hi, hi, Snow White, are you?
Oh my God, let's go.
By God, what a beautiful face!
Your Highness, my aunt is in perfect health.
You are a professional actor, Saud. Come on, guys, let's move on. Come on.
Wow, you're amazing! Look, they're applauding and praising you.
Come on, now go change your clothes and wipe off your makeup.
Hey, man, let it go and come here to sign for me first.
Yes, from today onwards, my name is Falih Al-Marzooq.
Leave this talk and write "Saudi."
Saud is dead.
From today, my name is Falih Al-Marzooq Abu Abdulaziz.
May God bless you, my love.
# Buffet One
Sweet two.
I heard one of the bride's relatives say, "God, these people are so classy. I don't think anyone could pull off what they did at the wedding."
Okay, my love. Bye, take care.
Mom, it's me.
I need to bring something for the engagement.
What's wrong, mom?
Take a look at your brother, he's going to embarrass us.
You're a failure, man. Bring it on.
Let it go as it goes.
Let the maids eat this.
He wants to make a joke out of us.
Say it's beautiful what I've seen.
This is the upper-class type for high-class people.
Below average performance.
No, we want something extraordinary, something not everyone can afford.
# Request المسامحه الشيخه اللي ما بيعرفك بيجهلك تؤمري طويله العمر # Translation My apologies, Your Highness. Those who don't know you will misunderstand you. Your command is my wish, Your Majesty.
Shut up, just shut up, you don't know anything.
I'm afraid my money won't be enough.
Let's not be embarrassed, just use your card.
Oh, wow, they're so elegant, truly refined.
Saleh is my refuge yesterday.
Saleh Nasser
Sure, her
I'm on my way to Abha, my dear.
We've booked the small hall and the food is from Ghalaqa.
Very Jeep
The L family talked about the wedding of the Saeed family.
Surely everyone says the same thing.
This is what scares me.
My choice, my beloved.
I'm just staring at the money.
No care for people's talk.
He wants to make a joke out of us.
We should get something that suits our means and our circumstances.
You know, there are people who borrow money, sell their houses and cars just to have a lavish wedding so that people won't talk about them.
Stay out of it, enough is enough, that pocket of yours that almost got us embarrassed.
You yourself said that the manager was impressed by the Chinese dish and took it home.
"Zain, the bride's family said it's up to you to choose the hall and the stage, and to take care of everything on your own."
God willing, we'll choose anything.
It's not just about anything, but I think the store we went to earlier is really reasonably priced.
You mean this store, it's the one that hosted the wedding of the Bu Zuhaib family.
Has anyone used it before?
By God, honestly, all at once.
I marry the daughter of the long life Mubarak.
No, we don't want anything used.
We're the first people in the world to use it.
You want to stand out.
Show me what you've got.
This is my first time sitting on the couch in Qatar.
Inspired by the information verse, i.e. Facebook and Twitter.
Afternoon, very modern.
The price of the couch with all the accessories.
Sure, here's the translation: Hello, can you calculate it for me, but not more than one hundred and twenty-five thousand?
Mom, mom, you know this won't be enough money. Everything is more expensive and better, it's unique. You know, all of this will cost money.
Everyone does it like this.
Shut up or I'll kill you.
What's up?
Do you like this one?
This is Noah's Ark.
At your leisure, they are two grandfathers, but a corner of Noah's ark is worth twenty thousand.
No, and why? May God have mercy on your parents. I say, the luxurious car is much better, honestly.
Shut up, I don't want Noah's Ark.
These weddings and their costs, and we consider ourselves to be average people, you know.
You need to book a corner for 150,000 and a hall for another 150, this is what you reserved, the royal hall as you call it.
We said Sahara, but why the pretence? Everyone wants to look at each other, and everyone wants to do better than the other.
Battle of appearances, only the owners of wedding halls benefit from it.
Those who know that everyone wants to stand out, take advantage of us and deceive us.
By the will of God, I know one of my friends who says his brother has a wedding venue.
He says the wedding car doesn't cost two thousand riyals.
I can't let him go, I've been waiting for God to bless her father.
Okay, then you take care of it.
Just as others before you got married and took action.
Hello, my dear.
How are you?
I know you like to stand out.
I'm telling you this is why.
# First Time in Qatar Designed by the renowned artist Peter Salmo
# The Nine Planets Collection
I am from the solar system.
# Noah's Ark Corner It will look really nice with the Noah's Ark corner.
Harmony, you'll never find anyone like you in Qatar, you're the first one to use the nine planets.
Alright then.
I was fifty thousand and now
I give up.
May God give you peace of mind.
It is my pleasure.
Expenses are way too high, my brother.
I couldn't manage to get all eighty of them, to be honest.
All I could manage was sixty thousand, and I took twenty thousand from my brother.
You did not fall short, you did not fall short, my brother Fahad, may God bless you.
# **Translation:** Hey, Fahd, back off! As long as we're proud and showing off at the wedding, we're headed for disaster.
No pretensions, no arrogance.
You definitely get the cards you want.
"God willing, we'll start with the cards this week."
If our wedding turns out to be better than theirs.
Mom, look at the cards your son is making for the wedding.
My brother, where have you been living?
People now travel to countries just to make wedding cards.
Amina's family went to Italy, designed the cards, printed them, and came back. Amina's house
They went to France, even people who don't have a lot of money go to Lebanon, they go to Lebanon and bring their cards.
The country is moving like this, do you want us to go against it?
Why and which country do you want to travel to, God willing?
The cards are very beautiful.
She's really expensive, though.
I'm unique, no one has done it before us.
Zari is not pretty.
I say gold is better, it shines.
Bro, if he can't afford the wedding expenses,
"Why would he get himself into this mess in the first place?"
Give up this boasting and showing off at weddings, and the unnecessary expenses that serve no purpose.
No one benefits from our mental illness except these hotels and wedding halls.
I'm going, poor me.
Let me go take him, it's a shame if he doesn't find anyone to take him.
Welcome, your arrival is a delight.
You're welcome, Nasser.
Bro, the bride's family should stand by your side.
I'm just a single time, just once.
I mean, it's not necessary to have a huge hotel ballroom like this.
I found her in the street, and she's no better than the rest.
This problem, everyone looks at everyone.
Who told you I got married?
At least these people don't have this arrogance.
It's just a simple party and expenses are within our means.
And now, these days, people are having wedding parties on Facebook.
Cheapest and most cost-effective.
You're not married to someone from your country, are you?
Forget, I want to go there.
Aravij 'aad
If I don't get a wedding gift for my son Abdullah Arweshid or Nawal.
You can go to hell, she'll never look better than me.
I say, my love.
Madam, Mr. Al-Washaid has his number, give it to us so we can call him.
Alright, my love, you're the best. Bye, take care.
We were agreed, mom, on having a DJ. Why did you change your mind?
I hope Um Nsour is better than me.
You forgot who I am and who we are.
Those below us become better than us.
The subject is not like that, mom. You see, my brother Saleh is breaking my heart, and we don't want to put pressure on him.
I felt so sorry for him.
Wow!
I'm at the hospital now, which hospital?
Mother suddenly fell upon us.
Did you hear that, or should I repeat it for you?
He has no idea what he's talking about. You can't blame him after you prepared everything and people started saying they don't want a wedding.
He wants to fail us.
He said the doctor was right.
He's embarrassing us, sister; he wants to cancel the wedding.
God willing, only good things will happen.
Don't break her heart.
Oh my dear mother, you are a real man, and it's you who brings home the money.
Run, run, wind, calm her heart.
By God, if I tell this to Boyusuf, his heart will stop.
You know why the minister is still keeping Bouyoussef.
You know, he should have been retired three or four years ago.
There's nothing wrong with him helping me.
You're out of your mind, man!
I think you're young, but I don't understand you now.
Let him go through the documents and statements until you get your money back.
This is what we call deferred cooling of amounts.
I have no idea why I spoke. Why? Are you scared?
There's nothing wrong with it, and in the end, I'll pay it back anyway.
Do you know what they call me? Do you know what they call me?
The committed, disciplined one.
# My Uncle, My Uncle, I Tried, But There's No Other Way
I gave you a week after the audit.
Their condition is in God's hands, they are in a critical state, please send help quickly, quickly.
Hurry up, one by one, one by one.
I ate the whole pill.
Lala, God willing, we'll be at the venue from 7:30 to receive the guests.
We won't be there at all.
I'll throw a wedding for my son, one that will be the talk of the entire Doha.
Surprise
Okay, my love, Fatima, I want to talk to you.
I'm afraid for you, my son, they might envy you if you go to them like this in your robe tomorrow.
Mom, how handsome he looks in his cloak.
The police are coming.
"Oh God, let it be for good."
Six policemen, you stay here, I'll be right with you.
May God judge you, O Salouh.
Your marriage is over.
# Marriage Cage, I'm Trapped Now, the Prison Cage
They found the papers I was hiding for your loan. Oh, come on, now they've got it into their heads and caught me.
Why are you upsetting yourself?
Do you hear worse things than this?
# Chapter 1 ## The Return of Shangul
Loyal and dedicated employee.
He loves his job. The ministry has contracted a company to do the maintenance.
The employee, due to his dedication to his work, went to inquire about the materials.
I found it for four hundred thousand riyals.
The ministry saves one million six hundred thousand.
The minister should go and punish him, no, no, I can't believe what I'm hearing.
Why don't you believe me?
That's him, it's Saad, he arrived.
He definitely has the full story.
Fire him from the job.
What's happening in the world? Where are the values?
Hey, didn't he tell you to call his office manager?
He said, "Let it be a destroyer instead of Uthman."
# And after that, forbidden.
The daughter of the manager is from the same company that I submitted the maintenance offer to.
They were exposed by Wali Osman.
La la la la, this is unbelievable.
You're always surprised, Saleh.
The company is not at all theirs.
Who is he?
That's how we became.
What do you say, man?
I'm not sure what he's done wrong, poor Osman.
His only fault is that he is an honest and loyal employee.
The manager is in his office right now.
I woke up at six.
What's wrong with the world?
We saw strange shapes.
I'm with you, Uthman, he doesn't deserve it, but there's nothing we can do.
It's a sin, Your Highness, he has seven children and no passport.
Satter, Satter, he's so old for this job now. Where should I hit him on the head? Where should he go?
Did you see what happened?
The newly appointed female employee by the minister.
# عثمان's Office I visited Osman's office and stayed with him. The poor guy wanted to take his belongings, but I stopped him and said, "Go ahead, I'll send your things with the cleaner."
Where is he now?
The scales have tipped, Osman.
This is the end.
Insha'Allah.
And to God be the glory.
Allah is generous, Osman. Allah will not forsake you, God willing. Goodbye.
I hope nothing's wrong. Your voice doesn't sound right.
I know, I know, you're very sensitive.
I really don't feel like going to work today, man. I'm just gonna leave.
I'll drop by my mom's and pick up your stuff on my way.
I don't want you to stay like this, feeling upset.
What's wrong with you? Why are you shouting at me? I'm your mother.
I'm not angry, I'm asking you.
You're crazy, my father, my brother, my husband, it's normal for them to ride together.
The world has changed, where have you been living?
I have no idea, mom.
Are you guys serious?
People are liberated, the universe has become a small village. Where do you live?
What can I say?
Stay ahead of your time and live in the present, don't lag behind.
Drop the stuff quickly, come on! Stop talking and shut your mouth, you're just staring. Come on, close it properly.
Is everything okay, Saleh? What's wrong?
You're not yourself today.
I shouted at the maid, who was blameless.
I had to do it, whether I liked it or not.
La la la, I don't feel like it.
So I can forget the horrors I've seen.
My love, there is no ice cream.
Dad, you're a bit angry today.
Your Majesty, it is our pleasure.
Thank you, thank you, you've been great!
Work hard, diligently, and persistently.
Sure, here is the translation: "That's right, Salam."
Most important.
The most important thing for me in this ministry is...
"Indeed, Your Highness."
Tell me the benefits of an employee who doesn't take bribes.
It's useless.
I want all of you for this reason.
There is no place for us here, for the loyal, the principles, and the outdated values.
I will discover one day
He has no one to blame but himself.
We fear no blame in upholding justice.
Let's work together on this.
Even if you doubt.
Let me know immediately.
Thieves, sons of thieves, and our sisters, of course, are no better.
Noura, if you don't take a bribe even for one day, the government will come after you when you're on your way home.
Mashallah, mashallah, kefu 'alayj, hadhi tra al-mamul minkum kulukum, ana ma abiha bas hiya, kulukum abi'kum atsuwn mithlaha.
May God bless you.
I want you to leave the procurement department and become my office manager.
Honestly, you chose well; you picked the right thief for the right place.
Alright, mother of Asaad, enough, don't torment me any longer.
I didn't take you to jail.
But God is my only refuge from Satan, who tempted me and made dishonesty seem attractive.
He told me to be honest.
You're a real father to your sons.
What do you want with honesty and loyalty?
You've been a thief all your life and lived comfortably.
Fine, I didn't become a Sharif.
Let me chat with your dad.
I'll bear it, I'll do it again.
One walks straight, bribes, steals, and lies, and lives comfortably.
My father is in prison because all his money is haram.
Shush.
You shouldn't wear this.
We are a respectable family.
It's not my fault.
Where is Tangier?
Why isn't it uncovered?
You're shameless, no shame or dignity.
Be ashamed, put on some clothes, brother.
There's one who's shy these days.
What's wrong with you? Why are you shouting?
Goofy, what are you wearing?
There's no way a decent woman would dress like that.
God willing, you'll walk in the street without revealing anything of your body.
I told her not to listen to me.
I've done my best for her.
Bring her those transparent clothes that she doesn't need.
Be warned, if I ever see you wearing anything above the knee.
He who is warned, is forearmed.
We wish God would protect you, we're coming.
Inshallah, just a flirt and a gigolo.
He takes after his father.
What you see in front of you.
You're a real gem, honestly. Where can we find another like you?
Don't worry, uncle, I'm black-faced.
My daughter Sarah is truly a gem; I love her dearly and care deeply about her future.
Are you not hearing about it?
Alhamdulillah, mashallah, her reputation is terrible.
I enter the house at 3:30 in the morning.
Wow, mashallah, it's five o'clock in the morning.
Ayo, ayo, what's up?
Come and get me from the bar.
Start your car and come pick me up from here.
I've never seen a father who doesn't listen to his son's words.
Let's go, dad, stop playing around. Start your car, let's go, I'm waiting for you.
Mary, I love you.
I love you too, I've disappeared, disappeared, disappeared.
Basically, my father is here.
Where is he?
You're a piece of junk, you're not my father's equal. He doesn't give a damn about such nonsense.
I'd like to introduce you to my boyfriend Majid.
He's not like his previous boyfriend, Abdulaziz.
Welcome, come in, welcome, it's a chance, some hash.
The Arabic and Israeli satellites
I've noticed that many Palestinians don't trim their nails.
According to the commitments made by the State of Palestine in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.
Generally, the United Nations is meeting today to decide on Israel's request to send special teams to inspect the fingers of the Palestinian people.
If their nails are long or not.
There was a condition that nothing in Palestine should irritate, hurt, or raise a fuss.
State of Palestine
I call on the entire international community to visit Palestine.
Comprehensive Peace Agreement
We make it from cork.
# The Walzatonas, Man!
I squeeze the olives like this, I squeeze the olives.
We, the Arab brothers, demand the international community.
We inspect the Palestinians' nails.
Now we start voting.
No, I won't let it go that far, no.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
Saleh Saleh, what's wrong with you?
I dreamed about what?
I dreamed of an upside-down world.
Rashed, you must have a strong personality.
Now, brother, what's the number of the school I'm going to tomorrow?
I am, like you, a teacher.
Why not change my school since I started teaching?
Hey, man.
His personality is too weak.
The teachers who are with him are the ones who protested against him.
How much more, brother?
I don't see him being quiet.
He started explaining.
I really don't like it if there's no mayonnaise with it.
Bro, we're not saying all this to make you upset.
We're telling you this because this is your last chance.
He told me he accepted Rashid, even though his personality is weak.
I'm unsteady and overly kind.
No matter what, he's a local boy.
Why are you quiet now, my brother?
"Because everything you said is true."
Your words are all correct.
I hate it.
Professor Rashid Al-Hadeed
Professor Rashid
May your tongue be sound and healthy.
Forget it, already.
I'll be there tomorrow.
What kind of justice is this? What next?
Here you go.
I'm a teacher, I can't stand mistakes.
"Suppose a boy jumps out at you and says to you the same thing the boy said to you in primary school, and the inspector is sitting there."
Take your bag.
Slowly, slowly, you broke the door.
One has learned from their mistakes.
I was in from the first minute.
Here you go.
I am nervous.
I'm awesome.
Shut up, Zain.
Heaven said, "Be quiet now."
I heard him.
He said, Professor Rashid kicked me out.
Ava jannah qal yallah zayin lakin ma3lay, ma abi ajof wayyak ahnay fass saf.
Professor, do you know a boy from there?
Born from
There's Professor Rashid coming.
We're heading your way.
Sir, there's a problem if he tells his father.
Okay, you usually have the opportunity, where do I see you seizing it, sitting there?
He might be sitting near the chairs.
Above the chairs
Chairs, chairs, run!
In the end, Adam's son is but a human being.
You just shouted at me.
A quarter and you're joking. You're joking with me.
My dad is traveling, and he'll be back next week. When he returns, I'll tell him.
No, Abdulrahman, please.
We are the best, the best, the quarter of the raspberry ice cream is really sweet, you might not have tried it, it's a bit sour, but it's really amazing.
Come on, go get it quickly!
He's afraid to tell his father.
You didn't say that his father was traveling.
I'm a traveling woman, my father sent me off, he said, "Take her away, pack her bags and send her off."
God help us, God help us.
He took his bag, brought it to him, and gave him your phone number, saying, "If you need anything, call me. I'm your friend."
Hey man.
What else?
You told me to do it.
Scream and believe in yourself strongly.
Bathroom, bathroom, bathroom.
Rashed, listen!
Sleep, my dear, sleep. Sleep, there's no need to worry, just sleep.
Teacher Bu Nasser, Teacher Nasser in the bathroom.
One juice, please.
Come, come, come, come, give it to me.
Come on, hurry up!
Put them on the table.
All people are equal.
# Our Graduation Party That's why I've gathered you all here to hear your ideas for the celebration.
# Will someone guarantee these children?
You're causing trouble, man. He's calling.
Three o'clock.
Hello, sugar, he's just joking, I swear.
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Hello.
Stand up for the inspector. Sit down.
Yes, sir.
Teacher, come here, come here, over here, teacher!
I guess I've made you upset.
Are you mocking me, my friend? I'm asking you, have you finished talking?
# Have you finished it or not? Where is your respect for the teacher? You're humiliating yourself. You're degrading the teaching profession.
Fine, fine, enough, enough.
Do you speak up even louder?
I'll raise my voice, you first know this boy is a boy from
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Two cars only.
Lala Arabibtin, I want four, four, five cars. Go, go, go, the desert is vast.
Be the owner of this village.
Abu Nasser used to do it this way and he didn't do it this way.
May God make it easy for him.
I, the manager, congratulate.
I'm not known as Bonasser.
He gave all the teachers extra lessons.
I only.
I am the manager, I congratulate.
You're the boss, God bless you. What's wrong with you?
Chill out.
Put it on your head on the chair, man.
What does "شش" mean?
There's no need, I swear, I really want to ease your mind.
What's its name?
You're finally here now.
Respect yourself, it's better for you, and you'll take extra classes whether you like it or not. You're welcome, or do as you please.
Get lost, man! Get up, get up, get up, and get out!
I'm ready, God willing, let's go outside.
How are you, we told you, boy?
We need to stop him from going too far.
Hold on, guys, hold on.
Don't blame us, O father of Salamin.
You, Bu Nayef, are the elder of the neighborhood, and you must put a stop to him.
I'm not my father's son.
I'll show him to you, I will.
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Goodbye, Your Highness.
Māshāllah, when did you buy this new car?
You told me that you didn't believe me.
He shaved his mustache, and his face turned red.
I knew it was him the moment he walked in; his voice gave him away.
You know we've been out for a week.
I am responsible for eight boys' and girls' schools.
What's the magic secret that he tells you about, the one that pulled him up from the depths?
Here's the translation: "I told you from day one."
I'm explaining, but I hear no sound.
We do not allow.
Respect yourself.
Come back and I'll come back to you. Get lost, go out, come on, out, out, out.
As soon as your appointment as a minister is announced, I'll look for a nice job for me with you.
Hey, come here, don't tell me you want this job.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I understand your request. It seems like you want me to translate a text, but the text you provided is already in English. Could you please clarify what you need assistance with?
My brother, Minister.
By God, I didn't feel at ease with the calls that came to me.
Ma sha Allah, everyone is congratulating.
What are they saying, mom? May God guide you.
This is a regular thing; every minister comes and automatically employs his relatives and associates.
I'm reassured from this side. Don't worry. Nice to meet you. Have a nice day.
I'm aware that I'll become a minister.
# **English Translation:** # First Gear Engine Oil
# Treasure Unveiled A treasure, a treasure, unveiled for us.
# Earth Return
Oh my, everyone has gone to congratulate the new minister.
Come on, come on, come on.
Congratulations on his efforts, the minister.
Congratulations, may you live a long life, congratulations.
Congratulations, the minister's watch is worthy of you.
You deserve it, minister's messenger.
Oh brothers, the responsibility is great. May God grant us the strength to bear it, God willing.
"A perfect match, as they say."
You turned out to be wrong, I told you Bu Saleh's phone was ringing.
He was a bit far away.
Stay away from him.
This love that descended upon him all at once.
"Bo Sultan is not easy."
I did open the car door for him.
Well done, you didn't hold back.
We're waiting for our brother to become a minister.
I told you, mom, it was you who didn't believe me.
Do you talk to me with your coffee shop talk?
After her husband passed away, she said that I was the one who took care of him.
May God protect us. May God protect us.
You got nothing to say, you got nothing.
Mom, get up, let's go. You're killing me, get up.
I don't mean to offend anyone.
Relax, you.
I just went off on them because they pissed me off.
They are right.
I didn't want to say this in front of my mom, you know, she embarrasses us.
Anything you hear, you spread it; we call it the sieve. We don't want the scandal.
You're the man, what do you want me to give you if they remove him and put you in his place?
Because I asked.
If you're pulled out, you'll be the first one nominated.
Okay, I'll tell you something, they're actually going to remove it.
No, I'm sure about this.
Ava 3laych, shaif shilta mithal ma ashufch jadami il-7een.
I'll cast a spell on him.
The plan in my head is foolproof and effective.
# Plan of
I'll make sure he bans all activities taking place in the country.
At that moment, he burns, and the fire consumes him, and when the fire consumes him, the burden is lifted.
My brother, I don't know how to explain it, I'm at a loss for words.
Your trip is called participation, reflecting your love for the country.
Do you see it like this?
You are a state official today; you must be in the picture.
I must contribute to everything. Forgive me, Your Highness, forgive me, forgive me.
Before I forget, thank you for the lamb you sent me yesterday.
# Invitation to a Simple Sheep Hey, His Highness, it's just a humble sheep, not worthy of your presence. Come on, what did you say, Your Highness, that you'd go with me today?
The real is waiting for you outside.
You know, to be honest.
I don't feel like going.
I'm tired, I'm tired of showing off, I'm tired.
You are the minister today. Correct your speech and be the social person you are. Earn your livelihood.
May God make this kind man a fool for you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
I don't picture myself.
Give it, give it.
Tonight I took him to an evening event and a wedding; if he didn't get hit on, he got hit on with a hundred pictures.
I'm bringing you a nice job, I want you to go with me.
Listen, I've arranged a really great educational activity for you.
Just like this, let it shine; I want it to shine, shine, shine until it's polished. I'm looking for that shine.
Shopkeeper, thank you. Congratulations, congratulations. Blessed is the bicycle. Oh, look, a picture. A picture for the minister. Give him a picture. Give him a picture. I don't want to. I don't want to. Go away. Give him.
This bicycle.
Congratulations on the opening. God willing, may it bring you success. The minister sends his blessings.
Sure, here is the translation: "Take a picture, take a picture, you're so fat, you're so fat, you're so old."
There is nothing. May God bless you.
Fly on page two.
He doesn't know what he's doing.
National participation
Remember Allah.
This is the fourth friend of mine who called me today.
Everyone praises your activities, Um Khalid, you could be called the active social activist.
Yesterday, I heard a word that hurt me.
Last night, the party that Bu Sultan took me to.
# Celebration of the Sprouts' Swimming Victory
One guy is telling his friend
They think I don't hear them.
He says hello, Mr. Minister.
I want to buy my niece's birthday gift.
Hello, hello.
I'll read the newspaper every day, dad.
Absolutely, absolutely.
Here's the translation: This is a mess. Why do you come here so often? Dad, what do you want? I'll fucking do it, Dad.
As long as he pays, he doesn't pay, no problem.
If that's the case, your minister won't look for him and won't ask about him.
I am Anas Bou Saleh, the minister.
Bossultan didn't come to take me somewhere. I'm waiting for him.
He made me sit in the front row and went to his car to rest.
I don't want anything from him, may God guide you.
Oh my god, my dear, may my parents be blessed, look, listen, I'll call you in a bit to make sure.
Out of yourself, you started to connect.
People are giving us discounts.
I told you so.
The job is really cool.
He's back, he wants to take me.
"Oh my, the minister is really working hard, may God protect him."
Hello, hello, the minister's wish.
I'm really tired today, man.
Alright, if you're that enthusiastic, give the order.
You just say the word, my brother Saad will take you and drive you around, God willing, he'll find a party or something for you.
This engine is a party starter.
LaLa, today we have no activities.
No, by God, there isn't.
Where can we find him?
Hey, thanks, thanks.
I say, is there anyone we can ask?
May God bless you.
I'll tell you to sleep and rest.
# لحظه سعد # Fortunate Moment
Sure, here is the translation: "Anything, God willing."
Hey, cool.
I can't waste any more time.
He's just posing in the cabin, and look, he's taking pictures, let him take a few more, just a few more photos.
Oh, come on. Bye, take care.
Did you throw it at him?
I have no idea, let him play alone in the field, God willing.
"Hey, this minister is assigned to us."
Sweet, he reached the peak.
The end is near, now that people are talking.
Your Highness, he is now more famous than you.
Long live your majesty, if you go to a place and take Abu Saleh with you.
Long live the King!
Stellar star
We'll put it out, and it'll return to its original size.
The minister has arrived. The minister has arrived. The minister has arrived.
I can't imagine, I can't imagine, if one of you takes my picture, I'll break you. I'm not going down like this.
Brooke broke my cameras, I don't want to be filmed.
I greeted you a lot.
I missed the train, just as they say.
This is Khalid, my brother.
There is no power or might except with Allah.
Why like this?
This is the first time I've seen him.
First time I saw him.
I haven't seen him in years.
Wow!
This is my immortality.
I've been waiting for you, my love, come to me, come.
What can we do, we're used to it.
Phew, there is no power or might except by Allah. You brought up the same old issue again.
Get out, I'm telling you, get out and stop blowing up my head. I'm already exhausted, I just came back from the wedding at 3 a.m.
Just leave me alone, man. This is getting ridiculous.
Your brother is my son.
By God, I will tell my father what you've done to yourself; you look like a girl.
He was just playing, playing.
He was playing with a makeup container, I tell you.
This is Saud, I know what to do with him.
Khaled has returned, and I wish all the kids were like him.
"With all these advertisements and nonsense he keeps showing his brother."
Come on, my loves, come and say hello.
Hey, my loves, how are you?
We're not going to Spain this summer, my love.
Who are you looking for?
Cheetahs of Kuwait
Hi Hamadeh
Listen to me, I'm telling you.
There is no power or might except with Allah, the Most High, the Supreme.
I'll let my love, Amal, make the choice.
Sure, why not?
I say, the sea is the best.
In the near future, we'll buy a yacht and sail directly from home to the sea.
We and our children.
Come on, set a wedding date already!
We're almost there, just a year and a few months left.
What the hell, is this your brother? He's wearing way too much cologne.
I hope honesty, I notice Khalid your brother I don't know how.
You're so very different from your brother Saad.
He's back, not gone, everyone is free to act as they wish, my dear.
Then your fiancé is so backward, he doesn't know there are unisex perfumes.
I say, let your fiancé keep his opinions to himself.
I don't care.
Khaled couldn't believe it.
You're not just using your perfumes like a woman.
You even use their colors.
Why are you doing this, Khalid?
Oh, you're so clueless!
Mom, why don't you want to see that he's up to something? Don't you see his actions and behavior?
This time, perfumes for both of you.
Did you hear me when I warned you?
Have you seen the Bluetooth file?
Listen to the guys chatting in the corner, they say it's spreading in Doha.
I heard about him, Rauna.
You'll see, and then I'll tell you.
Oh wow, Joe, how do you dance like that?
Blue blue blue blue Joe movements
These are girls. Look at this one you're talking about, she dances well and does some moves. Do you know who this is? This is Khalid, Muhammad's cousin.
Khalood's cousin is a damn dog.
I'll show him.
Look at Saad's brothers come.
Why don't you come over, and I'll show you, man. Send it to Saad via Bluetooth so his family can see it.
Hello.
Peace be upon you, hello, hello.
Vanquished for sure.
I see my cousin standing over there.
My Bluetooth is on, just saying.
I'll send you something.
Thank you, ma'am.
Shut up, he escaped from him.
You're a bastard, Saad.
I'm traveling tomorrow.
I won't show my face in this country.
Where do I hit you on the head?
What will people say?
They say their son pushed them away and left. Do you want to cause us a scandal?
Wow!
This is what you did, my daughter, is a source of pride and honor.
Real mold cake, it's a disaster.
I don't have any sisters, so they say he's the brother of my daughters.
Say he traveled, got treatment, studied, worked, or committed suicide; anything.
I just want to live in a place where scandal doesn't chase me every day.
Are you coming back, where are you going?
May it go to hell in a handbasket.
This is the end of it.
He's gone, we don't know where he is, and he's packing his bags to travel.
We don't even know where he wants to go.
What did you expect to happen?
What's wrong with you now? I came here to make things easier for you, but you're saying things that hurt my heart.
I was telling you to take care of him.
I won't let him go to the servants.
You had no idea about it nor were you aware.
My father is busy with his work and leaves the responsibility on you.
Mother's remedy is right here.
There's no hope, for your sister's sake.
In this, you're right.
We have no face among people, all because of what Khaloud did.
I can't see anyone.
You told him something.
This is my father's biggest mistake.
We're in the shitty case of the pervert Kholoud.
I didn't tell him.
I'll give it to him on a CD.
I'm on my way to the airport.
I'm really worried about him.
Our house needs to be this clean, Amal.
Do not be surprised.
# Eternal and His Kind, I Do Not
Their siblings' reputation.
No matter how the religious values call them.
They go and dance, making a ruckus.
Down the drain of evil.
I swear, father, you're the one who's confusing me.
Goodbye, dad.
Be careful, my son.
I've got a little gift for you, Dad.
Gift for me.
Now, I've put the CD into the laptop. I'm scared of what's going to happen. Just follow my lead.
Oh my God, mom!
"Can it be, mom? Dad is still watching the CD, and it's only three minutes long!"
Maybe it's true.
Where does he get the time to go?
Reply to me, what's wrong, Abu Saad?
Dad
Sorry, Amal.
I get really tired if I have to look for it.
I'll hit you for your rude behavior.
Forgive me.
May God bless you.
I see you guys went up to the roof.
My love.
We are in the era of freedom.
The era of human rights, no one owes anyone anything.
He who has a riyal can take a thousand, oh my beloved.
Of course, God bless America, my love.
# The Legend of Maji's
I don't understand one thousand and two hundred.
According to God, I'll get you, and you're the one who sided with Adryol. I asked him how much his salary is.
Mama, Mash is mine, I have so many invitations.
I'm tired of hearing him complain; his salary is a bit low, and there's no point in negotiating with him. We offered him seven hundred, you gave him a hundred more, what else does he want?
I told him that once the year is over, I will increase your salary.
This guy is greedy and will give us a hard time.
Shut up, just shut up! Be quiet, be quiet! Send him away, get rid of him!
Is it easy for you to say this word? It's easy.
I can't stand riding in his car anymore.
Let him go, enough.
You've told me the story now, I'm the man of the house, I'll make sure to keep quiet. You be quiet too, I'll handle it.
Get up, I want to go out. Get up!
Come here, stand still.
I don't understand what you're saying.
My friend says, "Why can't they see me inside the exile?" He says this or he doesn't say it.
Dad, there's no friend here, just work. I'm the brother of my father's brother, not your brother.
I'll be there in five minutes, God willing.
Five minutes.
Leave it inside your head, okay?
You never listen to Madam, she always tells you to increase the salary, increase the salary.
All is precious in the world of the simple-minded.
In a few months, it'll be eight hundred.
Dad, I'm in a lot of trouble here in the country.
This driver is inside Doha in a silver one thousand one hundred thousand two hundred.
In bed maybe one thousand, in bed three hundred above one thousand father.
Patience, I'm thinking.
Look, I've already added one hundred, that's it, shh, no more, no more, be quiet, there's no increase after that.
You don't do what you say, you just add a hundred extra things to the job.
Sinu qol.
I say, will you go?
There's no use crying over spilt milk.
Two hundred, no use.
Shashi, I am afraid.
# ليس كوف # Not Cuf
I'm sorry, but the
3000 above 4000, three thousand above four thousand.
Snow problem small inside house no use outside good money horses.
I am very afraid.
The wool is very delicate.
How much is
2005
I fear the police, they will come for me, and I'll be imprisoned.
No coffee for you.
I'm your buddy.
I'll wear my jacket and leave.
I vote, but no one answers me.
Hero of his room, except for the closet, is empty.
Amira, her service lasted for a whole year.
I can only say, God will hold him accountable.
Okay, I'll stop by your place.
I went to the police, I reported it.
Alright, since you reported it, you have no responsibility.
We, God willing, won't fall short.
You should also look around the neighborhood, back and forth, maybe you'll see him. Let us know if you do.
I gather money, and when I'm full, I hand myself over.
I'll beat them, lose to them, dress them, feed them, train their car.
It's not up to him.
Match starts now, watch, watch, the best is inside.
Sure, I was scared to tell you.
These are the Fox team, and the foxes don't surrender easily.
Do you know if more than three register, it means we didn't win, we want ten, fifteen.
Mockery, clear mockery. Let's be honest, it's clear mockery.
This level, if it doesn't bring more than three, it's not the fox team's level.
I tell you, take it.
In the team, the players, and the performance.
They have nothing to be grateful for. If they get out in less than three, they should be grateful.
We're hungry for the upcoming words from our team, these are the Foxes, get away from us, dad.
We scored a goal, now you can relax and celebrate.
I expect there are more sayings, or is this it?
This is a very good idea. This is what's in your mind. It's not good for you. You're just wasting your time and money. This is a very good idea, but it eats chicken.
Lala, I don't have a car.
You are my money companion.
Did you not hear what he said?
They say this fox is a big troublemaker.
You are in the hands of the most merciful.
Yes, sir.
Are you clueless or what?
This is the logo of the Free Foxes Association.
He sometimes appears on the Fadfada program.
Hegelbucho will be defeated today.
You're a fine team, there's no defeat, you're always victorious.
Fox, what do you say about the result today?
What do you see as a result?
Result of this class: Foxes.
This t-shirt should earn him some money; it's his turn to do so.
Let's be realistic, my friend. Don't tell me Foxes won and flew away.
This is Papa's foxes.
This fox is taking a chicken; he's making food.
Oh my, Your Highness, you didn't see him here in the stands, what is he doing?
The audience is slaughtering with laughter.
Zahir is inside the mall, and Salama owns it.
He is the true fan, the one with genuine loyalty to the club.
I'm hanging out with the big Qatari guys who go to the malls and all that.
He invited me for a cappuccino.
Take a look at the world, my brother.
He pulled out a 500 riyal note right in front of my eyes and paid the bill.
Let me hear the poem you wrote about our match against the frogs.
Salamah, the tribe of the Arabs, is present.
You are a frog.
You're not in my team, you can't turn me into your rival.
Shut up and disrespect the club and the team, just you wait and see what happens.
There is no saying.
# The Day One Fox
What is the reason for this, man?
Stay tuned for the first match of the final team.
I'm doing this username from here, so I'm coming soon.
Salamah, Salamah, Salamah, Arba'a qabila hadhrin.
Each month we meet to choose the ultimate fan.
Mashallah, and who did you choose for the recognition this month, inshallah?
Members of the association's board of directors are the ones who decide.
You're such a child, and each one of you is as big as a camel.
I run this big club, Fox.
Come on, come on, look at the driver who escaped from us, he's on TV, get up!
Now this is it.
This guy is talking straight, that one just left.
Pen or insult, what do you say, man?
I finally figured out how to get there.
Oh my God, get out, audience!
Wrap and turn.
He rolled away from me.
He is an accelerator.
We've lost it now, great.
Sweet
Shut up, don't you dare decide, I'm the man of the house, I make the decisions.
We remove doubt with certainty.
Majid Abdulrahman Al-Subaij
The name, the name, the name of God, God sleeps on this wealth, you are generous, God bless you.
I built a house in Subayj.
I bought a record in my name, la la la, he doesn't want to live in Andy's house.
I just want to make an investment.
Give good above, may God bless your generosity, may God keep you.
Gather, oh crowd, what do you desire?
May God protect you, and may He bless you with generosity.
Come on, everyone, let's have some coffee together.
May God keep you safe. You don't have a clue. You don't order anything. May God bless you.
Are you sure? That's good. I wanted to embarrass us with the cabaret.
May God protect us.
Mom, Mom, I'm here, Mom.
Now your dad, what's he going to do to us, we have no idea.
I didn't mean to, Mom.
Please, mother, don't tell father.
Your father is turning the house upside down.
He's definitely going to kill you right now.
Mom, I swear, I didn't break it, it was the workers.
Zain, mama, why don't we go get some glue and stick it?
We stick it on, mom.
Where can we find another like her? I have no idea; your uncle, where did he get her from? He brought her as a gift.
By God, I'm afraid of him for you.
Mom, I'm scared dad's gonna hit me.
Slam the door on your way out; I'll figure out a solution to this matter.
Oh my, hurry up and go to your room!
# My Uncle, My Uncle, My Uncle My uncle, you're my uncle.
My uncle broke the vase, my uncle.
Mom, Walid is not coming with us.
No, mom, nothing's happening over there.
He fled from home, scared of his father.
It's a sin, mother, have mercy on the boy.
Oh my god, this is not proper upbringing. May God guide you.
What do I do now, mom?
I don't know how to act.
I don't know, but I'm afraid for him because of the cars on the street.
God willing, he is protected. I think he might have gone to the shop or gone to the neighbors' house to play with the kids.
I swear, Walid is so cute and kind, and he's so lovable, oh my!
Mama, take refuge in Allah from Satan and do not worry, God willing, only good will come.
Oh my God, mom, goodbye.
Where is Walid?
My dad is going to kill me.
Grandma, dad is killing me with his beating.
Don't be afraid, my dear.
My love, do not be afraid.
I won't let him raise a hand against you.
I broke, despite my resistance.
Come, my dear father, come. Have a little warm water and rest in my room.
Your face is turning yellow.
May God guide him, oh may God guide him. Come here, my dear, come here.
Oh God, the Most Generous.
I'm afraid my dad will come here.
Enough, dad, don't worry.
No one should interfere with my child's upbringing.
This is my son, and I'm raising him the way I see fit.
It's a sin for a child to stutter and tremble, terrified of something he didn't do. Oh, no!
Why doesn't he have eyes?
Let him open.
The bag accidentally knocked over the vase, I swear he didn't mean it.
You, you have to defend him.
You shouldn't say anything to him for my sake, forgive him this time, the boy is pitiful with fear.
He's nowhere to be found. What's keeping him here at this hour?
I don't have it here.
Where are you?
Take a shower inside, please.
Lala Boudiha is my brother's right today.
Okay, if you bring a different one, not the initial one.
Let's go, let's take a picture, man, we want to play.
You're saying they're studying.
Dad, just this one game, and then we'll go study.
Why don't you have an exam tomorrow?
Hey dad
Alright, dad, go away, don't ruin it for us.
Go on, dad, enough, don't make a fuss, go, go, dad, we'll start studying, we'll start.
What the hell is this? Go and see for yourself.
If you don't, I'll call Mr. Walid right now.
La la la, don't tell my uncle, don't tell my uncle, don't tell my uncle.
I don't care about you.
I tell him, "Don't you listen?"
Oh my, let's see everyone grab their books and study.
Alright dad, put your phone in your pocket, we're going to study now, dad. Alright, don't tell uncle.
Oh my god, Mom, I'm so confused, I don't know how to act.
I'm afraid he'll cause trouble if he finds out.
"He'll definitely ask me why I took him to the hospital."
Okay, what's wrong with that if you told him?
If he finds out that Walid is with Ibol, he'll kill him.
Oh my god, he's the reason for all of this.
Oh my god, this is affecting my mental health.
The boy is not small now, he is twelve years old.
"It's okay, Mom."
Let's have lunch together, mom. I'll hint to him.
I need
Her mother is going to Bahrain to buy abayas.
Mom, she's a pillar and a need.
Wow, what a thrill!
Every night he says he sees a ghost in his bed.
I always wet the bed every night and you never tell me the story.
He has to be taken to the hospital so they can treat him.
Realha asala ma 3atda salfa.
It escapes them nothing.
His words are true.
I need to take you to the hospital, mom, so they can see what's wrong.
Wide open his mouth, dry as a bone, just right.
# The Last One in the Neighborhood to Hear the Screams He was the last one in the neighborhood to hear the screams.
Stay seated.
Eat, my mother, eat.
I won't say anything.
I'll take a quick shower and bring you some clothes. Let's go!
Please, I beg you.
I need to educate them.
You don't interfere, you.
This is what we call success.
And eternity of forty-nine out of fifty.
This is a success.
Their grades are good.
Beware, you're doomed if you don't bring fifty out of fifty.
Please, don't take them to your brother's place.
You need to behave.
These are my children.
Alright, uncle, I swear, this is the last time.
Why not bring fifty from fifty, fifty from fifty?
Zayda waḥda.
I tell him not to go with us to public places.
Yesterday we went to the hospital, they let us in and told him, "You can't go in, it's none of your business."
You're going by yourself, don't come with us.
Shut up, you fool! I'll teach him a lesson.
I'm dying, uncle, I'm dying, I'm dying, I'm dying, I'm dying, uncle, this is the last time, I'm dying, I'm dying.
Let me teach you a lesson, damn it.
Be careful, this is not a joke, we will see who gets fifty at the end of the year.
By the poolside.
I'm afraid

Call, call the owner who's in the same class.
I saw him at the school gate.
Call me, call me, maybe I'm going to my grandmother's house.
I won't go there.
Where did he go? Where did he disappear to?
There is no power or might except with Allah.
Dude, what's wrong with this kid?
Hey, you're definitely going to fail, and you're scared of your parents.
You damn fool, may God guide you, the boy is outstanding and ranked second in the class.

Nuclear energy.
Sixty percent of the world's oil reserves.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia leads the global reserves with twenty-four percent.
Libya, the United States, and Nigeria.
3% for each of them, and the rest of the world combined with 15%.
And then
As well as from production.
Perhaps this is one of the secrets and reasons for the scramble for this region and its countries by the major industrial powers.
The United States, the world's largest consumer of oil energy, leads the way.
Oil prices are continuously on the rise.
Simultaneously, there was a decline in the value of the dollar.
The unit that is used for oil pricing.
The price of a barrel reached yesterday
This has led to an increase in the revenues of producing countries, and at the same time
To increase the inflation therein.
Inflation in some of those countries has reached fifteen percent.
The most important source of energy in the world.
In the prices of life and goods.
"This was during a direct dialogue with the Deputy Prime Minister."
Minister of Energy and Industry of Qatar
Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah
For our viewers who wish to participate, they can contact us on the program's numbers and phone lines.
Hello, deputy.
I'd like to start with you on the unprecedented prices that oil has reached.
Where could prices go?
Of course, where prices could go is a perplexing question.
He, or what is known as the market force.
OPEC is not [the] end.
She is not a producing country.
The producing countries, the producing countries and OPEC have no influence on oil pricing.
Is it the relationship solely between price and supply and demand?
There is no demand now, not even supply and demand has a significant impact.
What are the factors, then?
In other factors, besides supply and demand
What is attractive to investors?
They felt immense pressure and turned to oil and gold, or what is known as commodity marketing.
Investors have lost confidence in stock markets.
# The Golden Opportunity And gold, too.
We witnessed gold's rise from $350 in recent years to its current price of $970.
He still owes me about a hundred and nine dollars, as I mentioned.
But they all increased, and if they decrease slightly
Let me remind you that in the first quarter of this year
The second quarter is supposed to see a decrease in prices due to the low demand for oil.
We saw the market in a fascinating and strangely changing state.
In the second quarter, at the beginning of spring, it rises above $100.
However, this implies that the previous factors that determined the price surge during winter and consumption have now shifted, and there are other influencing factors at play.
Economic growth and development
At the same time, we observe that oil prices are rising to such an extent.
I discussed political factors and stated that political tensions play a role in this matter.
Iran should expect Fallon's resignation in light of the political complexities.
# Breaking News: Her statement made headlines in most American newspapers and the global press today. It could impact oil prices.
100% yeah yeah today yeah
Today, we live in an era of globalization, and influence comes swiftly.
# Possible Unreal Factors Affecting
They create a kind of disturbance in the market.
Also created a kind of political rumor.
He said there is no plan, but he did not deny that other options for Iran are also possible.
Always the ptarmigan reacts with the markets.
Of course, now it's not certain that America is at war with Iran.
I am one of those who do not see this scenario as meaningful.
# فالون It might be and there might be something we haven't seen yet. What will it be like in the future?
We are the ones who work in the energy sector.
We see that all these political tensions
The oil supplies in the world.
There is a very comfortable supply, on the contrary.
What indicates that there is oil going into storage?
There is never any shortage of oil supplies.
Perhaps preparing for the upcoming war.
In light of this reassuring picture you paint about supply, stating that there are no obstacles in the supply chain, ...
In the event that President Bush and the United States decide to execute their plan,
This is something else.
Prices are soaring to record-breaking levels.
Oil price may reach
We are one of the world's largest oil reserves.
You are here, this is here for today, the Gulf represents the most important.
In addition to Iraq, Iran, and the other Gulf states.
They represent over sixty percent of the oil reserves today, which is definitely a lot.
You today.
If a very minor accident occurs.
Therefore, it indicates.
# War and Oil Prices The implication is that, in the event of any war on Iran, it means that oil prices cannot be guaranteed to what extent they can reach.
God knows, it might arrive today. We arrived without it.
Wars for a hundred and seven dollars, a hundred and ten dollars, and it might jump to a hundred and ten. God knows best.
Today, oil, as I told you, is experiencing psychological and political tensions.
Speculators exploited these tensions.
I'm only invested in oil.
I am an investor, of course, in real terms. No, it's future purchasing or futures marketing.
Petroleum paper
These are all speculations on paper in the oil market.
His entire production is approximately three hundred thousand barrels, that's it or less.
Perhaps these will push for more purchases and then for more rises.
I hope April Fools' Day is an April Fools' joke.
I hope there isn't any
Jenny is coming to the region, and it is said that this is on his main agenda.
Jelly is the owner of this project, as many politicians and media personalities have stated.
I had no idea what was in Jelly's bag.
I cannot predict what it will mean.
Will he ignite a war?
America is in a transitional phase.
Why doesn't the son do something else?
Let's see what happens if we talk about April, as April is very close, it's just a few weeks away, and we'll be in April soon.
The world may pay.
America is a major consuming nation.
In the Gulf countries.
The Gulf will be the tough number.
You cannot dial this number.
The production costs are cheap.
Comparison with West African countries, most of which rely on...
The Gulf, no other country in the world can.
We've heard this talk from them in the West and the United States for many long years.
"Good idea to seek help."
To etc. and the Caspian Sea War, remember the story, and
No matter what these dreams may be.
When you sit with the close ones in a closed circle.
You hear them speaking in a different manner.
What are they saying?
# Supply, the Significance of the Region,
Why is it that I asked one of the European officials, saying, "It's strange that you speak to us in closed-door meetings during the Hajj"?
I speak a different language than the one you use in front of others.
He or she said no for political reasons.
Of course, there's also something called the "double standard" or "double-edged sword."
The cup that everyone knows is the role of the Gulf countries.
Saudi Arabia is of great importance today, for example Qatar.
The largest producer and exporter of oil in the world.
Enter into
Despite all this.
Leader of the Central Sector
Let the war on Iran begin.
Even if it's an aerial war or an air strike, as they say.
The supplies
You are not late, you are extremely kind.
I don't agree with you, we're not in the same boat.
We don't deal with Westerners either.
We deal with America.
Where are the good prices?
Regardless of the nationality of this market.
**نَضَع** means *non-renewable energy*.
For the sake of (generosity)
Arab generosity
Please go ahead and give it to me.
The observers state that the real price of oil is
The reason for the rise in oil prices is...
You Gulf countries, OPEC, and the states.
You are very generous with Americans, insisting on sticking to their currency.
You said the price of oil should be seventy dollars.
The real price is sixty to seventy in exchange for the falling dollar.
Okay, now the price is one hundred.
109 because the dollar dropped 35%.
Now it's over a hundred dollars.
If we consider the ratio and proportion.
No one denies it.
One of the main reasons is
Comparison with the depreciating dollar.
If we take, if we take
If we take this comparison
Oil prices
The United States of America
Of course, it's in our best interest at the present time for the dollar to decline.
The U.S. cannot revive its weak or stagnant economy.
So, what happened during this period of economic weakness and stagnation?
You too have become.
United States cuts interest rates on the dollar.
Why do you insist on pegging oil prices to the dollar?
Let's talk about why oil prices are pegged to the dollar.
The first one over a hundred years.
The first export of a barrel of oil originated from the United States of America.
Issued in USD.
I became, since the beginning of the 20th century until today
Pricing the dollar Oil pricing in dollars
Historically, it has become
For a hundred years, the whole world has been interacting and reacting.
Norway is now the third largest oil-producing country.
Oil is its source.
Russia is the second largest oil exporter.
North Sea oil production in Europe
Sells in dollars, not priced in.
Everything is changing in the world, there are other sources and information pointing to something else other than this.
You, the Gulf states,
There are secret agreements between you and the Americans.
Oil became the real cover
Is this statement correct and is there any truth to it?
These agreements are indeed...
The agreement is that oil remains the cover for the dollar, in exchange for the United States protecting these regimes.
This is not correct, and there are no secret agreements.
Let's not take OPEC today.
You have sixty-six percent of the deputy's support.
I am thirteen countries.
# OPEC's Share: Forty Percent of the Eighty-Five Barrels # OPEC's Share: 40% of the 85 Barrels
There are many large countries in terms of oil production.
Out of OPEC
What are the barriers to pricing in another currency?
Take a look, I'll do it for another price.
Not all adults when they decide.
You are Saudi Arabia and the major Gulf states.
Today is the OPEC meeting as a whole.
There are sixty percent.
Even if, hypothetically, OPEC wanted to.
There is an agreement among all oil-exporting countries to
There is a tendency or an intention to change.
What's the attempt?
However, these countries are not currently able to change the pricing currency.
Unless there is an agreement between
What is the effect of Tared?
Let me speak now, I mean, about the Europeans.
Why don't they export their oil?
I sail from the North Sea, Russia, or Norway, accepting euros or rubles.
Their currency is expensive, high, and elevated, which is in their interest.
On the contrary. No, on the contrary.
Here is their loss.
One euro imports one and a half barrels.
You are the real losers, your currency has dropped because it's pegged to the dollar.
He's also losing, a huge loss.
The currency's connection here in the Gulf is a historical one.
You remember in the 1970s, the dollar was the strongest currency in the world.
You're now connected, why do you talk about disengagement?
This is like marriage; once you get married, [there's] no turning back.
As you come with divorce, divorce is not easy.
No, here.
Or you're doing a casual deal with the dollar.
You must study the costs in a methodical manner.
To study professionally and study with
Kuwait also depegged 25% of its currency from the dollar.
Saudi Arabia Bahrain United Arab Emirates Qatar
You may adjust your currency rate.
Today, regarding the topic, but it means that you have no intention of studying or considering it.
The study, of course, differs. His Excellency the Prime Minister has stated.
The Wall Street Journal stated that the Qatari currency is undervalued by approximately two percent.
You are included in this study.
We don't intend to keep this matter exclusive to you.
Kuwait stands alone. Why don't you follow its lead?
Economists say it is more profitable for countries and their people than a loss.
We are, though.
Nothing else but this.
The four Gulf states declare...
Everyone means believer.
I am personally one of those who support him.
She will support it.
You must be included in this study.
By itself, B.
We were created from one state or two.
Until the time of the currency arrives.
You won't grasp the upcoming situation.
This is of course, there are specialists who will study it.
They will be the same owners.
We're not specialists; this requires a political decision.
Let's wait and not rush now. Look at what happens today.
People started, you know.
Of course, in a complicit position.
The deputy's efforts mean that the inflation rate in Qatar reached fourteen percent in 2007 and will increase to fifteen percent in the coming year.
# Consumes People's Salaries Devours the wages of the workers here, the salaries of the employees here.
The salaries of people residing in Qatar have been eroded by thirty-five to forty percent.
We're back with you after a short break to find out the extent of the increases that will be made to salaries.
Staff in Qatar will remain at least for the upcoming period, so stay with us.
Welcome back, without limits, to this episode where we host the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy.
The Qatari industry Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah on the huge price increase.
The oil [industry] has generated revenues of tens of billions of dollars for the Gulf countries and the producing nations.
# Oil and the Anticipated Salary Increase My question revolves around the upcoming salary increase for employees. However, before this increase, I would like to provide you with some important information.
The UAE has 97.8 out of 10 billion in reserves and ranks 6.2 out of 10.
# Kuwait Times Economic Report Revenues of Gulf States among the largest
Saudi Arabia's expected revenues for the year 2008 are $190 billion.
And it was.
70 and 170 in the past year, the UAE 66 this year, expected 57 and 70.
Kuwait sixty-four and it was fifty-four.
One twenty-one percent of oil minus five fifty-five billion.
I am the gas, as other reports say. God forbid, no envy. I don't get envious, oh messenger of the deputy.
Iraq forty-seven billion.
1.5 trillion
# Spending Aspects It amounted to one and a half trillion dollars.
The Gulf states imported one trillion dollars.
$1 was the cost of various imports.
# **Exploitation in the United States: $300 Billion**
Nine out of ten billion.
Three percent in Bahrain.
# 2007 In 2007, Oman had 6.5%, which will increase to 7%. # Qatar In Qatar, it was 13.57%, and it will rise to 58.12%.
Those living in Qatar should brace themselves for further increases in the prices of goods, commodities, and the cost of living.
Life is being devoured, and prices have soared to unprecedented heights. More to come in Qatar.
We empathize with everyone.
You must be treated.
# Inflation Control and Management The aim is to control and manage inflation.
We're going to increase salaries by fifty percent.
They say you're against the salary increase.
This is not true and it's in a cup.
# Ministers Against Salary Increases
There is a problem and the solution must be the optimal one.
There is no quick fix solution.
Fine, there's a balance between the two.
Sure, here is the translation: This is it.
The crucial thing is to tackle inflation.
We are here in Qatar in the committee.
His Highness the Amir issued a decree to form it.
And you put.
Lay and place mean rules.
Strong enough to solve the problem and control inflation.
It is crucial to control inflation first.
# Inflation
Ah, well, if you don't get a hold of him.
Be the deputy's messenger now.
Specialist in market accounting published at the end of last February just a few days ago.
Let them in.
Now you're going to get stuck with inflation and let inflation devour these people's incomes.
Many of them are here now.
Income to other countries.
Raise our salaries, then I'll deal with inflation and bring them down again.
I say, the talk, the talk that they are saying is the parallel in the subject.
But now
# Temporary Fix #
The problem increases in a much greater manner.
Therefore, here it is.
The attempt to curb inflation from one limit to another.
Boredom will always prevail.
In the past year, the increase was tremendous.
The apical point. The apical point.
Those who work with the government as well as those who work in the private sector.
The private sector is completely neglected.
The issue of this increase must also be considered fairly.
I have no idea where I got these notes from.
We're living in Qatar, not Germany, where the deputy lives.
I tell you, on the contrary, today the private sector has started to pay.
Most of it
Many Qataris who worked in the public sector have moved to the private sector.
Due to the high salaries.
He is facing a problem.
I transition to the private sector because it is vibrant and dynamic.
He offers good salaries.
We are associated with what is known as the market force.
He is driven by market forces.
They do not come with highly specialized skills.
They don't come to Qatar because Qatar is less attractive, with lower salaries or lower costs.
They come for the costs.
Okay, with our full understanding.
I am not anticipating events, nor am I saying that there will be a salary increase.
There's no hope, then.
"To control this inflation."
Let's give each other some time.
Control this inflation.
Insha'Allah, this is what the report says that Qatar is in 2008.
Inshallah, let's say I
We expect these numbers to change.
Bribe the people a little bit.
This is a professional process.
Sure, with professionalism and all that.
I am inflation.
We're spending too much.
Big on different projects.
Let me share some questions from the viewers, and I hope each one is asked directly. Abdelaziz Mohamed M. from Morocco: Your question, brother Abdelaziz.
This matter is based on the assumption that ruling families in the Gulf...
I don't think the justification for that is the lack of OPEC agreement.
Secondly, all oil revenues go directly to the ruler.
The ruling family receives a portion, and the rest is allocated for development.
In the absence of accountability, the situation will remain as it is.
Peace be upon you and God's mercy.
Welcome, brother Ahmed.
I am your brother, I won't prolong the conversation. My brother mentioned the issue of the ruling systems and the matter of pegging the riyal or the Gulf currencies to the dollar.
America wants to globalize the world under its banner.
The US trade deficit with China reached $82 billion.
The European Union reached $80 billion with him.
This means that all global policy directions are flowing against the dollar.
We are paying the price for this now as Arab countries and oil-rich Gulf states.
He may end up facing America.
Between the first world countries such as China, Russia, and others, the matter may become...
Military, pure and simple.
The explosion of Chinese bombs, Russian bombs, Japanese bombs, and even American bombs.
Thank you very much for this clarification and information.
Your question, Muhammad.
Hello, your question is welcome.
Could you lower the TV volume and ask your question?
Are you asking me?
The only thing I see is that the deputy is determined not to cooperate.
Subject: Decoupling from the dollar as it's on the decline
He will, God willing, fall to the depths.
He is a good man.
They should not follow the style of the Arab brothers.
Thank you, brother Mohammed. Thank you, thank you. And here is the last intervention from Ahmed Hassan from Qatar. Your question, Ahmed.
May God greet you with goodness.
Thank you, and you did not hold back during the pleasant interview.
Salary increase, God willing, things will get better. It's not clear who or what "he" refers to.
We're all facing problems, not just with salaries.
Salaries, God willing, things will work out.
Let me quickly answer your question.
I'm dropping the call, you have a question?
All of them are cheap, the whole range is imported goods.
I'm a European outsider.
Okay, we have the entire Arab world, which has factories and laboratories.
# Translation: Thank you, Ahmed. I appreciate your time.
The issue of rising prices is an important one.
# The Wolf's Case with the Poor Guys Stay with the poor guys, my friend. The deputy is on their side.
The original is poor here, who doesn't have a billion.
Here, we're like some brothers, of course.
Those who don't know Qatar.
This is not correct for the State of Qatar.
Today, when you come to Qatar, you will see what the main indicators are.
# Economic Growth Indicato
# Highest Growth Indicators in the World
The forest trembles, where are you going? What will you do with it?
What is it within the framework of responding to him?
He spoke in a way that was not genuine or realistic; the brother from Morocco expressed himself in an unrealistic manner.
The person who does not see beyond his own nose.
If the person who is meant to be here comes and sees Qatar, he will witness its tremendous developments.
Growing rapidly, you are indeed asking.
All have the right.
Will you, the locals, recruit people from here?
Actually, will you, for example, import, say, a surplus from China, say?
We won't import, God willing, and...
The state is built on a plan and a

To be the State of Qatar.
She is considered one of the greatest historical achievements in the Arab world.
Today also for them.
# **LTL Focus On**
What will have an impact on it.
# Post-Oil and Gas Era
I don't give birth to Dubai, man.
Every country has its own unique characteristics.
We, in the State of Qatar, have focused on education.
# Essential Elements
There is a medical city here where people can receive treatment.
The Media City will be a hub that embraces [something].
Of course, today is the world day. Today, we must build.
We build a vision.
# Post-Oil and Gas Era
There were fatal mistakes.
There was unfortunately a huge opportunity, but we didn't seize it because a surprise came our way.
We were not prepared for it, neither in terms of human resources, nor technologically, nor educationally.
Today, I've changed after thirty years.
Also, the most important thing.
I am here today, a bird here in my imagination.
Vision and sight.
Vision and sight.
Thank you very much for the efforts of the deputy. I also thank you, our esteemed viewers.
We hope that our follow-up was satisfactory and that we have been able to provide you with the necessary information.
Qatar's foreign policy appears vague to many observers.
Qatar enjoys distinctive relations.
In the time when Qatar maintained relations with Israel, and still does.
Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas
Qatar has presented.
She began.
The largest Arab country.
What enraged the regime in Egypt.
I arrived in Qatar full of anger, even accusing it of conspiring against Egypt.
Qatar was not far from important files.
Darfur in Sudan, the Houthis in Yemen, and even the Israeli soldier, a captive.
# Qatar's Foreign Policy Reach: A Cause for Arab Discontent The reach of Qatar's foreign policy has extended to a point that has angered the larger Arab states.
What is the force that places you in this position?
I am one of these achievements.
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani
They can write to us via our website www.aljazeera.net.
Your Excellency Sheikh, welcome.
On the twenty-second of September in the year two thousand and seven to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
The visit was a turning point in the relations between the two countries, at least in recent years.
Redrawing the borders
Wash off the stains.
This is what I mentioned.
# Newspaper or Magazine: Al-Haqaz
The agreement you reached with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, through which relations were restored and the Saudi ambassador returned.
To Doha
In the beginning, your introduction was lengthy and required many answers, even without your last question.
I believe I carried it.
"Especially regarding the topic of Saudi Arabia."
What is flour?
Saudi Arabia is an important country for Qatar.
There is a connection between the two countries.
I spoke about silencing Al Jazeera.
I spoke about a revolutionary movement.
I believe these matters have been clarified by both parties.
We accepted the clarification.
In the State of Qatar
# Conflict with Saudi Arabia
He was always confined within a limited scope.
Views.
Praise be to Allah, and this is the wisdom of the two leaders.
King Abdullah and His Royal Highness the Prince.
There is a significant presence in the Gulf.
Over a hundred years.
She always had bright, honorable, and trustworthy relationships.
I want to attribute it to a misunderstanding between the two parties.
This topic has been resolved, and there were no conditions.
In solving any issue.
However, there was an understanding, and there was a sincere intention from both parties.
To resolve this pending issue.
The situation is not seasonal but rather a strategic relationship.
We wish for it to not just endure but to evolve.
Beautiful diplomatic speech.
Until Saudi Arabia withdraws its ambassador from Qatar.
I've never been one to beat around the bush, or else I'd have avoided many problems.
I always stood by my beliefs.
Saudi Arabia, and thus it is not diplomacy, but faith.
# The Topic of Al Jazeera Falls Under the Media Category
Between the two parties, and in many countries, a third party was introduced.
She believes she can ignite a conflict or gain points at the expense of other countries.
He's at the expense of Qatar.
He is at the expense of Saudi Arabia.
We must resolve the dispute within the Gulf family.
On the contrary to what was before.
He bowed in political agreement.
No, no, there was no agreement, only an agreement of love and an agreement of interest.
However, for anything that contradicts this, you should consult the Al Jazeera management. Have you built a strategy for promotion?
Keep a distance between you and Saudi Arabia to avoid what happened before.
The relationship was originally built on a close strategy.
Let's say it in one, two, three, four.
There must be unity.
I made some adjustments based on this foundation.
Among some Arab countries, we strive to settle other disputes.
If we observe the differences in the Arab world now, they are merely differences in perspectives.
When we have an opinion on a specific policy, a certain action, or a particular issue, and another country has a different opinion.
This is a matter of perspective.
Some observers thought you took pleasure in criticizing Saudi Arabia.
Criticizing her.
We were exhausted and decided to change our direction, so we headed to a bigger country, Egypt.
It's like the same, the same idea.
Lala, first of all, we are not enjoying ourselves, and we are not free.
We do not deal with any other party in this manner.
The dispute with Saudi Arabia has been resolved.
There's an understanding between them, and I know it.
Too big and you know we've founded.
There is a kind of model.
However, Saudi Arabia, however, however, Saudi Arabia.
Let me put this under two lines.
I started to pick a fight with Egypt's Al-Ahram newspaper in the April 10th issue last month.
Al-Jarida Al-Rasmiyya Al-Misriya
There is a comprehensive investigation. The extensive inquiries stated that ...
The Hezbollah network uncovered a destructive plot.
Egypt is targeted in a campaign involving three countries: Iran, Syria, and Qatar.
Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood
A well-known media figure known for his conspiratorial role.
Qatar is the smallest Arab country.
They conspire against Egypt.
We respect.
Struggle over the years.
I'm not saying it to disturb anyone's feelings.
I'll finish it for you.
We can do it.
The Egyptian president
Eager
# Arab Relations
First point.
Subject: Gaza
They say, and we acknowledge.
Qatar is a country.
She is petite.
You can participate in a scheme like this.
We suffered from the interference of other countries at some point, and I don't want to go back to that.
Who sold the interference of some countries in Qatar's affairs?
The policy of His Highness's government is therefore...
Now that they've discovered what they call a conspiracy,
Also, mentioning his name means that I want to say that every house has a lord who protects it. Syria and Iran defend themselves, and I won't defend them.
Settling down in Egypt
Why does Qatar want to change or intervene in a matter of this kind?
The pyramids do not speak without purpose.
Qatar's government has tried to undermine Egypt's role and its contacts with Turkey and the European Union.
I will organize a parallel conference to the Arab Summit, but not to steal the limelight.
You are using a biased media outlet, Al Jazeera channel.
Sure, go ahead.
With Hezbollah.
We're not comfortable, Miss.
I can tell you with confidence.
We are
We don't interfere in such circumstances.
Our brothers in Egypt were forced to do this, and this is what we hold the Egyptian officials accountable for.
# The Dispute or Sensitivity Among Some Members of the Egyptian Government
Some officials are allergic.
I don't understand.
I'm coming to you about the matter.
Those were the days of Fo'a's peace, the days of peace and if we were.
The conference was held in Egypt beforehand.
After that, it was held at our place.
Since Israel
We have a disagreement with her.
We have no dispute with Israel.
Now, since that day, the conference
Any Islamic conference, any Arab conference, they're both sensitive.
Why is there such sensitivity?
Do you sit with them and
Let me finish for you.
We always hope for the best.
This allergy we discovered.
O.K. three means
Gaza Conference that took place
Egypt doesn't want to hold it in Qatar.
I am not Arabic.
In Qatar, and I'm at the peak in Kuwait, we told them, "Hey, guys!"
The Palestinian people marched to strike.
Over two weeks.
We are the first to attend the Kuwait Conference, but we organize it before the scheduled conference.
People are being killed and
# Procrastination is Procrastination
The dispute seemed to begin.
No small state has halted this fight.
Of course, I know that some of the brothers in the government are also insulting Egypt, not just anyone else but Egypt.
When they said that after
Okay, you guys are on the island.
The Israelis reported that a day before, there was a meeting scheduled to stop the fighting before any speech or anything else.
What is
Brother, they brought in medicine and food during the bombardment while our brothers were being hit.
They say the gate is narrow.
Why are the trucks coming in?
They keep telling us there's an agreement on the other side, and they have to come.
Now is not the time to bring up Fatah or Hamas.
I don't care about Fatah or Hamas; what mattered to us were the one and a half million people who are being beaten.
They don't have any medication.
When we started discussing this matter and speaking at the Gaza conference
Qatar's involvement in this matter causes sensitivity for the regime in Egypt.
It's not interference.
We haven't discussed how Egypt is handling the situation, as it is within Egypt's jurisdiction.
One of the officials said, "We've uncovered a huge conspiracy behind this matter."
We still don't know what the conspiracy is.
We mean this official.
They tell us that Egypt is a great thing.
# Egypt, a Major Arab Nation Well, my friend, we understand that Egypt is a major Arab country, and we always say that Egypt is a great nation.
We always ask a lot from the great state.
For us, Egypt is...
You were also invited to the conference, which was provocative to them.
We were invited to the conference.
Aging Gaza
We coordinated, and our stance was unified.
People are suffering in Gaza.
No means no, I know Turkey brought things through Israel.
I'm so happy to see her enter through our brothers in Egypt.
We are of them and from them.
If Egypt wins or makes a good political move.
This is what we believe to be in our interest in Qatar and the interest of the Arab world.
Egypt's stability is important to us.
If she does a good job, that's important to us.
Let me finish, your question and introduction took up a quarter of an hour.
The issue you're talking about now has lost me.
I am telling you, I am telling you, I am telling you, I am angry right now.
I am angry at you because of the Egyptian officials' system.
We were the ones who failed the Doha summit.
The second thing is that they failed the Doha conference.
King Abdullah had wisdom, he wanted [something].
Wired wants to make amends.
Some countries therefore ban NN.
This is what I told our brother in Saudi Arabia, because we
We have no dispute with Saudi Arabia, not even on this point.
# The Edge, as it appears in an internal form.
Hey, hey, is there any of the officials around?
The higher-ups are at it again.
A large country with one responsible person can achieve what a small country with many workers can.
There, that was yours.
She can play any role.
Darfur is a part of Egypt's national security and Sudan.
The five major powers and
If it was any other country but Qatar, it would've been possible.
# Sensitivities like these only lead to an escalation. Why do you stick your nose into everything that is none of your business?
We want to get rid of the allergy, so we'll take anti-allergy medication. They tell us what the allergy is.
Why the sensitivity?
Some of the brothers in the government are...
They have an internal failure.
They want to divert attention, it's a conspiracy in Gaza, a coup.
Means, as the English say, blame the Italian.
Whatever happens.
Recipient for for not just for instructions for analytics
I don't know what happened, so I can't tell.
The issue must be addressed locally.
Are you treating?
I swear, my priority is my country.
My priority is to act first on matters that concern my country.
And then I'll see if I have enough time.
Consider issues of concern to the Arab nation.
Unless Qatar tried to mediate.
We think about every Arab issue in which we can contribute as much as possible.
Why are you being provocative? Why can't you take it in good faith?
I can't treat you.
I can explain my opinion.
Don't throw it at me.
We are we are we in our opinion.
He who springs from his heart.
Let me finish for you.
When the peace initiative was announced and the presidents gathered in Kuwait, we were filled with hope. I issued a statement welcoming this topic.
# في إملاءات In dictates
Of course, the Egyptian official who boasted about his heroism.
I won't respond to her in my article, I think it was in a TV interview or something.
I have a response to each point.
I am preserving the bare minimum of relations that bind us and connect Arab interests.
Also, responding to the call mentioned by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques,
But all I can advise is this and nothing else.
They try to rectify their mistakes, whether internally or externally.
In politics, economics, or any other field, just like we make mistakes in our political and economic decisions and strategies, no one is infallible.
They accuse Qatar of these accusations.
You deny any connection between Qatar and anything related to the Hezbollah cell.
This is a funny topic.
To distort Egypt's relations and undermine its role and connections with Turkey and the European Union.
We are first, we are few in number.
If we're capable of taking on this role.
This is incorrect.
You are personally accused.
To pay money to Shalit's captors so that Qatar takes Shalit and takes over the Egyptian role in this matter.
He always accuses us of paying first. We didn't pay anything, and we didn't talk to anyone about paying.
But this issue.
We support Egypt's resolution of the issue between the Palestinians, just as we supported Egypt, and we continue to support its resolution of this matter.
The Palestinian president will remain until this issue is resolved.
We were present and the first to support the State of Qatar.
The authority remains and the Palestinian institutions persist until the dispute is resolved.
And I said, "Take it."
The Arab League says no, we didn't pass it because we believe there are people who don't want this topic.
We navigated it intelligently.
Does he address his superior?
Prime Minister of hers.
Dude, I don't know, there seems to be a problem.
I'm from us, they're from them. I don't know.
They decided now, on the twelfth of April last year, Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper broke the news.
The political leadership in Egypt has decided to launch a news satellite channel to counter the media mouthpiece called Al Jazeera and put an end to [untranslatable]
All of these days will pass, and matters will come to an end and be settled.
We fear the island will become a thing of the past.
We are now experiencing political adolescence.
You stepped down for Saudi Arabia, and the Emir of Qatar met with the King of Saudi Arabia.
We did not give in, nor did they give in to us.
We dealt with them as brothers.
A small state yields to the great state of Egypt.
No, Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia at an important point to clarify.
Qatar's relations with Saudi Arabia differ.
So, and then we'll talk.
Qatar's relations with Egypt.
We have high hopes for it.
Let me be frank with you, is it time to part ways?
I disagree with the main policy.
# We have no personal dispute. I told you, we respect the Egyptian people.
If you asked me right now to name two problems, I'd say Gaza and...
This issue has affected us deeply.
We need to address this from a psychological perspective, to resolve this issue.
Post in some newspapers.
Foreign Minister
His Royal Highness Prince Saud Al-Faisal
We talked about everything.
It was clear that things had escalated and remained unresolved.
No, no, there was, there was, no, look.
I can't tell you that our relations with Egypt are good.
They have their grievances, and it's our duty as brothers to address them.
We have a complaint, and they have a right to it as our younger brothers.
We don't want to compare ourselves to any major power.
Egypt is larger than expectation.
It's not a matter of life and death, that's not what I mean, but for the solution to come from above.
We, on our part, if there's someone waiting to be pleased.
No one expects a style.
Qatar has
You deal with them not as equals but as brothers.
As a major country, yes, we are proud of Egypt as a major country.
But if someone deceives someone else.
This is me, I know Israel is tracking us.
The previous American political administration was with me or against me.
I believe they want to emulate neither Israel nor America in this matter.
And then they, too, if we take their policies as well, they are also under pressure from external forces.
In several matters, let me finish for you.
We also understand and know that there are still demands and instructions that come from even the greatest powers.
The dress code drives your politics.
We have no movement; one thing moved us.
The internal affairs of Qatar are our internal matter.
In any field where we can help in the Arab world, we will.
What are the sources of power for Al Udeid Air Base and Al Jazeera Channel?
You could say this is not strong enough.
Believing in God and our self-confidence.
O O Vision of His Highness the Prince
I don't want to upset anyone.
Let me finish for you, we don't want to disturb anyone.
We don't want to compete with anyone.
They can say whatever they want, Qatar the great or otherwise.
We have our own perspective.
We first expelled the Israeli ambassador, then we closed their embassy.
Glory be to God, first they said, "Close the office," so we closed it. They got upset and went to tell the Americans, "Look at these people."
They went and aligned themselves with the so-called Devil's team.
What are they saying?
Americans and Europeans, these are not our friends, and we know how to deal with them.
The intrigues
The efforts exerted
It's a shame we've reached this stage, and now what?
I am now ready.
What is your vision for resolving the issue with Egypt? (i) [First point] (ii) [Second point]
Egypt has a significant role in the Arab world.
We believe it's important to be informed about it.
I am certain that President Hosni Mubarak is keen on this.
But some of the crew
He needs to leave.
Occupying the Egyptian public opinion, governmental or otherwise, with trivialities.
Focus on Egyptian and Arab interests.
Are there any steps?
We're behind them, not in front of them, behind them, because they are a major power.
In the foreseeable future
By God, I mean, I think, this topic, I can't imagine how it will turn out.
I know a time will come for reason.
There comes a time for those, whether from us.
If I am
I am among them.
They are united by great Arab interests.
We will find one day that this topic is...
The world still has a long way to go.
I'm not going to be mad in the Egyptian style that you have.
If anyone extends their hand to us, we'll extend our arms a meter.
Now, His Excellency, the Sheikh.
We've never been used to running.
We're ready to run to Egypt, but only on a solid foundation.
Stand with Egypt.
There are many rumors now about Egyptians working in Qatar being affected by this issue.
There are contracts for Egyptians working in various positions, whether in small companies or major jobs.
Are you aware that Qatar does not typically engage in job cancellations and terminations?
These people have nothing to do with what's going on.
This is a market with a shift in demand, one is canceled, and another one comes in.
He is an offer and a demand, in some nationalities it decreased, in others it increased.
Okay, a quick answer.
The office was there.
We've caused trouble for the office, so we should leave now.
# The Itching Days When They Launched a Campaign That Every Loss in Negotiations with Israel Was Due to This Office
Hey, we've closed it. Let them resolve the issue with Netanyahu.
He was a guest.
We usually invite all accredited ambassadors in any foreign country.
# Invitation This is not an official invitation, but rather a gesture to honor Gabriela Schell.
No, by God, we haven't honored anyone before him when the relations were as good as they say. It's a bit difficult to honor her now.
There is no reason now to reopen the office during this period.
The office opens when there are no reasons.
You're the one who raised him.
As big as Egypt.
Egypt is the one who imposed this.
Our relationship with America is a strategic one. Let me be clear with you.
In some matters, this is the way it is.
The most important things are:
We had differences with the previous administration regarding the handling of certain issues in our region.
Now, we actually have great hope in the administration, especially with the steps taken by President Obama.
We believe there is a great hope that this administration will succeed.
Road in the V movement, a path to peace. Road in the solution of the Palestinian issue.
All our friends, and we deny it.
What happens in Iran, what is its impact on the Gulf and on you?
This is how Iranians decide to solve their issues.
Among themselves.
They'll overcome this crisis in their usual way, I'm sure.
Iran's stability, as His Highness the Prince mentioned.
It is vital for our region, the Gulf, and we share common borders with Iran.
We of course have distinguished relations with all our neighbors, including Iran.
We are a nation that strives for peace and stability in this region.
We would intervene whenever there was an attempt to alter or modify the Doha Agreement.
I thought that Saad Hariri said
The conversation about the strategic matters with the president has come to an end.
Among the Lebanese groups
How to see
Regarding Yemen, do you have a role or have the Yemenis taken a stand against you?
See first, we are known for supporting the unity when almost the entire Arab world was against the Yemeni unity.
We are the only Arab state, a Gulf state, that stood with the Yemeni unity.
Subject: The South. We have spoken with Yemen, and His Highness, the Prince, sent me twice to meet with His Excellency, the President of Yemen.
We explained to him that our goal is stability in Yemen because Yemen is an important country in the Arabian Peninsula.
He did not respect this agreement, and I do not want to say what each party has done.
But what really saddened me was
Qatar, which took this stance, is accused of paying money to the Houthis, and this is attributed to senior officials.
Yemenis, because we do not interfere in such matters.
He who stands with unity does not stand against it.
For another purpose, in the interest of Yemen, be it political, economic, or otherwise.
I'm shocked, but we don't have any objections to this topic.
I went more than ten times during the fighting days. His Highness, the Prince, sent me to Yemen among the Yemenis.
I'm sorry, this accusation is strange.
The time is up, but briefly, will these problems that you have encountered while trying to solve issues change your policy of intervening in other Arab problems?
By God, if only His Highness the Prince would listen to my advice, I truly believe it's unnecessary.
He once offered us a large sum.
Over five billion dollars at that time, if we had invested it, it would have become fifty billion. Better than a headache.
I'll just say it, and I believe it, because maybe the time in the Arab world now means...
What is allowed here under these circumstances?
"Thank you very much, Your Excellency, Sheikh."
# The Exceptional State of Sheikh Hamad Or perhaps even the exceptional state of Sheikh Hamad.
When the agreement was reached in Doha.
How did the Doha miracle happen?
To empower the committee and provide it with all the support.
# Lebanon: Post-Israeli Invasion
There was an Arab consensus.
We went to New York and managed to make the decision somewhat balanced.
We noticed in Doha that both parties were keen.
We tried as hard as we could not to listen to him or be there.
We knew the committee, we knew.
Face reality and know what the problem is after we spent hours with the Lebanese.
We believe it is a shared success.
But there was insistence.
I believe that Lebanon's problems are directly reflected by the atmosphere in the region.
Whether peaceful or non-peaceful.
Lebanon is destined for this location.
Let it be so.
Unfortunately.
External reverberations.
I can say that the problem among Lebanese people, even if there is a problem, is not the number one issue.
# Behind the Scenes I know, perhaps it's not too early yet to talk about the backstage, but...
What happened? Why did you come here?
You, so to speak, halted the engagement on the ground.
You didn't arrive a moment too late.
What exactly was going on, I know very well, even the Lebanese leaders at that time were telling me what happened.
No, I was from the beginning.
When I spoke to His Highness
We said to him, "If we go to Lebanon."
I am putting forward this idea, His Highness has endorsed and supported it.
All Lebanese leaders should be present.
I look at everyone in their own neighborhood because you are here in Beirut.
You are staying at the same hotel and in the same place.
On the same flight, you met and talked.
We created this atmosphere, but from the beginning, we had a plan.
This was the most important decision of all.
Of course, in Cannes.
This is what I've noticed from the Arab League.
We will be impartial mediators.
Alhamdulillah, I believe this has proven to everyone that Qatar has made an effort.
Both parties must
To reach a dignified solution for both parties.
There is no single loser solution.
Before you take your next step.
We consulted at the Arab League and found support.
We did it.
I told him in his language, and we were there.
If we succeed in Lebanon, we'll move them to Doha.
He told me to be careful.
Lock them in, take away their phones, and remove all distractions.
We managed to bring them there, and the brothers in Syria were also supportive of the position.
I told you from the beginning that without the Arab support, the committee wouldn't have been able to accomplish anything.
They wanted to know why they wanted the solution.
I believe the situation in Lebanon and the escalation that occurred.
This tension.
There is tension in Somalia. There is tension in Sudan.
There are several issues surrounding the Arab world.
We extinguished every fire.
It is in the interest of the Arab world to avoid external interventions.
I'll try my best to be there.
Sends troops.
Even if militarily.
In moments like these, I believe in the subject.
At Sheikh's Point
He always said to solve the Lebanese side and the Lebanese file.
Coincidental Saudi-Syrian agreement.
b qāf qāf If it is correct, qāf 'arab means Qatar and the Arab League.
Can what happened in Lebanon lead to a serious reconciliation between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Syria?
In the Arab world, we need to review ourselves.
Because of Arab differences.
Any agreement between two Arab states.
And this we have tried.
# Chapter 1 In the war of seventy-three.
When Arabs agree to solve an issue.
I believe this is in my interest.
Saudi Arabia and Syria have a significant role in Lebanon.
The two parties
They prevail with wisdom.
Arab relations are on the right track.
We face immense and significant challenges in the Arab world.
Everyone plays in our yard.
We are helpless and powerless.
How do we stop the game in the Arab world arena?
As Arabs, we should at least have a minimum level of agreement.
Unfortunately, we're complaining.
We are spectators.
# Arab Disunity and Lack of Trust Our lack of agreement as Arabs and the absence of trust between us, Arabs, has resulted in a profound loss of confidence among the Arab states.
And then the Arab countries.
# Betrayal, not treason
The session, what is the session called?
This issue requires a stand from everyone, I believe.
Will you materialize this wish? Will you actually demand an Arab summit?
We grieve when he grieves and rejoice when he rejoices.
I just said it, no big deal.
Can you play a role in repairing the situation between Damascus and Riyadh, even if it's unofficial?
We're eager to find solutions, and I'm certain that with their wisdom, we will.
They might reach an understanding.
They discuss many issues among themselves.
He was in harmony with the politics, and I'm sure, God willing, this is it.
Relationships are improving.
He needs both parties to want to take a step forward.
I can't say for certain that this is what's happening now.
I am certain that if Arabs focused on resolving the disputes between Arab countries and the problems of some Arab states that I mentioned,
I am in a state of optimism and a state of pride as a citizen, as there is an awakening across the Arab world.
I can't connect the dots on what happened in Lebanon.
On the ground, it can be translated as an Israeli-Palestinian escalation.
There is an escalation, perhaps American-Iranian, maybe other issues too.
Do you still fear it in the coming months?
We, as Arabs.
We can only order food and medicine delivery.
Electricity for the people.
We in Qatar are always ready, Your Highness.
Over one hundred and fifty million Palestinians are under siege.
We don't want them to have weapons, we don't want them to be victorious, and we don't want...
They do all this.
We are electricity.
We will give it, God willing, to the Red Cross organization to deliver it to the Palestinians.
We brought food and medicine to the Palestinians.
We continue to disagree with them.
I urge the Palestinians on both sides to put national interest first.
They leave illusions behind.
The ongoing Palestinian rift is a deep wound.
Solve it.
They did not and they did not comply.
This is a serious matter, they must abide by the Mecca Agreement.
They must request that even if they go again to Mecca or to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
They should resolve this dispute.
They won't benefit.
Why promises from which side?
I wish there was a solution, but I'm not sure.
Our position is well-known on this matter, and we have conveyed it to all concerned parties.
We will not be a party and will not accept being a party to any military conflict with Iran.
We have good relations with her.
We are a sovereign state, and they are a sovereign state too.
Everyone looks out for their own interests, but these interests will not harm them or us.
We believe that the Gulf's destiny is to have a clear agreement between the GCC countries.
Iran is committed to cooperation and peaceful coexistence with its neighbors.
When Sheikhdom states that Qatar is not a party.
Any details or clarification?
Just a hint.
No, never.
# Lebanese File Okay, I'd like to return to the Lebanese file, please.
In all honesty, the Sheikh's state, we were facing a major blockage, and in the last hours, we reached a solution.
There are those who linked what happened to what was announced.
Maybe it's information that might be scattered, unrelated to each other, but what happened?
We arrived at this conclusion.
I know Istanbul had specific dates set beforehand.
Oh, if only you knew about the negotiations.
Continuously working on the solution in the topic of...
There's no doubt that the support of the Kingdom is extremely important.
Change the negotiation tactics.
The negotiations led to
We reached a positive outcome by bringing together various parties from different backgrounds.
We started talking.
In this, there is an Arab and national orientation with this paper.
Tell me what's wrong with this paper.
We started talking about the substance, one after the other.
In the very last moment, the final obstacle was overcome.
But the prince passed through the outskirts.
We removed this obstacle.
I was in a solution.
We heard the word Emir of Qatar in the opening session in Doha.
Do you not think that your role now is
See, the most important thing is to keep this matter away from the spotlight.
We have no regional ambitions.
We will surely gain control over a country or something, because we are a powerful nation.
Our size, we are proud of ourselves, yes, we believe that we can contribute to solving matters with our other brothers.
But in the Arab world, it is very important.
In NVI countries
We want her to do this, and it's very important.
Some small states are empowered to take on this role and are supported in doing so.
Some things are excellent, some are good, and some are less than good.
# Last Question Country of the Sheikh.
What is the central priority?
Is it a political priority?
Amna is striving for reconciliation.
What is the biggest challenge facing Israel?
We're stopping the game in the Arab arena.
We fix our problems in the Arab world.
I am an active member in Iraq.
To improve the situation.
Regionally and internationally.
If we put our heads together.
We have no hope for any victory ahead of us.
Thank you, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, for this emotional interview.
The international efforts exerted to put an end to the ongoing war on Gaza.
Let's begin with your request to convene a meeting of the Arab League Council at the
Ministerial, as if you had overlooked it.
Urgent request for an extraordinary Arab summit.
In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. First of all, I'm happy, Hassan, to be a part of this program.
Even if the circumstances
Humanity that our brothers in Gaza are exposed to.
Circumstances require us to do a lot.
Qatar has not ruled out the Arab summit.
We actually went with the idea of the Arab Summit beforehand.
United, not only by a UN Security Council resolution, but also through
Never be trampled on and underestimated.
Let me put it in another sentence.
We're teaching them a lesson.
The Arab street can no longer bear it if we, as officials, cannot bear it either.
He is not responsible.
When we were in Cairo
There were ten to eleven written approvals.
Some of them spoke during the meeting, and we could have held the meeting.
We complicate it as much as there is Arab consensus.
I don't blame those who think that there might be a meeting where they can have a look.
Oops, I've solved the problem. How?
I can't do anything with this input, as it is already in English.
This is the important subject.
We're not here for advertising or promotion; our goal is to create.
We haven't ruled out the summit.
We ask of ourselves.
We're leaving to put pressure on the poor other party.
The previous and subsequent, and the Security Council resolution, but let's stay focused on the topic of the Arab Summit. President Bashar Al-Assad of Syria
Speak clearly, the situation may require an emergency Arab summit with whoever is present.
He found that the majority of the brothers support holding the summit.
Who did I block?
I have no idea what they mean by moderation.
We are the only nation.
Only the Arab nation means that if we go to any nations in Asia, in Latin America, or elsewhere,
Without a solution.
Moderate countries
What is moderation in our view?
Do we give up on the Palestinian cause?
We like them.
Should we interfere in the Palestinian issue in this manner?
There is no mother who would allow such interference to decide who is good and who is bad.
I'm not a fan of Hezbollah, tomorrow another party might emerge.
Is she a student?
We wonder if we can be a part of the Arab body.
We were destined to engage in an internal Arab conflict.
Let's go to the Security Council, then.
There is no UN Security Council resolution.
I hope Israel completes its mission soon.
Good the second Arab ministerial meeting that you invited to
The period was marked by discussions, disagreements, and intense altercations.
He's at an important point.
You get it. That's not the point.
We're having a meeting if we do.
I am one of the crossings.
There is no longer a peace issue.
Are the ministers ready for it?
We should wait, one side says.
Okay, we are in an Arab initiative.
Peace talks with Israel have come to a standstill.
We say that we are on the losing end of this matter.
# We've lost more than we're losing now. Well, we've always been respectful, polite, and committed to the decisions since the truce.
Sadeah Sheikh says that the arguments are not important.
There were those who wished they could put an end to Hamas and the like.
This implies a political statement rather than a mere altercation between ministers.
Unfortunately, this situation occurred.
Not everyone, though.
We don't want to speak on behalf of others.
It's crucial that we become men, men of our nation.
We uphold the policies of our nation.
Who does these kinds of things on her behalf?
I think, therefore I am.
I don't think they'll respect us in the end.
Yes, are there people acting on behalf of the West?
No, God willing, I won't accuse anyone. I don't want to accuse anyone about this matter.
After the Security Council resolution.
What will his agenda be?
The position seemed clear in the Arab effort's decision.
And here lies the dispute: if Israel had implemented the resolution immediately.
We can say it's a decision.
Israel has not implemented this resolution.
Now, are we ready to go and ask for Chapter Seven? I know, of course, there are difficulties.
Questioned by no one from the international community, and if asked
Shyly
LL, the situation.
They believe that the most important thing they did was to grant the Jews or Israelis their rights.
They will get their revenge.
The current Arab situation.
If the Arabs hadn't gone to the Security Council.
They agree on a summit and make difficult decisions.
Western countries will seek us out.
We are in an Arab context, in a world, and among people, and you can see how the Arab street is moving on this issue.
But this decision is important.
# Case of Summoning Our Leaders, One After Another
Okay, in the end, they said, "By God, it turned out to be false and fake."
# Should we demand it now, if we were like Germany or other countries?
They don't have to pay compensation for the attack they carried out based on incorrect information.
She kills hundreds of thousands.
This is because you are a weak Arab party.
We Arabs go against each other.
He testifies about how.
Dismissal of the topic.
By the way, it was as if it was just fate.
If the Arab nation says, "If you send troops to Darfur, we will send troops to Darfur."
The Arabs considered, or some considered, Resolution 1860.
The community testified in reaching the decision.
The Security Council resolution.
I don't want to say that this is a victory or not a victory.
Matters end up as they do.
Let's assume victory.
What are we going to do?
We assume we are not bound by the remaining decision.
I assure you, we will abide by the decision.
Unfortunately, you will have to comply, but ideally, you shouldn't have to adhere to the decision.
Even after Israel's rejection, Israel reconsidered and accepted.
We are.
Will you have an alternative or rather are you the ones calling for a ministerial meeting?
I don't believe in the Arab nation.
I'm ready for any alternative in the current situation.
I don't think the Arab nation is ready.
# Gaza Siege Enforcement
For other political goals.
To favor one group over another in Palestine, instead of reconciling them, we create division among them.
We started trying to plan.
They organized a gathering, some kind of intelligence meeting, with Arabs and Europeans, without mentioning names.
We're just sitting here, subscribing.
In execution.
What is expected of us from the West?
Let's go.
This is what I want to be sorted.
I'm not talking about the decision, I'm talking about
Consequences because this topic started two years ago, the Gaza topic, not just now.
I'll talk about the subject two years ago, but specifically about the decision.
Do you have any reservations about its clauses?
Issued but not executed.
We were invited.
They might think we have a dissenting opinion.
Everyone was expected to share the same perspective.
We don't have to all share the same opinion, but I believe those who went put in a lot of effort.
We thank them for it.
Regarding what is happening in Gaza for two years, you said that parties
Overwhelming one category over another that participated in the topic of the siege on Gaza.
You actually agree with the statements, insinuations, or accusations that have been made here and there.
There is a genuine Arab complicity in everything that is happening now in Gaza.
We are aware of the partial information.
Let me tell you about the subject; we are not privy to everything.
But I know.
The Palestinian-Palestinian divide.
I am igniting on an Arab and international level.
They would not have differed so greatly had it not been for the fuel.
And it was after the elections that took place.
There is a strong enthusiasm for power.
Majority
We should give them a chance and see.
They want reform, or perhaps they are still revolutionaries at heart, in the sense that they know nothing but the gun and fighting.
But they came that day.
Some of our Arab brothers believe that these radical movements should not come to power.
They now say that there was an attack.
Hamas has previously broken the ceasefire, or rather, the Palestinians from Gaza broke the ceasefire.
Ceasefire
# The People of Gaza Remain In Gaza, the Palestinian people endure, Two years of hunger, a relentless struggle.
I'm sorry.
For Israeli security reasons.
# Match Report Clear, okay, I don't want them in the ruling, this doesn't concern me, I'm in Qatar.
What's the fault of the remaining people?
What's next? And who decides?
These or he are not all the states that have their sovereignty in choosing.
Governments
It is the root of the problem.
I'm sure it could have been treated.
We would testify, we would testify to confront the disagreement.
It's clear that we were required to overthrow one group with another, as this group...
We consider it a terrorist category or what we consider it to be.
What's happening is all these things led to
We also expect the promises made by the party to ensure a suitable life.
They didn't do anything for him.
We return to the international and Arab efforts exerted to put an end to what is happening. As I mentioned, you are...
There is a Security Council resolution that Israel has rejected so far.
There is also the Egyptian Initiative which
Cairoite woman.
Upon those Egyptian efforts.
I'm afraid this is
She is required to play a significant role.
Also, Egypt's borders are adjacent to Israel's and Palestine's.
We are
We must stop the chaos now.
In Gaza, we need people to stop the chaos in Gaza because...
This is not the way to peace.
There must be something.
We always ask her to take on a bigger role.
What has been announced.
It's too early to judge the initiative.
You either give the possibility of success or studies.
I believe in the chances of success.
If the brothers in Egypt can
We are close to converging Palestinian viewpoints.
He who discusses the initiative is assumed to be the affected party in Gaza.
He is the only one who can touch it, he might say yes, and he might say no.
This is an important point.
When the 1860 decision was issued.
We have a Palestinian Arabic problem.
We don't want to hear a word.
But I wish that when the Palestinian delegation left
When they went to the university, they asked for someone to be with them from Gaza.
We're showing the Israelis now that these are our brothers, we're all one.
This is an important point.
Let's not make it authoritarian.
We aim to protect and build our policy.
Stay in power.
# الشيخ الآن
I don't know if it's possible to discuss the Egyptian initiative since you haven't reviewed its terms.
Do you, in principle, think it is suitable as a mechanism to implement the international resolution 1060, as some have stated?
Balanced role
Now, not tomorrow or the day after, but...
Every day passes.
In our brothers' blood, it is spilled.
We don't want to rush or pressure the Israelis; they should be allowed to complete their mission before we start discussing this initiative.
I am certain that the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt are aware of this and are keen to uphold it.
This is what I want to make clear, I say everything I mean.
It's necessary to resolve the issue now.
We're not doing what Israel wants.
Pointing to this Turkish role since the beginning of the crisis.
Does it mean an expression?
# About an
There was no doubt that the stance was striking.
She has an Arabic depth.
Her entrance caused an Arab deficit.
We know there is an Arab deficit.
Part of it is due to disagreements.
I think that part of it is due to each one's point of view; I believe that my perspective is the best.
# فلان believes that his point of view is the best.
We must gain respect and make them know there is an Arab decision.
They do not single us out, one by one.
He said, "No problem, I'll give them an extra two or three days to teach them a lesson. We'll bring the guys, and by then, they'll be all sorted out, and the issue will be resolved."
We must rise above this and not accept it.
They might have their mistakes, Hamas, but we are dealing with Hamas.
Arabically, Arabically.
But now
At least we can say no.
In the framework of the position, Qatar is also required to comply. As we hear, we will return to this point. However,
On the ground, at the same time, you heard.
Khalid Mashal, the former head of Hamas' Political Bureau.
First, it's not necessary to say, "With all due respect and appreciation to Mr. Khaled Mashal," every time.
Why don't we sit down with Khaled Mashal and talk to him as Arabs?
I'll bring it to the Arab League and tell him.
This is important information.
I am from Hamas.
If you impose Israel's conditions, you also impose conditions.
Let them impose their conditions too. Why is it forbidden for them to impose conditions but allowed for Israel to do so?
Firstly, what do you think of this Arab popular gift?
We are the rabble, or these are the masses; we don't have to listen to their words. Once they told De Gaulle not to listen, and look what happened.
He differs completely. First, he liberated his country.
I swear, with allies and without, my country is liberated from Nazi occupation.
Now we're talking.
We should assume the Arab gift.
Presumed presidents should represent the views of their people.
The Arab people in all those demonstrations we have witnessed.
# This demand can be met from these rows.
Also, many of those criticizing Qatar in this situation are demanding
In light of what is happening, the office and the representative office remain open.
They speak with the same reasoning.
We will align with all Arab countries by severing the relationship.
To cut off all relations, even if someone claims to have a treaty.
They want only Qatar's sacrifice.
We are
This is more important than the relationship.
It's not just this decision, it's this and even harder choices.
I am this decision.
We must have a unified Arab stance.
To others.
No one sells out anyone because they expect to gain from it, whether it's moral, material, or for recognition.
Yes, before we close this file, on this matter, there are also countries that have taken individual steps.
Good, Chavez's issue is different. Chavez has a dispute with America.
We, the people, need to summon.
Five permanent members and their arguments. These are movies.
We've finished it, the street is smarter now.
# بالسقف الأعلى سعادة الشيخ # At the Highest Ceiling, Your Excellency, the Sheikh
He calls on the resistance forces in Lebanon to confront the Israeli aggression and all that.
Do you think that if this matter were approached within a unified Arab framework, it could succeed?
We call for an Arab stance that will earn us respect from others.
We don't think the Arab countries are ready for war.
We're not motivated either.
How can we bring Syria, bring Lebanon, and bring the other countries, while there are Arab states that don't communicate with each other?
We need to be.
Qualitative shift in Arab relations.
This is the policy that currently exists between the Arab states.
# Shopping List But I think it's expired.
# Vision, Mission, and Goals ## Vision ## Mission ## Goals
The important issue.
We know the Lebanese composition.
Lebanon There's no doubt that
She gave an example that if her lands were returned.
The situation in Gaza is different. They are still in Gaza.
Trapped from all sides.
And this siege.
Nature gives differently.
Yes, I am referring to the objectives from Israel's perspective, the goals of the operation from Israel's point of view.
When you hit someone, you punish them. When you do this and that, you please someone.
That's why the example of what happened in Lebanon is not a good one for them.
# Solution Model Achieved in Lebanon
It deems it valid.
Gaza.
See the problem in Gaza, the Palestinians, their solution is easier than the one in Lebanon.
Different in some ways, should we reclaim our land today or tomorrow?
# My Struggles for Power
The distribution of power.
This differs because their fabric is closer to each other.
I am a fabric of intellectual thought in Lebanon.
The solution is therefore simpler.
And here lies the problem.
# Sheikh Saeed
We only have a few minutes left to summarize this topic: where can we go from here?
A diplomat means business.
How can this process come to an end?
Palestinians in Gaza
Let me tell you.
He either refuses or rejects.
Let's help each other.
Those who didn't walk with us.
Failed bacon to be us Arabs.
From a strategic point of view
However, on the Palestinian side,
There were some efforts, but we haven't seen a comprehensive initiative.
In the past, not now, why?
It's not just an issue of initiative, it's more about how we feel.
We help without mentioning Qatar, as some might be sensitive to its name.
We don't aim to reach the summit because we already have a summit scheduled for March.
Will we be better than our brothers if we take the initiative? I don't think so.
We don't put pressure on them.
The past will not forgive us if we put pressure on them.
We're moving forward with this initiative, we've met with all parties involved. There was a meeting scheduled for the 4th, but it was postponed due to the trip to the Security Council.
We hope, God willing, to make progress. We wish our Arab brothers would help us as much as possible with this matter.
We hope to keep him away from the topic of competition.
Arabic Arabic
In inflaming it due to their dispute with the Sudanese government at one point in time.
This is also one of our problems. We fight among ourselves, we disagree with each other.
I don't want to get involved in this matter.
In Kuwait, on the nineteenth of this month, as I believe, of course, the Arab situation is...
As you are aware, as I have mentioned and elaborated, Your Excellency.
Is the Arab atmosphere conducive to this first economic summit?
His Highness
We, of course, always attend any summit of any Arab brother.
We always abstain from attending any summit.
But isn't there a fear that it might turn into a political summit?
Of course, given that time imposes itself.
It's too late, and even if it means after ten days.
We talk about Palestinians after they've endured twenty-five days of beatings.
It means "It will be."
Won't it be said that the Arabs couldn't unite?
This is what we said.
This is what we said.
With all due respect, this summit is scheduled, and we are committed to it.
I think we
The Arab street is upon us.
We're going about this our way.
So that means I
We submit.
He says, "That's enough. I'm content."
Let's meet up.

"With the change in terminology, as you suggested, is there a shift in the perception of this group within society?"
Yes, and it is measured by
Varies from region to region.
However, the special thing about this topic is
The Arab world has its own distinct characteristics or differences.
The legal approach is present, and there is a culture of human rights, for example, in Africa.
In Latin America, but the reasons might be due to a lack of financial resources. It's not the case.
Of course, this is what I wanted to say, that culture exists, but there is a lack of resources, sometimes it's a lack of political will.
Sometimes legislation but
Unfortunately, awareness is somewhat low, and legal culture is also non-existent.
10% of the world's population are people with disabilities.
Eighty to ninety percent of people with disabilities in developing countries are of working age.
They suffer from unemployment.
I visited Darfur.
He and the mines and all the weapons.
Males are preferred to a lesser extent.
# Remote Areas and Disability People with disabilities often find themselves in remote areas, isolated and distant from the rest of the world.
There are many organizations working in this field that are trying to raise awareness.
Consciousness is realizing the right to education.
Instead of establishing many so-called religious centers
She establishes rehabilitation centers, hospitals, and schools.
This is one of the things that, praise be to God, we've been able to accomplish through our work in the office.
I tried with the organizations present in the State of Qatar.
Set the agenda for action.
We integrate the work agendas of these humanitarian organizations, ensuring they include the aforementioned centers.
In light of the deteriorating situation of people with disabilities worldwide.
I cannot agree with you that there is a decline.
If the decline in the Arab region is due to the issue of disability.
Within the community context, within the political context, and within the economic context, we cannot expect the conditions of people with disabilities to be any different.
They are among the marginalized groups.
In a country like like what I told you like the Gaza Strip like Darfur
On the contrary, I cannot make it absolute that there is no improvement in the situation.
And now I've translated it on the ground, for example, if I can, I'll strike an example.
As a professional translator,
We agreed to include the projects.
# Strategy for Persons with Disabilities There are other projects within this strategy that focus on the health aspect of disabilities.
We tried to include it as well.
Within the scope of organizations based on the ground.
# Interview with Kamal Karo from Syria We have Kamal Karo with us now from Syria. Hello, Kamal.
Good evening, Suleiman Quru.
Solomon Crow, please come in. Solomon.
Greetings to you and the esteemed lady Hafsa.
# Is intellectual disability included in the laws of the United Nations?
# Intellectual Disability A person with an intellectual disability is someone who was once healthy but, due to some pressure or stress, developed an intellectual impairment.
He has been disabled as a result of torture and imprisonment, and now has a mental disability. He has been receiving treatment for six years now.
I know, I know, around four hundred people, from children to sane adults, as a result of prisons.
Is there a law in the United Nations?
Reality, I mean, really.
They understand, knowing what it means to know, to be known, just as they know their own children.
Every intention means purpose, purpose without without without without making themselves its names.
There are values in the west.
Agreed upon but people.
Those who have deviated from Islam or have been overcome by it, their wisdom should not be taken.
"Thank you very much, Nayef Al-Sa'eed, speaking from Kuwait."
I return to our guest to comment on what was mentioned.
Communications Sulaiman wondered if there was an intellectual disability.
Yes, within the classification.
# International Day of People with Disabilities Certainly, intellectual and developmental disabilities, as they are known.
There are sensory disabilities, which include visual and auditory impairments, as well as physical disabilities.
Of course, as mentioned, disability is...
Action and reaction occur within a specific social context.
In the Arab world or in any other regions.
Certainly, tackling disability has been a lengthy process.
And even at the United Nations level.
During my experience and work as a special rapporteur, one of the issues I tried to address and work on was...
The right for all.
Until they are ready.
# Rehabilitative Measures Various rehabilitation measures are implemented to ensure their enrollment in schools and their integration into the workforce. The labor organization plays a crucial role in this process.
Works on vocational rehabilitation, which includes people with disabilities.
I have made some improvements to it.
Especially after the reform.
In general, it is present in this international body.
I am also, as a special rapporteur.
Reality is practical and this has been positive for me, even if it is not directly related.
"The entity that supported this position."
I've seen him in many meetings, for example, the international convention.
The rights of persons with disabilities.
She was disabled by some of these constraints or shortcomings.
For example, regarding legal capacity.
This is one of the fundamental points in the world of disability that...
The United Nations, unfortunately, was somewhat hindered during its preparation and drafting.
In regard to organizations and agencies.
For example, I'll end it with this.
The world, governments, and non-governmental organizations, the member states of the United Nations.
We sent another questionnaire.
United Nations organizations and their agencies in the various regions.
To what extent are disability programs on their agendas?
If she budgets, there is participation of people with disabilities.
Human rights
Development issues only.
# Good day, we are taking more calls. With us now is Meshri Naji from Algeria. Go ahead, Naji.
Peace be upon you.
I wanted to ask my sister from Algeria, exactly where is Wasif?
I wanted to ask, I am originally disabled, physically.
Okay, we'll put this question to you, Naji Mashri. You spoke to us from Algeria. Thank you very much, Ahmed.
Aleppo, from Greece, please come in, Ahmed.
Good evening, ma'am. Good evening to your guest.
# Social Benefits for Migrant Workers Health care, accommodation, seasonal clothing, and even seasonal tours are provided, which is a common practice in Europe.
Is a psychiatric patient considered disabled?
They might cause harm to others or themselves, especially.
We're just beating around the bush, and for that, I'm grateful.
I have been informed by Sister Hasna that there is a financial shortfall.
In poor countries, especially in Africa and Latin America, I call upon them.
Establish the International Disability Support Fund and allocate one percent of the net profit of every institution in the world.
It is mandatory and without exception for any institution or company.
# The Plight of the Disabled, War Victims, and Others Hundreds of disabled, war victims, and others are struggling and barely hanging on.
Thank you very much, Abe Ibrahim Abdullah, for speaking to us from Saudi Arabia.
Naji Mashri wonders and showcases his problem: he is disabled.
On a local or national level, that is, within Algeria.
Community needs must be met within the community.
The same rights that must be afforded to any other person.
In the name of the right to life first, then the right to housing, the right to health, and the right to education.
I hereby call upon the governments, and the Arab governments in particular, from this very platform.
In the interest of this citizen and this individual.
To ensure inclusion.
Those needs and rights are already on the existing agendas.
No, there's no need to create any devices.
New to meet the needs of the disabled person or not necessary if this is the case in this country.
She must be committed to performing it, anyway.
I advise him first to return and go back to the responsible authorities at the governmental level, if possible.
We must do this within the national scope, as it falls under that jurisdiction.
Your reference to the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, there are many signatory states but they do not comply.
Why aren't there any laws in place?
It's definitely a fact that we live in a human society, which means there are many mistakes and a lot of correctness.
Certainly, many agreements and undoubtedly, many covenants lack literal commitment.
An ideal commitment, many countries have joined many such as CEDAW and others.
However, there are breaches and violations, and we are aware of them.
We must adopt and accede to the agreement.
Firstly, we will ensure at least we will ensure that there is awareness.
This awareness starts from the top of this pyramid, which is the decision-makers.
The responsibility then extends to the entire society.
Our commitment is also to prepare reports, and these reports reach the United Nations.
The issue of knowledge, understanding, and heightened awareness.
To the reports, you served as a rapporteur for the United Nations, did you?
Yes, based on what I've seen and recorded, there is interest.
There is a relative advantage for the Arab League to accede to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
Thus, I advise, encourage, and invite.
It is also important that people with disabilities are included.
We will hear what Ali Abid Al-Sanari, the president of the Qatari Association for the Deaf, has to say.
Deaf people are being discussed by Sayed Naji. Welcome, Sayed Naji, and Sayed Ali as well.
Hello.
Peace be upon you.
I have Professor Ali Obeid Al-Sanari, the chairman of the board of directors at the Qatar Cultural and Social Center for the Deaf.
"Which is dominated by the happiness of Sheikha Hessa."
Special Rapporteur on Disability for the United Nations, formerly.
I am from Qatar.
Sheikha Hessa was indeed a long-standing chairperson of the board.
The international convention you are referring to is indeed a reality.
A great benefit for all people with disabilities worldwide.
In particular, in the Arab world.
I wish, as a deaf person.
To be for these states to implement this international convention.
That would serve the needs of people with disabilities and is necessary to
Currently, there should be someone who activates this agreement in all countries.
Obaid Alsanari, the president of the Qatari Association for the Deaf and Mute.

# Live SMS Service on Al Jazeera
Dear viewers, welcome back. We are delighted to have as our guest today Sheikha Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani.
International Fund for Disability Support
# Disability and the Obligation to Provide Funds: A Proposal The proposal suggests that disability should be recognized as a binding obligation for all nations to provide financial support. What are your thoughts on this idea?
The United Nations has a fund called the Disability Case Fund.
Unfortunately, those contributions are very weak.
Monitoring is crucial for implementing standard rules.
When I worked those six years, there was little to no support.
Except for China and Austria.
I would like to express my gratitude to this country for its support.
The main supporting country is my country, Qatar.
The organization that established the office through which we were able to implement many activities and projects, praise be to God.
Yes, this lack of support indicates what?
As we mentioned at the beginning, and this point is always raised, that
In ordinary circumstances
How do we care for people with disabilities?
There must be a realistic, genuine, and serious commitment.
He in all his states in all categories.
# Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Children, Adolescents, and Displaced Refugees.
We will indeed all be reaching a degree of what is called
Equality of opportunity, participation, and equality.
There are those voices that always demand and never tire or give up.
In the Islamic region and the Arab region, why is there no dedicated space?
In favor of these programs and projects.
Just as he presented the truth, and I thank him from this platform.
Islamic Development Bank
I am part of the budget allocation.
Non-compliance with the financial payments you mentioned
Funds to assist people with disabilities. Does it include only developing countries and Arab states, or is it more inclusive?
Even advanced countries don't offer.
The person who was before me, the Swede, yes.
Also, some countries from the European Union.
There are certainly many countries, especially in the Arab region, which might not have been
You even know about this special rapporteur.
In my case, it means what happened.
Sweden and China were F.
The Arab region, unfortunately, also had many promises, but sadly, only one state kept them.
We will talk about the Arab region, but...
# Contact Us We have more connections. Hamad Al-Marri from Qatar, please go ahead, Hamad.
Hello.
Peace be upon you.
Dr. Hello, Sheikha Hessa.
Almost ten years.
This girl now we notice in her a psychological disability.
What is your role, exactly, when it comes to a girl like this who is suffering?
She is with her colleagues.
Sometimes, even if we stay.
What is your role, specifically for Qatari girls?
Thank you very much, Hamad Al-Marri, speaking to us from Qatar. Karwan Bahjat, joining us from Kuwait. Welcome.
They say, oh Sheikha Hessa.
Why don't we leave our oil in its sediment?
Arabs with special needs can be counted.
We can help them.
We have immense financial capabilities.
We can break the psychological barrier between us and them.
Boosting individual morale.
She seeks divine guidance for this noble purpose.
This is if we are truly believers.
# Expression of Gratitude We extend our sincere appreciation and gratitude to Sheikha Hessa for her efforts and contributions during her tenure as the Special Rapporteur.
We extend our sincere gratitude and appreciation to her and to the State of Qatar for all they have done for those with special needs.
"Thank you very much, Aisha Mohammed, who spoke to us from Qatar."
Hello, Ms. Wasila.
Peace be upon you.
Your gracious hospitality.
# سعاده الشيخه حصه
I'm asking about prevention.
Prevention is better than cure.
There is another level of disability, regardless of wars and road accidents.
# Genetic Level Implications Inbreeding, a consequence of familial proximity, may result in genetic shortening.
I believe this is a large percentage.
Lead to disability.
Thank you very much, our dear Shereef, you spoke to us from Tunisia, and I return to you, my guest.
The first caller, Hamad Al-Marri, asked about...
He's heading somewhere with a girl who has a disability, a psychological impairment.
He wonders where he's headed.
In every country
Certainly, there are services provided for all types of disabilities in the State of Qatar.
For these disabilities, whether they are intellectual disabilities as we mentioned or any psychological disabilities.
Regarding this for schools.
In the past, there was

I discussed this aspect.
Adopts healthy strategies.

I believe in a dish in the State of Qatar.
We respect traditions and customs, but they certainly take time.
In tribal communities, specifically.
However, over time, there is a response to it, but it is essential that there is a legal obligation, in other words,
Yes, Kawran Behjat wondered and suggested that one percent of the Arab countries' budget be allocated.
Help the disabled, let me start first.
Yes, there is the statistical estimate that was applied by the World Health Organization to the entire world.
There are forty or nearly forty million disabled people.
Half of them are women.
But these numbers are multiplying.
There was a study in South Africa that saw and proved
It is certain that the statistics that emerged about the war in Iraq and the war in Gaza
Every death is accompanied by three disabled people.
Our Arab region has become, without a doubt, a region of conflicts.
"Even the proposal that Behjat Kooran presented."
One percent won't be enough.
To assist people with disabilities in the Arab region.
The issue of ratios is relevant to people with disabilities or other marginalized groups.
Honestly, I truly don't see how they align.
"which requires addressing their problems and needs"
She emphasized that people with disabilities are the most neglected.
Generally, censuses conducted by governments do not enumerate persons with disabilities.
It is true, and it also relates to the culture of the community and sometimes to restrictions.
# المجتمعية (Community-based) When a census is conducted among the population.
Relevant authorities
There is a disabled person in the house.
There was only one question: is there a person with a disability or not?
The relevant department for this matter and through the concerned individuals, there is...
Let's collaborate on preparing the form.
We recommend providing more details.
Does it specify first whether the type of this disabled person, if present, is male or female?
Does his assistant get paid or not?
The truth is, even though the number, as you know, is correct, why, why, why haven't we reached the precise result?
# Let's Get Started! It's great to have your attention here as we welcome Fatima Al-Dosari from Qatar. Welcome, Fatima!
Peace be upon you.
I am a Qatari citizen and I have a child with disabilities.
I extend my gratitude to His Highness Sheikh Hamad, the ruler of the country.
Mrs. Mozah, along with her husband, is dedicated to supporting this category.
I am truly proud and grateful for the care and attention I receive.

Thank you for your hard work. I'd like to contribute, if I may.
First of all, I am an audiologist and I worked in the State of Qatar for almost four years.
We had a month dedicated to raising awareness about hearing and speech disorders.
We organized conferences, lectures, and awareness campaigns for the hearing-impaired.
Now I want to talk about Jordan; I've been residing in Jordan for almost three years.
Honestly, it offers new and amazing services.
Honestly, I offer new services, whether from a material, non-material, or moral perspective.
Even the Jordanian Ministry of Education is mentioned in the sources.
The one affiliated with the Ministry of Education in public schools.
We, as private institutions, are also [involved/committed/engaged].
We receive wonderful and beautiful support.
Kind and generous, do you have a direct question? Due to time constraints, I apologize.
Do you have a direct question?
Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan offer excellent services, and in my opinion, they are truly outstanding.
Commenting on the viewers' calls and their feedback.
Someone who works in this field.
Regarding the subject,
I will also return to the matter of the agreement.
Once ratified and acceded to, it becomes binding.
It is a duty upon this state or upon these organizations.
Because it stems from the issue of rights for these individuals, regardless.
Honestly, what?
During that period, efforts were made for the disabled and...
I wish it would come true now.
Surely, I wish for either.
I hope that this research or survey will be a benchmark and that more qualitative research will be conducted in this field.
It became clear to me from this experience.
Six years of experience
Coordination among Arab countries is also necessary.
They also have a role to play; it's not just about rights, they are recipients of those rights.
Shaikha Hessa bint Khalifa Al Thani, former UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, thank you.
We welcome the elegant presenter from the Al Dawri wal Kass channel, Lana Lana. Good morning.
I am also pleased to welcome the shining captain in the ranks of Umm Salal Club, Captain Ali Qasim.
Hello Ali, welcome!
Welcome.
Good morning.
I'll leave the space open for congratulations; each one of you can congratulate at your own pace. Please, go ahead.
I had an open studio for five hours, and then I had two hours without a break.
Huge congratulations to the State of Qatar, its government, and its people, they absolutely deserve this global achievement.
I can now seize this opportunity to congratulate and extend my best wishes to Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.
Sheikh Tamim, the Crown Prince.
Yes, of course, Lana, you are like that because you are from the field of mathematics and work in this area, and you are familiar with these lines and this field in general.
We too.
We deserve it, considering we got six votes, while America got fourteen votes for Qatar and eight for themselves.
It's not just a night, as our file is rich and comprehensive, and supported by many ambassadors. Let's say it's well-supported, let's talk about the venues.
Some people were afraid that maybe it could be like America.
Perhaps in some countries, these things are already prepared, so they don't need to build sports fields and organize certain projects for this event.
They are all ready now.
They were just afraid of this point.
Captain Ali, you athletes, I expect this is a very important achievement for athletes.
I expect it will venture into the realms of economics, politics, and health.
Be careful, athletes.
What does this achievement signify?
Of course, it's a great achievement, especially for us athletes. Even non-athletes, you saw how happy they were.
Insha'Allah Ali will let me know as soon as the announcement is made.
By God, I was coming back from the workout and we were listening to the radio.
We were waiting for him, and I had one of the guys with me.
We're driving and listening to the radio.
When they announced Qatar, wow!
We both screamed, of course, after popping the cork.
My buddy climbed out through the opening.
Shouting and the world is watching, we're doing our own thing, the danger and the journey, alone.
We started marching from the very beginning.
Alhamdulillah, it was a very special day. I think all the channels focused on this event extensively.
Lana, you must be included in this topic.
And especially the sports channels.
How did they celebrate this matter and what was their reaction?
There were media outlets from many channels around the world.
# Main Teacher Now it's clear on the map, Qatar is well-known.
Certainly, his presence in the national team is also a very important matter.
I expect that this is a huge responsibility on his shoulders.
What's your opinion on this specific point?
# Player Selection Criteria Captain Ali, what are the key attributes that this player must possess to join this national team?
I'm coming to more than one sporting event on my way.
We now need to raise a strong generation.
He has a solid understanding of the basic rules and strategic techniques in football, which he applies thoughtfully.
What are the rules and fundamentals that this player must possess?
I believe professionalism ensures everything.
# Discipline in Practice Perseverance in exercises Consistency in practice Self-discipline
Hey, these are all basic things to help the player give it their all in matches or training sessions.
Each stage has its own meaning, so it has a unique character.
She has her quirks and her sensitivity.
I enjoy a variety of programs, from entertainment to sports. Where do you feel more at home, in entertainment or sports?
My, you're pretty.
You really make me take care of myself, you know how I want to maintain myself through sports, that's the most important thing.
# Football: The People's Darling, a Love You Can't Escape When you enter this field, you have no choice but to embrace the love for football, the sport adored by the masses and followed by all, whether you like it or not.
An anchor is confined to one side of the studio.
What confines you like this will put you in a specific corner.
You don't have to, but football.
I'm not a physical person, I prefer reading. Sports and medicine are not my cup of tea, I find them unappealing.
I also have several important things to discuss.
I wish you hadn't come back like this, being ten years younger so you could reach 2022.
I never wished for this job.
Of course, we all wish for that, especially with the World Cup. Now, any player
I'm happy to help with the translation. Here's the text in English: It means that when one watches a World Cup match, they feel excited and happy. Imagine how much more thrilled they would be if they were actually playing in the World Cup.
I hope they live up to expectations, God willing. This is their chance, God willing.
What's the word you want to say, a professional player, stinky, about what word do you want to say from your heart to them?
This half-term we'd love for you to be with us.
I'm on leave right now, just like God.
I brought him back to championships after an absence of twelve years from the Gulf Cup tournament.
You definitely left a beautiful mark, Mashallah, on Qatar TV and created wonderful memories.
Mashallah, Qatar TV has now become like a university, graduating a large group of media professionals.
Our team is a strong one, God willing, and will win many different awards.
Let's talk about the important task for Al-Markhiya Club.
How are you over there? What's the news over there? I hope you're comfortable.
Certainly, Alhamdulillah, to be honest, Umm Asal.
Yesterday, of course, Bal was with us in the studio, and we talked a lot about the players.
I assume that some of the young people who are following us still feel like you're one of them.
# ملطوب Required
I play naturally in the instinctive professional league and the transfer of players.
I got my chance in As-Salt, whether as an offer or a proposal.
I'm glad I can take the place of the Asian Cup with the team.
My situation, thank God, is good with the team.
# Sport as a Social Phenomenon How can we turn sports into a social phenomenon?
# How can we introduce sports to women, children, and youth in Qatar?
# Sport is a holistic concept, where everything complements each other.
You have women's roles in various sports fields.
We now have a sports awareness for every individual, from the youngest to the oldest, in this society.
It's been almost ten years, and I think we'll need another twelve years to reach this occasion.
The new generations keep coming up with new ways.
In a generation that is passing by and growing older, there is a generation after it that also needs to be aware of sports from a young age.
We have Aspire, the Aspire Dome, a landmark that we cannot deny, a great monument, a founder.
# New Generation Sport One
We just need to set our minds and go.
They love football in particular.
I'm not sure how to attract the audience to engage continuously with all the different matches between clubs.
My God, this is actually a problem in the Qatari league, which is the lack of spectators.
We only have this issue with attendance. The Qatar Football Association hasn't yet found a solution to attract the crowds.
What is the approach we need to take to attract them to follow these matches?
It depends on the person themselves, some of them don't like to attend the stadium.
Media plays a key role in shaping public opinion and influencing the widespread disengagement.
# New Ticketing System We have recently implemented a new ticketing system, which allows you to accumulate points.
Lala is unity, it means he has a plan with several steps to attract the audience.
Some clubs have methods like Al-Rayyan, which attract fans. Of course, Al-Rayyan is rich, so it doesn't need fans.
Some clubs need some of their management to organize activities and events.
The right of the public To stimulate the right of the public I think these are the means I have
The players, meaning the new generation.
Their love for the job, their faith in their abilities, and just like me, they need not only financial support but also moral support, which is extremely beneficial.
We definitely appreciate this wonderful meeting, thank you.
We wanted to have your final words on this magnificent win, with Qatar's victory in the bid to host the 2022 World Cup. Please, begin.
We never doubted that Qatar would deliver, on the contrary, they kept their promises and always fulfilled their commitments.
Insha'Allah, Captain Ali, you have the final word that you would like to address in this interview.
"I say congratulations to them and I hope they continue to move forward."
Thank you, Ali Qasem, the captain and player. We wish you all the best, God willing, in your sports career and in your life as well. May God bless you, amen.
Let's love sports more and more.
# Episode Topic: Young Talents
Some young people like these songs, which are currently popular, but they have a deep and long history.
A group of young people are singing Arabic lyrics or English words.
We're going to follow up on this topic today with a group of rap enthusiasts.
We will get to know them extensively through our meeting that will bring us together with them live.
Welcome, dear viewers, wherever you may be.
A new style of singing emerged in the Arab world and the Gulf region years ago.
Coming from the west, specifically America, it's rap music.
And before we dive into the topic of rap singing
There's boldness in using any word without any hesitation.
Anyone can rap.
Regarding the lyrics writing
Almost all rappers write their own lyrics.
Generally, all these details are very important and we will get to know them through two individuals who are deeply involved in this field.
They made a nice division.
I welcome Yusuf Al Nuaimi and Salman Abdullah Yusuf. Good morning.
Welcome Salman, good morning.
Good morning, hello.
I am very happy to have you with us through this program, of course.
And also, of course, the topic of rap singing.
What do you have to do with it, Yusuf?
# Rap Art: A New Wave in Tar We've noticed that the art of rap wasn't really present in Tar.
Better off alone
Speak in the language of the citizen.
There are songs that are cheerful, songs that are sad, and songs that discuss political topics.
Yes, I'm the first in rap.
Music is an art form, just like how a painter creates a masterpiece, a poet writes a poem.
The singer can sing, the musician plays any instrument.
There is a sense of acceptance and appreciation from the Qatari and Gulf communities for this type of music.
2010
People seem to enjoy collecting rap music CDs.
Different ages
There are families and there are many people who have become more aware of the world.
There was something like a website.
How many of you are there in this group so far?
Everyone can say words, write poetry, and deliver it in a rap style.
The rapper, may God be praised, you can say he's the one who sings to himself.
He's the one who plays sometimes, and he writes the lyrics.
Oh okay.
Listen to it, man, I swear I recorded this song.
Okay, now all these songs you produced, are they from Salman, from you, from Yusuf, from anyone else, or from the band itself?
We thought it might be available on a specific CD sold in the markets.
It's a challenge when you're an individual and want to release an album and put it out there in the market. It requires a business license and going through certain procedures.
# Why didn't you consider that you are twenty-five in number, so the single hand can't clap?
We need your hands, you have, praise be to God, twenty-five hands. May God protect you all as young men and brothers.
Learn this CD. You can promote it through more than one website on the internet.
Do you have Facebook? Do you have YouTube? You also have access through local newspapers.
There are, I think, thirteen songs.
Registration is not the same as it is now.
I only had a little lunch, but it was quite obvious.
The quality is a bit weak, but it's not as bad as it is now, it's clear.
He is roughly fifty CDs old.
I can't not say there isn't any, because some of the young guys might have known this art for ten years.
I am not sure about the recording and I expect the distribution during this period. Now it's different.
Especially since there's a large collection of music, a large collection of different types of music, techno music now.
These are the young guys or these are the artists who produce a large collection of beautiful songs.
We should also talk about the parties you've attended.
I swear, you should've seen the party we had in Doha. We participated in one amazing event.
Of course, it was organized for us by Al Sadd Club, so they didn't come with us.
I can't see the audience.
We'll see something, I didn't expect this number.
The families, surprisingly, are more.
Families are more than just young people.
I'm sorry, but the provided t
We were a bit confused, and it was our first time in Doha.
We expected no interest.
The audience interaction was amazing.
It had been a long time since music had any benefits.
Let's hear some lyrics from a song you composed, for example, and it was well-received by the audience, especially the youth.
Let's hear some words, too, and show them to the viewers.
We might hear it live.
Feel free to take your time.
Welcome, Salim.
I'm the problem because my words are a bit lacking.
Let's hear it.
I don't know.
We have with us now the Doha Morning Show.
One wakes up in the morning with an open mind.
Salman is like a mountain; he's been in rap for five years now.
One should not accept being poor.
I brought a lot of people to their comfort zone.
I need to learn some new words.
# Song Lyrics Translation Okay, give me a sentence from one of the songs you've sung, for example.
# Free Style He, listen, not all songs are random, you know. What he said just now, they call it 'free style' in English.
It means the same meter.
We compose the lyrics with intention when we sing a song.
Thank you, let's keep an eye on it.
We can say good morning my country, good morning Qatar with the Sabah Al-Doha program.
Stay tuned, we're live on air, broadcasting directly to our viewers.
They see one, one, two, one. What do they do? They showcase a bit of their art.
# صباح الدوحة # Doha Morning Show
Of course, the beautiful song you saw.
I'm insisting that the youth be present online and everywhere.
Hello, I'm actually greeting you. When did you record it?
Common it was common
Each one of us, each one of us, each one
I feel like Youssef can't quite grasp my words, or he takes them but can't quite process them.
Every man takes words.
We definitely expect that every artist, every painter, and every poet is always [untranslatable].
It's also possible to write about one's love for sports.
In love with the homeland itself.
Surely you participated in the National Day celebrations through the parade.
Through beautiful songs, you Qatari youths also represent Qatar.
Doha is all dressed up to welcome the Asian Cup, and there's a big parade on the Corniche.
To welcome this event.
We are bringing you these clips to capture the reception, of course.
Doha welcomes the Asian Cup
I'm at Doha Airport, going onwards.
We continue together with these live shots.
To have the support of these fans, the presence of such an audience, and our students as players, it's incredible.
I arrived at an early hour this morning at Doha Airport, Asia Cup to complete...
Preparations for hosting the grand continental event.
Let's go back to our guests, Yusuf and Salman, who are lighting up the studio.
I'm afraid I can't translate the text as it is not clear and seems to be incomplete. Please provide a coherent sentence or phrase for an accurate translation.
We can't really say that about you.
By God, it means we are currently, you know.
I'm preparing for a party, but it's not definite.
We're currently working on a specific event, and it will be announced, God willing, Yusuf.
Inshallah, hopefully, but it's not definite, it's still at the beginning of the journey.
# Journey's Beginning We wish you all the best and I'm certain that our program, God willing, will be your support, God willing, with all our hearts.
Also, where do you guys hang out as a group of twenty-five young people?
Where is the meeting held? How do you put ideas together? How do you write them down?
There definitely need to be some collaborations on songs.
It's not necessary for, say, Salman or Yusuf or any one of them to sing an entire song.
We need to have several harmonies between us, where we meet, and when we meet.
By God, you know, twenty-five people is quite a challenge to gather all at once.
I'll start talking to Youssef, and I'll talk to that guy, and I'll talk to them so we can maybe meet up today at some place.
In order to get a feel for the song's idea and lyrics.
He's on his way, taking a different route this time.
I'm registering what's on me.
Deaf to him as he speaks.
This is bacon for you, Yusuf. He will register and he will respond, he will respond and send me a little.
Do you see the experiences that are available outside?
You buy some CDs from big artists.
You'll gain some experience, you'll learn a few techniques from them.
Hey, of course, we always do.
Artists who have been in this field for years or those who have experience and a well-established position in this industry.
One hears them, sees their methods and ways, and tries to develop their own style, without imitating them.
I mean, what if I did the same as him, with the same tone of voice and the same level of words?
I'm just imitating myself, I'm not doing anything new, I'm doing something unique to me.
We can use them a little.
Yes, I also expect there to be a large group of young Gulf nationals in the Gulf itself.
In a primitive manner, we follow this report together, learn, and also enjoy watching it together.
The enigma still shrouds that talent which some people possess.
Using very primitive means.
Abu Ibrahim Abdullah al-Dail

One hundred and fifty kilometers.
He possesses exceptional ability and extensive expertise.
# Detection of Shallow Groundwater Sites
In depths beyond a hundred meters
You know that drilling wells is expensive.
He can determine the appropriate location to dig the well with the expert's help.
Of course, the method of discovery or
Locate the water source.
She has been since ancient times.
They were the glory of our fathers and grandfathers of old.
They use experts to locate the wells.
Dig.
Abu Ibrahim's methods in water detection.
There are no modern devices.
A soil analysis in scientific laboratories.
He relies solely on God's grace in his work.
Her canals are beneath the ground.
She is either aar or aar ewood.
A branch of pomegranate or a branch of fig.
Now we are putting into practice the process of watercourse detection.
Start now, go back, this is the end of the stream.
Come back again.
Go back, go back.
# **Translation:** This is the original source now, so if you want to go back, you can put a marker here.
Here's the translation: And here the watercourse ends.
It requires great expertise and long patience.
In order for the explorer to access the motion sensor's sensitivity.
I traveled to more than one region.
Success rate of ninety-five percent.
Of course, this is the method and the way to use copper rods.
There is, of course, no precise scientific explanation.
This is the way.
It is surprising that the success rate of those practicing this primitive profession is high.
Over ninety-five percent.
# Surface Groundwater Exploration
"Glory to God, who has taught man that which he did not know. This is, of course, the report that we have taken, of course, from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."
They formed a special unit for them and ended up with more than one CD.
It means whether it's on the internet or some of them on the phone.

There's an issue, an issue, it means, well, various topics and so on.
Imitate him or see my role model, I see that there isn't any.
Insha'Allah.
We also want to take a few at the same time.
It also means a large collection of songs.
We're trying as much as possible to spread it.
Let's stay in touch with you like this from time to time.
We also know the latest news about this band.
I just want to emphasize the name of the band.
# رابِرز
We return again, our guests are still here, and we go back to the corniche and the beautiful atmosphere.
We are definitely live with you, streaming directly through the live link that we are sharing with you, our viewers.
Wherever you are on the corniche, celebrating the Asian Cup win.
We are certainly proud of them and proud of the diverse arts.
# Mental Health Awareness: Addressing Youth's Social
Yuna is in the studio with two people.
They'll definitely make it to twenty-five.
Welcome back, Abu Yusuf and Salman. May God bless you again.
Stop the subscription once.
Let's try to get to the company, but we don't know where it is. No one is answering us.
I need to improve myself, at least the one out there exists.
Facebook YouTube
This translates to: "Websites like these."
In the name of the band.
We're always here, we're available whenever you need us.
You guys are so organized, just like we saw with each other, mashallah, you've done this work so well.
You use these songs, you put them together with a collection of images, your personal photos.
He and they uploaded it on YouTube. They uploaded it on websites where videos can be found and followed.
By God, we have stayed here before.
There are so many songs.
Overcoming the obstacles you're facing, there is no need for a company to adopt you.
You really need a place that brings you together as a team.
What are your wishes that you truly desire to come true and reach the level of sophistication you aspire to?
I guess we just have to bear it now.
Let's get going, we're counting down, organizing, and bringing you an album.
Is it serious?
It's been five years now.
It's just a lot, nothing more.
Yes, we participated in many things. We participated in programs. We participated in TV series.
I wish to evolve and become.
If he means something to us, it means he supports us, so we'll always be with him.
Yes, we also want to know your wishes, Salman, apart from Yusuf's wishes. What might you say?
The only wish, almost, is the music video.
Insha'Allah, we wish you all the best, God willing, through this team.
Kindness, and we hope, God willing, that your songs will always be present in the Arab world, in the world.
This is indeed a sophisticated art, an art that is widely appreciated.
And it contains messages, as you mentioned.
Good luck, inshallah, always, and we wish you all the best, God willing.
Send my regards to the whole group, and good luck, God willing.
We will conclude this meeting with the song they made for the show.
# صباح الدوحة Good morning, this is KD and DJ Mister Bobo, live on the Doha Morning Show.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

We have Nasser Al-Maliki with us as the director. The guests of the episode are Rappers Qatar.
# Reuse, Reduce, Recycle Reuse means doing it again and benefiting from it at home.
There's something in this shopping cart.
Do you mean this? "Do you put the person who shops in the car, at the supermarket or elsewhere?"
I'll buy whatever you put in the cart, buy whatever you feel like.
A large screen appears, showing you the components of this item.
This idea was also brilliant and feasible.
Just a barcode scanner in the car detects this item.
"It makes it easier for the buyer to purchase."
He takes full details on a private screen.
I expect there will be a greater health awareness.
When I'm in the same car as you, whether it's your device or mine.

Do you want the full details included?
He is ambitious, he had a number of projects, maybe four or five.
Solves traffic problems.
Traffic congestion and parking issues are being addressed, and they are also quite creative and very nice, I mean.
Māshā'allāh Also, the Child Culture Center.
Let's also talk, Professor Abdullah, about the various activities we will hopefully see in the coming days.
Yes, indeed, there are surprises, of course. But they passed by quickly.
Ideas, if you like, I can mention some of the projects that were presented.
This is an innovative idea for underground transportation. Its main smart feature is...
Everyone who leaves their house has a purpose.
They gather at a specific point.
These are, of course, all the pictures that the viewers are watching, I expect them to enjoy them.
Children's Innovations
Exactly yes, this is like the same as the cash machine.
Women, for example, I have a card.
Insert this card, I say, for example, I need a black T-shirt.
This is an example, now in some stores or even in my house, I have some missing items, like a key, I don't know what for.
I lost, for example, the office keys.
We certainly have a main objective, which is to achieve Her Highness Sheikha Mozah's vision.
# His Highness' Court
By a period of time at an early stage, and this has utmost importance in project design.
The number was also selected from among three hundred children.
We also have promising speakers for Ramadan.
Yes, she was the one who hosted the closing ceremony; she's a presenter.
We'd love to open our hearts and doors to all children who wish to present their programs.
They set off after them.
Our need for their support is also essential, and their presence is a top priority for us.
These projects and programs serve this main idea.
Despite the varying skills and diverse talents of children
# Personal Development
# Collaboration with Youth Clubs in Qatar We have established great partnerships with various youth clubs across Qatar.
There are also scientific clubs available in Qatar.
We naturally build all our programs on partnerships.
All our programs are specialized partnerships.
We also have a range of specialized community service institutions dedicated to developing these skills.
He is in partnership with all institutions interested in the field.
The Society The Society of Photonics
Center for Girls' Innovation, the General Secretariat of the Council of Ministers, also played a very significant role.
Yes, he played a significant role in explaining Qatar's vision.
Training children on it.
Attracting and encouraging children, as all our programs are based on institutional partnerships.
According to the specialization of these projects and institutions.
What changed you guys?
Of course, our presence in Katara gave us a strong boost and provided us with great support.
The fastest shape.
Of course, there is a set of projects in partnership with Katara that we are currently preparing to launch, God willing, within the next two months.
"Of course, there is collaboration in many programs."
Especially what concerns reading.
Chairman of the Supreme Council for Family Affairs
We're walking through it now, especially now, during this time of preparation.
Building a promising scientific future for all children, future generations, and the upcoming youth, God willing.
# Let's Get Started! I'd like to address parents, young people who follow us, and children who wish to be a part of our center.
What we give now.
Sometimes our children have ideas that we should neither underestimate nor belittle.
We must pay attention to these ideas, no matter what they are.
# The Power of Ideas Because truly, whoever embraces this idea, their interest in it will foster the development of this concept. At the very least, it will cultivate a child's love for thinking.
This is very important that I take care of the interest.
I connect with him spiritually. I connect with him now. Our big problem is that most fathers...
He is provided with support.
Encourages him, so we urge parents and educators.
Children today are our future; they are the foundation of this future. Let's give their imagination more attention.
We've actually lived and wandered through their projects at this exhibition.
I live in a dream.
There are thoughts in a dream, all of them are very broad fantasy.
Now the dream means a definite reality, many dreams have come true and become a reality.
Alhamdulillah, we hope, God willing, for the success of our children who were present.
Our hopes are pinned on you, God willing.
By His permission.
We are of all ages and both genders.
I have completed seventy projects.
Pioneering and innovative projects are being implemented.
To talk more about this exhibition.
The National and the Cultural Center for Childhood as well.
Professor Abdullah, also at the beginning, so briefly tell us about the exhibition.
What lies within it brings together a multitude of events; so, in brief, what can we say about this exhibition?
A new way for children to express their love, loyalty, and belonging to their homeland.
Of course, it was held under the patronage of the Minister of Education and Higher Education.
At the exhibition tour, this exhibition came.
He starts to grow with him until he reaches twenty, thirty.
Of course, we started training the children to see the twenty-thirtieth degree with its five axes.
Human development, economic development, sustainable development, and environmental development.
First, he knows now, Qatar in twenty thirty, where will it reach?
He then starts thinking about how his way of thinking.
How does he innovate and be creative, come up with creative ideas?
I'm expecting this, you know, his field is vast, praise be to God.
However, when we give him certain symbols and help him.
I expect his thinking will grow even bigger and more.
Professor, you launched the exhibition under the title "Dreams of Generations, Realities of Tomorrow."
Her slogan is the dreams of today's generations.
He will be a part of tomorrow's Qatar, Qatar's future.
We actually experienced this while wandering with the children; when the child speaks, he says, "Your Excellency, the minister."
I want you to inaugurate my project. I invite you to visit my project on the 20th of the 30th.
The child thinks about twenty years later.
I am passionate about my homeland, especially in the field of [insert field].
Surely, it is accompanied by various activities, events, and competitions.
"One of them was the winner of the Stars of Science award."
He was also among the winners of the first prize for the League of Arab States.
Of course all the children.
On the sidelines of the exhibition, there were various showcases on a specific schedule.
They presented their projects, which they had carried out during the exhibition.
Alhamdulillah, what a remarkable presence.
# نجوم العلوم Stars of Science
Some of the winners of the projects I participated in the exhibition.
She also won one of the main awards.
The forest or the reserve.
Let's also talk about the colorful ball.
We were, of course, also part of the vision and the children's dream of Qatar's future.
Also think of twenty two twenty two.
How can a child contribute to an innovative idea project for twenty twenty-twenty?
# My main idea is to have a chip embedded in the ball.
# **English Translation:** # Gives color upon judgment
If she goes, for example, over there, it means everyone is watching the referee's movements with this ball.
He controls the movements of the ball on the field and observes the changes through this electronic device.
There is no definitive translation for
Ideas, of course, creative, of course, is the main idea. Many people may find it surprising, they ask us.
These are the projects.
We always say we haven't reached the kids.
At this stage, they are developing these skills and broadening their horizons.
I gave them an idea of how to express their love for the nation through these projects.
I can explain it to the audience, present my project, and confidently express my idea.
In his areas of interest, in something he loves, all of this is considered an achievement, an achievement.
He offered support, which was appreciated and he deserves thanks for that.
You are now entering the development stages and
In supporting KSA, with support from the committee, and I expect support from the public as well.
The forest was not second, it was the forest, because this child was.
Method of subscribers' entry, channels that are pipes that visitors enter underground.
# The Grand Nature Reserve ## A Vast Wilderness
The visitor can stroll around and see the animals, I mean, the reptiles, beneath the earth.
We sense some animals and a research center that measures the condition of animals.
In the marine environment and entering it in an innovative way as well.
Her imagination, which is vast and detailed, is also a reason for her success.
This, of course, led her family to...
In nature, of course, one speaks of a tourist city under the underwater.
Who's talking about a city for butterflies?
In who speaks of a forest, a forest above the ground.
Who's talking about many travel ideas?
She's exciting.
Perhaps this is what children's minds need now, perhaps in 2030, 2050.
In the future, maybe these things will actually come true.
There are three projects.
I need these projects now; I want to work on them.
Project, for example, like the LLC water air conditioners.
I'm reading the Arabs' newspaper now.
Qatar University celebrates graduation.
In the presence of His Excellency Mr. Saad bin Ibrahim Al-Mahmoud.
Minister of Education and Higher Education Secretary General of the Supreme Education Council

We are also happy to read this good news about our students.
A pioneering academic achievement, God willing, and we wish them success, God willing, in all specialties, God willing.
He is one of the young rising stars making a strong impact on the Qatari drama scene.
Until when also classifications and colorful threads
Abdulhamid Al-Sharshani, the artist, is considered among those artists who made themselves.
If it weren't convincing.
He would not have been chosen to be involved in the operations carried out within Qatar.
Abdulhamid Al-Sharshani is currently starring in the series *The Killer Feeling* and *Tasaneef* part two.
We are pleased to have our guest this morning.
Let's talk to him about his involvement in these two important projects and about his overall experience.
Hello and welcome, good morning.
# Good Morning Doha Welcome to the show, this is our first time meeting, and it's your first time joining us on Good Morning Doha.
People who are tired of the program are leaving.
You are Lisa's sister.
Welcome, let's begin our conversation.
Come on, let's see.
I am a responsible and administrative man.
I enforce the laws.
All I can tell you is...
Bring the bisht.
Then listen, why are you coming to me?
Go and see if anyone agreed that you don't have to return the bisht.
I had another question to start with, of course, but since we watched this clip from the series "Tassaneef," part one.
Khaled bin Al-Waleed.
Some historians attribute the great poet Imru' al-Qays to the city of Muwat.
There are many things and information associated with this city in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
For more, we continue with this beautiful report by our colleague Abdulrahman Marshad.
We stay in touch.
It is certainly a testament from one who knows neither flattery nor favoritism.
Emphasizing the rich heritage of this city or that.
As much as we witness its effects and hear what has been said about it from its narrators and poets.
Their old and new, all of it adds up to a remarkable record for the city's history.
The city of Madinah is one of the cities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
It is a country with a rich historical background, dating back to the pre-Islamic era.
Historians disagree on the reason for its naming.
There are those who attribute it to Imru' al-Qays, the renowned poet of the Kindah tribe.
By the pool to which he is attributed.
She was founded at an unknown date.
Pre-Islamic Era
The most famous thing in the city of Marrat is Jebel Kumait, which is a well-known saying.
He is in the city and attached to it.
These are also archaeological sites.
# Al-Hijr Archaeological Site This site is renowned for its impressive rock-cut architecture and ancient inscriptions, making it a significant tourist attraction in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Merat Municipality exerted Herculean efforts to carry out [the task/project/initiative].
I'm atop this mountain, in the park.
Sessions for the parents and all the residents of the kingdom.
Khaled Bin Al-Waleed, may God be pleased with him, was a great companion of the Prophet, and the city was named after him.
To combat the apostates and Musaylimah the liar.
Ghadir-e-Kimite is also one of its effects.
# Wadi It is a place where floods gather, and it stores water for an extended period.
One of the most important water sources in the past was...
One of its effects is also a house that clarifies the heritage.
Madinat al-Zahra, a city with pre-Islamic origins.
She is renowned for her poets whose poetry ignited their passion.
# Mount Komet and its Beauty With its beauty, landmarks, and the renowned Mount Komet.
Abdulrahman Al-Marshed in the program Sabah Al-Doha.
Madinah Maradht north of Riyadh.
We are back once again with our esteemed guests.
I wish we were informed and the viewers were informed about these methods and these means.
We, as I mentioned earlier, have a very unique infrastructure.
We open a page for him, he gets registered, and has a dedicated file on our system.
The email of his/her guardian.
This distraction increases the speed of writing, the speed of reading, and the overall level of distraction.
The guardian will have full custody.
This temptation is a good addition to the student's file.
He registered his son online.
He sees the extent of his son's progress.
He checks his grades and also his attention with the teachers.
We truly enjoy the intelligence of this beautiful child.
We brought most of the children who are at the center and send them our warmest greetings.
I entered this center with Professor Tayyeb, who is present through this center.
She demonstrates her intelligence and the level she has reached, of course, by joining this center.
Of course, this year.
I'll focus on work after Ramadan.
This approach, of course, would be unfair as it would overshadow other works. Always.
There are people who only watch TV in Ramadan.
He stays up late watching TV, and the people spend the worship month with the TV.
# Drama Series Ease up, lighten up, lighten up on the drama series. Let it air over two years, it's better that way.
Of course.
Inshallah, they accept me in Ramadan.
Best regards, I hope to greet you all.
And, God willing.
Also, in the plays that
Of course, from the art of drama to the art of fashion.
Fashion show was held at Katara Cultural Village.
We are definitely continuing with you, with all our love and sincerity.
Enhances children's abilities and skills to a greater extent.
Different schools, different paths, all present in this generous nation.
We definitely have a model; we talked to our guests who were with us.
Now with us is Professor Ibrahim Hussein Abdulsalam. Welcome and good morning.
How are you, Amna?
Praise be to God.
By which page are you currently?
Professor Ibrahim, let's first introduce the materials that are offered through this center.
As an example, let's consider Sister Amna.
I will also go over the style or approach that Professor Naseem mentioned.
He feels like there's a change in his mind, a shift in his thinking.
You feel that these skills and these methods
Things will change regarding his skills, his mind, and even his educational level.
Scientific methods
I initially conduct a global test called the TONI test for the child before they start anything else in my program.
I'll start working on the second part of the test in Tunisian as well.
We can measure the student's level of understanding through it, or the level of difference in their understanding.
We are now going to take a test or some quick math questions.
I will be answering live on air, instantly.
Of course, Amna has no idea about these questions at all.
We are concerned about this matter.
Sure, I had another question to start with.
Do you mind telling us about your participation this year in the second part?
What is your contribution that you want to tell us about?
"Of course, after we presented the series Tasaneef One."
Of course, Alhamdulillah, Allah has blessed me with several roles.
Professor Ghanem
Distribute the roles, of course, with the executive director Ashraf Shohata and the great professor.
Of course, an opportunity from Tar Company for artistic production.
Sara7a haq al shabab.
Professor Ghaneem, of course, nominated me this year for maybe.
Of course, each episode is different.
I'll be doing some character designs in a few episodes.
Sure, here is the translation: On the contrary, it's a nice experience, of course, the team is here.
The Pyramid, one of Kuwait's pyramids, starring Saad Al-Faraj.
We have artists from Bahrain: Abdullah Malik, Ali Al Gharair.
Ali Mirza is like a gem among us.
We have a group of young people with us: Abdullah, Adham.
We still have Abdullah Al-Asem among the young people.
We've been working two jobs a year for ages.
Maybe that's why, before the wind, I asked you when you were born in '97.
I couldn't achieve my dream or ambition in art.
Alhamdulillah for everything.
Did you study art formally, or is it just a hobby?
I don't have it as a talent.
I took art as a talent, of course, the one who supported and believed in me at the beginning was the artist Abdulaziz Jasim.
I consider myself as a person like his son among the artists.
I can talk to anyone about anything.
Sure, we're in for the whole series.
We got up, gave it our all, and thank God.
Now, I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to Professor Abdulrahman Al-Sulaiti. A big, big thank you to Professor Abdulrahman.
You're comparing us to Kuwait, right? In Kuwait, every year, there are twelve to thirteen new actors that emerge. Why is that?
They have it.
Certainly, the gratitude is immense. You're offering opportunities.
Let's just say
We talked about the series Al-Sani, we discussed its categories, and we got an idea about it.
The Killer Feeling Violin
The foot is also a man's foot.
We have with us a definite model, with us is the processor, Professor Abdulaziz Al-Ma'euf Al-Tamimi.
This process will be performed live.
Let's see how we can address the personality, for instance. First, let me greet Professor Sobhi Abdullah. May God bless you.
Hello, welcome. May peace and God's mercy be upon you.
Let's begin with you, professor. Please go ahead.
Insha'Allah.
In the name of God, of course.
We hold hands.
I see nerves.
It's as if it's a drawing or a message from God Almighty, illustrating all the members of your body.
From the inside, what are its problems?
I sometimes feel dizzy.
Headache and dizziness.
Lower your hand, relax, keep your nerves calm. Yes.
Thus, Professor Abdulaziz will discover a particular job through his hands, indicating that he suffers from a certain illness.
The one on the left has a mild inflammation in his middle ear.
Ouch, that feels good, Professor Abdulaziz.
Do you have an ear problem?
I've been creating since I was little.
Here, I feel the pain even more.
# Sinusitis
Pain in the nose, you'll get a headache here.
I have a headache here.
He has sinus problems.
She's giving me a headache between the eyes.
The weight increases without eating.
His thyroid is a bit underactive. You have fatigue and sluggishness. There's always a feeling of heaviness in the body.
Excessive sleep.
He sleeps too much, always tired, his body feels so heavy.
# Chronic Tonsillitis Chronic
Do you see the trembling? Are you noticing the tremors?
He's stressed, and of course you never walk barefoot, maybe for the last time.
Brother from Tunisia, hello.
Masha'Allah, you've told us some things about him.

Professor Mr. Abdulaziz Al-Jaber, founder and director of the Qatar Multiple Sclerosis Association, welcome.
We try to focus on most important topics as much as we can.
We thought it would be nice to introduce ourselves and let our beloved viewers know what multiple sclerosis is.
Because this title might also be a bit strange for us. Please go ahead.

Surely treatments.
The most important functions in the human body can be severely disrupted.
I have this disease, a disease called sclerosis.
Theories suggest it's a viral transition.
It is a non-contagious disease.
It does not pass on to children.
Some consider it a disease, depending on the region.
Equator was, for example, completely spared from this disease.
We currently have cases on the equator infected with this disease.
This disease currently has no known cure as the cause remains unknown.
So far, scientists are unable to determine the cause of the disease in order to find a cure.
The current operation is a reverse operation.
They try to avoid the impact of the disease itself on the human body.
They're trying to start from the back, in other words.
We might be a little afraid of this topic, which means we can say that this disease might come suddenly.

My number was forty-four or forty-six.
Does the person show any symptoms that indicate he actually has this disease?
We don't have confirmation that it's a virus, so we don't want to adopt a specific theory. That's the point.
# Point two: How do I know if I am infected or not?
This is extremely difficult.
I am lost, Professor Abdulaziz, through my attempts to find a specific point.
