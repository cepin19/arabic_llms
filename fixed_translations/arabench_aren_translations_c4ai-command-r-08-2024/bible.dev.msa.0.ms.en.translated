The birth of Jesus Christ happened like this: His mother Mary was betrothed to a man named Joseph. But before they came together, she was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit.
Joseph, her husband, was a good man, and he did not wish to expose her, so he decided to let her go quietly.
Joseph was pondering these things when an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
"She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."
This happened so that what the Lord had spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled:
"Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall name him Immanuel, which means, 'God with us.'"
When Joseph woke up, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took his wife into his home.
He did not know her until she gave birth to the child whom he named "Jesus."
Wise men from the East.
When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem,
"They asked, 'Where is the child who has been born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east and have come to worship him.' "
King Herod was disturbed when he heard this, as were all the people of Jerusalem.
Herod summoned all the chief priests and scribes of the people and enquired of them where the Christ was to be born.
"And they said to him, 'In the city of Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, for so it is written by the prophet:'"
"O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, you are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who will govern my people Israel."
Herod summoned the wise men and met with them privately, and learned from them the exact time when the star had appeared.
Go then and search for the child. When you have found him, bring me word, so that I too may go and worship him.
The wise men listened to the king and then departed. And behold, the star that they had seen in the east went before them until it came and stood over the place where the child was.
They rejoiced exceedingly when they saw the star.
They entered the house and saw the child with Mary, his mother; they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
Then God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod, so they departed for their own country by another route. Flight into Egypt.
Arise, take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.
Joseph arose and took the child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt.
He remained there until the death of Herod, so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, “Out of Egypt I called My Son.” # Matthew 2:15 Herod killed the children in Bethlehem.
When Herod realized that he had been deceived by the wise men, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and all the surrounding region who were two years old and under, according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise men.
Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Jeremiah:
A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping. It is Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted, because they are no more. The return from Egypt.
After Herod's death, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream in Egypt.
He said to him, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child's life are dead."
Joseph arose and took the child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he went away to the district of Galilee,
He settled in a town called Nazareth. This happened to fulfill what was said by the prophets, that the Messiah would be called a Nazarene. #Nazarene. 23:2 Named after the city of Nazareth. It also resembles the Hebrew word meaning "branch," as mentioned in Isaiah 11:1, referring to the promise of the Messiah's coming from the lineage of David.
John the Baptist
In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea,
"He was saying, 'Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.'"
John is the one of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke when he said, "A voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'
John wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and his diet consisted of locusts and wild honey.
At that time, people began to come from Jerusalem, from all over Judea, and from the region around the Jordan River to hear him.
He baptized them in the Jordan River after they confessed their sins.
"When John saw that many Pharisees and Sadducees were coming to be baptized, he said to them, 'You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?'"
Bear fruit worthy of repentance.
Do not boast by saying, "We are descendants of Abraham." I tell you that God is able to raise up children of Abraham from these stones.
Behold, the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water for repentance, but the one who is coming after me is more powerful than I. I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
He will thresh his threshing floor thoroughly, and will gather his wheat into the barn; but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire." The Baptism of Jesus
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River, to be baptized by John.
John, however, tried to prevent him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, so why do you come to me?"
Jesus answered him, «Let it be so now, for it is through this that all righteousness may be fulfilled.» Then John consented to baptize him.
Jesus was baptized, and as he came up out of the water, the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him.
A voice from heaven said, "You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased."
The Trial of Jesus
And Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
After fasting forty days and forty nights, Jesus was hungry.
The tempter came to him. Now the tempter was the Devil. And he said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread.”
"But Jesus answered, 'It is written, "Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God."'"
Then Satan took him to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple.
He said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written, 'He will command his angels concerning you,' and 'On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'
"Jesus answered him, 'It is also written: "Do not put the Lord your God to the test."'"
Then Satan led him up to a high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
"He said to him, 'I will give all these things to you if you will bow down and worship me.'"
Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! for it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.' "
Then Satan left him, and behold, angels came and served him. Jesus began his ministry in Galilee.
When Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he returned to Galilee.
He did not remain in Nazareth, but went and settled in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
This happened to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet Isaiah:
# The Land of Zebulun and Naphtali The land of Zebulun and Naphtali, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.
The people dwelling in darkness have seen a great light, and for those sitting in the land of the shadow of death, a light has dawned.
From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus chooses some of his disciples.
As Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon, who is also called Peter, and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
"He said to them, 'Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.'"
They dropped their nets immediately and followed him.
Jesus moved on from there and saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets, and Jesus called out to them.
They immediately left the boat and their father and followed him. Jesus was teaching and healing.
Jesus was traveling throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom. And he healed every disease and every sickness among the people.
And the news about him spread throughout all of Syria, and they brought to him all those who were sick with various diseases and torments, those possessed by evil spirits, those suffering from epilepsy, and those paralyzed, and Jesus healed them.
A great multitude followed him from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.
Jesus' teaching.
And when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him,
And he began to speak and to teach them, saying:
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are the humble, for they shall inherit the earth. #TheyWillInheritTheEarth. 5:5 See Psalm 37: 11. Here, it may refer to a future spiritual inheritance.
Blessed are the hungry and thirsty for righteousness, #for seeking God's will. 6:5 Literally: "To justice." For God will satisfy them.
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me.
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward will be great in heaven. For so they persecuted the prophets who were before you. You are the salt of the earth and the light of the world.
You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men.
You are the light of the world. A city built on a mountain cannot be hidden.
People don't light a lamp and put it under a bowl! Instead, they put it on a stand and raise it up so that it gives light to everyone in the house.
"In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven." Jesus and the Law of Moses.
# The Gospel of Matthew 5:17-18 "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished."
"I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will be erased from the Law until everything is accomplished."
"Therefore, whoever breaks the least of these commandments and teaches others to do so will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever obeys and teaches these commandments will be called greatest in the kingdom of heaven."
# Matthew 5:20 For I say unto you, that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. Wrath.
"You know that it was said to your ancestors, 'Do not murder. #Do not murder. Exodus 20:13, Deuteronomy 5:17. Whoever murders shall be brought to judgment.'"
# Matthew 5:22 But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, 'Raca,' is answerable to the court. And anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell.
Therefore, if you bring your gift to the altar and there remember that your friend has something against you,
# Matthew 5:24 So leave your gift there in front of the altar, go and make things right with your brother or sister, and then come back and offer your gift.
Quickly subdue your opponent, as you walk with him on the way to the court. Otherwise, he will deliver you to the judge, and the judge will hand you over to the jailer, who will throw you into prison.
I tell you the truth, you will not get out of there until you have paid the last penny. Adultery.
"You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit adultery.' #No adultery. 27:5 From Exodus 20:14 and Deuteronomy 5:18."
I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
# Matthew 5:30 And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and cast it from you. For it is better that you should lose one of your members, than that your whole body should be thrown into hell. Divorce.
"It was also said: 'When a man divorces his wife, he must give her a certificate of divorce.' #If he divorces ... let it be so. 31:5 from Deuteronomy 24:1."
I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for immorality, makes her commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
"You have heard that it was said to those of ancient times, 'You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn.' #Do not break your oath ... to the Lord. 33:5 See Leviticus 19:12, Numbers 30:2, and Deuteronomy 23:21."
I say to you: Do not swear at all.
Do not swear, neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God, nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet, #footstool. 35:5, meaning it is under his authority. Nor by the holy city, for it is the city of the great King.
Swear not by your head, for you cannot make a single hair of it white or black.
If you say yes, say yes. If you say no, say no. Anything beyond that comes from evil. #Evil. 37:5 Satan. Resist evil.
"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.' #The_eye ... for a tooth. 38:5 From Exodus 21:24 and Leviticus 24:20."
I say to you: do not resist evil. But if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other one to him as well.
If anyone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.
If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him or her two miles.
If anyone asks you for something, give it to him. Do not refuse the one who wants to borrow from you. Love everyone.
"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven. 43:5, Leviticus 19:18."
I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.
# Matthew 5:45 So that you may be children of your Father in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.
If you love only those who love you, what reward will you get? Is that not even what the tax collectors do?
If you only greet your brothers, what do you do more than others? Do not even the pagans do the same?
Therefore, you shall be perfect, just as your heavenly Father is perfect.
# Tender
Beware of practicing your piety publicly, for then you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.
When you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by people. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full.
When you give to those in need, let not your left hand know what your right hand does.
Let your giving be in secret. And your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. Prayer.
# **Matthew 6:5** But when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. And your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
# Prayer and Understanding "And when you pray, do not repeat meaningless words, as the pagans do, for they think that they will be heard because of their many words."
So do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need even before you ask Him.
Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,
Let your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us.
# 13:6 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. #The Evil One. 13:6 Satan (the Devil). For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever. Amen.
If you forgive others for their offenses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
If you do not forgive others for their offenses, neither will your Father forgive your offenses. Fasting.
When you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they change their appearance so that their fasting may be noticed by people. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,
# **English Translation:** So that people do not notice you are fasting. Your Father, whom you cannot see, sees it. Then your Father, who sees what happens in secret, will reward you. God or money?
Store not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
Store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is good, your whole body will be full of light.
If your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
"No one can serve two masters. For a slave will either hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth. #Wealth. 24:6 Literally, 'Mamona,' an Aramaic word meaning 'wealth,' in its negative sense, as it represents here a god whom people serve instead of God. The kingdom of God first."
# Matthew 6:25 Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will wear. For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing.
Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
Who among you can add an hour to their life by worrying?
"Why are you worried about what you will wear? Consider how the lilies of the field grow; they neither toil nor spin."
But I say to you, not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of these.
If God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
Do not worry and do not ask yourselves, "What shall we eat?" or "What shall we drink?" or "What shall we wear?"
But your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.
Do not worry about tomorrow, for each day has enough troubles of its own, and tomorrow will have its own worries.
Judging others.
Do not judge others, lest God judge you.
# Matthew 7:2 For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.

Do not give what is holy to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces. Persevere in asking.

For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it shall be opened.
If any of you asks his son for a loaf of bread, will he offer him a stone?
If he asks for a fish, does he give him a live one?
You, though evil, know how to give good gifts to your children. So, will not your Father who is in heaven much more give good things to those who ask him? The Golden Rule.
"So as you would like others to treat you, so must you treat them. This is the essence of Moses' law and the teaching of the prophets. The way to heaven and the way to hell."
Enter through the narrow gate, which leads to heaven. For the gate that leads to destruction is wide, and the road is easy to follow, and many are those who enter through it.

Every one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.

"For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I say to this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."

He said, "Go outside. The girl is not dead, she's only sleeping." They laughed at him.
When the people had gone out of the house, Jesus entered the room where the girl was and took her by the hand, and she arose.
And Jesus' fame spread throughout all that region. Jesus heals two blind men // and casts out an evil spirit.
And when Jesus had departed from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out and saying, "Son of David, have mercy on us!"
When Jesus entered the house, the two blind men came to him. Jesus asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to heal you?" They answered, "Yes, Lord."
"Then he touched their eyes and said, 'According to your faith let it be done to you.'"
"The two blind men regained their sight. Then Jesus sternly warned them, 'Don't tell anyone about this.'"
They went and spread the news throughout that region.
As they were going along, some people brought to Jesus a man who was possessed by demons and could not speak, for whenever the demon saw Jesus, he threw the man into convulsions.
Jesus drove out the evil spirit, and the mute man began to speak. The people were amazed and said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons." The harvest is plentiful.
Jesus was going about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom. And he healed every disease and every infirmity among the people.
When Jesus saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Jesus said to his disciples: "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
# Matthew 9:38 "Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest."
Jesus sends his disciples.
Jesus called the twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon, who is also called Peter, and his brother Andrew, James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John,
Phillips and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the tax collector, James son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus,
Simon, also known as "the Zealot," #Zealot. 4:10 From a Jewish political party resisting Roman rule, called the Zealots. And Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus.
Jesus sent out these twelve and gave them these instructions: "Don't go anywhere among the Gentiles, and don't enter any Samaritan town.
Go, therefore, and make disciples of all the nations.
The kingdom of heaven is at hand.
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. You received power to do these things without cost, so give without cost.
Do not carry gold, silver, or copper coins in your belts.
# **Matthew 10:10** Take no bag for your journey, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor walking sticks; for the laborer deserves his food.
# Missionaries' Instructions And when you enter any city or village, seek out a worthy person to receive you, and remain in their home until you leave that city.
When you enter a house, greet its people.
If the household is worthy, your peace will come upon them. If they are not worthy, your peace will return to you.
If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your message, shake the dust off your feet as you leave their house or town.
I tell you the truth, it will be more bearable for the people of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town. Jesus warns of tribulations.
Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and harmless as doves.
Beware of people, for they will hand you over to be tried in their courts and flogged in their synagogues.
They will deliver you to councils and before governors because of me, as testimony to them and to the Gentiles.
When they arrest you, do not worry about what you will say, for the right words will be given to you at that time.
Remember that it is not you who will speak, but the Spirit of your Father will speak through you.
"The brother will hand over his brother to be killed, and the father will deliver up his child. Children will rebel against their parents and put them to death."
# Matthew 10:22 But all people will hate you because of my name. But he who endures to the end, he will be saved.
When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next. I tell you the truth, you will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
There is no student better than his teacher, nor a slave greater than his master.
Let the disciple be content to become as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they call the master of the house Beelzebul, #Beelzebul. 25:10 One of the names of the devil. A reference to Matthew 9:34. then how much more will they malign the rest of his household? It is the fear of God, not of man, that is needed.
Fear them not, for nothing hidden will not be made known, and nothing covered will not be proclaimed.
Speak what you hear in the dark, proclaim it from the housetops.
Fear not those who kill the body, but cannot kill the soul; rather, fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
"Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father's will."
So do not be afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows.
Do not fear; you are of more value than many sparrows. Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven.
"Everyone who acknowledges me before others, I will acknowledge them before my Father in heaven."
# **English Translation:** And whoever denies me before people, I will deny them before my Father in heaven. Christ first.
"Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword!"
I came to divide a man from his father, a daughter from her mother, and a daughter-in-law from her mother-in-law.
"So man's enemies are his own household!"
# Matthew 10:37 For whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
He who tries to gain his life will lose it, but he who loses his life for my sake will find it.
Whoever welcomes you, welcomes me. And whoever welcomes me, welcomes the one who sent me.
He who welcomes a prophet because he is a prophet, will receive a prophet's reward. And he who welcomes a righteous man because he is righteous will receive a righteous man's reward.
"For whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones who is my disciple, truly I tell you, will certainly not lose their reward."
John the Baptist, not Jesus.
When Jesus had finished teaching his twelve disciples, he left that place and went to teach and proclaim his message in the region of Galilee. Jesus and John the Baptist.
While John the Baptist was in prison, he heard about all that Jesus was doing, so he sent his disciples to ask him.
"And he asked him, 'Are you the one we are expecting, or should we look for someone else?'"
Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John what you have heard and seen."
Here is the blind receiving their sight, the lame walking, the lepers being cleansed, the deaf hearing, the dead being raised, and the poor having the gospel preached to them.
"And congratulations to those who do not hesitate to believe in me."
"After John's disciples had left, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John, saying, 'What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?'"
Why did you come out, then? To see a man wearing soft clothes? Those who wear soft clothes live in the palaces of kings.
Why then did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
"For this is he, of whom it is written, 'Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.' "
"I tell you the truth, among those born of women, no one has arisen greater than John the Baptist. Yet, the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he."
# The Kingdom Under Attack From the time of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom has faced fierce assaults, and the violent ones try to seize it by force.
For the law and the prophets were until John.
If you are willing to accept what the prophets and the scriptures say, then John is the Elijah whose coming they prophesied. #Elijah ... his coming. 14:11 Elijah was one of God's prophets around 850 BC. The Jews expected his coming based on Malachi 4: 5-6.
"He who has ears, let him hear."
"What shall I compare this generation to? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, calling out to each other, 'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not cry.'"
"We played our music for you, but you did not dance. We sang you funeral songs, but you did not mourn!"
John came, who neither ate like others nor drank wine like others, and people said of him, "He has an evil spirit."
Then the Son of Man came, who eats and drinks like others, and people say about him, 'Look at this man, he is a glutton and a drunkard, and a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' But wisdom is shown to be right by its fruits." Jesus warns the sinful cities.
Jesus began to rebuke the cities where most of his miracles were performed, for their inhabitants did not repent of their sins.
"Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes."
But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
# Matthew 11:23 But you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to heaven? No, you will go down to Hades! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
"But I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you." Jesus is the source of comfort.
At that time, Jesus spoke and said, "I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent, and revealed them to infants."
Yes, Dad, because you enjoyed doing it.
> The Father has entrusted everything to me. No one truly knows the Son except the Father, and no one truly knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you, #yoke. 29:11. The yoke is a wooden device placed on animals to help them carry heavy loads, and it is a Jewish symbol of the law. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
"For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."
Jesus: Lord of the Sabbath
At that time, Jesus went for a walk through the fields on a Sabbath day. His disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and eat them.
But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, "Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath."
Jesus said to them, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those with him?"
He entered the house of God and ate from the loaves of bread offered to God, even though it was not permitted for him or his companions to eat that bread; only the priests were allowed to do so.
Have you not read in the law of Moses that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are blameless?
But I say to you, something greater than the temple is here.
If you had known what the scripture means when it says, "I desire mercy, not animal sacrifices." #I_desire ... animal sacrifices. 7:12 from the Book of Hosea 6:6. You would not have condemned the innocent.
"For the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath." Healing on the Sabbath.
He then left that place and went to their compound.
There was a man with a withered hand. The people asked Jesus, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?" They asked him this so that they might have grounds to accuse him.
He said to them, "If one of you has a sheep that falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
Man is more important than the sheep. So doing good on the Sabbath is in accordance with the law.
Jesus said to the man with the paralyzed hand, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and it was restored, as sound as the other.
The Pharisees went out and began to conspire, seeking a way to kill Jesus. Jesus: God's chosen servant.
Jesus knew their plan, and he left that place. Large crowds followed him, and he healed them all.
They were ordered not to reveal his identity.
This happened to fulfill what God had said through the prophet Isaiah:
Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; My beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased. I will put my Spirit upon him, And he shall declare justice to the Gentiles.
No one will quarrel with him, nor will anyone hear his voice in their streets.
# The Unyielding Spirit Not even the bent reed will it break, Nor will it snuff the smoking wick. It perseveres until justice prevails, Unwavering in its righteous quest.
"And all nations shall put their hope in him." The reign of Jesus.
Then they brought to him a man who was blind and mute, possessed by a demon; and he cured him, so that the mute man spoke and saw.
People were amazed and asked, "Could this be the Son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man casts out demons by the power of Beelzebul!" #Beelzebul. 24:12 One of the names of the devil. Also in verse 27. "The prince of demons."
"For Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, 'Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself cannot stand.'"
If the devil drives out spirits and fights himself, how can his kingdom stand?
If I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.
But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
# Matthew 24:43 "But know this: if the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into."
I am with you, or against you. He who does not gather with me, scatters.
# **Translation:** Therefore, I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
He who speaks against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him; but he who speaks against the Holy Spirit, it cannot be forgiven him, neither in this world nor in the world to come. The fruit reveals the truth.
To bear good fruit, plant a good tree. A bad tree, on the other hand, bears bad fruit. For the tree is known by its fruit.
Ye vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.
A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart.
But I tell you that on the Day of Judgment people will have to give account for every idle word they speak.
Your words will determine your acquittal or conviction." The Jewish leaders demand proof.
"Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered, saying, 'Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.'"
"This wicked and adulterous generation seeks a sign, but no sign shall be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
As Jonah was in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.
"The people of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at what Jonah proclaimed. And now something greater than Jonah is here."
# Queen of the South The Queen of the South will stand in the judgment. #QueenOfTheSouth. 42:12 The Queen of Sheba. She traveled over a thousand miles to hear the wisdom of God from the mouth of King Solomon. See 1 Kings 10: 1-13. On the day of judgment against this generation, she will condemn it. For she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And now, here before you, one greater than Solomon is present. The empty soul.
When an unclean spirit comes out of a person, it roams through arid places searching for a resting place, but it doesn't find one.
He then says, "I will return to my house from which I came." So he goes and finds the house empty, swept, and put in order.
Then the spirit goes out and takes with him seven other spirits, more wicked than himself, and they go in and live there; and the last state of that person is worse than the first. So will it be also with this evil generation." The disciples of Jesus are his family.
While Jesus was speaking to the crowd, his mother and brothers arrived and stood outside, asking to speak to him.
"Then someone told Jesus, 'Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.' "
"Then Jesus asked, 'Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?'"
"Then he pointed to his disciples and said: 'These are my mother and brothers.'"
"For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother."
As seeds.
On that day, Jesus left the house and sat by the lakeside.
A large crowd gathered around him. So he went up into a boat and sat down, while the people stood on the shore.
And he said many things to them in parables, saying: "A sower went out to sow."
As he was sowing, some seeds fell by the roadside, and the birds came and ate them up.
Some seed fell on rocky ground, where there was not enough soil, and the grain sprouted quickly because the soil was not deep.
When the sun rose, it withered, and because it had no roots, it wilted.
Some seed fell on thorns. The thorns grew up and choked it.
Other seeds fell on good soil and produced a crop—a hundred times more than was sown, some sixty times, and some thirty times.
"He who has ears, let him hear." Hearing and understanding.
"The disciples came to him and asked, 'Why do you speak to them in parables?'"
Jesus answered them, "To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been granted."
Because everyone who has [#has. 12:13 Perhaps it means «who has understanding.»] will be given more, and will have an abundance. But from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.
For this reason I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.
"Thus, the prophecy of Isaiah applies to them: 'You will indeed hear, but never understand; you will surely see, but never perceive.'"
Their minds are closed, and their ears are heavy. They have shut their eyes tight, so that they cannot see with their eyes, hear with their ears, or understand with their hearts, and be healed by me.
Blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.
I tell you the truth, many kings and righteous men longed to see what you see, but did not see it, and to hear what you hear, but did not hear it. The meaning of the parable of the sower.
Listen, then, to the parable of the sower.
When a person hears the message of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes #the_evil_one. 19:13 That is, the devil. (Also in verse 38) And takes away the seed that was sown in their heart. This is the meaning of the seed that fell by the wayside.
"But the seed that fell on the rocky ground represents those who hear the word and receive it with joy.
# **Translation:** But because it has no roots in itself, it endures for a while; and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately it falls away.
"But that which fell among the thorns, these are those who hear the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful."
"But as for that in the good soil, it refers to someone who hears the word and understands it. This is the one who produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was sown." Like wheat and weeds.
"The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field."
When everyone was asleep, the man's enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and then left.
When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, the weeds sprouted too.
"So his servants came to him and said, 'Master, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Then where did these weeds come from?'"
"The man replied, 'My enemy has done this.' His servants asked, 'Do you want us to go and remove it?'"
"The man replied, 'No, because when you pull out the weeds, you might pull out the wheat with them.'"
Let both grow together until the harvest. And at harvest time I will tell the reapers, 'Collect the weeds first and tie them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.' For example, mustard and yeast.
The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field.
It is the smallest of all the seeds, but when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.
"The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour, till it was all leavened."
Jesus spoke these words, using parables. He would not say anything to them without using parables.
"This is what God said through the prophet: 'I will open my mouth with parables; I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.'"
Then Jesus sent the crowds away and went into the house. When his disciples came to him, they said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
"The Son of Man is the one who sowed the good seeds."
The field is the world, and the good seeds are those who have the kingdom. The weeds, however, are those who belong to the evil one.
The enemy who sowed them is Satan. The harvest is the end of the world. The reapers are the angels.
Weeds are gathered and burned with fire, and so will be the end of the world.
The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather from his kingdom all causes of sin and all evildoers.
They throw them into the blazing furnace. There, people weep and gnash their teeth.
Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Let anyone with ears listen! Parable of the Treasure and the Pearl
The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. A man found it, and hid it again. Then in his joy he went and sold all that he had and bought that field.
The kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls.
When he found a very precious pearl, he went and sold all that he had and bought it. Like a fishing net.
The kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the lake and caught fish of every kind.
When the net was full, the fishermen pulled it to the shore. Then they sat down and started picking out the good fish and putting them in baskets, while the bad fish they threw away.
This is what will happen at the end of the world, for the angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous.
"Then the wicked are cast into the burning furnace. There they weep and gnash their teeth."
Jesus asked his disciples, "Do you understand all these things?" They replied, "Yes."
"So every teacher of the law who has become a disciple is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old." Jesus went to his hometown.
When Jesus had finished these parables, he left that place.
When he came to his hometown, he began to teach them in their synagogue. And they were astonished, and said, "Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works?
Isn't he the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother called Mary? Aren't his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
Doesn't all of his sisters live among us? So where did he get all he has?
Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor, except in his hometown and in his own household."
He did not do many mighty works there, because of their unbelief.
Herod hears about Jesus.
At that time, Herod the tetrarch #tetrarch. 1:14 literally "the ruler of a quarter." The Romans had divided Palestine into four prefectures, so the ruler of each prefecture was called a ruler of a quarter or a tetrarch. See the Gospel of Luke 3:1. heard about Jesus.
"He said to his servants, 'It is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him.' " The execution of John the Baptist.
Herod was the one who arrested John and put him in prison, and this was because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.
"For John said to Herod, 'It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.'"
Herod wanted to kill him, but he feared the people, for they regarded John as a prophet.
But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before him and his guests, and pleased Herod so much
He even promised and swore to give her whatever she asked for, no matter what.
"But her mother had taught her what to ask for, so she said, 'Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter.'"
The king was saddened, yet he granted her wish due to his oath and out of respect for his guests.
He sent someone to cut off John's head in prison.
He brought her his head on a platter, and she gave it to her mother.
Then John's disciples came and took away his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus what had happened. Jesus feeds more than five thousand.
When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities.
As he stepped onto the shore, he saw a large crowd, and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick.
In the evening, his disciples came to him and said, "This is a remote place and it's already very late. Send the people away so that they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves."
They replied, "That's impossible! We'd have to buy that much bread, and we don't have that kind of money!"
"His disciples answered, 'All we have here are five loaves and two fish.'"
Jesus said to them, "Bring her to me."
And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass. And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
They ate and were satisfied. They collected the leftover fragments, filling twelve baskets.
There were five thousand men who ate, besides women and children. Jesus walked on water.
Jesus then asked his disciples to get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side, while he sent the crowds away.
And after sending them away, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening had come, he was there alone.
The boat had reached the middle of the lake, and the waves were crashing against it fiercely, as the wind was blowing against its direction.
Just before dawn Jesus came to them, walking on the lake.
When his disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified and cried out, "It's a ghost!"
Jesus said to them at once, "Take courage, it is I, do not be afraid."
"Lord, if it is you," Peter replied, "command me to come to you on the water."
"He said, 'Come.' So Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus."
But when Peter noticed the strong wind, he became afraid and began to sink, and he cried out, "Lord, save me!"
Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him, saying, "You of little faith, why did you doubt?"
When Jesus and Peter got into the boat, the wind ceased.
And those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God." Jesus healed many.
When they crossed the lake, they arrived at the region of Gennesaret.
And when the people of that region recognized Jesus, they proclaimed throughout the surrounding area about his coming, and brought to him all those who were sick,
They begged him to let them touch even the hem of his garment, and all who touched it were healed.
The law of God and the traditions of men.
Then some Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, asking,
"Why do your students break the traditions we inherited from our ancestors? They don't wash their hands before eating."
Jesus answered them, "Why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?"
The Lord commanded and said, "Honor your father and your mother," #Honor ... your mother. 4:15 From the Book of Exodus 20:12, and Deuteronomy 5:16. And He said, "Whoever curses their father or mother is to be put to death." #Whoever curses ... is to be put to death. 4:15 From the Book of Exodus 21:17.
You say, "Anyone who says to his father or mother, 'I cannot help you; I have vowed to give to the Lord what I had planned to give,' need not honor his father."
You have nullified the word of God by upholding your tradition.
Ye hypocrites, Isaiah spoke truly of you when he said:
"This people honors me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me."
Their worship is useless, for they teach doctrines that are merely human commands.
Jesus called the people to him and said to them, "Listen to me and understand what I say:
What goes into the mouth does not make a man unclean, but what comes out of the mouth, this makes him unclean.
Then the disciples came to him and asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard your words?"
"Every plant that my Father has not planted will be rooted up."
Let them be, for they are the blind leading the blind. If one blind man leads another blind man, they will both fall into the pit.
Peter replied, "Explain this parable to us."
Jesus said, "Do you not yet understand?"
Do you not understand that everything which goes into the mouth passes into the belly, and is eliminated?
For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, slander.
# Matthew 15:19 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:
"These are the things that defile a person; eating with unwashed hands does not make one unclean." Jesus helps a strange woman.
Jesus left that place and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him, crying out, "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is tormented by a demon."
Jesus did not answer a word. His disciples came to him and urged him, "Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us."
"I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
The woman came to him, knelt down before him, and said, "Lord, help me."
Jesus replied, "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
"She said, 'Indeed, my lord, but even dogs eat from the crumbs that fall from their masters' table.'"
Then Jesus answered her, "Woman, your faith is great; let it be done for you as you wish." And her daughter was healed instantly. Jesus healed many.
Jesus left that place and went to the region of Galilee. He climbed a hill and sat down there.
So large crowds came to him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others. They laid them at Jesus' feet, and he healed them.
The crowds were amazed when they saw the deaf hear, the mute speak, the lame walk, the paralyzed cured, and the blind receive their sight. So they praised the God of Israel. Jesus fed more than four thousand.
Jesus called to him the disciples and said: "I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I would not send them away fasting, lest haply they faint on the way."
"His disciples said to him, 'Where could we get enough bread in this desolate place to feed such a crowd?'"
Jesus asked them, "How many loaves do you have?" They answered, "Seven, and a few small fish."
Jesus commanded the people to sit on the ground.
He took the seven loaves and the fish, gave thanks, broke the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before the people; and he divided the fish among them all.
And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up the broken pieces which were left over, seven baskets full.
There were four thousand men who ate, not counting the women and children.
When Jesus had dismissed the crowds, he went up onto the mountain by himself to pray. Then, when evening came, he was there alone.
The Jewish leaders examined Jesus.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus to test him, asking for a sign to prove that God was with him.
Jesus replied to them, "In the evening you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.'
In the early morning, you say: "Today will be stormy, for the sky is red and sullen." You are good at interpreting weather signs, but you are not good at understanding the times you live in!
This wicked and adulterous generation seeks a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." Then Jesus left them and went away. Lack of understanding.
Jesus' disciples crossed over to the other side of the lake, but they forgot to bring bread.
Jesus said to them, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The disciples began to talk to each other and say, "But we brought no bread!"
Jesus knew what they were saying, and said to them, "You of little faith, why do you argue among yourselves because you have no bread?"
Have you not yet realized? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you gathered of the fragments?
Do you not remember the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered of the fragments?
Why can't you understand that I wasn't talking to you about ordinary bread, but I was warning you to guard yourselves against the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Then his disciples understood that he did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees. Peter declared that Jesus is the Christ.
"When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, 'Who do people say the Son of Man is?' "
"His disciples answered, 'Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.'"
"He said to them, 'But who do you say that I am?'"
"You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
"Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven."
I say to you that you are Peter, #Peter. 18:16 From the Greek "Petros," which means "rock." And upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades, #gates_of_Hades. 18:16 That is, the power of death, shall not overcome it.
"And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."
"Then he sternly ordered them not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. Jesus was speaking about the necessity of his death."
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests, and teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.
"But Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him, saying, 'Never, God forbid, Master! This shall never happen to you!'"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a hindrance to me because you are not on the side of God, but of men."
"Then Jesus said to his disciples, 'If anyone wants to come with me, they must deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow me.' "
# Matthew 16:25 For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it.
What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, but loses his own soul? And what can a man give in exchange for his life?
Truly, the Son of Man is going to come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he will repay every man according to his deeds.
"Truly I tell you, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."
Jesus, with Moses and Elijah.
Six days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and John, the brother of James, and led them up a high mountain, where they could be alone.
And as they were gazing, Jesus' appearance was transformed; his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as light.
Suddenly Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Jesus.
"Peter said to Jesus, 'Lord, it is good for us to be here; if you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.'"
As Peter was speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came from the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him!"
When the disciples heard this, they were terrified and fell to the ground, prostrate.
Jesus came and touched them. "Get up," he said. "Don't be afraid."
When they looked around, they saw no one but Jesus.
As they came down from the mountain, Jesus instructed them, saying, "Tell no one about the vision until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead."
"His disciples asked him, 'Why then do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?' He replied, 'To be sure, Elijah is coming and will restore all things. But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but have done to him everything they wished. In the same way the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.'" #Elijah ... First. 10:17. Elijah was one of God's prophets around 850 BC. The Jews expected his coming based on Malachi 4: 5-6.
Jesus replied to them, "Yes, Elijah will come and restore all things."
But I tell you, Elijah has indeed come, and they did not recognize him, but to him they did whatever they wished. So also the Son of Man will suffer at their hands."
Then his disciples understood that he was speaking of John the Baptist. Jesus cast out an evil spirit from a boy.
When they returned to the group, a man came to Jesus and bowed down before him.
He said, "Lord, have mercy on my son, for he suffers from seizures and is terribly afflicted. He often falls into the fire or into the water."
"I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him."
Jesus said, "O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you?" And he said to the man, "Bring your son here."
Jesus commanded the unclean spirit to leave him, and at that very moment the spirit left him and the boy was healed.
"Then his disciples came to him privately and asked, 'Why could we not cast it out?'"
"Jesus replied, 'Because of your little faith. I tell you the truth, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.'"
"But this kind does not come out except by prayer and fasting." Jesus foretells his approaching death.
"As they were traveling through Galilee together, Jesus said to them, 'The Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men.'"
"They will kill him, but on the third day he will rise again." The disciples were deeply saddened. Temple tax.
When Jesus entered Capernaum, those who collected the two-drachma tax for the temple came to Peter and asked, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
Peter answered them, "Yes, he does." Then Peter went home. Jesus spoke to him first and said, "Tell me, Simon, from whom do the kings of the earth collect taxes and tributes? From their own children, or from others?"
Peter replied, "They collect it from the other nations." Jesus said, "Then the sons are exempt from it."
Go to the lake, cast your line, and take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth, and you will find a coin worth four dirhams. Take it and give it to them from me and from yourself.
