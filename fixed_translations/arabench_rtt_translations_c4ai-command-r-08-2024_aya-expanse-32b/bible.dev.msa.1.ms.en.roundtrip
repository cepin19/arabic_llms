The Jesus Family Lineage
첀is is the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
첀Abraham was the father of Isaac. Isaac was the father of Jacob. Jacob was the father of Judah and his brothers.
Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar. Perez was the father of Hezron, and Hezron the father of Ram.
Ram was the father of Amminadab. Amminadab was the father of Nahshon. Nahshon was the father of Salmon.
Salmon was the father of Boaz, and Rahab was the mother of Boaz. Boaz was the father of Obed, and Ruth was the mother of Obed. Obed was the father of Jesse.
And Jesse was the father of King David. David was the father of Solomon, whose mother was Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah.
Solomon was the father of Rehoboam. Rehoboam was the father of Abijah. Abijah was the father of Asa.
Joram was the father of Uzziah, and Uzziah the father of Jotham, and Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah.
Uzziah was the father of Jotham, and Jotham was the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh, and Manasseh was the father of Amon, and Amon was the father of Josiah.
And Josiah was the father of Jehoiakim and his brothers. At that time, the Jewish people were taken captive to Babylon.
Then the family line continued through Shealtiel, who was the father of Zerubbabel.
Zechariah was the father of Jotham, and Jotham was the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
Azar was the father of Sadok. Sadok was the father of Akhim. Akhim was the father of Ebed.
Eliezer was the father of Elazar, who was the father of Matthan, who was the father of Jacob.
Jacob was the father of Joseph, who married Mary. Mary gave birth to Jesus, who is called the Messiah.
Therefore there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David. And fourteen generations from David until the carrying away into Babylon. And fourteen generations from that time to Christ. Jesus Christ was born.
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
Her husband, Joseph, was a righteous man. He did not want to expose her publicly. So, he planned to divorce her quietly.
But while Joseph was considering this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit."
She will give birth to a son. You shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.
All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet,
"The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel," which means "God with us." (Isaiah 7:14)
Joseph woke up. He did as the angel of the Lord commanded him. He took Mary into his home as his wife.
But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.
**The Visit of the Wise Men to Jesus**
Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This happened during the reign of Herod as king over Judea. After the birth of Jesus, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem.
They asked, "Where is the child who has been born to be King of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."
When King Herod heard this, he was greatly disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
Herod summoned the chief priests of the people and the scribes, and asked them where the Christ was to be born.
"In Bethlehem in Judah," they answered. "This is what the prophet wrote. He said,"
"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, yet out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times." (Micah 5:2)
Then Herod secretly summoned the wise men and learned from them the exact time the star had appeared.
Send them to Bethlehem. He said, "Go! Search carefully for the child. As soon as you find him, inform me. Then I too can go and worship him."
After the wise men had listened to the king, they set out on their way. And the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them. Finally, it stopped over the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, they were filled with joy.
The wise men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They knelt down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures. They offered him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
But God warned them in a dream not to return to Herod. So they returned to their hometown by a different route. The flight of the Holy Family into Egypt.
After the wise men had departed, Joseph had a dream. An angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Arise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child to kill him."
Joseph arose. And in the night, he departed into Egypt with the child and his mother Mary.
They remained there until the death of King Herod. Thus were fulfilled the words of the Lord spoken by the prophet: "Out of Egypt I called my son." (Hosea 11:1)
Herod realized that the wise men had deceived him. He became furious and issued orders regarding Bethlehem and the surrounding area. He commanded that all boys two years old and under be killed. This corresponded to the time when the wise men had seen the star.
Thus were fulfilled the words of the prophet Jeremiah; who had said,
A voice is heard in Ramah, wailing and great mourning. Rachel weeps for her children; she refuses to be comforted, because they are no more. (Jeremiah 31:15) Jesus' family returns to Nazareth.
After Herod's death, Joseph had a dream while he was still in Egypt. An angel of the Lord appeared to him in the dream.
The angel said, "Arise! Take the child and his mother. Go to the land of Israel. Those who tried to kill the child are dead."
So Joseph got up, took the child and his mother Mary, and returned to the land of Israel.
But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee.
He lived there in a town called Nazareth. Thus were fulfilled the words of the prophets about Jesus. They said, "He will be called a Nazarene."
John the Baptist prepares the way.
In those days, John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
He said, "Repent from your sins! For the kingdom of heaven is near."
John is the person about whom the prophet Isaiah spoke. He said, "A voice cries out: 'In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.'" (Isaiah 40:3)
John's clothes were made of camel hair. He wore a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea, and from the whole region around the Jordan.
When they confessed their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River.
John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing, and said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
Bear fruit worthy of repentance.
Do not think that you can say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.
The axe is already lying at the roots of the trees. All trees that do not bear good fruit will be cut down. They will be thrown into the fire.
I baptize you with water, calling you to repent of your sins. But after me comes one who is mightier than I, and I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
He wields his scythe to clear his threshing floor of chaff. He will gather his wheat into the barn. But he will burn the husks with an unquenchable fire.
Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River. He wanted to be baptized by John.
But John tried to prevent him, saying to Jesus, "I need to be baptized by you. Why do you come to me?"
Jesus answered, "Let it be so now. It is right that we should do this to fulfill all righteousness." And John consented.
As soon as Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. Then the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him.
A voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
Jesus is tempted.
The Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness, where he was tempted by the devil.
After forty days and forty nights of fasting, Jesus was hungry.
The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread."
Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.' (Deuteronomy 8:3)"
Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple, on the southern edge.
He said, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you, to guard you.' They will bear you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone." (Psalm 91:11-12)
Jesus answered and said to him, "It is also written, 'You shall not test the Lord your God.'" (Deuteronomy 6:16)
Finally, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain. And he showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
He said, "If you submit and prostrate yourself before me, I will give you all this."
Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'" (Deuteronomy 6:13)
Then the devil left Jesus, and angels came and attended to him. Jesus began to preach.
John was put in prison. And when Jesus heard of it, he withdrew into Galilee.
Jesus left Nazareth. He went to live in the town of Capernaum, which was on the lake in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
Thus the prophecy of the prophet Isaiah was fulfilled. He said:
Land of Zebulun! Land of Naphtali! Galilee, where the Gentiles live! Land along the Mediterranean Sea! Region east of the Jordan River!
"The people walking in darkness will see a great light. Those living in a land of deep darkness—on them will light shine." (Isaiah 9:1, 2)
From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." He chose His first disciples.
One day, Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers, Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake; they were fishermen.
Jesus said, "Come. Follow me." "I will make you fishers of men."
So they immediately left their nets and followed him.
After that, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and Jesus called them.
Immediately they left their boat and their father and followed Jesus. Jesus healed the sick.
Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.
The news about him spread throughout Syria. People brought to him all who were sick with various diseases. Some were suffering from severe pains. Others were possessed by demons. Some were trembling violently. Others could not move at all. And Jesus healed them all.
Large crowds followed him. Some came from Galilee, from the region known as the Ten Towns, and from Jerusalem and Judea. Others came from the region across the Jordan.
Jesus grants blessings.
Jesus saw the crowds, went up the mountain, and sat down. And his disciples came to him.
Then he began to teach them, saying,
Blessed are those who feel the spiritual need. theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.
"Blessed are you when people mock you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil against you because of my name."
Rejoice and be glad. Your reward in heaven is great. So they persecuted the prophets who were before you. Salt and light.
You are the salt of the earth. But what if the salt loses its saltiness? How can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by people.
You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden.
"No one lights a lamp and puts it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house."
"Let your light so shine before others, that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven. Jesus fulfills the law and gives it its true meaning."
Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. Heaven and earth will disappear before the smallest letter of the law disappears. Not even the least stroke of a pen of the law will disappear until all things are accomplished.
Do not break even the least important of these commandments. And do not teach others to break them. If you do, you will be called the least important in the Kingdom of Heaven. But practice and teach these commandments. Then you will be called important in the Kingdom of Heaven.
This is what I tell you: You must be more righteous than the Pharisees and the teachers of the law. Otherwise, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. Murder.
You have heard what was said to the people in ancient times: "You shall not kill. (Exodus 20:13) Whoever kills will be accountable for it."
But let me tell you this: Do not be angry with your brother. Whoever is angry with his brother is subject to judgment. Again, whoever says to his brother, 'Raka,' must stand before the Sanhedrin. But whoever says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of hellfire.
"Suppose you are offering your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you."
Lay your gift on the altar. Go first and be reconciled with your brother, and then come and present your gift.
Suppose someone has a claim against you and takes you to court. Settle the matter quickly. Do that while you are still on your way with him. Otherwise, he may hand you over to the judge. The judge may hand you over to the officer. And you may end up in prison.
I'm about to tell you the truth. You won't get out until you pay the last penny! Adultery.
You have heard that it was said, "Do not commit adultery." (Exodus 20:14)
But let me tell you this: Do not look at a woman with wrong intent. For whoever looks at her with such intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
If your right hand should lead you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. For your hand is but a small part of your body. It is better to lose it than to have your whole body thrown into hell.
It is written: "When a man divorces his wife, he must give her a certificate of divorce" (Deuteronomy 24:1).
But let me tell you this: whoever divorces his wife makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. A man should not divorce his wife unless she has been unfaithful to him. Oath.
Again, you have heard what was said to your ancestors long ago: "Do not break the covenant that the Lord made with you, and do not make vows to him that you cannot keep."
But let me tell you something. Never make any such promises at all. Don't make them in the name of heaven. That is God's throne.
Do not make them in the name of the Earth. It is the footprint of God. Nor in the name of Jerusalem. It is the city of the great King.
Do not swear by your heads, for you cannot make even one hair white or black.
Let "yes" mean "yes" only. Let "no" mean "no". Anything more comes from the devil. Be kind to others.
You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." (Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21)
But let me tell you this. Do not fight the evil person. "Imagine someone slaps you on your right cheek. Turn the other cheek to him as well.
If anyone takes you to court and wants your shirt, give them your coat as well.
If someone forces you to walk one mile, walk two miles with him.
Give to him who asks you. Do not turn your face away from him who wants to borrow something from you. Love your enemies.
You have heard that it was said, "Love your neighbor (Leviticus 19:18) and hate your enemy."
But that's what I'm telling you. Love your enemies. Pray for those who harm you.
Then you will be like your Father in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous.
If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Even tax collectors do the same.
If you only greet your relatives, what more are you doing than others? Even people who don't believe in God do that.
Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Assisting the needy
Beware of doing good deeds in front of others. Do not do them to be seen by others. Otherwise, your Father in heaven will not reward you.
When you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets. Do not be like those who claim holiness only. They proclaim what they do in the temples and on the streets. They want to be honored by others. What I am about to tell you is the truth. They have received their full reward.
When you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
Then your giving will be in secret. Your Father who sees in secret will reward you. He sees what you do in secret. Prayer.
When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
When you pray, go to your room. Close the door and pray to your Father who is unseen. He will reward you. Your Father sees what is done in secret.
When you pray, do not babble as the hypocrites do, for they think that they will be heard because of their many words.
Don't be like them. Your father knows what you need even before you ask him.
"This is how you should pray: 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
Your kingdom come, Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins, as we also forgive those who sin against us.
Deliver us from sin when we are tempted. Save us from the evil one.
Forgive people when they wrong you. If you do, your Father in heaven will forgive you.
But if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive you your trespasses.
When you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites. They make their faces dirty and sad. They want to show people that they are fasting. What I am about to tell you is true. They have received their reward in full.
But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face.
Then no one will see your fasting, except your Father who is unseen, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you. Store up for yourselves treasures in heaven.
Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.
Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
The eye is like a lamp for the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light.
But what if your eyes were bad? Then your whole body would be full of darkness. If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
No one can serve two masters at the same time. He will hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money at the same time. Do not be anxious.
I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
Can you add an hour to your life by worrying?
"Why do you worry about clothes? Look at the flowers of the field, how they grow; they do not spin or weave."
But let me tell you something. Not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of these.
If God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
Therefore do not worry, saying, 'What will we eat?' or 'What will we drink?' or 'What will we wear?'
People who don't know God chase after all those things. Your Father in heaven knows you need them.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Be fair when judging others.
Do not judge others. Then you will not be judged.
You will be judged by the same standard by which you judge others. You will be measured by the same measure with which you measure others.
You see the speck in your friend's eye, but you do not see the log in your own eye.
How can you tell your friend, 'Let me take the splinter out of your eye,' when there's a piece of wood in your own eye?
You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye. Then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your friend's eye.
Do not give what is holy to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. Ask, seek, knock.
Ask, and it will be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened to you.
Everyone who asks will receive. He who seeks will find. The door will open for him who knocks.
Suppose your son asks for bread. Which one of you would give him a stone?
Or if he asked for a fish, who among you would give him a live one?
Although you are evil, you know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will your Father who is in heaven give good gifts to those who ask Him!
In all things, treat others as you would like to be treated. This is what is written in the law and the prophets. The two great and small gates.
Enter the Kingdom of God through the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction and hell. Many are those who enter through it.
But the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and only a few find it. The tree and its fruit.
Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
You can know their true nature by their actions. "Do people gather grapes from thorns? Do they pluck figs from thistles?"
In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
You can know a tree by its fruit.
Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?' But I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'
Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?'
I will clearly tell them, "I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!" The wise and foolish builder
Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
It rains. The water rises. The wind blows and strikes that house. But it doesn't fall. It's built on rock.
But everyone who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.
It rains. The water rises. The wind blows and hits that house. It falls with a loud crash.
Jesus finished saying all these things. The crowds were amazed by his teaching.
He taught as one having authority, and not as their teachers.
Jesus heals a man with a skin disease.
Jesus came down from the mountain. A large crowd followed him.
A man with a skin disease came to Jesus, knelt down, and said, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."
Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. He said, "I am willing to do this." "Be clean!" Immediately the man was cleansed of his leprosy.
Then Jesus said to him, "Tell no one. Go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them." The faith of a Roman centurion.
When Jesus came to Capernaum, a Roman centurion approached him and pleaded for his help.
He said to him, "Sir, my servant is sick at home, confined to bed and unable to move. He is in great distress."
Jesus said, "I will go and heal him."
The captain answered, "Sir, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed."
I myself am a man under authority, and I have soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who were following him, "Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith."
I tell you, many will come from east and west and sit at table with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
But those who believe they belong to the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then Jesus said to the Roman officer, "Go! Let it be done just as you believed it would." And at that very moment, his servant was healed. Jesus healed many people.
When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. She got up and began to serve him.
When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
He did this to fulfill what the prophet Isaiah had foretold, saying, "He took our infirmities and bore our diseases. We considered him stricken by God, smitten by him, and afflicted. But he was pierced for our transgressions, crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the punishment that made us whole, and by his wounds we are healed." (Isaiah 53:4-5) Following Jesus requires sacrifice.
Jesus saw the crowds around him, and he gave his disciples orders to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
Then one of the scribes came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
Jesus answered, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
Another servant said to him, "Master, let me first go and bury my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow me. Let the dead bury their dead." Jesus calms the storm.
Jesus got into a boat. His disciples followed him.
Suddenly, a fierce storm swept across the lake. The waves began to crash over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
The pupils went and woke him up. They said, "Lord! Save us! We are perishing!"
He answered them, "How little faith you have! Why are you so afraid?" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm.
The disciples were amazed. They asked, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!"
Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake in the region of the Gadarenes. He met two men possessed by demons. They came out of the tombs. The two men were so violent that no one could pass that way.
They cried out, "Son of God, what do You want with us? Have You come to punish us before our trial?"
Not far away, there was a large herd of pigs feeding.
The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
Jesus said to them, "Go!" And the unclean spirits came out of the men and entered into the swine. And the herd ran violently down the steep place into the lake, and were drowned.
Those who were tending the pigs fled. They went into the town and reported everything. They told the people what had happened to the men who had been possessed by the demons.
Then the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to leave their region.
Jesus healing a man who cannot walk
Jesus got into a boat, crossed to the other side of the lake, and arrived at his town.
Some men came to him, carrying a paralyzed man on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
Then some of the scribes said to themselves, "This man is blaspheming!"
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to them, "Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?"
Is it easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven"? Or to say, "Get up and walk"?
"I want you to know," he said, "that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he turned to the paralyzed man and said, "Get up, take your mat, and go home."
The man stood up and went home.
When the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe. They praised God for giving such authority to human beings. Jesus chose Matthew.
As Jesus was leaving, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he told him. And Matthew got up and followed him.
Later, Jesus was dining at Matthew's house. Many tax collectors and "sinners" came and ate with Jesus and his disciples.
The Pharisees saw this and asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
Jesus heard this and said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick."
Go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’ (Hosea 6:6) For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.” Jesus was asked about fasting.
One day, John's disciples came to Jesus and said, "We and the Pharisees fast. Why don't your disciples fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
People don't patch a new piece of cloth onto an old garment. The new cloth will tear away from the old. This will make the tear worse.
People don't put new wine in old wineskins. Otherwise, the wineskins will burst. The wine will spill out, and the wineskins will be destroyed. No, they put new wine in new wineskins. That way, both are saved.
As Jesus was saying this, one of the synagogue rulers came and bowed down before him. "My daughter has just died," he said. "But come and put your hand on her, and she will live."
Jesus rose and followed him, and so did his disciples.
At that moment, a woman came up to Jesus from behind. She was suffering from a disease that caused her to bleed, and it had lasted for 12 years. She touched the edge of his clothes.
I thought, "I just need to touch his clothes. Then I will be healed.
Jesus turned and saw her. He said to her, "Woman, do not lose hope," "your faith has healed you." And at that very moment, the woman was healed.
When Jesus entered the ruler's house, he saw there the flute players. And he saw the crowds that were wailing.
He said, "Go away. The girl is not dead. She is sleeping." But they laughed at him.
After the crowd had been sent away, Jesus entered the house. He took the girl by the hand, and she arose.
The news about what Jesus had done spread all over that region. Jesus healed two blind men.
As Jesus was leaving, two blind men followed him, shouting, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When Jesus entered the house, the blind men came to him. He asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They answered, "Yes, Lord."
Then he touched their eyes and said, "Your faith has healed you."
They could see again. Jesus sternly warned them, "Make sure no one knows about this."
But they went out and spread the news. They talked about it all over the region.
As they were leaving, another man who was demon-possessed was brought to Jesus. He was unable to speak.
When the demon was cast out, the man spoke. The crowd was amazed. They said, "Never has anything like this been seen in Israel."
But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the power of the prince of demons." There are only a few workers.
Jesus went through all the cities and villages. He taught in their synagogues. He preached the gospel of the kingdom. And healed every disease and infirmity.
When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, for they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then Jesus said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few."
"Ask the Lord of the harvest to send workers into his field for the harvest."
Jesus sends the twelve disciples.
Jesus called his twelve disciples to him. He gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
Here are the names of the twelve apostles. The first is Simon Peter and his brother Andrew. Then comes James the son of Zebedee and his brother John.
After that come Philip and Bartholomew, also Thomas and Matthew the tax collector. There are also James son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus.
The last two were Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot. Judas would later betray Jesus into the hands of his enemies.
Jesus sent out these twelve with the following instructions. "Do not go where there are no Jews," he said. "And do not enter any Samaritan town."
Go instead to the people of Israel. They are like lost sheep.
As you go, proclaim this message: 'The kingdom of heaven is coming soon.'
Healed the sick. Raised the dead. Made lepers 'clean' again. Cast out demons. You received freely, give freely.
Do not carry gold, or silver, or copper in your belts.
Don't take a suitcase for the trip. Don't take extra clothes or sandals or walking sticks. The worker should be given what he needs.
When you enter a city or village, look for someone willing to receive you. Stay in their home until your departure.
When you enter the house, greet those who live there.
If that house welcomes you, grant it a blessing of peace. If it does not, do not bless it.
Some people may not welcome you or listen to your words. If they don't, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that house or town.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. The Day of Judgment will be easier for the people of Sodom and Gomorrah than for the people of that town.
I send you out as sheep among wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.
Beware! The men will hand you over to the local courts. They will whip you in their temples.
You will be brought before governors and kings because of me. You will be witnesses to them and to the Gentiles.
But when they arrest you, don't worry about what you'll say or how you'll say it. At that time, the right words to say will be given to you.
You will not be the speaker. Your father's spirit will speak through you.
Brothers will hand over their brothers to be killed. Fathers will hand over their sons. Sons will rise up against their fathers and kill them.
Everyone will hate you because of me. But whoever endures to the end will be saved.
When people attack you in one place, flee to another. What I am telling you is true. You will not finish going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
A student does not surpass his teacher. Nor a slave his master.
It is enough for the pupil to be like his teacher, and enough for the slave to be like his master. If the head of the house plays the drum, it is the duty of all the household to dance.
So do not be afraid of your enemies. Everything secret will be made public, and everything hidden will be brought to light.
What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered, proclaim on the housetops.
Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father's care.
It counts even the hairs on your head!
So do not fear. You are worth more than many sparrows.
What about someone who says in front of others that he knows me? I will also say in front of my Father in heaven that I know him.
But what about someone who says in front of others that he doesn't know me? I will say in front of my Father in heaven that I don't know him.
Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
I have come to set "sons against their fathers, and daughters against their mothers, and daughters-in-law against their mothers-in-law."
A man's enemies will be those of his own household.
Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me doesn't deserve me. Anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me doesn't deserve me.
"And whoever does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me."
If anyone finds his life, he will lose it. But if anyone loses his life because of me, he will find it.
Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.
Someone who welcomes a prophet as a prophet will receive the reward of a prophet. And someone who welcomes a righteous person as righteous will receive the reward of a righteous person.
He says: "If anyone gives these little ones a cup of cold water, they will be rewarded. What I am about to tell you is true."
Jesus and John the Baptist
Jesus finished teaching his twelve disciples. Then he moved on to teach and preach in the cities of Galilee.
John was in prison. When he heard what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples to him.
They asked Jesus, "Are you the one who was supposed to come? Or should we look for someone else?"
Jesus answered, "Go back to John. Tell him what you hear and see."
The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor.
Blessed are those who do not abandon their faith because of me.
As John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John. He said, "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?"
So what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No. Those who wear fine clothes are in the palaces of kings.
Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
He is the one written about in the Holy Book. It says, "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
What I am about to tell you is true. No one greater than John the Baptist has ever been born, yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been advancing with force, and forceful men lay hold of it.
All the prophets and the law prophesied until John came.
If you are ready to receive him, John is Elijah who was to come.
"He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
What do I compare the people of this time to? They are like children sitting in the markets, calling out to people.
We played the flute for you, but you did not dance. We sang you a funeral song, but you did not mourn.
When John came, he neither ate nor drank as you do. And people say, 'He has a demon.'
But when the Son of Man came, he ate and drank, and they say, "Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!" Yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds." Those cities that do not repent will be condemned.
Jesus began to denounce the cities where most of his miracles had been done, for they did not repent of their sins. He said,
Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in your midst had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
But I tell you this: It will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
As for you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades. For if the miracles had been done in Sodom which were done in you, it would have remained until this day.
But I say to you, it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you. "Rest for the weary."
At that time, Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent, and have revealed them to infants."
Yes, Father. This is what I wanted.
My father gave me everything. A father is the only one who knows the son. And the only ones who know the father are the son and those the son chooses to introduce him to.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Be my servants and learn from me. I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
My service is easy, and my burden is light.
Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On one of the Sabbath days, Jesus was walking through the grainfields. His disciples were hungry, so they began to pluck and eat the heads of grain.
The Pharisees saw this. They said to Jesus, "Look! Doing this work on the Sabbath is against the law. But your disciples are doing it anyway!"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him?"
So he entered the house of God. He and his men ate the sacred bread, which was only allowed for the priests to eat.
Haven't you read the Law? It tells us how the priests in the Temple are to perform their duties on that day every Sabbath. But they are not considered guilty.
I tell you, something greater than the temple is here.
The writing says, "I desire mercy, not sacrifice." (Hosea 6:6) You do not know the meaning of these words. If you knew, you would not accuse the innocent.
The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.
Then Jesus went to their synagogue.
There was a man with a weak and twisted hand. The Pharisees were trying to find fault with Jesus. They asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
He said to them, "If one of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?"
"A man is worth more than a sheep!" Therefore, the law allows us to do good on the Sabbath.
Then Jesus said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out. It was completely restored, just like the other hand.
But the Pharisees went out and conspired against Jesus, the chosen servant of God.
Jesus was aware of the Pharisees' plans. So he left that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick.
But he warned them not to tell anyone who he was.
This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah. It was written,
This is My servant whom I have chosen. He is dear to My heart. I am well pleased with him. I will put My Spirit upon him. He will proclaim to the nations that everything will be made new.
He will not argue or shout. No one will hear his voice in the streets.
He won't break a bent branch. He won't extinguish a flickering flame. He'll make everything alright.
"The nations will put their hope in him." (Isaiah 42:1-4) Jesus and Beelzebul
A man possessed by demons, who was blind and could not speak, was brought to Jesus. Jesus healed him, and the man was able to see and speak.
Everyone was amazed, and they asked, "Is this the Son of David?"
When the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man drives out demons only by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
Jesus knew what they were thinking. He said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand."
If the devil drives out the devil, he is fighting against himself. How then can his kingdom stand?
You say that I cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. But by what power do your followers cast them out? So then, they will be your judges.
But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
Or think about this. How can you enter a strong man's house and simply take what the man has? You must tie him up first. Then you can loot his house.
He who is not with me is against me. He who does not gather the sheep with me scatters them.
This is what I tell you: Every sin and every evil word spoken against God will be forgiven. But speaking against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
"Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come."
A good tree bears good fruit, and a bad tree bears bad fruit. You can tell a tree by its fruit.
O ye dens of venomous snakes! How can you evil ones say anything good? Your mouths speak what is in your hearts.
The good man says good things. These things come from the good within him. And the evil man says evil things. These things come from the evil within him.
But let me tell you this. On the Day of Judgment, people will be questioned about every careless word they spoke.
"You will be condemned by your words or acquitted." The marvel sign of Leonan.
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus and said, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
He answered and said, "An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign! But no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah."
Jonah was in the belly of a great fish for three days and three nights. Something like this will happen to the Son of Man. He will remain in the tomb for three days and three nights.
The men of Nineveh will stand in judgment with this generation. The people of Nineveh will prove this generation guilty. For when Jonah preached to them, they repented of their sins. Now, someone greater than Jonah is among you.
The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, one greater than Solomon is here.
What happens when an evil spirit comes out of a person? It wanders through the dry places, seeking a place to rest. But it finds none.
Then he says, 'I will return to the house I left.' And when he gets there, he finds the house empty. The house has been thoroughly cleaned and put in order.
Then the evil spirit goes and brings with it seven other evil spirits more wicked than itself. They come and live there, and the person becomes even worse than before. That is the fate of evil people in this age." - Jesus' mother and brothers
While Jesus was still speaking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.
Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside. They want to speak to you."
Jesus answered and said to him, "Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?"
Jesus pointed to his disciples and said, "Behold, my mother and my brothers!"
Everyone who does what my father wants in heaven is my brother or sister or mother.
The Farmer's Tale
On that day, Jesus left the house and sat by the Sea of Galilee.
A large crowd gathered around him. So he got into a boat. He sat in it, and all the people stood on the shore.
Then he began to tell them many things through stories. He said, "A farmer went out to sow his seed.
He scattered the seeds on the ground. Some fell on the path. Birds came and ate them.
Some seeds fell on rocky places, where there was little soil. The plants grew quickly, because the soil was not deep.
When the sun rose, it scorched the plants. They withered because they had no roots.
Other seeds fell among the thorns. The thorns grew up and choked the plants.
Other seeds fell on good soil and produced a crop, a hundred or sixty or thirty times what was sown.
"He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
The students came to him. They asked, "Why do you use stories when you talk to people?"
He answered and said, "It has been given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given."
Those who possess this kind of knowledge will be given more. In fact, they will have abundance. And if anyone does not have this kind of knowledge, even the little they have will be taken away from them.
This is why I use stories when I talk to people. I say, "They look, but they don't really see. They listen, but they don't really hear or understand."
In it, the words of the prophet Isaiah are fulfilled. He said, "You will hear, but not understand. You will see, but not comprehend what you are seeing."
"Their hearts are calloused. They hardly hear with their ears, they have closed their eyes; otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn back to the Lord, and he would heal them." (Isaiah 6:9, 10)
But blessed are your eyes, for they see. And blessed are your ears, for they hear.
I am about to tell you the truth. Many prophets and righteous people wanted to see what you see, but they didn't see it. They wanted to hear what you hear, but they didn't hear it.
Listen! This is the meaning of the farmer's story.
People hear the message of the kingdom but do not understand it. Then the evil one comes and steals what was sown in their hearts. Those people are like the seed that was sown on the path.
Others received the seed that fell on the rock. These are the ones who hear the word and receive it with joy immediately.
But they have no roots. Therefore they do not last long, and when tribulation or persecution arises because of the message, they quickly fall away.
Others received the seed that fell among the thorns. These are the ones who hear the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, and it does not bear fruit.
But others received the seed that fell on good soil. These are the ones who hear the message and understand it. They produce a crop 100, 60, or 30 times what was planted. - The Parable of the Weeds
Jesus told the crowd another parable. "The kingdom of heaven," he said, "is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came. The enemy planted weeds among the wheat and then left.
The wheat began to grow and form grains. At the same time, weeds appeared.
The landowner's servants came to him and said, "Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where did this weed come from?"
He answered, "An enemy has done this." And the servants asked him, "Shall we go and pull up the weeds?"
"No," the owner replied. "While you're weeding, you might pull up the wheat along with the weeds.
Let them grow together until the harvest. Then I will tell the workers what to do. This is what I will say to them: First, gather the weeds. Bind them in bundles to be burned. Then gather the wheat. Bring it to my barn." The Parables of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast
Jesus told the crowd another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed. Someone took it and planted it in a field.
It is the smallest of all seeds. But when it grows, it becomes the largest of garden plants. It becomes a tree. Birds come and rest on its branches.
Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour until it was all leavened."
Jesus spoke these things to the multitudes in parables. Without a parable, he didn't speak to them.
The words of the prophet came to pass, who said, "I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter hidden things, things kept since the creation of the world." (Psalm 78:2) Jesus explains the story of the grasses.
Then Jesus left the crowd and went home. And his disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the tares in the field."
He answered, "The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.
The field is the world. The good seeds are the people who belong to the kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the evil one.
The enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the day of judgment. And the workers are the angels.
Weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire. That is how it will be on the Day of Judgment.
The Son of Man will send his angels. They will uproot everything that causes sin from his kingdom. They will also destroy everyone who does evil.
They will be thrown into the fiery furnace. There they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Then the people of God will shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom. Let those with ears listen. The parables of the buried treasure and the pearl.
"The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again. He was very happy. So he went and sold all he had. And he bought that field."
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.
He found one that was very precious. He went away and sold all that he had. And he bought that pearl. The parable of the net.
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea. It caught all kinds of fish.
When they were full, the fishermen pulled them to the shore. Then they sat down and gathered the good fish in baskets. But they threw away the bad fish.
Thus will be the Day of Reckoning. The angels will come. They will separate those who did wrong from those who did right.
The wicked will be thrown into the blazing furnace, where they will weep and gnash their teeth.
Jesus asked, "Do you understand all these things?" They answered, "Yes."
He said to them, "Every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings out of his treasure both new things and old." A prophet is not without honor except in his own town and in his own home.
Jesus finished telling these stories. Then he left.
He came to his hometown of Nazareth. There he began to teach the people in their synagogues. They were amazed. "Where does this man get this wisdom? And where does he get this power to do miracles?" they asked.
Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother called Mary? Aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
Aren't all his sisters with us? Where did this man get all these things?
They were not at all pleased with him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, and among his relatives and in his own home."
Few miracles were done there because they had no faith.
John the Baptist's head is cut off.
At that time, Herod the tetrarch, who ruled Galilee and Perea, heard about Jesus.
He said to them, "This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead! That is why he has the power to do miracles."
King Herod arrested John. He bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother.
John was telling Herod, "Her presence with you is unlawful."
Herod wanted to kill John. But he feared the people, for they believed John to be a prophet.
On Herod's birthday, Herodias' daughter danced for Herod and his guests. She pleased Herod greatly.
He had sworn to her that he would give her anything she asked for.
Her mother told her what to say. So the girl said to Herod, "Give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
The king was very angry. However, he remembered his promise and the dinner guests. So he ordered one of his men to give her what she asked for.
Herod cut off John's head in prison.
They brought his head on a large platter and presented it to the girl. She then took it to her mother.
John's disciples came and took away his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. Jesus fed the five thousand.
Jesus heard what had happened to John. He wanted to be alone. So he went by boat to a quiet place. The crowds heard about it. They followed him on foot from the towns.
When Jesus reached the shore, he saw a large crowd. He had compassion on them. He healed their sick.
As evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, "This is a remote place, and it's already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves."
Jesus answered, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat."
They answered, "We have only five loaves of bread and two fish."
He said, "Bring them here."
Then Jesus commanded the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven, and gave thanks. He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, who distributed them to the people.
Everyone ate and was satisfied. The disciples gathered up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.
The number of men who ate was about 5000 men. The women and children also ate. Jesus walks on water.
Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat. He told them to go ahead of him to the other side, to Bethsaida. Then he dismissed the crowd.
After sending them away, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. And when evening came, he was there alone.
The ship had gone too far from the shore. The waves were beating against it violently due to the winds blowing against it.
Early in the morning, Jesus came to the disciples. He walked on the lake.
They saw him walking on the lake and were terrified. "It's a ghost!" they said. And they screamed in fear.
Immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, "Take heart! It is I. Do not be afraid."
"Master, is it you?" asked Peter. "If it is you, tell me to come to you on the water."
Jesus said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
But when Peter saw the wind, he was afraid. He began to sink. Crying out, he said, "Lord, save me!"
Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?"
When they boarded the boat, the wind died down.
Then those who were in the boat worshiped Jesus, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God!"
They crossed the lake and came to land at Gennesaret.
The men who lived there knew Jesus. So they sent a message throughout the surrounding countryside. People brought all their sick to Jesus.
They pleaded with him to allow the sick to touch just the fringe of his garment, and everyone who touched it was healed.
What makes people "dirty"?
Some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem. They asked,
Why don't your students obey what the elders teach? Your students don't wash their hands before eating!
Jesus answered, "Why do you not obey the commandment of God? You prefer to follow your own teachings!"
God said, "Honor your father and your mother" (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) and also, "Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death" (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9).whenwhenwhenwhen
But you allow people to say to their parents, 'Any help you received from us is a gift dedicated to God.'
Therefore they do not need to honor their parents with their gift. You make the word of God of no effect that you may keep your own tradition.
You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying:
"They honor me with their words, but their hearts are far from me."
"Their worship means nothing to me. They only teach human rules." (Isaiah 29:13)
Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand.
What goes into your mouth does not make you "unclean." Rather, what comes out of your mouth is what makes you "unclean."
Then his disciples came to him. They asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
Jesus answered, "There are plants that my Father did not plant in heaven. They will be uprooted.
Leave them alone. The Pharisees are blind guides. A blind man leading a blind man will both fall into a pit.
Peter said, "Explain this to us."
"Do you not yet understand?" Jesus asked them.
Don't you see? Everything that goes into the mouth goes into the stomach. Then it comes out of the body.
But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart. These are the things that make you 'unclean'.
Evil thoughts come from the heart. So do murder, adultery, and other sexual sins. So do theft, bearing false witness, and lying to others.
"These are the things that make you 'unclean.' But eating without washing your hands does not make you 'unclean.' - The Faith of a Canaanite Woman"
Jesus left Galilee and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
A Canaanite woman who lived near Tyre and Sidon came to him and cried out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is tormented by a demon."
Jesus did not answer a word. His disciples came to him and pleaded with him, "Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us."
Jesus answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
Then the woman fell down before him, saying, "Master! Save me!"
He answered, saying: "It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
She said, "Yes, sir," but even dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' tables.
Then Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that hour. Jesus feeds the four thousand.
Jesus departed from there. He walked along the Sea of Galilee, then went up a mountain and sat down.
A large crowd gathered around him. They brought to him the blind, the lame, the paralyzed, those unable to speak, and many others. They laid them at his feet, and he healed them.
This amazed the people. The lame began to speak. The paralyzed were healed. The unable to walk could walk. The blind could see. So the people praised the God of Israel.
Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have great compassion on this crowd. They have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."
His disciples answered him, "There is nothing here but five loaves and two fish." They said, "What good is that with such a large crowd?"
Jesus asked, "How many loaves do you have?" They answered, "Seven, and a few small fish."
Jesus commanded the multitudes to sit down on the ground.
He took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples. And the disciples gave them to the people.
Everyone ate and was satisfied. Afterwards, the disciples gathered seven baskets of the broken pieces.
The number of men who ate was 4,000. Women and children also ate.
After Jesus had sent the crowds away, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
Jesus asks for a sign.
The Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
He answered, "In the evening you look at the sky and say, 'The weather will be good. The sky is red.'"
In the morning you say, 'Today will be stormy. The sky is red and cloudy.' You know the meaning of what you see in the sky. But you cannot understand the signs of what is happening now.
"A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign! But no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." And he left them and went away. The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees
The pupils crossed to the other side of the lake. They had forgotten to bring bread with them.
Jesus said to them, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
The pupils talked among themselves about this. They said, "He must be saying this because we didn't bring any bread with us."
Jesus knew what they were saying, and he said to them, "How little faith you have! Why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread?"
Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand? Don't you remember how many baskets of fragments were collected?
Do you not remember the seven loaves we distributed to the four thousand? Or the number of baskets we gathered the leftover bread in?
How can you not understand? I was not talking to you about bread. But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was not warning them about the yeast used in bread, but was cautioning them about the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Peter says that Jesus is the Messiah.
Jesus went to the region of Caesarea Philippi. There he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
They answered, "Some say it is John the Baptist. Others say it is Elijah. Still others say it is Jeremiah, or one of the prophets."
But what about you? he asked. Who do you say that I am?
Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
Jesus answered, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven."
This is what I tell you. You are Peter. And on this rock, I will build my church. The gates of hell will not be strong enough to destroy it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
Then Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. Jesus speaks about his upcoming death.
From that time on, Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem. There he will suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests, and teachers of the law. He will be killed, and on the third day he will rise again.
Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him. "Never, Lord!" he said. "This shall never happen to you!"
Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me. For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man."
Then Jesus spoke to his disciples. He said, "If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself. He must take up his cross and follow me.
If he wants to save his life, he will lose it. But if he sacrifices his life for me, he will find it.
What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?
The Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father, with his angels, and then he will reward each one according to his works.
What I am about to tell you is the truth. Some of you standing here will not die before you see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.
The appearance of Jesus was transformed.
Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, the brother of James. He led them up a high mountain, where they were alone.
There before them, his appearance was transformed. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as light.
At that moment, Moses and Elijah appeared before them, and they were speaking with Jesus.
Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three shelters: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
As Peter was speaking, a cloud appeared and overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my Son, my Beloved, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him.”
When the disciples heard this, they were terrified. They fell face down on the ground.
But Jesus came and touched them, saying, "Arise, do not be afraid."
When they lifted up their heads, they saw no one but Jesus.
They came down from the mountain. And as they were going down, Jesus commanded them that they should tell no man what they had seen, till the Son of man was risen from the dead.
The disciples asked him, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
Jesus replied, "True. Elijah is to come and restore all things."
But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also will they do to the Son of Man.
Then the disciples understood that Jesus was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Jesus healed a boy who had a demon.
As they approached the crowd, a man came up to Jesus. He knelt before him.
He said, "My Lord, have mercy on my son. He shivers greatly and suffers much. He often falls into fire or into water."
I took him to your pupils. But they couldn't cure him.
Jesus said, "O generation of vipers, how long shall ye continue to be blind? Bring the boy here to me."
Jesus commanded the demon to come out of the boy, and it left him immediately. The boy was healed at that moment.
Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why could we not cast it out?"
He replied, "Because your faith is so small. What I am telling you is true. If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, that is enough. You can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. Nothing will Farquhar Farquhar Farquhar Farquhar Farquhar Farquhar

They met together in Galilee. Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men."
"They will kill him. On the third day he will rise again." The disciples were filled with great sorrow. Jesus pays the temple tax.
Jesus and his disciples arrived at Capernaum. There, the tax collectors came to Peter and asked him, "Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?"
He answered and said, "Yes, it does." And when Peter had come into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take customs or taxes, from their children or from人民人民人
Peter replied, "From the others." Jesus said to him, "Then the children are free."
But we don't want to anger them. Go to the lake and cast your line. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth. You'll find there the very coin you need. Take it and present it to them as a tax for me and you. роз роз роз
