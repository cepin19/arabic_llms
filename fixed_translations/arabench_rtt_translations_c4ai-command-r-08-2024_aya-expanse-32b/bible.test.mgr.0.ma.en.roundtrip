Jesus called a little child to him and stood him among them.
Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."

"Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me."
"What, what, is there someone enticing these children who believe in God to engage in sins?! No, no, it would be better for them to hang a large millstone around his neck and drown him in the depths of the sea."

"If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter heaven without a hand or a foot than to be thrown into hell with both. Hell has a fire that never goes out."
If your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter heaven with one eye than to remain with two eyes and go to hell. The parable of the lost sheep.
Look well, don't bother any of these children. That's what I'm telling you. Their angels in heaven pass by at any time to see my father who is in heaven.
(No
"What are you saying? Imagine a man has 100 sheep and one of them gets lost. Is he going to leave the 99 sheep in the mountain? Or is he going to go search for the one that's lost?"
What I'm going to tell you is true. The thing he found will make him happier than the 99 that weren't lost.
Just as your Father in heaven does not want even one of these little ones to be lost, when someone sins against you...
If your brother wrongs you, go to him. Tell him where he went wrong. Keep it between yourselves. If he listens to you, you've won him over.
But who will listen to you? Take along with you one or two men. The Quran says: "And have two witnesses from among your men, and if there are not two men, then a man and two women from among those whom you accept as witnesses, so that if one of them errs, the other can remind her." (Surah Al-Baqarah, Verse 282)
But what if he refuses to listen even to the church? In that case, tell it to the church. What if he refuses to listen even to the church? In that case, do not treat him as a brother. Treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
"What I am telling you is true. What is bound on earth will be bound in heaven, and what is loosed on earth will be loosed in heaven."
Again, I tell you, whatever two of you agree on earth will be done for you by my Father in heaven.
"Whenever two or three are gathered in my name, I am with them." The servant who had no mercy.
Peter came to Jesus and said, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"
Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."
"The kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants."
When the king began to do it, a man who owed him millions of dollars was brought to him.
The man couldn't pay. That's why his master gave the order. The man, his wife, his children, and everything he owns must be sold to repay his debt.
My master stood before him. "Give me a chance," he pleaded. "I'll return everything."
Sido felt pity for him. He forgave him for what he owed him and let him go.
But then that servant went out and found one of the other servants who owed him a few dollars. He grabbed him and started choking him. He said, 'Pay me what you owe!'
"The other slave knelt on his knees. 'Give me time,' he pleaded. 'I will pay you back the money.'"
But the first servant refused. Instead, he went and threw the man into prison until he paid back all he owed.
They saw the other servants what was happening. They were very affected. They went and told their master everything that happened.
"Then, he called the first servant and he entered. He said to him: 'O wicked servant, I forgive you for everything you did to me, because you asked me for this.'"
"Why didn't you show mercy to my brother Obed as I showed mercy to you?"
His master was angry with the spies. He will punish them until they return everything they took from him.
This is how your father in heaven will deal with you if you do not forgive your brother from the bottom of your heart.
Isa is teaching about divorce.
When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
Large crowds followed him. He healed them there.
They asked the Frenchmen to choose. Solo: "Does the law give a man the right to divorce his wife for any reason?"
Jesus answered, "Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator made them male and female?" (Genesis 1:27)
He said, "That's why a man leaves his parents and marries his wife. They become one."
There are no longer two, but one. That's why man cannot separate what divine power has joined.
Suleiman: "Why did Moses, peace be upon him, command the man to write a divorce decree for his wife and then hand it to her?"
Jesus answered, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of heart, but it was not this way from the beginning."
Hani is telling you: A man who divorces his wife and marries another is a traitor. A man will only divorce his wife if she has betrayed him.
The students said to him, "If this is how a husband treats his wife, it's better not to get married."
Jesus answered, "Not everyone can accept the idea of celibacy. Only those who are given the grace to live without marriage can accept it."
Some men are unable to have children because that is how their wives were born. Some are like that because people have brought them to that state. Others have made themselves that way to serve the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept living that way should do so." They brought children to him so that he might touch them.
Some people brought little children to Jesus. They wanted him to lay hands on them and pray over them. But the disciples told the people to stop.
Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me. Do not hinder them. For the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
Jesus laid his hands on them. Then he went from there. Jesus and the rich young man.
A man came to Jesus and asked him, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?"
"Why do you ask me about what is good?" Jesus answered. "There is only one who is good. That is why, if you want to enter the kingdom of heaven, obey the commands of God."
"Do you know them?" asked the man. Our Lord Jesus answered, "Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not bear false witness."
"Honor your parents." (Exodus 20:12-16; Deuteronomy 5:16-20) and "Love your neighbor as yourself." (Leviticus 19:18)
The young man said, "I have kept all these commandments; what more shall I do?"
Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."
When the young man heard this, he went away sad. He was very rich.
Jesus said to his disciples, "What I am about to tell you is true. It is difficult for rich people to enter the kingdom of heaven."
I tell you again, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.
And she said to the disciples, "This saying is hard to understand. Are you sure there isn't someone who will be saved?"
Jesus looked at them and said, "For mortals it is impossible, but for God all things are possible."
Peter answered and said to him, "We have left everything to follow you! What then will we have?"
"What I am telling you is true," said our Lord Jesus. "When everything is renewed, the sons of men will sit on his glorious throne. When they sit down, those who followed me will also sit on twelve thrones. You will judge the twelve tribes of Israel."
Everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.
But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.
The Tale of the Workers in the Chrome Mine
The kingdom of heaven is like a man who owned a field. He went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
He agreed to pay them the usual wage for a day's work. Then he sent them to his vineyard.
At nine o'clock in the morning, he went out again. He saw people standing in the market doing nothing.
He told them, "Even you, come help me with my harvest. I'll pay you what you deserve."
He's walking around. He left again around one in the afternoon and three in the evening and did the same thing as before.
At around five o'clock, he went out and found other people standing. He asked them, "Why are you standing here all day long without doing anything?"
They replied, "No one has given us a job." He told them, "But you still work in my company."
When evening came, the conversation took place between the owner of the vineyard and the foreman. He said to him, "Call the workers and pay them. Start with those who were hired last, and then pay those who were hired first."
The workers who were hired numbered almost five. Each of them received the regular daily wage.
When the first employees arrived, they expected to be paid more. However, each of them received the regular daily wage.
When they arrived, they started complaining about their friend.
They said: "These people who were hired last only worked for one hour, and now they're getting the same as us. We did most of the work and were under the sun all day."
The homeowner answered one of them. He said to him, "My friend, I am being fair to you. Didn't you agree to the service at the regular daily rate?"
God bless you, your money, and your journey. I want to give those who came at the end the same fee I gave you.
And don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Do you feel resentful because you gave so generously to others?
"Those who are last will be first, and those who are first will be last." Jesus speaks of His impending death.
Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. And on the way, he took the twelve disciples aside to speak to them.
He said, "We will go to Jerusalem." "The son of man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes. They will condemn him to death."
"He will give them to people who are not Jews. These people will mock him and scourge him. They will crucify him. On the third day, he will rise from the dead!" A mother asks a favor of Jesus.
The mother of Zbedi's children came to him. Her children came with her. They prostrated before him and asked him for a favor.
"What do you want?" Jesus asked. She said to him, "Grant that one of my sons may sit at your right hand and the other at your left in your kingdom. You promised that one would sit on your right and the other on your left."
Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I am about to drink?" They answered, "We can."
Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."
These ten other students heard about this. They were angry with these two brothers.
They all gathered. He told them, "You know about the rulers of the countries. They oppress their people and rule them by force."
Don't be like that. On the contrary, whoever wants to be important among you must be your servant.
And whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave.
"Be like a son of Adam. He did not come to be served. He came to serve others. He came to give his life as a ransom to free many people." "Two blind men saw."
Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, and a large crowd followed them.
Two blind men were sitting by the roadside. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they shouted, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"
They were given the order: "Silence!" They were told: "Be quiet!" But these men kept shouting loudly: "Oh Lord, oh son of David, have mercy on us!"
Jesus stood and called to them, "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked them.
Answer: "Mawlana, we want to see him."
Jesus felt great compassion for them. He touched their eyes. Immediately they could see. And they followed him.
Jesus enters Jerusalem
And as they approached Jerusalem, they came to Bethphage, on the Mount of Olives. Then Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them,
He told them, "Go to the village ahead of you. When you arrive, you will find a donkey tied up. Her foal will be with her. Untie them and bring them to me."
If anyone tells you anything, tell them our master needs them. Their friend will send them right away.
This happened so that what was said about the Prophet would come true. He said,
"Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem! Lo, your king comes to you; triumphant and victorious is he, humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey." (Zechariah 9:9)
The disciples went and did what Jesus told them to do.
They brought the donkey and the colt. They placed their cloaks on them. Then our Lord Jesus sat on the cloaks.
A large number of people gathered and spread out their cloaks on the ground. Others cut branches from trees and spread them on the ground.
Some people went ahead of him, and some followed him. They all shouted, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" (Psalm 118:26) "Hosanna in the highest heaven!"
When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up. The people asked, "Who is this?"
The people answered him, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." Jesus cleansed the temple.
Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be a house of prayer' (Isaiah 56:7), but you have made it a 'den of robbers' (Jeremiah 7:11)."
People who were blind and disabled came to Jesus in the temple. At that time, he saw them and healed them.
The chief priests and the scribes saw the miracles that he did, and they saw the children making a noise in the temple, crying: "Hosanna to the Son of David!" But when they saw all this, they were angry.
"Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," replied Jesus. "Haven't you read," he said to them, "that from the lips of children and infants you, Lord, have called forth praise?" (Psalm 8:2)
And afterward, Jesus went out from among the people and walked outside the city to the garden. He spent the night there. The fig tree withered.
Early in the morning, Jesus was on his way back to Jerusalem. He was hungry.
He saw a fig tree by the road. He went to it, but found only leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" And after he had said this, the tree withered.
When the students saw this, they were astonished. "Why did the fig dry up so quickly?" they asked.
Jesus answered and said to them, "Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be thrown into the sea,' it will happen."
"If you believe, what you ask for in prayer will be granted to you." "Doubting Jesus' authority"
Jesus entered the temple. While he was teaching there, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him and said, "By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?"
Jawabo Isa, "Ghadin nsalak ana kassak su'al wahid. In jawabtini ghadin nqul lik 3laash kndir hadchi." Translation: Answer, Isa, "I will ask you one more question. If you answer me, I will tell you why I am doing this."
"Where did John's baptism come from? From heaven or from men?" This is what they were discussing among themselves. They said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'"
But what if we say "among men"? We are afraid of people. Everyone thinks that John was a prophet.
The people's children replied, "We don't know." Our master Jesus said to them, "Well, I'm not going to tell you why I do these things." A tale of the children of our master Adam.
"What do you think about this? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, today work in the vineyard.'"
The boy said, "I'm not going." But after thinking, he changed his mind and went.
Then the father went to the second son. He said the same thing to him. The son replied, "I will go, my lord." But he did not go.
"Which of the two sons did what his father wanted?" "The first," they answered. Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you."
John came to show you the right way to live. But you didn't want to believe him. However, the tax collectors and prostitutes did believe him. You saw it with your own eyes. But still, you didn't want to rise from your sins and believe him. The story of the rented servant.
"He heard another story. There was a man who had a piece of land where he planted vineyards. He built a wall around it. He dug a winepress in it. And he built a watchtower on it. He leased it to some farmers and went his way on a journey."
When the time for the harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants, to collect his share of the produce.
But his dogs barked at his servant. He hit one of them. He killed another. He threw stones at the third to kill him.
Then the man sent other servants to the vine-growers. He sent more than the first time. The vine-growers treated them in the same way.
Finally, he sent his son to them. He said, "They will respect my son."
But the tenants saw the boy coming. They said to each other, "This is the one who will take everything from the landlord one day. Come, let's kill him. That way, everything will be ours."
That's why they took him and threw him out of the village. Then they killed him.
"And the owner of the vineyard, will he come? What will he do with these tenants?"
"He will destroy these wicked people," "and then he will lease the vineyard to new tenants. They will give him his share of the produce at harvest time."
Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" (Psalm 118:22-23)
Hani, I'm telling you. They will take away from you the kingdom of God. They will give it to those who bear fruit in it.
Anyone who falls on this stone will be broken. But the stone will crush anyone who falls on it.
The chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables. They knew he was talking about them.
That's how they started looking for a way to stop him. But they were afraid of the crowd. People were convinced that Jesus was a prophet.
Wedding Dinner Story
Jesus told them other stories. He said,
This is an example of what the kingdom of heaven will be like. A king gave a great banquet for his son.
He sold his servant to the people he invited to dinner. His servant told them to come, but they refused.
"Then he sent many servants. He told them, 'Go and tell those I have invited that my dinner is ready. I have slaughtered my fat cattle and my fattened sheep. Everything is ready. Come to the wedding dinner.'"
But people didn't pay attention to her. One went to his place in the village. Another went to his work.
The remnants of the medicine served me. They tortured and killed them.
The sultan was furious. He sent his army to destroy them. They killed the criminals and burned down their city.
The king said to his servants, "The feast is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy to come."
Walk to the alley. Call out to the cats you see.
The slaves went out into the streets. They gathered the people they found, both good and bad. And in secret, they prepared the wedding and the feast.
The king entered to see the guests. He found a man not wearing wedding attire.
He said to him, "Buddy, how did you get in here without your wedding clothes?" The man didn't know what to say.
"Then the king said to his servants, 'Bind his hands and feet. Take him outside into the darkness. He will weep and gnash his teeth.'"
"Many are called, but few are chosen." Should we pay taxes to Caesar?
The Pharisees left. They plotted to entrap Jesus in his words.
They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians. They said, "Teacher, we know that you are sincere and teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You don't care about anyone's opinion of you, and you don't put on a show to impress people.
Tell us what you think, should we pay taxes to Caesar or not?
But Jesus knew what they were planning. He said to them, "Hypocrites! Why are you trying to trap me?"
"I showed them the currency I used to pay the tax." They brought him a silver coin.
They said: "Who is this person in the picture? And who wrote this text?"
"Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's."
They heard this and got scared. They left and went away. When will the dead rise for marriage?
On the same day, the Sadducees came to him with a question. They did not believe in the resurrection.
They said to him, "Master, this is what Moses told us. If a man dies without children, his brother must marry his wife. He must father children for his brother."
We had seven brothers. The first one got married and died. Since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
The same thing happened to the second, third, and even the seventh brother.
In the end, the woman died.
"And why, when the resurrection comes, will you be with whom? All seven of them were married to you."
Jesus answered, "You are wrong, because you do not know the Scriptures, nor the power of God."
When the dead rise, they won't marry. Their parents won't give them away in marriage. They will be like angels in paradise.
"Don't you see the dead coming out? Haven't you read what God told you?"
He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." (Exodus 3:6) He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living.
And the republic said, "That thing was astonishing with what it taught." The most important legacy.
When the Pharisees heard that the Sadducees had no answer to Jesus, they gathered together.
One of them was a legal scholar. That's why our master Jesus tested him with a question.
The student asked the teacher, "What is the most important thing in the law?"
Jesus answered, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind." (Deuteronomy 6:5)
This is the first and most important commandment.
"And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'" (Leviticus 19:18)
"Everything written in the law and the prophets is based on these two commandments." "Is the child the Messiah?"
The Pharisees gathered together. They asked Jesus,
"What do you say about our Lord Jesus? Who was his father?" "David," they answered.
He said to them, "Why then does David call him 'Lord'? The Holy Spirit spoke through David's mouth." David said,
"The LORD said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.'" (Psalm 110:1)
"How can David have a son and call him 'Sidi'?"
No one else dared to answer him with such words. From that day on, no one dared to ask him even a single question.
Jesus condemns the Pharisees and the teachers of the law.
Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples,
He said, "The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat."
"You have to obey them. Do everything they tell you. But don't be like them. They only talk and don't do anything."
They carry the heavy load and put it on people's shoulders. And they don't want to lift a finger to do anything.
"Everything they do is just for show. They wear small caps on their heads and armbands with verses from the Quran. They make them very wide. And they make the sleeves of their jalabiyas very long."
They like to sit in places of honor at dinners. They even like to take the important seats in synagogues.
They like it when people greet them in the market. They like it when someone calls them "Rabbi".
But you don't need to be called "Rabbi." You have only one Master, and you are all brothers.
Don't call anyone on this earth "Father." You have only one Father, and he is in heaven.
You don't need to call yourself "teacher." You have one teacher, and it's Christ.
The most important person among you will be your servant.
He who raises his head will lower it. And he who lowers himself will be raised.
"How severely will you be condemned, you teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You lock people out of the kingdom of heaven. You yourselves do not enter, and you hinder those who are trying to enter."
(No
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and then you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are."
"What a disaster you are, you who blind people! You say: 'If someone swears by the temple, it means nothing. But if they swear by the gold of the temple, they must keep their oath.'"
You are blind and stupid! What's more important, gold or the temple that sanctifies gold?
You say: "If someone swears by the stove, it's nothing. But if someone swears by the gift above it, they must fulfill it."
Oh blind ones! Is what is more important the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
"He swore by the temple, as he would swear by everything in it."
And anyone who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it.
And whoever swears by the name of the sky is swearing by the name of the throne of God and the One who sits upon it.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill and cumin—but you have neglected the more important matters of the law—justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former."
Oh misguided ones! You are straining at gnats in your food, but swallowing camels!
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. You only care about outward appearances, but your hearts are full of wickedness. You only want to satisfy your own desires."
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside will be clean also.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness."
Just the way you are. From the outside, it's all work, but inside, it's full of what's not right. You're deluding yourself.
"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous."
And you would say, "If we were living in the time of those who came before us, we would not have done as they did. We would not have assisted in the killing of the prophets."
You bear witness against yourselves that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.
Complete the sins they started for you, those who came before you!
"O den of venomous snakes! How will you escape being sentenced to the fire?"
I will send you prophets, wise men, and teachers. You will kill some of them. You will crucify some of them. You will flog some of them in your synagogues. You will drive them from town to town.
You will surely pay for the blood of every innocent person who has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
What I'm going to tell you is true. This is going to happen to those who are alive now.
"Jerusalem! Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone those sent to you by God. How often I have wanted to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!"
Look, your house is empty.
Tell me, you won't see me until you say, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord."
Signs of the End Times
Jesus left the temple. As he was walking away, his disciples came to him and pointed out the magnificent temple buildings.
"Do you see all these things?" asked Jesus. "Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives. At that time, the disciples came to him privately. "Tell us," they said, "when will this happen? And what will be the sign of your coming? And what will be the sign of the end?"
Jesus answered: "Watch out! Beware of those who deceive you."
Many will come in my name, saying, "I am the Christ!" and they will deceive many.
"You will hear about wars. You will hear people talking about the wars to come. Don't be afraid. This is happening and will happen. But the end is not here yet."
Nations will fight nations. Kingdoms will fight kingdoms. People will go hungry. There will be earthquakes in many places.
This is all just the beginning of the labor pains.
"And people will hand you over and will treat you badly and will kill you. All nations will hate you because of me."
In times like these, many will lose their faith. Some will hate. And some will wash the feet of their enemies.
A lot of charlatans are going to appear. They will deceive many people.
If evil increases, people's love will grow cold.
But whoever endures to the end will be saved.
This good news of the kingdom is going to spread all over the world. It will be a testimony to all nations. Then God will bring about the resurrection.
"The prophet Daniel spoke of the 'abomination that desolates.' (Daniel 9:27; 11:31; 12:11) You will see it standing in the holy place. The reader needs to understand this."
"They are making mountains out of molehills."
No one on the roof goes down to their house to get something.
No one in the field will come to take their job.
How difficult those days will be for pregnant women! How difficult it will be for those who are breastfeeding!
"Pray to God so you won't have to flee in winter or on Saturday."
There will be great suffering in those days. It will be worse than anything since the beginning of the world until now. And it will never be like that again.
"If it were not for the brevity of time, no one would remain. But because of God's chosen people, it will be shortened."
At that time, some will say to you, "Look! Here is the Christ!" or "There he is!" Do not believe it.
You will see false Christs and false prophets arise. They will perform great miracles and signs. They will try to deceive the believers of God, if possible.
See, I told you before.
If someone tells you, "It's far in the desert," don't go out. Or if someone tells you, "He's too deep inside the house," don't believe it.
"The lightning that comes from the east appears in the west. It will be like that when God brings His son."
Vultures will gather wherever there's a carcass.
"Immediately after the terrible suffering of those days, 'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the celestial bodies will be shaken.' (Isaiah 13:10; 34:4)"
"Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory."
He sends His messengers with clear signs, bringing the creatures of His choice from darkness to light, and He brings light and darkness from the womb of the earth and from within the wombs of men.
"Learn a lesson from the fig tree. When its leaves fall and its branch becomes tender, you know that summer is near."
In any case, when you see all that happening, you'll know the end is near. It's at the door.
What I'm going to tell you is true. The people who lived in that time period won't die until everything I've told you happens.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. No one knows the day or the hour.
No one knows the day or the hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
Remember how it was in the days of Noah. It will be the same when the Son of Man comes.
In the days before the flood, people ate and drank. They married. They gave their daughters in marriage. They did these things until the day Noah entered the ark.
We had no idea what was going to happen until the floods came and took them all. This is what will happen when they take our children.
There will be two men in the field, one will take him and one will leave him.
They will grind with the grindstones of grief, one will take and one will remain.
Stay awake. You don't know where your Lord will come to you from.
You need to understand something. If the homeowner knew where the thief was going to strike, he would have been guarding his house. He wouldn't have let it be broken into.
Beware lest you be neglectful. Man is born to bring you news at the hour you least expect.
We imagine a master of a house having one of his servants responsible for the other servants in his house. This servant's task is to feed them at the right time. The master wanted a trustworthy and sensible servant for this task.
It would be good for the servant if his master found him doing his work when he returns.
What I'm going to tell you is true. The man is going to leave this servant in charge of everything he has.
But suppose this slave is wicked. Suppose he says to himself, "My master is a long time in coming."
He starts hitting the servants. And he eats and drinks with those who drink a lot.
The master will return to his servant on a day he does not expect, at an hour he does not know.
They will be given what they have earned, and they will be cut off from what they have devised. They will be sent to the place where they are going, those people with their kind. There they will weep and they will gnash their teeth.
The Tale of the Ten Brides
This is how it will be in paradise at that time. Ten brides will take their lamps and go out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were fools. Five were wise.
The ignorant people brought their lamps but did not bring olive oil with them.
The wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
The groom hasn't come for a long time. Because the witnesses got tired and fell asleep.
In the middle of the night, someone shouted, "The groom is here! Let's go meet him!"
"And all the bride's girls woke up and held their lamps."
The fools said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil. Our candles are going to go out."
"No, answer them. It might not be enough for all of us. Instead, go to the oil sellers. Buy some for yourselves."
"They went to buy oil. But on their way, the bride came. They entered with her and the party guests. And the door closed."
"Then they came like their sisters, the brides. 'Our master! Our master!' they said. 'Open the door for us!'
But he answered: "What I am going to tell you is true. I don't know you."
Be careful. We don't know the day or the hour when the groom will come. This story has been going on for three years.
Again, it will be like a kingdom of heaven. A man was going on a journey. He called his servants and gave them responsibility for his possessions.
He gave 10,000 dirhams to one. He gave 4,000 dirhams to another. And he gave 2,000 dirhams to the third. The man gave each of the servants that amount that he knew they would preserve. And he went on his way.
The servant who was given 10,000 dirhams spent it all and then started working for his money. He earned another 10,000 dirhams.
He who brings 4000 dirhams will add another 4000 dirhams.
But the man who was given 2000 dirhams went and dug a hole in the ground. He hid his master's money in it.
After a long time, the master of these slaves returned. He wanted to collect the money they had earned.
The man who was given 10,000 dirhams brought another 10,000 dirhams. He said to him, "Sir, you gave me 10,000 dirhams, and here I have won another 10,000 dirhams."
His master said to him, "Blessings upon you, my faithful servant! You have done well. I will give you great responsibility. Come and share my joy!"
The man to whom you gave 4000 dirhams came. He said to you: "Sir, you gave me 4000 dirhams, and here I have won another 4000 dirhams."
His master said to him, "Blessings upon you, my faithful servant! You have done well. I will give you great responsibility. Come and share my joy!"
Then the man who had given him $2000 came. He said to him, "Sir, I know you are a harsh man. You reap where you did not sow, and gather grain where you did not plant it."
I was scared. I went out and put $2000 on the ground. Look, this is what's left for you.
Jawabo Seydo: "You good-for-nothing and lazybones! Do you know where I reap without sowing? Do you know where I gather the harvest without scattering the seeds?"
And why didn't you put my money in the bank? I would have gotten interest on it.
Then his master commanded the other servants, "Give him 2000 dirhams. Give it to the one who has 20,000."
Everyone who has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. But those who do not have, even those who have will have it taken from them.
"That failed servant will be driven out. People will weep and bite their tongues in the dark."
God Almighty will bring His son in His glory. All the angels will come with Him. Then He will sit on His throne in the glory of Paradise.
All the nations will be gathered before him. He will separate the people into two groups, just like a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
He will put the sheep to his right and the goats to his left.
Then the King will speak to those on his right, saying to them, 'Blessed by my Father! Come, take your inheritance. This kingdom has been prepared for you since the creation of the world.'
I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger, and you invited me in.
I needed clothes. And you gave them to me. I was sick. And you took care of me. I was in prison. And you came to visit me.
The people who did good will reply, "Lord, when did we see the hungry and feed them, or the thirsty and give them drink?"
Why did we see you as a stranger and bring you in? Why did we see you in need of clothes and give them to you?
"Why did we see you sick or in prison and went to visit you?"
The king will reply: "What I am about to tell you is true. Anything you do to one of these people who are considered my younger brothers, you are doing it to me."
"He will say to those in his sight: 'May God curse you! Go to the fire of eternal torment. That is the fire of Satan and his angels.'"
I was hungry. But you didn't give me anything to eat. I was thirsty. But you didn't give me anything to drink.
I was a stranger. But you did not invite me. I needed clothes. But you did not give me any. I was sick and in prison. But you did not help me.
They will say to Him: "O Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not help You?"
He will reply: "What I am going to tell you is true. Anything you haven't done to one of these people who mean nothing to you, you haven't done to me."
"And they will go away into eternal punishment, but those who have done good will have eternal life."
"The plot to kill Jesus"
Jesus said all these things, and then he said to his disciples,
As you know, Easter is in two days. The Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
The chief priests and the elders of the people came together in the palace of Caiaphas, the high priest.
They devised a scheme to capture him cleverly. They wanted to kill him.
"But not during the holiday," they said. "It will cause a problem with the people." A woman poured perfume on Jesus.
Jesus was in Bethlehem. He was in the house of a man named Simon, who had a skin disease.
A woman came to him with a very expensive bottle of perfume, well sealed. She poured the perfume over his head while he was having lunch.
And the disciples said, "This thing cannot be," and they said, "What a loss!"
The perfume might be sold at a high price. And the money might be given to poor people.
He was blocking this thing. At that moment, he told them, "Why are you chasing this woman? She did me a good turn."
You will always have the poor with you. But you will not always have me.
She poured perfume on my body so I could be embalmed and buried.
"What I am going to tell you is true. What she did will be told everywhere it is known that this good news in the whole world. It will always be told in her memory." Judas agrees to hand over Jesus.
One of the twelve went to the chief priests. His name was Judas Iscariot.
Judas: "What will you give me if I deliver Jesus to you?" That's why they gave him thirty pieces of silver.
From that hour, he brought his disciples to him that he might give the Lord Jesus to them. The Lord's Supper
It was the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal for you?"
"Go to the city to a certain man. Tell him, 'The master says to you, 'My time is near. I will celebrate Passover in your house with my disciples.' '"
So the disciples did as Jesus had told them. They prepared the Passover meal.
When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples.
As they were walking, he said, "What I am about to tell you is true. One of you will hand me over to my enemy."
They were very sad. One by one, they started saying to him, "No, my Lord, no?"
Jesus answered, "He who dips his hand with me in the dish, he will betray me."
Man will go as it is written for him. But how difficult it will be for him who gives birth to a son of man! It would have been better for him if he had not been born.
Judas is the one who will hand him over. He said to him, "It is not me, Rabbi, is it?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is you."
And while they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks, and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Eat this; this is my body."
Then he took the glass, praised God, and passed it to them. He said, "Drink it all."
This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
Hani, I'm telling you. From now on, I'm not going to drink alcohol with you until the day we drink together in my father's paradise.
And after they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus said to Peter, "Today, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times."
Jesus said to them, "This very night, all of you will fall away on account of me, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' (Zechariah 13:7)"
But after we rise from the dead, we will go ahead of you into Galilee."
Peter replied, "Everything will be fine, but I won't."
"What I'm about to tell you is true," Jesus answered. "Tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times and say that you don't know me."
But Peter said to him, "Though I should die with you, I will not deny you." Likewise also said all the disciples. Jesus prayed in Gethsemane.
Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Wait here while I go and pray to my Father."
He took Peter and the sons of Zebedee with him. He began to feel sad and troubled.
He told them, "My heart is very sad. I feel like I'm going to die. Stay here, keep me company in the guardhouse."
He walked a little farther. Then he fell to the ground. He prayed and said, "Father, if it is possible, let this cup of suffering pass from me. But do as you will, not as I want."
He went back to his friends and found them sleeping. "Can't you even wait an hour with me?" he said to Peter.
"Look at me. That's how you won't fall into sin when you try. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
Jesus went away for the second time. He prayed, "Abba, Father, can this cup pass from me? But if it cannot pass from me unless I drink it, may your will be done."
He came back later. He found them sleeping, just like last time. They couldn't stay awake.
He left them and walked away as usual. This is the third time he's calling for the same thing.
Turn to the students. He told them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Look! The hour is coming. The Son of Man is going to be handed over to the sinners."
"Get up! Let's go! Here is the one who will hand me over to them!" The arrest of Jesus.
And behold, Jesus was speaking, and Judas, one of the twelve, came up. A large crowd came with him, carrying swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Judas, who was going to betray Jesus, had agreed on a signal with them. "The one I will kiss is the man," he said. "Seize him."
"So Mary stood right by Jesus' side. She greeted him, 'Teacher, I salute you!' and kissed him."
Jesus answered, "Friend, do what you have come to do." Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested him.
At that hour, one of Jesus' companions drew his sword. He struck the high priest's servant and cut off his ear.
Jesus said to him, "Put your sword away; those who live by the sword will die by the sword."
Do you think I'll ask Papa to help me? He'll send me an army of angels, so many, so many, so many, so many, so many, so many.
But how will the heavenly books be fulfilled? They say this has to happen this way.
At that time, Jesus said to the crowd, "Am I leading an armed rebellion against you? Is it necessary for you to come out with swords and clubs to arrest me? I have been teaching in the temple every day, and you did not arrest me."
But all this happened so that the words of the prophets would be fulfilled." Then all his disciples deserted him and fled. They took Jesus to the high council of the Jews.
Those who had arrested Jesus brought him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
He didn't want to go too far, he followed Peter and Jesus. He went all the way to the demon's house. He entered and sat with the guards to see what would happen.
The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus in order to put him to death.
But they found no evidence, even though many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two other witnesses came forward.
They said: "This man said, 'I will make a temple like this temple of God, I will destroy it and rebuild it in three days.'"
Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Will you not answer? What is it that these people are accusing you of?"
But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us, are you the Christ, the Son of God?"
"Yes. Just as you say." Jesus answered. "But I tell you all: In the days to come, you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? You have heard the blasphemy with your own ears!"
What are you saying? "He must die!" they answered.
And then they insulted him, despised him, and hit him with their hands. Some even slapped him.
They said to him, "Prophesy to us, Christ! Who struck you?" Peter said, "I do not know Jesus."
Peter was sitting in the courtyard. A servant came to him and said, "You were with Jesus of Galilee."
But before them all, Peter denied it. "I do not know what you are talking about," he said.
He went out to the gate to go into the courtyard. Another of the women saw him. She said to the people, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
He said it again and swore, "I don't know this man!"
"After a while, they went to Boutros's place. 'You must be him,' they told him. 'I knew it from your speech.' "
And Peter began to curse and swear, saying, "I do not know the man!" And immediately the cock crowed.
And then he remembered that Jesus had said to him, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." Peter went outside and wept bitterly.
Judas hanged Rassou.
It was early in the morning. All the chief priests and elders of the people decided to kill Jesus.
They bound him and delivered him. Then they handed him over to Pontius Pilate, the governor.
Judas realized what he had done, knew the consequences, and felt immense shame and regret. He returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
He said, "I made a mistake, I handed over an innocent man." They replied, "What do you have to do with us? That's your problem."
That's why Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went and hanged himself.
The big bosses collected the money. They said: "This is haram, we should put this money in the mosque's funds. This is blood money. They bought a man's death with it.
They decided to take the money to buy land for a cemetery. They will bury in it the people who came from outside.
That's why they called it "the Field of Blood" until that day.
And then I verified the words that the prophet Jeremiah had spoken. He had said, "They weighed out thirty pieces of silver. This price was determined by the Jews."
"Use this thirty pieces of silver to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me." (Zechariah 11:12,13; Jeremiah 19:1-13; 32:6-9) Jesus before Pilate
Jesus stood before the governor. The governor asked, "Are you the King of the Jews?" "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus answered.
But when the chief priests and elders brought the charges against him, he did not answer.
Pilate asked him, "Don't you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?"
But Jesus did not answer even one accusation. The governor was baffled.
It was the governor's custom at Easter to release one prisoner. The people could choose whom they wanted.
Then they released a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.
When the people were gathered, Pilate asked them, "Whom do you want me to release? Barabbas? Or Jesus who is called Christ?"
Pilate knew that the chief priests were jealous of him. He was aware that this was the reason they handed Jesus over to him.
And while Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message, saying, "Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much in a dream today because of him."
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the people to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus put to death.
"Which of the two do you want me to release?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered.
Pilate said, "What shall I do with this man called Christ?" They all answered, "Crucify him!"
"Why? What has this man done to deserve this?" asked Bilat. But they shouted even louder, "Crucify him!"
When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "It is your responsibility!"
Answer completely: "We and our children will bear the responsibility for your death!"
Release Barabbas, but scourge Jesus and deliver him to be crucified. The soldiers mock Jesus.
The governor's soldiers led Jesus to the governor's headquarters, called the Praetorium. All the other soldiers gathered around him.
They took off his clothes and dressed him in a scarlet gown.
And then they picked up the thorns and wove them into a crown. They placed it on his head. They gave him a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt before him and laughed at him. "We honor you, King of the Jews!" they said.
They keep taunting him. They hit him on the head with a stick from time to time.
After they had mocked him, they stripped him of his clothing. They gave him his garments. And they led him away to be crucified. The crucifixion of the Lord Christ.
On their way out of the city, they met a man from Cyrene named Simon. They forced him to carry the cross.
Go to a place called Skull. Skull means the place of the brain.
Then they mixed wine with gall and offered it to Jesus to drink. But when he had tasted it, he refused to drink it.
While they were crucifying him, they divided his garments by casting lots.
They sat and kept watching him there.
They put a sign over his head that read: "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
There were also two criminals crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
Those who passed by him shouted in his face and mocked him. They shook their heads.
And he said to them, "You will destroy the temple and in three days I will rebuild it." So the chief priests and the scribes said, "What will this man do? He says, 'I am the Son of God,' making himself equal to God." And the high priest answered and said to them, "What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy!"
However the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders mocked him.
They said, "He saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the King of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him."
"Verily, Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He punishes whom He wills and forgives whom He wills. And Allah is Most Capable of everything." He who said, "I am the son of Allah."
And the thieves who were crucified with Jesus also reviled him. Jesus died.
From evening until three, darkness covered the entire country.
At three in the morning, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" that is, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Psalm 22:1)
Some of the chickens standing here heard Jesus shout. They said, "It's Elijah he's calling for."
One of them quickly went and got him a sponge. He soaked it in vinegar and put it on the stick. He gave it to him to drink.
They said to them: "Leave him alone. We'll see if Elias comes to save him."
After Jesus cried out in a loud voice, he died.
In that moment, you tear the curtain of the sanctuary from top to bottom. The earth trembled. The rocks split.
The graves were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised.
They came out of the tombs. After Jesus had risen, they went to the holy city. There, many people saw them.
The centurion and those who were guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and all that had happened, were terrified. They said, "Truly this was the Son of God!"
He did not want to go far, there were many women there. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to serve him.
Mary Magdalene was among them. Mary, the mother of James and Joseph, was there too. There were also the mothers of Zebed's children. They buried Jesus.
As evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came. He was a disciple of Jesus.
He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
Joseph took the body and wrapped it in some clean white cloth.
They laid him in his new tomb, which had been cut out of the rock. They rolled a big stone in front of the entrance and left.
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. The tomb guards.
The day for the one who was coming was a day after day of preparation. They went to Pilate, the chief priests, and the Pharisees.
They said to him, "Sir, we are waiting for something from that liar who said it while he was alive. He said, 'I will return in three days.'"
He commanded those who were guarding the tomb to remain there for three days. That was why, so that his disciples would not come and steal the body and tell people that Jesus had risen from the dead. At that moment, the last lie would be greater than the first.
Pilate answered, "Take soldiers, go, make the tomb secure."
They carried her away and left the grave unguarded. They placed a seal on it and left the guards to watch over it.
Our Lord Jesus' Resurrection from the dead.
Now it was the Sabbath evening, during the first hours of the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.
It was a powerful earthquake. The angel of the Lord came down from heaven. The angel went to the tomb. He rolled back the stone and stood behind it.
His body was as bright as lightning. His clothes were white as snow.
The guards were so scared of him that they trembled and remained motionless like dead men.
The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified."
He's not here! Just as he said! Come see the place where he was dying.
Walk quickly! Tell his disciples, "He has risen from the dead. He has gone ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there." These are the words I have spoken to you.
The women ran from the tomb. They were afraid, but they were filled with joy. They ran to tell the disciples.
Suddenly they met Jesus. "Peace be upon you!" he said to them. They went to him, seized his feet and worshiped him.
"Don't be afraid, go and tell my brothers to go to Galicia. They will find me there." The guards reported to the chief priests.
As they left, they took some of the guards with them to the city. They reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
When the elders met with the seniors, they came up with a plan. They gave their soldiers a lot of money.
They told the soldiers, "We want you to say, 'His disciples came at night. They stole his body while we were asleep.'"
If the governor hears this report, we'll pay him off. That's how we'll keep you out of trouble.
"And the soldiers divided the clothes among them, just as they had been advised. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day. The good recommendation of Jesus."
Then the disciples went up to the mountains, to the place where Jesus had told them to go.
When they saw him, they prostrated to him. Yet some people remained doubtful.
At that time Jesus said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."
Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
Teach them to obey everything I have commanded you. And be sure that I will be with you always, even to the end of the age."
"John the Baptist prepares the way."
This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Long ago, the prophet Isaiah wrote: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way." (Malachi 3:1)
"A lone messenger shouts in the desert, saying, 'Prepare the way for the Lord. Make his paths straight.'"
And so John came. He was baptizing people in the wilderness. He was preaching and telling people that they needed to be baptized and repent of their sins, and then God would forgive them.
Then all the people of Judea and even those from Jerusalem went out to him. They confessed their sins, and John baptized them in the Jordan River.
The young man wore clothing made of camel hair. He had a leather belt around his waist. And he ate locusts and wild honey.
This is what John used to say, "People will come after me who are stronger than me. I don't deserve to bend and untie his shoes."
"We call it water. But he will call it the Holy Spirit." The Baptism and Temptation of Jesus
At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River.
Jesus came up out of the water. He saw the heavens opened, and the Holy Spirit descending on him like a dove.
He heard a voice from heaven saying to him, "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."
Immediately the Spirit drove Jesus into the wilderness.
He was in the desert for 40 days. There, the temptation from the devil came. The beasts did not harm Jesus. The angels were protecting him. Jesus chose his first disciples.
And after John was imprisoned, Jesus went to Galilee, preaching the gospel of God.
He said, "The time has come," "The kingdom of God is near. Repent of your sins and believe the good news!"
One day, Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. He saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting their nets into the sea; they were fishermen.
"Come with me," said Jesus. "I will make you fishers of men."
Immediately they opened their windows and followed him.
Jesus went a little further and saw James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in their boat mending their nets.
Immediately a demon-possessed man was brought to him. He had been blind and mute, and Jesus healed him, so that he could both talk and see. And all the people were amazed, and they began to discuss it and said, "What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even unclean spirits, and they obey him." The news about him spread quickly to all places in the region of Galilee.
Jesus and those with him went to Capernaum. When it was the Sabbath, he entered the synagogue and began to teach.
People wanted to be like him in terms of his education. He explained things as if he had authority. He didn't speak like a teacher.
Suddenly, a man cried out in their temple. He was possessed by an evil spirit. He said,
"What do you want from us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!"
Jesus said firmly: "Be silent!" "Come out of him!"
The evil spirit shook the man violently. Then it left him with a scream.
Everyone was amazed. They said to each other, "What is this? A new teaching! With such authority! Even the evil spirits obey him and tremble!"
News about Jesus spread quickly throughout all of Galilee. Jesus healed many people.
Jesus and those with him left the mosque. They immediately went with James and John to the house of Simon and Andrew.
Simon's mother-in-law was bedridden. She had a fever. They told them about her condition.
Walk to her. God gave her a hand and helped her stand. The fever left her. Then she started working for them.
That night after sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who were sick. They also brought to him those who were demon-possessed.
All the people of the country gathered at the door.
Jesus healed many of them. They had all kinds of diseases. He cast out many demons. But he would not let them speak, because they knew who he was. Jesus prayed in a quiet place.
It was still very early in the morning, and it was dark. Jesus got up, left the house, and went to a place where he could be alone. There he prayed.
Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus.
When they found him, they cried: "Everyone's looking for you!"
Jesus answered, "Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby towns. I need to preach there also. That is why I came."
That's why he traveled throughout Galilee. He was preaching in their synagogues. And he was casting out demons. Jesus healed a man who had a skin disease.
A man with a skin disease came to Prophet Isa. He bowed down and begged him humbly. He said to him, "If you want to cure me and make my skin clean, you have the power to do so."
Jesus was very scared. He reached out and touched the man. "I am willing to do it," he said. "Be healed!"
Quickly, the disease left him. He recovered.
Jesus moved away from him. He warned him a lot.
He said, "Do not tell anyone about this," "Go to the priest and show yourself to him. Perform the sacrifices that Moses commanded. This will be proof for the priest and the people that you are 'clean'."
But the man went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news to everyone. This made Jesus unable to enter any city openly. He remained outside in desolate places. But people came to him from everywhere.
"Jesus uncovers a man who doesn't walk"
A few days later, Jesus entered Capernaum again. The people heard that he had returned home.
A large crowd gathered, until there was no more room, even outside the door. And Jesus preached the word to them.
Four people are carrying a man who can't walk.
But they couldn't reach him due to the crowd, so they made a hole in the ceiling above him. Then they lowered him down to the man below on a mat.
Jesus saw their faith. So he said to the man, "My child, your sins are forgiven."
There were some law teachers. They were thinking,
"Why is this man speaking this way? He's saying something really bad! Only God will forgive sins!"
Immediately Jesus knew what they were thinking in their hearts. And He said to them, "Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?"
Which is easier to say to this man, "Your sins will be forgiven" or to say to him, "Rise, take up your mat and walk"?
"I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he said to the paralyzed man,
He said to him, "My advice to you is to pack up your mat and go home."
The man stood up and took his mat. He walked away, looking at everyone. All the people were amazed. They praised God and said, "We have never seen anything like this in our lives!" Jesus chose Levi.
Once again Jesus was beside the Sea of Galilee, and a large crowd came to him. He began to teach them.
As he went on, Jesus saw Levi, the tax collector, sitting at his tax booth. He said to him, "Follow me." And Levi got up, left everything, and followed him.
Then Jesus came to the home of a man named Simon. Many people were at the meal with him—a large group of tax collectors and other disreputable people, along with Jesus’ disciples.
They were Pharisee lawyers. They saw Jesus eating with "sinners" and tax collectors. And they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"
Jesus heard this and said to them, "It is not those who are well who need a doctor, but those who are sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance."
John's disciples and the Pharisees' disciples fast often and pray. People came to Jesus and said, "John's disciples and the Pharisees' disciples fast often and pray. But yours do not. Why don't they fast?"
Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridefast while the bridegroom is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast."
But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them. On that day they will fast.
No one patches a new piece of cloth onto old clothes. That's why it only looks mended. This will only make the hole bigger.
People don't put new wine in old wineskins. Because the wine will burst the wineskins. And the wine will be lost, and the wineskins too. No, everyone puts new wine in new wineskins. Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.
On Saturday, Jesus was walking with his disciples through the grain fields. The disciples began to pluck some of the wheat.
The Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look! This is not lawful on the Sabbath. Why are you doing this? Your disciples are breaking the Sabbath."
Reply: "Didn't you see what David had? He and his friends were hungry and wanted to eat."
That was the time when Abiathar was the high priest. David entered the house of God and ate the sacred bread. Only the priests were allowed to eat it. David gave some of it to his companions.
Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath."
"Yes, that man is a master even on Saturday."
Healing on Saturday
Again Jesus entered the synagogue, and a man with a withered hand was there.
Some Pharisees were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath.
Jesus said to the man with the weak and distorted hand, "Stand up in front of everyone."
Our Lord Jesus asked the people, "What does the law say about what we should do on the Sabbath? Should we do good or evil? Should we help and save people or kill them?" But no one answered.
Jesus looked around in anger; he was greatly distressed to see their hardness of heart. Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He did, and his hand was completely restored.
Then the Pharisees went and began to plot with the Herodians against Jesus, how to destroy Him. The multitudes were following Jesus.
Jesus went to the Sea of Galilee with his disciples. And a large crowd followed him from the region of Tiberias.
People heard about everything Jesus was doing. And a large crowd came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, the regions east of the Jordan River, and the areas around Tyre and Sidon.
Because of the crowd, Jesus ordered his disciples to prepare a small boat for him. That way, the people would not crowd around him.
Jesus healed many people. Because those who were sick paid to touch him.
We don't see the people who have devils inside them until they fall in front of us. And the devils scream: "You are the son of God!"
But Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone who he was. Jesus appointed the twelve apostles.
Jesus went up a mountain. He called to some people to come to him, and they came.
He appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles, that they might be with him and he might send them out to preach.
They will have the authority to cast out demons.
Jesus appointed twelve. Simon was one of them. Jesus gave him the name Peter.
James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John were given the name Boanerges by Jesus. Boanerges means Sons of Thunder.
There were James, the son of Alphaeus, Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus. Also, Thaddeus and Simon the Zealot.
Judas Iscariot was one of them too. He was the one who was going to hand Jesus over to his enemies. Jesus and Beelzebul
Jesus entered a house. The crowds gathered again. They were so large that Jesus and his friends could not eat.
His family heard about it. That's why they went to get him. They said, "This man is crazy."
Some doctors of the law were present. They came from Jerusalem. They said, "This man is possessed by Beelzebul! He casts out demons by the authority of the prince of demons."
Jesus called his disciples and said to them in parables: "How can Satan cast out Satan?"
She's waging war on herself, she won't be able to stand.
Ella's family split up, she won't be able to stand it.
